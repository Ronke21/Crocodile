<text>Torg is a cinematic cross-genre tabletop role-playing game created by Greg Gorden and Bill Slavicsek, with art by Daniel Horne. It was first published by West End Games (WEG) in 1990. Game resolution uses a single twenty-sided die, &quot;drama cards&quot; and a logarithmic results table, which later formed the basis for WEG&#x27;s 1992 sci-fi RPG &quot;Shatterzone&quot; and 1994 universal RPG &quot;Masterbook&quot;. WEG produced over fifty supplements, novels and comics for the first edition. A revised and expanded core rule book was produced in 2005, with a single adventure. 

After WEG closed in 2010, &quot;Torg&quot; was sold to Ulisses Spiele, who, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, published a new edition called &quot;Torg: Eternity&quot; in 2018.

==Overview==

&quot;Torg&quot; takes place in a near future setting, known officially as &quot;the near now&quot;. At the starting point in the game setting, Earth has been subjected to an inter-dimensional invasion by a series of &quot;High Lords&quot;, who have changed the natural laws of large swaths of the planet, to reflect those of their home dimensions. The players assume the role of &quot;Storm Knights&quot;: heroes from Earth and the various invading realms, who possess limited reality-altering abilities used to oppose the plans of the High Lords. The game&#x27;s title, &quot;Torg&quot;, refers to an ultimate in-game title that individual leaders of the invasion strive to achieve.

==Game mechanics==

&quot;Torg&quot; branded itself as a &quot;cinematic&quot; game and tried to emphasize game play in a manner similar to adventure films such as &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; or &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. Terminology used in the game reflects this fact. For example, encounters are divided into sub units known as &quot;acts&quot; and &quot;scenes&quot;. Conflict resolution also reflects the cinematic nature of the game. Actions are resolved by a player rolling a twenty-sided die, resulting in a modifier which is applied to the relevant attribute or skill, which is compared against a difficulty number. The degree by which the total exceeds the difficulty number of the task influences how successful the player is at the action. Rolls of 10 or 20 allow the player to roll again, adding their new total to the previous. This can be continued indefinitely as long as the player rolls a 10 or 20, allowing for fantastic feats in a cinematic style. The wound system, which stresses incapacitating damage over lethal kinds, also mimics the style of adventure films, wherein the hero may often be incapacitated, but is rarely killed.

In addition, &quot;Torg&quot; uses an unusual card-based system to augment gameplay. From &quot;Torg&quot;&#x27;s unique &quot;Drama Deck&quot;, a hand of 4 cards are dealt to each player at the beginning of the game. The rest are stacked in front of the game master. Cards can be used by both players and game masters to influence play. Whenever a combat encounter begins, the game master flips over a card which dictates certain advantages and disadvantages for the players and the non-player characters (NPCs). Players can also use cards to give themselves advantages, or even plotlines, which could result in extra points.

Players are rewarded with &quot;possibility points&quot;, which can be spent to improve the characters abilities, similar to many other role-playing games. However, unlike in most role-playing games, possibility points (or &quot;possibility energy&quot;) also exists as an in-game phenomenon, and characters may spend these points to achieve certain effects, such as healing, or changing results during play.

Character creation is limited. Both the basic set, as well as subsequent supplements, provide several character templates based on general archetypes such as &quot;Eidenos Hunter&quot;, &quot;Vengeful Human&quot; or &quot;Werewolf&quot;. These come complete with a general background story and a pre-set roster of attributes and possessions. Character customization is limited to distributing points among an array of dictated skills. Even though there is a simplified instruction to create templates in the back of the core rulebook, further supplements allow for more freedom in designing characters.

==Characters==
Player characters are dubbed &quot;Storm Knights.&quot; These are heroes who are able to alter reality in limited ways. Storm Knights can come from all of the different realities in the game, and oppose the invaders for various personal reasons. Although you can play as a normal human, some of the Storm Knights are natives of the invaders&#x27; home worlds, and some are natives of Earth who have &quot;flipped&quot; to the invaders&#x27; reality, allowing them to use abilities and technology as if born to that reality. A person becomes a Storm Knight by experiencing a reality crisis, which links them to a particular invading reality that &#x27;washes&#x27; over them during the initial invasion.

The primary way in which Storm Knights are able to shape reality is the ability to impose the rules of their own reality on a limited area of another reality. Each reality, or &quot;cosm,&quot; has a set of four &quot;axioms,&quot; which delineate what could be achieved under its rules. The most important of these for gameplay are the social, technological, magical, and spiritual axioms. For ordinary people, violating the laws of a reality is improbable, and becomes increasingly impossible over time. For example, when the Neolithic reality of The Living Land invades North America, soldiers find that their guns and radios no longer work because the tech-axiom of the cosm only allows for a Neolithic level of technology. Storm Knights, however, carry their own reality with them. Normally, they can perform under their own reality wherever they go, sometimes requiring a check against their reality skill, the key skill possessed by all Storm Knights, to accomplish feats which particularly violate the rules of a reality.

Storm Knights can also spend possibility energy in order to influence reality. One way they can do this is to impose their own reality temporarily on a limited area around them. The most common use of possibility energy is to effect rapid healing or create contradictions, allowing higher tech weapons to work in a lower tech realm. It is possible for a character to disconnect from their own reality, through forcing changes with the Reality skill, and actually change physically, into a denizen of the new cosm; from a human into an Elf or caveman for example. They are then considered a native to the laws of the new realm and must alter skills and abilities to fit the new paradigm.

== Notable features ==

&quot;Torg&quot; is designed to allow players to derive enjoyment from how characters, equipment, and environments of the various realities interact, such as having Terminator-style futuristic cyborgs adventure alongside &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-style mages in an Indiana Jones-style pulp setting. It also allows playing a game with an explicitly epic or &#x27;cinematic&#x27; overtone (as in &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, as opposed to RPGs like &quot;&quot; or &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;).

Torg provides a unified mechanics system suitable for any setting; character attributes and game mechanics use a single sliding scale (&#x27;18&#x27; can equally mean an hour of time, a truckload of weight, an expert marksman&#x27;s skill, or $4,000) and a unified method of task resolution involving a 20 sided die.
At the same time it provides an open-ended die mechanic: one twenty-sided die roll, read through a bonus chart, gives the bonus to a character&#x27;s skill for that attempt. Barring special circumstances, the die may be rolled again (and the subsequent total added to the first roll) each time a 10 or a 20 is rolled. Along with re-rolls gained through spent possibilities, card play, and other possible influences, this allows truly spectacular feats to be accomplished by player characters.

The game&#x27;s backstory involves &#x27;possibility energy&#x27;, which can be used by Storm Knights to achieve heroic feats. In the game mechanics a spent possibility gives a player a chance to make an additional die roll, potentially leading to greater success. Similarly, an included deck of cards provides bonus rolls or skill points and contains ideas for additional character interaction. Some of these cards can be used instead of Possibility energy.
It places an emphasis on groupwork and character interaction by exchange and giving of cards, coordination rules, and the use of &quot;group powers.&quot;

At the time of its release &quot;Torg&quot; &#x27;Infiniverse&#x27; campaign was an ambitious attempt at creating an interactive campaign setting. Subscribers to West End&#x27;s &quot;Infiniverse&quot; magazine received response forms, through which they could inform WEG of the progress of their campaigns. Player input actually influenced the campaign setting through a &#x27;rumor&#x27; system (&#x27;rumors&#x27; were introduced in &quot;Infiniverse&quot; magazines and published adventures, and the majority of responses would determine whether that rumor was &#x27;true&#x27; or not). The &quot;Infiniverse&quot; campaign ran until April of 1994.

== Setting ==

The game setting describes a number of different realities, each a different genre, self-contained but with two elements common to all: a &quot;Darkness Device&quot; and its linked ruler, the &quot;High Lord&quot;. Together each is an individual &quot;cosm&quot; with its own four &quot;axioms&quot; and three &quot;World Laws&quot;. Each &quot;cosm&quot; survives by invading other &quot;realms&quot; and converting them to its reality. The inhabitants of most invaded &quot;realms&quot; transform into those of the invading &quot;cosm&quot;, while a few become &quot;Storm Knights&quot;. &quot;Storm Knights&quot; are the player characters of Torg. The conversion drains &quot;possibility energy&quot; which feeds the &quot;Darkness Device&quot; and &quot;High Lord&quot;. Earth is an unusual &quot;realm&quot; rich in &quot;possibility energy&quot; and the only way to access all of it was to have a number of &quot;cosms&quot; invade at once. This was organized by &quot;The Gaunt Man&quot;, &quot;High Lord&quot; of &quot;Orrorsh&quot;, the most successful and powerful of the &quot;High Lords&quot;. Initially six &quot;cosms&quot; invaded, all are detailed in the Worldbook, then in their own sourcebook.

===&quot;Core Earth&quot;===
A near future Earth with basic magic and religious miracles, and without a &quot;Darkness Device&quot; and &quot;High Lord&quot;. Its alternate history has the United States government taken over by a shadowy cabal known as the Delphi Council. &quot;Core Earth&quot; is detailed in &quot;The Delphi Council Worldbook Volume I&quot;.

===&quot;The Living Land&quot;===

A primitive, mist-filled Lost World-style jungle that covers two separate areas of North America; a strip on West coast, and a larger area on the east coast. The invading &quot;cosm&quot;, &quot;Takta Ker&quot; is home to humanoid dinosaurs called edeinos, ruled by the &quot;High Lord&quot; Baruk Kaah and its &quot;Darkness Device&quot;, a huge forest called Rec Pakken. Technology and magic are almost nonexistent, but the inhabitants&#x27; religion gives them powerful miracles. &quot;The Living Land&quot; sourcebook was the first published for &quot;Torg&quot; in 1990.

===&quot;The Nile Empire&quot;===

A pulp action &quot;cosm&quot; combined a restored Ancient Egypt that invaded North Africa. It is characterized by 1930s technology working side by side with Egyptian magical astronomy and &quot;weird science&quot; powers and gizmos. Costumed Mystery Men patrolled the alleyways of Cairo. Ruled by Dr. Mobius, also known as Pharaoh Mobius, one of the most devious High Lords. His darkness device was a crocodile-headed idol called Kefertiti. &quot;The Nile Empire&quot; sourcebook was the second published for &quot;Torg&quot; in 1990.

===&quot;Aysle&quot;===

&quot;Aysle&quot;, is a magical &quot;cosm&quot; with many of the elements of traditional fantasy fiction, including knights, dwarves and dragons. It covers most of the United Kingdom and parts of Scandinavia. &quot;Aysle&quot; is ruled by the &quot;High Lord&quot; Pella Ardinary and her &quot;Darkness Device&quot;, an ornate crown called Drakacanus. High magic and low-technology are the dominant &quot;axioms&quot;, with &quot;Aysle&quot; having its own internal war between light and dark. The &quot;Aysle&quot; sourcebook was the third published for &quot;Torg&quot; in 1990.

===&quot;The Cyberpapacy&quot;===
Covering France, this is a realm which was initially a repressive, medieval theocracy (that wielded real miracles). En route to Core Earth it melded with a virtual reality and gained cyberpunk technology and attitudes. Ruled by the Cyberpope Jean Malreaux I, his darkness device Ebenuscrux took the shape of a prototypical circuit cross, the symbol of the realm&#x27;s strange transhumanist version of Gallican Catholicism. This &quot;GodNet&quot; was realm of circuitry and mind, an artificial reality contained within the networked computers of the realm, and stylized as a jazzed-up realm of churches and religious artifacts. Storm Knights unlucky enough to be defeated here could be jacked into the virtual Hell, from which no one ever returned.

===&quot;Nippon Tech&quot;===
An ultra capitalist nightmare society covering most of Japan where lies and betrayal were as common as breathing, and where martial artists, computer hackers, and yakuza fought to bring down the corporate-controlled government. Ruled by 3327, who was assisted by a darkness device named Daikoku that took the form of a laptop computer.

===&quot;Orrorsh&quot;===

A Gothic horror realm (&quot;Orrorsh&quot; is an anagram of &quot;horrors&quot;) set in Indonesia where the realm&#x27;s Victorians considered it their White Man&#x27;s Burden to protect the natives from the unspeakable monsters roaming the countryside. The greatest enemy in Orrorsh, however, was the enemy within: the realm would attempt to seduce Storm Knights to the side of Wickedness. Originally ruled by the greatest of the High Lords, Lord Byron Salisbury (aka The Gaunt Man) from his sinister holdfast, Illmound Keep. His darkness device, Heketon, took the shape of an enormous human heart. He also possessed a powerful artifact, a mirror named Wicked, that permitted him to gain insight into the Nameless One. Early in the war, the actions of several Storm Knights locked The Gaunt Man into a kind of reality bubble; during this interregnum several monstrous beings known collectively as the Hellion Court ruled in his place.

As the game progressed, more realms were added:

===&quot;The Land Below&quot;===
Not a realm per se but a pocket dimension created as an experiment between the Nile Empire and the Living Lands. This dimension featured primitive tribesmen, giant apes, and hostile native animals, all similar to the &quot;Pellucidar&quot; and &quot;Tarzan&quot; books of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Later this dimension intruded upon Core Earth&#x27;s reality in the eastern United States (&quot;The Land Above&quot;), supplanting some of the Living Lands.

===&quot;Space Gods&quot;===
A high-technology, spacefaring society out of Chariots of the Gods that had visited South America centuries before. The Akashans had their own colonial empire of alien races which could be added to the game at the game master&#x27;s discretion. This realm introduced advanced biotech and psionics to the Possibility Wars. it also introduced the idea of reality trees, a non-invasive organic device capable of merging two realities without damaging the inhabitants. This realm was not controlled by a High Lord. However, a sentient group-mind virus known as the Comaghaz had infected some percentage of the Akashan population, including one of its highly placed citizens, Sarila, and sought to perpetuate itself. The Akashans have no darkness device or means of creating inter-cosmic portals, but came this cosm through naturally occurring wormholes called &quot;stargates&quot;; many of them don&#x27;t even realize they are in a different cosm, thinking they have only found another galaxy.

===&quot;Tharkold&quot;===

The home of a race of magic and technology-using demons that lead a thousand-year war against their world&#x27;s native human population. Tharkold has been compared to something of a cross between &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Hellraiser&quot; movies. In the game, the Tharkoldu originally planned to invade the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Army defeated them with the help of an Earth psychic. They later established a small realm in Los Angeles, and subsequently took partial control of Berlin, splitting their reality with the New Nile Empire. Ruled by Jezrael, a human slave/soldier who took control after the previous High Lord, the technodemon Kranod, failed in his invasion attempts. The darkness device took the form of a carved rod and was named Malgest.

===&quot;Terra&quot;===
Not an invading realm but rather the home cosm of the invaders from the Nile Empire, this was a more straightforward pulp realm without the ancient Egyptian trappings and magic.

According to the cosmology of &quot;Torg&quot;, in the beginning each dimension, or cosm, was separate from every other. However, a ravenous entity known as &quot;The Nameless One&quot;, who fed on the energy of the cosms, created several intelligent machines known as &quot;Darkness Devices&quot; and scattered them throughout the cosms. Wherever they landed, the Darkness Devices bonded with an inhabitant of the cosm, giving him great power. Those who possessed Darkness Devices were known as &quot;High Lords&quot;. Through the power of his Darkness Device, a High Lord could rip open a portal to other cosms. By sending an invasion force through the portal, the High Lord could slowly remake the target cosm into a duplicate of his own while concurrently draining the target cosm of its &quot;possibility energy&quot;. Because the invader&#x27;s reality remade the physical laws of the beachhead, his armies were much more effective in combat than the target&#x27;s defense force. For instance, if a low-tech, high-magic cosm invaded a higher-tech cosm, the defenders&#x27; guns would stop working while the invaders would have access to spells for which the defenders had no known defense. In this way, invading other cosms provided both new lands to conquer and tremendous power which a High Lord could use to extend his lifespan, give himself new abilities, and even modify the physical laws of his home cosm.
Amongst the cosms known in &quot;Torg&quot;, the most successful and powerful High Lord was &quot;The Gaunt Man&quot;, High Lord of Orrorsh. He had been invading and destroying other cosms for thousands of years before the game opened. According to the backstory of &quot;Torg&quot;, the Gaunt Man stumbled across the cosm of Earth in his travels and was astounded by the amount of possibility energy available for the taking. Unfortunately for him, that same amount of energy made it impossible for the Gaunt Man to simply invade Earth as he had so many others; the energy backlash would have overwhelmed his portal. The Gaunt Man therefore began forming alliances with the High Lords of several other worlds. They would all invade Earth near-simultaneously, spreading the energy backlash across all their fronts. This invasion is the setting for the game—each invader brings his own, strikingly different realm to Earth so that different physical locations across the globe also have different laws of reality.

Players could design characters for any of these realms, so a party of adventurers might contain a magician, a cop, a vampyre hunter, a super-hero, a cybernetically-enhanced gunrunner, a dwarf miner, a six-foot dinosaur priest, or a beetle-like alien with a bad temper, and any of these characters might eventually learn sword fighting, kung fu, magic, or net-hacking.

== Game history ==

The title was originally an acronym for the in-house development name: &quot;The Other Roleplaying Game&quot;. Unable to find a better name, the name was adopted as the official name and applied to the game. Names that were considered but rejected include &quot;Shadow Wars&quot;, &quot;Shadow Spawn&quot;, &quot;Twilight Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Endless Earth&quot;.

&quot;Torg&quot; initially achieved some success in a saturated market. Reviews (both contemporary to the release of &quot;Torg&quot; and since then) generally cited the uniqueness of the cinematic elements (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the drama deck), the flexibility of rules system, and the expansiveness of the setting. However, various factors such as poor quality control in new products, a large amount of required game material to purchase, and lack of support from publications outside the WEG studio, meant that by 1994 only a few hardcore fans remained. Various attempted sales of the property and failed attempts at revising and resurrecting the game ensued. In 1995, Omni Gaming Products released the first issue of a new &quot;Infiniverse&quot; magazine, ignoring many of the series-ending events of WEG&#x27;s final published adventure &quot;War&#x27;s End&quot; in the interest of continuing the game under their own management. This quickly fell through.

By 2004, &quot;Torg&quot; was again under ownership of West End Games (although WEG itself was under new ownership) and a new version was under development. An announcement by WEG&#x27;s then-current owner on the official &quot;Torg&quot; forums explained further:

&quot;&quot;To that end, we are beginning our &quot;countdown to the new &quot;Torg&quot;&quot; event at GenCon 2005; at this event we will have at least two products designed for established &quot;Torg&quot; fans, but which will hopefully be approachable enough for new people who would want to get started in the grandeur of the &quot;Torg&quot; universe early.&quot;

Ultimately, 2005 came and went without the arrival of the new &quot;Torg&quot; game. Due to expending resources and time to developing and publishing the new &quot;D6&quot; games also by WEG (&quot;D6 Fantasy&quot;, &quot;D6 Adventure&quot;, &amp; &quot;D6 Space&quot;), it became necessary to push &quot;Torg&quot; into 2006. The new release date was to be in the Fall of 2006.

&quot;Without giving too much away, this will be the beginning of a grassroots effort to get people excited and thinking about &quot;Torg&quot; again. Those waiting for next year&#x27;s second edition will get a well-tested system and a universe ready for multi-genre action, and fans who want to come along for the ride through the coming year will learn more about the secrets and mysteries of the &quot;Torg&quot; universe than they&#x27;ve ever known before.&quot;

In addition to an upcoming second edition (&quot;Torg 2.0&quot;), WEG released &quot;Torg Revised &amp; Expanded&quot; (dubbed &quot;Torg 1.5&quot;), in order to invigorate interest among longtime fans and to generate interest in backstock of first edition &quot;Torg&quot; merchandise. This book was released in May 2005 as a PDF file, and was slated to be released as a limited-edition hardback in June 2005, though the release date was subsequently pushed back to July and finally released in August. A limited run of leftover softcover editions, printed for distribution at the 2005 Origins RPG convention, were also made available on WEG&#x27;s website. The announced &quot;Torg 2.0&quot; was never produced.

== Torg: Eternity ==
When West End Games ceased operations in July 2010, Torg was sold to a German game company, Ulisses Spiele. The July 31, 2014, email newsletter from DriveThruRPG announced that Ulisses Spiele were planning new Torg titles for 2015. Meanwhile, the company had made most of the back catalog available for purchase as PDF downloads in their webstore, aside from the original boxed set.

In 2016 Ulisses Spiele announced that new edition would be released in 2017 under the title, &quot;Torg: Eternity&quot;.

Ulisses Spiele started a Kickstarter on May 31, 2017, for the new edition of Torg, named &quot;Torg Eternity&quot;. The Kickstarter succeeded, generating $355,992 against a goal of $8,000.

Ulisses Spiele continued to run Kickstarters for the release of additional sourcebooks. Early setting changes included the renaming of Nippon Tech to Pan-Pacifica, and Tharkold&#x27;s permanent arrival in Russia as part of the original invasion of the cosm.

== Drawbacks ==
While the breadth of &quot;Torg&quot; was one of its most exciting features, it could also cause significant problems. Because the scope of the game was so broad, and it incorporated such a wide variety of skills, the game became unwieldy to some players. Further, in some cases simple rules given in the basic set were thrown out or expanded in sourcebooks, so that players moving between campaigns sometimes found the rules were not what they were used to; even some of the character templates from the boxed set were not completely compatible with the rules in the sourcebook for their home cosm. This breadth of scope also served to ratchet up the game&#x27;s expense: each of the game&#x27;s realms was detailed in its own sourcebook, and those sourcebooks included rules that weren&#x27;t covered in the main rulebook. For instance, if a character wanted to build his own magic spells, the player needed to own (or at least have access to) the &quot;Aysle&quot; sourcebook. Likewise, psionics were covered in the &quot;Space Gods&quot; sourcebook, martial arts in the &quot;Nippon Tech&quot; book, pulp powers and gizmos in &quot;The Nile Empire&quot; and &quot;Terra&quot; sourcebooks, and cyberware/bionics in the &quot;Cyberpapacy&quot;. Note, however, that if a Cyberpapacy character wanted to hack the GodNet, they needed yet another supplement for those rules. While this allowed a group to take their game in any direction they wished, it made it difficult to keep up with all the rules. This is especially true because long-term campaigns tend to lead to cross-genre characters, such as mages with cybernetics, or espionage agents who learned the Occult. It reached a point where even published adventures would forget, ignore, or skim over previously established rules.
Successive materials suffered from power creep: as more books were released, the rules and equipment tended to escalate the relative level of power available to player characters and NPCs alike. The &quot;Living Lands Sourcebook&quot;, while initially formidable, was soon superseded by advanced alien weaponry, more powerful miracles, cybernetics, occult magic, and psionics published in subsequent books. 
The later material displayed a penchant for humor, often at the cost of breaking the mood. The edeinos of the Living Lands proved a popular target, transforming to other realities and becoming among other things &quot;Skippy the Edeinos&quot; (who in the campaign setting came complete with an action figure), a Nile Empire &quot;Rocket Ranger&quot; named Captain Verdigris, and an Elvis impersonator. Supplements such as &quot;The High Lords Guide to the Possibility Wars&quot; went so far as to address this issue and advise readers to read the original material on edeinos to make them more dangerous/serious and ignore the trend WEG had itself established. The Nile Empire also often slipped from the genre of pulp heroes into outright self-referential parody. For example, Nile Empire ninja engaged in elaborate martial art moves and high-pitched battle cries, compared to their stealthy Nippon Tech counterparts who would mock them. Scene titles in the published adventures were often elaborate puns, and there was a &quot;Five Realms&quot; role-playing game-within-the-game where the author Jeff Mills was a parody of game designer Greg Gorden, and who eventually went on to help save the world in the final published adventure, &quot;War&#x27;s End&quot;.
One advantage of the game was that with a virtual army of &quot;Storm Knights,&quot; player characters could be fit in to anywhere on the planet. However, this led to a huge &quot;supporting cast&quot; of characters. The initial characters featured in the first trilogy of novels were implied to have great destinies but for the most part slid into obscurity. Individual writers and artists had their own preferred cast of characters they featured in the published supplements, novels, and adventures they worked on. One supplement, the &quot;Character Collection&quot;, featured a contest of reader submissions for best characters. The five winners were then incorporated into a subsequent published adventure. The result was an overly large cast of characters where no one individual or group made an impression or could be identified as the primary identifiable characters of the game.

Another problem stemmed from the fact that visiting other realms meant travelling to geographic locations and cultures with which many players and gamemasters were not familiar. For example, there is a specific reference to 1930s gangsters &quot;with an Arab slant,&quot; though most players simply did not know how to give such a &quot;slant.&quot; Similarly, a lot of references were made to the culture clash between the Victorians and Indonesians, without specific information. In practice, this tended to be ignored in the game&#x27;s own adventure modules, despite the vague references to culture in the rules books. Also, as not surprising for a U.S. game aimed at U.S. customers, Torg was highly U.S.-centric. At one time or another every invading cosm except one occupied part of the United States, and most of the real-world political focus was on the U.S. government, which was taken over in a political coup by a fascist Senator. Four of the ten book-length adventure modules were set in the United States, with three of those (&quot;City of Demons&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Central Valley Gate&quot;) set in California. The final major act of the concluding adventure, &quot;War&#x27;s End&quot;, was also set in California. 
Finally, in some quarters the game was criticized for its alleged anti-Japanese sentiment, as the Nippon Tech realm played into many of the fears and concerns of Japanese business dominating the U.S. industries in the late 80s/early 90s. The portrayal of the Cyberpapacy provoked claims of anti-Catholicism as well with its papacy that among other things spread an artificial AIDS virus. It has to be said that within the game it was actually the Core Earth Japanese and Catholics who were &quot;good guys&quot; fighting evil invaders who embodied these stereotypes. However, that distinction was often lost upon many, and WEG did heavily promote these stereotypical elements in their gaming products even while attributing them to fictional invaders.

==Reception==
Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Torg&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #21 (June/July 1990), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;In conclusion, I can only say that &quot;Torg&quot; receives my highest possible recommendation. This game is going to set a standard which may remain unequaled for a long time. The emphasis on storytelling, fun mechanics, and an engrossing setting combine to create a nearly unbeatable RPG experience.&quot;

In the July 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 16), Paul Mason found the combat mechanics fairly pedestrian, saying, &quot;All that can be said of this is that it is serviceable and not overly complex.&quot; He also found that &quot;the artwork is weak for a product of this prestige.&quot; He concluded, &quot;the game reminds me just a little too much of Pacesetter&#x27;s doomed introductory product &quot;Sandman&quot;, which featured a similar heady, eclectic blend.&quot;

In the February 1991 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 166), Jim Bambra liked the multi-genre aspect of the game, in which players could be immersed in a medieval fantasy London one session and in a cyberpunk Paris the next. He also liked the quick resolution for skill checks and combat; although it did require some table checking, it was fast and adaptable. He noted that magic and healing were &quot;neatly handled and fit into the system with a minimum of fuss.&quot; Bambra criticized the varying quality of the rules, saying, &quot;some places are very clear, but re-readings are needed to grasp to what is being said in other areas.&quot; He also found the quality of artwork varied greatly. Overall, Bambra thought &quot;Torg&quot; was &quot;a major addition to the role-playing games currently available.&quot;

In the July 1992 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 183), Martin Wixted called &quot;Torg&quot; &quot;one of the most gripping role-playing games I have ever encountered.&quot; However, he cautioned that it was &quot;not for the rule-dependent gamer.&quot;

In the August 1992 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 184), Rick Swan reviewed &quot;Tharkold&quot;, a supplement describing the demons invading Los Angeles. Of &quot;Tharkold&quot;, Swan said that West End designers &quot;have hit their stride.&quot; He noted that &quot;absent in previous TORG products but delightfully present here is an undercurrent of black humor.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Torg&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Matthew David Surridge said &quot;The possibility energy that made the player characters heroes was, in essence, imagination. &quot;Torg&quot;, as a game, was literally driven by imagination on numerous different levels.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;[The game&#x27;s] expansive possibilities both make &quot;Torg&quot; attractive to players and stifle its playability.&quot; Horvath pointed out that players needed to purchase a new sourcebook for each of the separate regions of &quot;Torg&quot;, saying &quot;Seemingly every new &quot;Torg&quot; book introduced a new system, decentralizing the game&#x27;s mechanics and raising the overall power level. Coupled with the rapidly advancing metaplot, &quot;Torg&quot; was expensive to jump into and dizzying to keep up with.&quot; Horvath also found &quot;The production values are also surprisingly low. The boxed set is adequate, but many subsequent books have inferior illustrations, which distinctly disadvantage &quot;Torg&quot; when compared to the strong aesthetics of &quot;Rifts&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot;.

<doc id="493268" wikidata="Q943681" url="?curid=493268" title="Viasat (Nordic television service)">
<text>Viasat was a satellite and pay television brand, co-owned by the Swedish media group Viaplay Group in the Nordic countries, Antenna Group in Hungary, and by Viasat World internationally. Founded in Sweden in 1991, Viasat has previously been owned by Modern Times Group. The channels of both companies were broadcast from London. 

In 2020, Viasat formed a joint venture with Canal Digital to form the company Allente. The merger was completed on April 13, 2021.

== Satellite platforms ==
The Viasat signals was received from the Astra 4A and SES-5 satellites at 4.8°E with any DVB-S receiver equipped with a NDS VideoGuard descrambling module.
Viasat does not have a platform of their own outside the Nordic and Baltic countries, so they have to rely on third party distributors in Eastern and Central Europe.

In May 2016, MTG announced the launch of Viasat Ultra HD, the first ultra-high-definition television (UHD) channel in the Nordic region and its first UHD Sports channel. The channel will feature selected live sport events especially produced in Ultra HD and launch in the autumn in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland via SES-5. Viasat will also be launching an Ultra HD set-top box from Samsung and a TV-module to enable existing UHD TVs to display the channel.

<doc id="493269" wikidata="Q1711132" url="?curid=493269" title="List of visitors to the International Space Station">
<text>This is a list of all of the visitors to the International Space Station (ISS), including long-term crew, short-term visitors, and space tourists, in alphabetical order. ISS crew names are in bold. The suffix &quot;(twice, three times, ...)&quot; refers to the individual&#x27;s number of spaceflights to the ISS, not the total number of spaceflights. Entries without a flag symbol indicate that the individual was an American citizen at launch. Entries without a female symbol () are men.

== Statistics ==
, 244 individuals have made 403 spaceflights to the ISS, including the seven people currently at the ISS (Expedition 65). Two people have made five spaceflights to the ISS, while five people have made four, 36 people made three and 84 people made two. Note that this list assigns individuals with dual citizenship to their country of primary residence at time of launch (for example, the Iranian-American space tourist Anousheh Ansari is only listed under the United States).

Initially all private space travel was aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. When only two crew members are required in the three-seat Soyuz, and additional cargo is not sent, the additional seat is sold to the general public through Space Adventures. Private travelers would remain on the ISS during handover from one expedition crew to the next, generally a week or two. The NASA Space Shuttle carried seven crew members, and the longest docking with the ISS was 11 days. Many visitors to the ISS were accommodated for short periods during NASA shuttle dockings.

NASA stated it was &quot;not interested&quot; in private spaceflight during construction of the ISS, but eventually began allowing up to two flights per year in 2019, with the first private visitors arriving at the US Orbital Segment in 2022 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon.

<doc id="493280" wikidata="Q649780" url="?curid=493280" title="OutRage!">
<text>OutRage! was a British political group focused on lesbian and gay rights. Founded in 1990, the organisation ran for 21 years until 2011. It described itself as &quot;a broad based group of queers committed to radical, non-violent direct action and civil disobedience&quot; and was formed to advocate that lesbian, gay and bisexual people have the same rights as heterosexual people, to end homophobia and to affirm the right of queer people to their &quot;sexual freedom, choice and self-determination&quot;.

==Formation==
The group was formed on 10 May 1990, called after the murder of gay actor Michael Boothe (which occurred on the previous 30 April). Between 40 and 60 people attended the first meeting, set up by Keith Alcorn, Chris Woods and Simon Watney, including many such as Peter Tatchell who had been active in the Gay Liberation Front and other campaigns. The founders of the group are considered to be Keith Alcorn, Chris Woods, Simon Watney and Peter Tatchell.

A second meeting, this time in public, was held on 24 May. Alcorn came up with the name of the group and Tatchell wrote the first draft of what became the Statement of Aims. Michael C. Burgess and Steve Stannard were elected as joint treasurers. The first OutRage! action was on 7 June at Hyde Park Public Toilets to protest against Metropolitan Police entrapment of gay men cruising, and attracted some media attention. OLGA offered the group office space at its base at the London Lesbian and Gay Centre, and regular fundraising was set up with the group selling T-shirts with its logo. One of the defining images of OutRage! actions was taken in September 1990 when the group organised a &quot;kiss-in&quot; at Piccadilly Circus to protest against arrests of gay men for kissing in public. One member, identified as an actor called Richard, climbed up and kissed the statue of Anteros.

From January 1991 the group established a series of &quot;affinity, focus and caucus groups&quot;, which took on specific aspects of the group&#x27;s remit. They were given intentionally obscene and insulting names: the Policing Intelligence Group (PIG), the Whores of Babylon (tackling religious homophobia), Perverts Undermining State ScrutinY (PUSSY - tackling censorship), QUeers Asserting the Right to Ride Every Line Safely (QUARRELS - on safety on London Underground), Expanding The Non-Indigenous Contingent (ETHNIC), and Lesbians Answer Back In Anger (LABIA). To go along with these names, the financial team adopted the name QUeer Accountants Never Go Out (QUANGO).

==Outing controversy==

The issue of outing, which had already begun in the United States, split the group in 1998. There was no consensus and so the group agreed to have no policy. Those who favoured the tactic then established their own group outside OutRage called &quot;Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality&quot; (FROCS) which was committed to outing. Peter Tatchell agreed to act as public speaker for the group. The outing plan was widely denounced by the press, before FROCS admitted the plan had been a ruse with the goal of getting newspapers which had themselves outed lesbians and gay men to denounce the practice of outing.

In 1992 the group suffered from entryism from far-left political parties who wished to use OutRage! as a front organisation for other political motives. The most serious was by the Lesbian and Gay Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (LGCARF). The creation of the focus groups added to the vulnerability for a takeover and on 25 June the group took a decision to abolish all the groups. This decision was accepted by most but not by LABIA, and many of its members left, eventually to form the London chapter of the Lesbian Avengers.

==The 1993 actions==
Lord Jakobovits, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, reacted to the 1993 discovery by Dean Hamer of possible genetic connections to homosexuality. Jakobovits claimed it offered the opportunity for genetic engineering to eliminate homosexuality. OutRage! held an action outside a synagogue in London where it handed out leaflets comparing Lord Jakobovits&#x27;s remarks to those of Hitler. This action brought accusations that the group was antisemitic.

Nine members of OutRage! were arrested in November 1993 in the offices of Benetton UK, where they had been organising a protest against the company&#x27;s advertising. The nine were charged with various public order offences but were eventually acquitted.

==Age of consent==

1994 saw the issue of gay rights become more prominent in British politics as the House of Commons debated whether to equalise the age of consent for gay sex, then 21, with that for heterosexual sex at 16. OutRage! had organised a series of actions over the issue in previous years and it was prominent in the crowd outside Parliament on the night of the vote, where it had called for a peaceful presence. When news came through that equality had been rejected there was a near riot. Many in the crowd shouted the names of two Conservative Cabinet ministers who were widely rumoured to be gay.

After the vote OutRage! managed to enter the Labour Party National Executive Committee meeting where it protested about the 35 Labour MPs who had voted against equality. More light-heartedly, the group petitioned the Danish embassy for an invasion so that the UK could have Denmark&#x27;s more liberal legislation.

Peter Tatchell of Outrage! said in 2000: &quot;All consenting, victimless sexual offences—homosexual and heterosexual—should be abolished, including the criminalisation of consensual adult pornography and sadomasochism. The law on the age of consent should take into account the fact that over 50 percent of young people have their first sexual experience before they are 16. Consenting sex involving partners under 16 should not be prosecuted, providing they are of similar ages and there is no evidence of pressure, manipulation or exploitation.&quot; According to OutRage! in 2000, &quot;A 20 year old man who has consenting gay sex with a man aged 17 is categorized as a pedophile and forced to sign the Sex Offenders&#x27; Register. In contrast, a 19 year old heterosexual man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged 13 does not have to sign the register.&quot;

Later, the amendment to the Sexual Offences Act equalised the age of consent for all sexual acts at 16 (17 in Northern Ireland). The age of consent in Northern Ireland was subsequently reduced to 16 by the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.

==Church of England==
In autumn 1994 OutRage! began to concentrate on what it saw as religious homophobia in the Church of England. It was revealed in the press that the new Bishop of Durham Michael Turnbull had a conviction for a gay sex offence, and OutRage! disrupted his ordination ceremony. There were other Bishops known or suspected to be gay in private, and OutRage! held a demonstration outside Church House naming ten Bishops and urging them to &quot;Tell the truth!&quot;. Although the ten bishops were not named in the British Press, their names were published in the Australian gay newspaper the &quot;Melbourne Star Observer&quot;, and have since been published on the internet. At the same time, Peter Tatchell began a dialogue with the Bishop of London, David Hope as Outrage! hoped he could be persuaded to admit he was gay. Press stories speculating about the personal sexuality of Bishops led Dr Hope to call a press conference in February 1995 at which he denounced OutRage! for putting him under pressure, while admitting that his sexuality was &quot;a grey area&quot;.

In January 1995 OutRage! had sent 20 Members of Parliament known or believed to be gay letters inviting them to come out. On 20 March the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; carried the story that one of the MPs was from Northern Ireland, widely assumed to be James Kilfedder. That day he died suddenly of a heart attack. The press immediately assumed that the death and the letter were linked and some of the fiercest denunciations of OutRage! were written.

==Bolton 7==

The Bolton 7 were a group of gay and bisexual men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at Bolton Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and of age of consent offences under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Equivalent heterosexual behaviour was not a crime. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a result of a high-profile campaign led by gay human rights group OutRage!. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and human rights groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, Amnesty International, pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

In 2000, six of the men appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with &#x27;the right to respect for a private family life&#x27; enshrined in article 8 of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As the remaining seventh man of the original group was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the Labour Government broadly equalised the treatment of homosexual and heterosexual behaviours in criminal law. The offences of gross indecency and buggery were repealed and sexual activity between more than two men was no longer a crime in the United Kingdom.

==Stop Murder Music campaign==

OutRage! had also campaigned against the anti-gay lyrics of certain dancehall stars such as Buju Banton, Elephant Man, Sizzla, Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, Vybz Kartel, Baby Cham, Spragga Benz, and Capleton, and rap stars such as Busta Rhymes and Eminem. Sizzla had to cancel concert dates due to the protests of OutRage! There has been criticism of this campaign from Rastafarians, who accused Outrage! of racism and extremism, saying they have &quot;gone way over the top. It’s simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla in the same bracket and just shows how far Peter Tatchell is prepared to go.&quot;

<text>Flavia Maximiana Theodora (died before 337) was a Roman empress as the wife of Constantius Chlorus.

==Biography==
===Early life===
She is often referred to as a stepdaughter of Emperor Maximian by ancient sources, leading to claims by historians Otto Seeck and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia, wife of Maximian, and Afranius Hannibalianus. This man was consul in 292 and praetorian prefect under Diocletian.

Timothy Barnes challenges this view, arguing that all &quot;stepdaughter sources&quot; derive their information from the hypothetical 4th century &quot;Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte&quot;, which Barnes considers unreliable, while sources he considers to be more reliable refer to Theodora as Maximian&#x27;s daughter, rather than his stepdaughter. He concludes that she was born to an earlier wife of Maximian, possibly one of Hannibalianus&#x27;s daughters. Although Julia Hillner agreed with the idea of Theodora being Maximian&#x27;s biological daughter, she also observed that Barnes&#x27; theory does not explain why one of Theodora&#x27;s daughters was named Eutropia. She believes that Theodora was the daughter of both Maximian and Eutropia. She agrees with Barnes that the &quot;stepdaughter sources&quot; are the result of later Constantinian propaganda, but argues that Afranius was instead Eutropia&#x27;s brother, thus explaining why Theordora named one of her daughter Eutropia, and one of her sons Hannibalianus.

===Marriage===
In 293, Theodora married Constantius Chlorus, the junior co-emperor of Maximian, after he had set aside Helena, mother of his son Constantine, to strengthen his political position. The couple had six children. Through her son Julius Constantius, she would become the grandmother of the emperor Julian.

After the death of her stepson Constantine, several of her male descendants were massacred, which Julian explicitly blamed Constantius II for. Constantine&#x27;s successors proceeded to print coins of Theodora, presumably in an attempt to distance themselves from the massacre.

<text>William Bullock ( – 7 March 1849) was an English traveller, naturalist and antiquarian. He established what was called Bullock&#x27;s Museum, first in Liverpool which he then moved to London.
==Life==
Bullock began as a goldsmith and jeweller in Birmingham. By 1795, Bullock was in Liverpool, where he founded a Museum of Natural Curiosities at 24 Lord Street. While still trading as a jeweller and goldsmith, in 1801, he published a descriptive catalogue of the works of art, armoury, objects of natural history, and other curiosities in the collection, some of which had been brought back by members of James Cook&#x27;s expeditions. In 1809, Bullock moved to London and the collection, housed first at 22 Piccadilly and in 1812 in the newly built Piccadilly Egyptian Hall, proved extremely popular. The collection, which included over 32,000 items, was disposed of by auction in 1819.

In 1810, Bullock figured briefly in a law case concerning Sarah Baartman, a Khoikhoi woman brought to England for purposes of exhibition as the &quot;Hottentot Venus&quot;. Bullock had been approached by Alexander Dunlop, the army surgeon responsible for Baartman&#x27;s arrival in England, but had declined to be involved in the proposed show.

In 1822, Bullock went to Mexico where he became involved in silver mine speculation. He brought back many artefacts and specimens which formed a new exhibition in the Egyptian Hall. He made a second visit to Mexico along with his son, and to the United States in 1827. Bullock bought land on the bank of the Ohio River from Thomas D. Carneal where he proposed to build a utopian community named &quot;Hygeia&quot; (a Greek word meaning health) laid out by John Buonarotti Papworth. The speculation was not a success, although some people, including Frances Trollope, took part; Bullock sold the land to Israel Ludlow, Jr. in 1846.

Bullock was back in London by 1843 and died there at 14 Harley Terrace, Chelsea. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Chelsea, on 16 March 1849.

Bullock was elected a fellow of the Linnean in 1810 despite opposition from William E. Leach. He also became a fellow of the Horticultural, Geological, Wernerian, and other learned societies, and published several pamphlets on natural history.

<text>Rosemary Isabel Forbes (October 27, 1913 – November 14, 2002) was an American nurse and social activist.

==Early life==
Rosemary Isabel Forbes was born in Paris, France, to American parents. She was one of eleven children of James Grant Forbes II of the Forbes family and Margaret Tyndal Winthrop of the Dudley–Winthrop family. Margaret was a granddaughter of politician Robert Charles Winthrop.

==Work==
She studied to be a nurse, and served in the Red Cross in Paris during World War II where she treated wounded soldiers at Montparnasse. According to her son John, Rosemary and her sister escaped from Paris on bicycles the day before the Nazis took the city. The sisters foraged their way across France while being shot at by German fighters, eventually making their way to Portugal before returning to the United States.

Rosemary also was a Girl Scout leader at the troop and council level in Groton, Massachusetts, for 50 years.

==Personal life==
On February 8, 1941, she married Richard John Kerry in Montgomery, Alabama. Kerry was a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School. Richard and Rosemary met when Kerry took a sculpture class at the resort of Saint-Briac, where the Forbes family built the family estate. Together, they were the parents of four children:
* Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Kerry (b. 1941);
* John Kerry (b. 1943), the former United States Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic nominee for President of the United States;
* Diana Kerry (b. 1947);
* Cameron Kerry (b. 1950), a Boston lawyer who was a General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Commerce and an adjunct law professor at Suffolk Law School. Cameron Kerry is the father of two daughters, Diana and Elizabeth (Peggy).

Kerry died on November 14, 2002, at Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. Upon her death, her son John inherited &quot;trusts with $300,000 to $1.5 million in assets.&quot;

<doc id="493312" wikidata="Q122759" url="?curid=493312" title="Ratcliff">
<text>Ratcliff or Ratcliffe is a locality in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It lies on the north bank of the River Thames between Limehouse (to the east), and Shadwell (to the west). The place name is no longer commonly used.

==History==

===Etymology and origin===
The name &quot;Ratcliffe&quot; derives from the small sandstone cliff that stood above the surrounding marshes, it had a red appearance, hence &quot;Red-cliffe&quot;.

Ratcliff was historically part of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney. The place name Stepney evolved from &quot;Stybbanhyð&quot;, first recorded around 1000 AD. &quot;Stybbanhyð&quot; probably translates into modern English as &quot;Stybba&#x27;s hithe (landing place)&quot;, with Stybba the individual who owned the Manor (estate). The hithe itself is thought to have been at Ratcliff, just under south of St Dunstan&#x27;s Church.

===Civil and ecclesiastical administration===
The hamlet was divided between the parishes of Limehouse and Stepney until 1866, when it was constituted a separate civil parish (as Ratcliffe). From 1855 it was administered by Limehouse District Board of Works, and in 1900 became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. By the latter half of the nineteenth century, the condition of the area had improved somewhat - the 1868 &#x27;National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; describes Ratcliffe as inhabited by persons connected with shipping and having extensive warehouses, with the area &#x27;well paved, lighted with gas, and supplied with water from the reservoir at Old Ford&#x27;.

The parish church of Ratcliffe, St. James in Butcher Row, was built in 1838 and served the area until 1951 (it was damaged during the Second World War), when the parish was merged with St. Paul, Shadwell. In 1948 the church site became (and remains) the East London home of the Royal Foundation of St. Katharine. The social campaigner Father John Groser became the first Master of the Foundation in its new home.

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Ratcliff became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

===History===

Ratcliffe in earlier times was also known as &quot;sailor town&quot;. It was originally known for shipbuilding but from the fourteenth century more for fitting and provisioning ships. In the sixteenth century various voyages of discovery were supplied and departed from Ratcliffe, including those of Willoughby and Frobisher. By the early seventeenth century it had the largest population of any Hamlet (administrative sub-division) in Stepney, with 3500 residents.

It was again a site of shipbuilding in the seventeenth century - a number of sailing warships were built for the Royal Navy here, including one of the earliest frigates, the &quot;Constant Warwick&quot; in 1645. Located at the western end of Narrow Street it was made up of lodging houses, bars, brothels, music halls and opium dens. This overcrowded and squalid district acquired an unsavoury reputation with a large transient population. In 1794 approximately half of the hamlet was destroyed in a fire but, even so, it continued as a notorious slum well into the nineteenth century.

From the late sixteenth century Ratcliffe and surrounding areas were notable areas for non-conformist Christianity. John Penry preached in the area in 1592/3, until he was spotted by the local vicar at Ratcliffe and subsequently hanged. By 1669 around 200 Presbyterians were worshipping at a warehouse at Ratcliffe Cross and there was a purpose built Quaker meeting house in Schoolhouse Lane, which was demolished by soldiers in 1670.

In late 1811 seven murders took place in Ratcliffe Highway (more recently St. George&#x27;s Street), allegedly committed by a sailor named Williams, who committed suicide after being captured. The murders were later fictionalised in an account by Thomas De Quincey.

===The Ratcliffe Fire===
The Ratcliffe Fire was the largest fire disaster in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz in 1940. The fire took place in July 1794 when a smaller fire ignited a barge loaded with saltpetre. The conflagration that followed destroyed over 400 homes and 20 warehouses and left 1000 people homeless. Following the fire tents were set up near to St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church whilst the area was rebuilt.
==Population and area==
The hamlet of Ratcliffe covered and had a Census population of:

<text>José Eulogio Gárate Ormaechea (born 20 September 1944) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker for SD Eibar, SD Indautxu and Atlético Madrid. Born in Argentina, he played for the Spain national team at international level.

==Club career==
Gárate was born to Basque parents in Argentina and grew up in Eibar, Spain. He began his career with SD Eibar in 1960 before joining SD Indautxu in 1963. Just like two earlier Indautxu players, Chus Pereda and Miguel Jones, he was controversially overlooked by Athletic Bilbao and like Jones he eventually joined Atlético Madrid. Along with Luis Aragonés, Adelardo, Javier Irureta, Enrique Collar, and Ufarte, he was a prominent member of the successful Atlético side of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gárate helped the team win La Liga three times, the &quot;Copa del Generalísimo&quot; twice, reach the final of the European Cup and win the Intercontinental Cup. He was a notable goalscorer, winning the &quot;Pichichi&quot; three consecutive seasons (1968 to 1970) and scoring the winning goals in the 1972 and 1976 &quot;Copa del Generalísimo&quot; finals. During his time at Atlético, Gárate played 241 games and scored 135 goals.

==International career==
Gárate also played 18 times for Spain and scored 5 goals. He made his debut on 22 October 1967 against Czechoslovakia and played his last game against Romania on 17 April 1975. During this period Spain failed to qualify for either the European Championships or World Cup, and as a result he never played in the finals of a major international competition.

<text>Sveriges Radio [[Aktiebolag|AB]] (; &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Radio&quot;) is Sweden&#x27;s national publicly funded radio broadcaster. Sveriges Radio is a public limited company, owned by an independent foundation, previously funded through a licensing fee, the level of which is decided by the Swedish Riksdag. As of 1 January 2019, the funds stem from standard taxation. No advertising is permitted. Its legal status could be described as that of a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization.

==History==

The company – which was founded as AB Radiotjänst (&quot;Radio Service Ltd&quot;) by a consortium of newspaper companies, the TT news agency, and radio manufacturing interests on 21 March 1924 – made its first broadcast on 1 January 1925: a relay of High Mass from St James&#x27;s Church in Stockholm. It was officially renamed Sveriges Radio in 1957.

Sveriges Radio was originally responsible for all broadcasting in Sweden, both radio and television, and hosted the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest. A reorganization in 1979 saw it become the parent company of four subsidiaries:
* (RR), &quot;Swedish National Radio&quot;;
* (LRAB), &quot;Swedish Local Radio&quot;;
*Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR), &quot;Swedish Educational Broadcasting&quot;; and
*Sveriges Television (SVT), &quot;Swedish Television&quot;.

This structure was dissolved in 1993, with the national and local radio companies merging under the name of the old parent company: Sveriges Radio AB.

== Stations ==
=== National radio ===
Four radio channels are available nationwide on FM, DAB and via the internet.

*P1: news, culture, debate, readings, documentaries, etc. Almost no music is played, except in the daily summertime programme &quot;Sommar&quot;, in which guest presenters introduce their own choice of music.
*P2: classical music, folk, jazz and world music; the channel also carries some minority-language programming.
*P3: popular music and comedy targeted at a younger audience.
*P4: popular music, entertainment and sport, chiefly targeted at an older audience; the network is made up of 26 local stations, each of which carries a mix of local and national programming.

=== Local radio ===
A large part of P4&#x27;s programming is regional with 26 regions each broadcasting their own local programmes during most of the day.
*P4 Blekinge, for Blekinge County
*P4 Dalarna
*P4 Gotland
*P4 Gävleborg
*P4 Göteborg
*P4 Halland, for Halland County
*P4 Jämtland
*P4 Jönköping
*P4 Kalmar, for Kalmar County
*P4 Kristianstad, for the former Kristianstad County, now north and eastern Skåne County
*P4 Kronoberg
*P4 Malmöhus, for the former Malmöhus County, now south-western Skåne County
*P4 Norrbotten
*P4 Sjuhärad, for Sjuhärad, the south-eastern part of Västra Götaland County
*P4 Skaraborg, for the former Skaraborg County, now north-eastern Västra Götaland County
*P4 Stockholm
*P4 Södertälje
*P4 Sörmland
*P4 Uppland

*P4 Västerbotten
*P4 Västernorrland
*P4 Västmanland, for Västmanland
*P4 Örebro, for Örebro County
*P4 Östergötland, for Östergötland County

Additional radio stations available locally on FM include:
*Din gata 100,6 (in Malmö): playing mostly hiphop and R&amp;B
*SR P2 Musik (in Stockholm): relays most of the output of P2, but replaces programming in minority and foreign languages (available in Stockholm from P6, see below) with additional music output – Schedule
*SR P6 89,6 (in Stockholm): broadcasts in minority and foreign languages and relays the BBC World Service at night – Schedule

=== Digital channels ===
Sveriges Radio also provides a number of digital channels through DAB and via the internet.

*P4 Plus, plays a broad mix of classic and current popular music (web)
*Sveriges Radio Finska, in Finnish and Meänkieli (DAB, web and cable)
*Radioapans knattekanal, children&#x27;s radio (DAB and web)
*SR Sápmi, for Sami languages (web)
*Ekot, news (web)

=== SR International ===

SR International is the international channel of Sveriges Radio and offers programming in the following languages:

*Arabic – website
*English – website
*Kurdish – website
*Persian – website
*Romani – website
*Russian – website (closed on March 28, 2024)
*Somali – website
*Tigrinya - website
*Ukrainian - website
SR International is not responsible for programming in the domestic minority languages, Finnish and Sámi, which have their own dedicated digital channels.

On 16 March 2010, Radio Sweden announced the end of broadcasts on shortwave and medium wave as from 31 October 2010. External service programmes would continue on the internet only. Language services for immigrants to Sweden in Albanian, Syriac, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croat would also be discontinued, while programmes in English (also on the domestic service), German, Persian, Dari, and Kurdish would remain.

== Criticism ==
The public&#x27;s trust in the company, along with its Public Service counterparts in Sweden, may have decreased slightly during the 2000s. The decrease is most significant among right wing citizens.

On 2022, it was revealed that SR had registered the word &quot;Sommar&quot;, meaning Summer in Swedish, as a trademark, along with other names related to their show, Sommar i P1, much to the dismay of some podcast operators.

===Twitter===
On 18 April 2023, Sveriges Radio stopped using Twitter as part of its social media plan due to concerns over &quot;recent turbulence&quot; at the company over its (in)ability to combat fake news and hate speech.

<doc id="493322" wikidata="Q231063" url="?curid=493322" title="Fausta">
<text>Flavia Maxima Fausta &quot;Augusta&quot; (died 326 AD) was a Roman empress. She was the daughter of Maximian and wife of Constantine the Great, who had her executed and excluded from all official accounts for unknown reasons. Historians Zosimus and Zonaras reported that she was executed for adultery with her stepson, Crispus.

==Family==
Fausta was the daughter of the emperor Maximian and his wife Eutropia. As her age is nowhere outright attested, scholarly estimates have ranged from 289/290 to the end of the 290s. To seal the alliance between them for control of the Tetrarchy, Maximian married her to Constantine I in 307.

Constantine at first tried to present Maximian’s suicide as an unfortunate tragedy, but later started spreading another version where Fausta was involved in her father’s downfall. Barnes observed that the story “shows clear signs of being invented during Constantine’s war against Maxentius.”

During her marriage, she had 5 children. Fausta held the title of &quot;nobilissima femina&quot; up until 324, when Constantine held her in high enough regard to grant her the title of &quot;augusta&quot;, which she received together with Constantine’s mother Helena.

==Execution==
In 326, Fausta was put to death by Constantine, following the execution of Crispus, his eldest son by Minervina. The circumstances surrounding the two deaths were unclear. Various explanations have been suggested; in one, Fausta is set against Crispus, as in the anonymous &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot;, or conversely her adultery, perhaps with the stepson who was close to her in age, is suggested.

According to the Latin &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot; and the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of Philostorgius (as epitomized by Photius), Fausta was executed by being locked in a bath which was over heated, in connection with the death of Crispus, which &quot;people [thought]&quot; was caused by Fausta&#x27;s accusation of unclear nature. But Constantine, having obtained rule over the whole Roman Empire by remarkable success in wars, ordered his son Crispus to be put to death, at the behest (so people think) of his wife Fausta. Later he locked his wife Fausta in overheated baths and killed her, because his mother Helena blamed him out of excessive grief for her grandson.

Zosimus, on the other hand, suggests adultery as the reason: He killed Crispus, who had been deemed worthy of the rank of Caesar, as I have said before, when he incurred suspicion of having sexual relations with his stepmother Fausta, without taking any notice of the laws of nature. Constantine’s mother Helena was distressed at such a grievous event and refused to tolerate the murder of the young man. As if to soothe her [feelings] Constantine tried to remedy the evil with a greater evil: having ordered baths to be heated above the normal level, he deposited Fausta in them and brought her out when she was dead.

In Zonaras&#x27; version written in the 12th century, Crispus&#x27; death was caused by Fausta&#x27;s retaliatory accusation of rape following her unsuccessful sexual advances toward him. But when Constantine realized his innocence, he punished her, mirroring the myth of Phaedra and Hippolytus. Scholars have noted that if Crispus was found to be innocent, his condemnation of memory should have been lifted, but it was not.

Although Hans Pohlsander dismissed the idea of Fausta’s death being accidental, viewing the condemnation of memory to be certain proof that Constantine intended to kill his wife, David Woods’ response was that, “Accidents continue to happen even to people deep in disgrace.” He suggested that Crispus and Fausta were not actually executed, offering the connection of overheated bathing with contemporaneous techniques of abortion, a suggestion that implies an unwanted, adulterous pregnancy from her relationship with Crispus and a fatal accident during the abortion.
Constantine I ordered the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; of Fausta and Crispus around 326 with the result that no contemporary source records details of her fate: &quot;Eusebius, ever the sycophant, mentions neither Crispus nor Fausta in his &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, and even wrote Crispus out of the final version of his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (&quot;HE&quot; X.9.4)&quot;, Constantine&#x27;s biographer Paul Stephenson observes. Although Julian praised Fausta in his panegyric to Constantius II, there is no other evidence of her memory being rehabilitated.

==In popular culture==
Fausta is an important antagonist in Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; chronicle-play &quot;The Emperor Constantine&quot; (1951). In addition, Fausta was portrayed by Belinda Lee in the film &quot;Constantine and the Cross&quot; (1961).

<text>Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England&#x27;s register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of &quot;squalor and slovenly disorder&quot; into one of the world&#x27;s most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West&#x27;s death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust. It was ranked 42nd on the list of the Trust&#x27;s most-visited sites in the 2021–2022 season, with over 150,000 visitors.

The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be &quot;one of the finest collections in the world&quot;. A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed &quot;garden rooms&quot;, one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual &quot;garden rooms&quot;, the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as &quot;the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.&quot;

The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by Sir John Baker. In 1554 Sir John&#x27;s daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker&#x27;s fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The prisoners caused great damage and by the 19th century much of Sir Richard&#x27;s house had been demolished. In the mid-19th century, the remaining buildings were in use as a workhouse, and by the 20th century Sissinghurst had declined to the status of a farmstead. In 1928 the castle was advertised for sale but remained unsold for two years.

Sackville-West was born in 1892 at Knole, the ancestral home of the Sackvilles. But for her sex, Sackville-West would have inherited Knole on the death of her father in 1928. Instead, following primogeniture, the house and the title passed to her uncle, a loss she felt deeply. In 1930, after she and Nicolson became concerned that their home Long Barn was threatened by development, Sackville-West bought Sissinghurst Castle. On purchasing Sissinghurst, Sackville-West and Nicolson inherited little more than some oak and nut trees, a quince, and a single old rose. Sackville-West planted the noisette rose &#x27;Madame Alfred Carrière&#x27; on the south face of the South Cottage even before the deeds to the property had been signed. Nicolson was largely responsible for planning the garden design, while Sackville-West undertook the planting. Over the next thirty years, working with her head gardeners, she cultivated some two hundred varieties of roses and large numbers of other flowers and shrubs. Decades after Sackville-West and Nicolson created &quot;a garden where none was&quot;, Sissinghurst remains a major influence on horticultural thought and practice.

==History==

===Early history===
The site is ancient; &quot;hurst&quot; is the Saxon term for an enclosed wood. Nigel Nicolson, in his 1964 guide, &quot;Sissinghurst Castle: An Illustrated History&quot;, records the earliest owners as the de Saxinhersts. Stephen de Saxinherst is named in an 1180 charter about the nearby Combwell Priory. At the end of the 13th century the estate had passed, through marriage, to the de Berhams. Nicolson suggested that the de Berhams constructed a moated house in stone, of an appearance similar to that of Ightham Mote, which was later replaced by a brick manor. More recent studies, including those of Nicolson&#x27;s son, Adam, cast doubt on the existence of an earlier stone manor, suggesting instead that the brick house, or perhaps a timber construction of a slightly earlier date, occupying the corner of the orchard nearest the moat, was the earliest house on the site. Edward I is reputed to have stayed at this house in 1305.

===Rise, decline, collapse: c. 1490–1930===

In 1490 the de Berhams sold the manor of Sissinghurst to Thomas Baker of Cranbrook. The Bakers were cloth producers and in the following century, through marriage and careers at court and in the law, Thomas&#x27;s successors greatly expanded their wealth and their estates in Kent and Sussex. In the 1530s Sir John Baker, one of Henry VIII&#x27;s Privy Councillors, built a new brick gatehouse, the current West Range. In 1554 Sir John&#x27;s daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, creating the earliest connection between the Sackville family and the house. Sir John&#x27;s son Richard undertook a massive prodigy expansion in the 1560s. The Tower is part of that expansion, and formed the entrance to a very large courtyard house, of which the South Cottage and some walls are the only other remaining fragments. Sir Richard surrounded the mansion with an enclosed deer park and in August 1573 entertained Queen Elizabeth I at Sissinghurst.

After the collapse of the Baker family fortunes following the civil war (1642–1651), the building declined in importance. Horace Walpole visited in 1752: &quot;yesterday, after twenty mishaps, we got to Sissinghurst for dinner. There is a park in ruins and a house in ten times greater ruins.&quot; During the Seven Years&#x27; War, it became a prisoner-of-war camp. The historian Edward Gibbon, then serving in the Hampshire militia, was stationed there and recorded &quot;the inconceivable dirtiness of the season, the country and the spot&quot;. It was during its use as a camp for French prisoners that the name Sissinghurst Castle was adopted; although it was never a castle, there is debate as to the extent to which the house was a fortified manor. In 2018 an important collection of historical graffiti drawn by some of the 3,000 prisoners was uncovered beneath 20th-century plaster.
Around 1800, the estate was purchased by the Mann family and the majority of Sir Richard&#x27;s Elizabethan house was demolished; the stone and brick were reused in buildings throughout the locality. The castle later became a workhouse for the Cranbrook Union, after which it housed farm labourers. In 1928, the castle was put up for sale for a price of £12,000, but attracted no bids for two years.

===Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson: 1930–1968===
====Vita Sackville-West====
Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like &quot;to live alone in a tower with her books&quot;, an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted.

From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for &quot;The Observer&quot;, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, &quot;Some Flowers&quot;, she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: &quot;I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.&quot; In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, &quot;bending some stubborn acres to my will&quot;, she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West&#x27;s &quot;one magnificent act of creation&quot;.

====Harold Nicolson====

Harold Nicolson, diplomat, author, diarist, and politician, was born in Tehran on 21 September 1886. Following his father into the diplomatic corps, he served as a junior member of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference at the end of the First World War, and returned to Iran as Counsellor in 1925. In 1929 he resigned from the Foreign Office to pursue a career in journalism, editing the &quot;Londoner&#x27;s Diary&quot; for Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. This proved unsuccessful, as did his subsequent political career, which saw him move from Oswald Mosley&#x27;s New Party to Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour Party. Throughout, he maintained a detailed private diary. His entry for 4 April 1930, records, &quot;Vita telephones to say she has seen the ideal house – a place in Kent, near Cranbrook, a sixteenth-century castle&quot;.

====Building a garden====
Sackville-West and Nicolson found Sissinghurst in April 1930, after Dorothy Wellesley, their near neighbour and a former lover of Sackville-West&#x27;s, saw the estate for sale. They had become increasingly concerned about encroaching development near their property Long Barn, near Sevenoaks, Kent. Their offer on Sissinghurst was accepted on 6 May and the castle and the farm around it were bought for £12,375, using only Sackville-West&#x27;s money rather than Nicolson&#x27;s.

The property was in total. The house had no electricity, running water, or drains, and the garden was in disarray. Anne Scott-James notes their &quot;planting inheritance&quot; as &quot;a grove of nut-trees, some apple trees, a quince [and] a tangle of old roses&quot;. The physical assets on the site were &quot;four buildings of beautiful mellow brick, part of a moat [and] various fine walls&quot;. Clearing the ground took almost three years, but by 1939 the garden was largely complete, with the exception of the White Garden. Nicolson was responsible for the design and layout, while Sackville-West, at the head of her team of gardeners, undertook the planting. Simon Jenkins, the architectural writer, describes Nicolson&#x27;s design as &quot;post-Picturesque, a garden not as an imitation of nature but as imitation of a house&quot;, and suggests his thinking was much influenced by Lawrence Johnston&#x27;s garden at Hidcote. Sackville-West&#x27;s approach was plant-centred, within the constraints of her husband&#x27;s plan, &quot;profusion, even extravagance and exuberance, within confines of the utmost linear severity&quot;.

The buildings scattered around the site were converted to become an unconventional home. Part of the long brick gatehouse range from Sir John Baker&#x27;s construction of c.1533 became the library, or Big Room; the tower gatehouse dating from Richard Baker&#x27;s rebuilding in 1560–1570 became Sackville-West&#x27;s sitting room, study, and sanctuary. The Priest&#x27;s House was home to their sons Ben and Nigel, and held the family dining room, while the South Cottage housed their bedrooms and Nicolson&#x27;s writing room.

The garden was first opened to the paying public for two days in mid-1938. Thereafter, the opening hours were gradually increased. Despite her love of privacy, Sackville-West came to enjoy greatly her encounters with the visitors, known as &quot;shillingses&quot; on account of the entrance fees they deposited in a bowl at the gate. She described her relationship with them in a 1939 article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;: &quot;between them and myself a particular form of courtesy survives, a gardener&#x27;s courtesy&quot;. Nicolson was less welcoming. Sackville-West&#x27;s &quot;Observer&quot; articles raised awareness of the garden; Scott-James records photographic articles in &quot;Gardening Illustrated,&quot; &quot;Vogue&quot;, and &quot;Picture Post&quot;, and notes consequently that &quot;increasingly paying visitors poured into Sissinghurst, coming in thousands in the course of a summer&quot;.

====War and after====
Nicolson&#x27;s diary entry for 26 September 1938 records the tense European atmosphere at the time of the Munich Crisis. &quot;They are making the big room at Sissinghurst gas-proof. I know one who will not be there. He will be in his bed minus gas-mask and with all the windows open.&quot; He drove down to Sissinghurst on the day war was declared, encountering an angry woman who shook her fist at him while declaring that the war was the fault of the rich. He found on his arrival at the castle that the Sackville flag had been lowered from the tower. During the Second World War, Sissinghurst saw much of the Battle of Britain, which was mainly fought over the Weald and the English Channel. Nicolson&#x27;s diary entry for 2 September 1940 reads: &quot;a tremendous raid in the morning and the whole upper air buzzes and zooms with the noise of aeroplanes. There are many fights over our sunlight fields&quot;.

In 1956, the BBC proposed making a television programme at Sissinghurst. Although Sackville-West was in favour, Nicolson was opposed. &quot;I have a vague prejudice against (a) exposing my intimate affections to the public gaze; (b) indulging in private theatricals.&quot; He later withdrew his objections, but Sackville-West declined the BBC&#x27;s offer in order to please him. In 1959 the American CBS network broadcast a four-way discussion from the dining room at the Priest&#x27;s House, between Nicolson, the journalist Edward R. Murrow, and the diplomats Chip Bohlen and Clare Boothe Luce. Sackville-West intensely disliked the result.

Sackville-West died in the first-floor bedroom of the Priest&#x27;s House on 2 June 1962. Nicolson recorded her death in his diary: &quot;Ursula is with Vita. At about 1.5 she observes that Vita is breathing heavily, and then suddenly is silent. She dies without fear or self-reproach. I pick some of her favourite flowers and lay them on her bed&quot;. Her death devastated Nicolson and his last years were not happy. Giving up his Albany apartment in May 1965, he retired to Sissinghurst and thereafter he never stayed anywhere else. He died of a heart attack in his bedroom at the South Cottage on 1 May 1968.

====Nigel Nicolson====

Nigel Nicolson had always been devoted to his father, and admiring of his more distant mother. Preserving Sissinghurst was &quot;an act of intense filial duty&quot;. He had first raised the possibility of giving the house and garden to the National Trust in 1954, but Sackville-West was adamantly opposed. After her death in 1962, which saw the castle pass to him although Benedict was the elder son, he began lengthy negotiations to bring about the handover.

The Trust was cautious: it felt that an endowment beyond the Nicolsons&#x27; means would be required, and it was also unsure that the garden was of sufficient importance to warrant acceptance. Sir George Taylor, Chairman of the National Trust&#x27;s Gardens Committee doubted it was &quot;one of the great gardens of England&quot;, and had to be persuaded of its merits by Sackville-West&#x27;s close friend and one-time lover, the gardener Alvilde Lees-Milne. Discussions continued until, in April 1967, the castle, garden, and Sissinghurst Farm were finally accepted.

Although always intending to transfer Sissinghurst to the Trust, Nigel Nicolson undertook major remodelling at the castle. Unwilling to live in four separate structures – the Big Room, the Tower, the Priest&#x27;s House, and the South Cottage – he built a substantial family home in the half of the entrance range that stood on the side of the gateway opposite from the library. He died at the castle on 23 September 2004.

===National Trust: 1967–present===
The National Trust took over the whole of Sissinghurst – its garden, farm, and buildings – in 1967. Since then, the number of visitors has steadily increased. Anne Scott-James, the author of the first non-Nicolson history of the garden, records 13,200 visitors in 1961, the year of Sackville-West&#x27;s death, 47,100 in 1967, when the castle passed to the Trust, and 91,584 by 1973. It is now among the Trust&#x27;s most popular properties, receiving nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. Although the increased foot traffic has necessitated the replacement of the grass paths with York paving stones, the entry fees generate considerable income which, under the terms of the handover, can only be expended on Sissinghurst. In 2008, Adam Nicolson described the estate as &quot;better funded than it has been since the 16th century&quot;. Major works of reconstruction, such as the restoration of the Tower brickwork, and the cataloguing and conservation of the collection of books in the library, have been made possible by the availability of these funds.

The property has an iconic status in LGBTQ culture; Adam Nicolson has noted &quot;rivers of lesbians coming through the gate&quot; each spring. The castle was one of the sites chosen in 2017 as a focus for the celebration of the LGBTQ history of Trust buildings. In the same year, the Trust opened the South Cottage to visitors for the first time. the gardens are open to the public daily from 7 March to 31 October. It was ranked 42nd on the list of the Trust&#x27;s most-visited sites in the 2021–2022 season, with over 150,000 visitors.

====Adam Nicolson====

Adam Nicolson, Nigel&#x27;s son and the resident donor after his father&#x27;s death, and his wife Sarah Raven, have sought to restore a form of traditional Wealden agriculture to Sissinghurst Farm. Their work to reunite the garden with its wider landscape is described in Adam&#x27;s 2008 book, &quot;Sissinghurst: An Unfinished History&quot;, which won the Ondaatje Prize, and was the subject of a BBC Four documentary, &quot;Sissinghurst&quot;, in 2009. Their efforts have generated some controversy, reflecting the tension between the demands of traditional agricultural practices and the requirements of a major tourism destination in the 21st century.

==Architecture and landscape==
===Plan===
===Buildings===
The site is a Grade I registered garden, and many other structures within the garden are listed buildings in their own right.

====West Range====

The West Range forms part of Sir John Baker&#x27;s original house of the 1530s. Sackville-West and Nicolson enlisted architect A.R. Powys to help convert the stables into a library, known as the Big Room and containing an important literary collection. For the design of the Big Room, they also employed Philip Tilden. The room as a whole is a recreation of Knole, &quot;Vita&#x27;s record of her disinheritance&quot;. Powys provided most of the architectural input into the conversion of the buildings at Sissinghurst, including the Priest&#x27;s House and the South Cottage, as well as occasionally advising on elements of the design of the gardens.

The range is of brick and of two storeys, with attics and decorated gables and chimneys. The wing to the south was converted into a family home by Nigel Nicolson. The coat of arms of the Carnocks above the entrance archway was brought to Sissinghurst by Nicolson. The West Range has a Grade I listing.

====Tower====

The Tower is of brick and was the entrance to the cour d&#x27;honneur of the 1560s rebuilding. Of four storeys, it has recessed staircase turrets to each side, creating what the architectural historian Mark Girouard described as an &quot;extraordinarily slender and elegant&quot; appearance. The courtyard was open on the tower side, its three facades containing seven classical doorways. Girouard notes Horace Walpole&#x27;s observation of 1752, &quot;perfect and very beautiful&quot;. Such an arrangement of a three-sided courtyard with a prominent gatehouse set some way in front became popular from Elizabethan times, similar examples being Rushton Hall and the original Lanhydrock.

The Tower was Sackville-West&#x27;s sanctum; her study was out of bounds to all but her dogs and a small number of guests by invitation. Her writing room is maintained largely as it was at the time of her death. Nigel Nicolson records his discovery in the Tower of his mother&#x27;s manuscript describing her affair with Violet Trefusis. This went on to form the basis of his book &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;. The clock, below the Tower parapet, was installed in 1949. A plaque is affixed to the arch of the Tower; the words were chosen by Harold Nicolson: &quot;Here lived V. Sackville-West who made this garden&quot;. Nigel Nicolson always felt that the memorial failed to acknowledge his father&#x27;s contribution. The Tower has a Grade I listing.

====Priest&#x27;s House====

The architectural historian John Newman suggests that this building was a &quot;viewing pavilion or lodge&quot;. Its name derives from the tradition that it was used to house a Catholic priest, the Baker family having been Catholic adherents. Sackville-West and Nicolson converted the cottage to provide accommodation for their sons, and the family kitchen and dining room. Of red brick and two storeys, Historic England suggests that the building may originally have been attached to Sir Richard Baker&#x27;s 1560s house but Newman disagrees.

====South Cottage====
This building formed the southeast corner of the courtyard enclosure buildings. It was restored by Beale &amp; Son, builders from Tunbridge Wells, and provided the pair with separate bedrooms, a shared sitting room, and Nicolson&#x27;s writing room. His diary entry for 20 April 1933 records: &quot;My new wing has been done. The sitting room is lovely ... My bedroom, w.c. and bathroom are divine&quot;. Of two storeys in red brick, with an extension dating from the 1930s, South Cottage has a Grade II* listing.

===Gardens===

Although the estate as a whole is , the gardens themselves occupy only . Anne Scott-James sets out the principles of the design: &quot;a garden of formal structure, of a private and secret nature, truly English in character, and plant[ed] with romantic profusion&quot;. As gardeners and landscapers, both Sackville-West and Nicolson were amateurs. Nicolson largely undertook the design and Sackville-West the planting. The landscape is designed as a series of &quot;garden rooms&quot;, each with a different character of colour or theme, the enclosures being high clipped hedges and pink brick walls. The rooms and &quot;doors&quot; are so arranged as to offer glimpses into other parts of the garden.

Sackville-West described the overall design: &quot;a combination of long axial walks, usually with terminal points, and the more intimate surprise of small geometrical gardens opening off them, rather as the rooms of an enormous house would open off the corridors&quot;. Nicolson considered the garden&#x27;s success was down to this &quot;succession of privacies: the forecourt, the first arch, the main court, the tower arch, the lawn, the orchard. All a series of escapes from the world, giving the impression of cumulative escape&quot;. In the White Garden and along some paths in other gardens, the flower beds were set off from the paths by closely clipped low square hedges of box.
Sackville-West&#x27;s planting philosophy is summed up in the advice from one of her gardening columns in the &quot;Observer&quot;: &quot;Cram, cram, cram, every chink and cranny&quot;. Gardener Sarah Raven (Adam Nicolson&#x27;s wife) notes the use of the vertical dimension, as well as horizontal paths, in her planting. Assisted by the number of walls still standing from the Tudor manor, and constructing more of her own, Sackville-West remarked &quot;I see we are going to have heaps of wall space for climbing things.&quot;

Old roses formed the centrepiece of the planting, and their history appealed to her as much as their appearance did: &quot;there is nothing scrimpy or stingy about them. They have a generosity which is as desirable in plants as in people&quot;, and ultimately around 200 varieties were grown at Sissinghurst.

====Influences====
Edwin Lutyens, long-time gardening partner of Gertrude Jekyll, was a friend to both Sackville-West and Nicolson and a frequent visitor to Long Barn, and gave advice regarding Sissinghurst. Sackville-West denied that Jekyll&#x27;s work had an impact on her own designs, but Nigel Nicolson described Lutyens&#x27; influence as &quot;pervasive&quot;. Fleming and Gore go further, suggesting that the use of groupings of colours &quot;followed Jekyll&quot;; &quot;a purple border, a cottage garden in red, orange and yellow, a walled garden pink [and] purple, a white garden, a herb garden&quot;. Scott-James notes however that herbaceous borders, &quot;Jekyll&#x27;s speciality&quot;, were much disliked by Sackville-West. Other influencers and friends were the noted plantswoman Norah Lindsay, the plant collector Collingwood Ingram, who was their neighbour at Benenden, and Reginald Cooper, one of Nicolson&#x27;s closest friends, whose earlier garden at Cothay Manor in Somerset has been described as the &quot;Sissinghurst of the West Country&quot;. Sackville-West&#x27;s considerable knowledge of old roses was deepened by her friendship with Edward Bunyard, plantsman, epicure, and the author of &quot;Old Garden Roses&quot;, who was a frequent visitor. The historian Peter Davey places the garden at the very end of a tradition of Arts and Crafts gardening which by the 1930s, in the face of changes in &quot;taste and economics&quot;, had almost come to its close.
The concept of &quot;garden rooms&quot; has been dated to the Romans, who included rooms within some homes that opened on one side onto a garden. The horticultural scholar and gardener Marie-Luise Gothein identified such a room at Pliny&#x27;s Villa Tusci, in her study &quot;A History of Garden Art&quot;. In the late 19th century, reaction set in against both the Victorian fashion for elaborate bedding and Italianate formality, and the earlier 18th century landscape gardening modelled on the paintings of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. This led in part to a concept of the &quot;garden room&quot; (distinct from the architectural concept of a sunroom as a garden room) as a space out of doors, in which paths, corresponding to halls in a house, lead to enclosed gardens within the garden as a whole, conceived of as rooms. The architect Hermann Muthesius described the style which developed into the Arts and Crafts approach in his &quot;&quot; (&quot;The English House&quot;): &quot;the garden is seen as a continuation of the rooms of the house, almost a series of ... outdoor rooms, each of which is self-contained&quot;. A number of pre-Sissinghurst gardeners, including Jekyll and Lawrence Johnston, had designed in this style, and much of their work was known to Sackville-West and Nicolson. This landscaping feature has since become an established one in garden design.

Many of the gardening themes developed at Sissinghurst were conceived during Sackville-West&#x27;s and Nicolson&#x27;s time at Long Barn: the prominence of roses, the emphasis on &quot;rectilinear perspectives&quot; through axial paths, and an informal, massed planting approach. Jane Brown suggests that &quot;without Long Barn there would have been no Sissinghurst.&quot;

====Head gardeners====

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, &quot;as much, if not more than Vita&#x27;s, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England&quot;. In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.

In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden &quot;in the manner of its creator, after they have gone&quot;. In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith&#x27;s re-making of the garden: &quot;Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain&#x27;s leading garden – and so, arguably, the world&#x27;s, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck&quot;. Scott Smith&#x27;s plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a &quot;Mecca&quot; and a &quot;place of pilgrimage&quot; for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

====Top Courtyard and Tower Lawn====

Entered through the archway in the West Range, that had been blocked for over 100 years before Sackville-West and Nicolson&#x27;s arrival, the Top Courtyard is dominated by the Tower. Planted against a new wall constructed on ancient foundations is the Purple Border, a colour palette deliberately chosen by Sackville-West in defiance of Gertrude Jekyll&#x27;s dictum against massing purple flowers. The gardening writer Tony Lord considers it &quot;the courtyard&#x27;s greatest glory&quot;. The height of the Tower attracts considerable wind which necessitates intensive staking of the plants, particularly the taller specimens such as Sackville-West&#x27;s much-favoured &quot;Rosa moyesii&quot;. On the opposite side of the Tower is the Tower Lawn, also known as the Lower Courtyard; Nicolson emphasised that &quot;the English lawn is the basis of our garden design&quot;. The west–east vista from the Top Courtyard, through the Tower gateway, across the Tower Lawn, and to the statue of Dionysus across the moat, forms one of the most important horizontal axes. It bisects the north–south axis running from the White Garden, across the Tower Lawn, to the Roundel in the Rose Garden. In the southwestern corner of the Tower Lawn is a small garden known as the Sunk Garden. It was created in 1930 as the Lion Pond, but the pond was prone to leaking and was drained in 1939. The site was subsequently considered for planting what became the White Garden, but was ultimately rejected as too confined, shady, and damp. The Trust is considering reinstatement of the pool.

====White Garden====

&quot;A symphony in subtle shades of white and green&quot;, the White Garden is considered the &quot;most renowned&quot; and most influential of all of Sissinghurst&#x27;s garden rooms. Planned before the war, it was completed in the winter of 1949–1950. Using a palette of white, silver, grey, and green, it has been called &quot;one of Vita and Harold&#x27;s most beautiful and romantic visions&quot;. Sackville-West recorded her original inspiration in a letter to Nicolson dated 12 December 1939: &quot;I have got what I hope will be a lovely scheme for it: all white flowers, with some clumps of very pale pink&quot;. The concept of single-colour gardens had enjoyed some popularity at the end of the 19th century, but few such gardens remained when Sissinghurst was designed. Influences for the White Garden include Hidcote and Phyllis Reiss&#x27;s garden at Tintinhull, both of which Vita had seen. Gertrude Jekyll had discussed the concept, but argued for varying the white palette with the use of blue or yellow plants, advice followed by Reiss. But neither Hidcote nor Tintinhull equals the &quot;full-scale symphony&quot; of the White Garden at Sissinghurst. A more prosaic motivation for the colour scheme was to provide reflected illumination for Sackville-West and Nicolson as they made their way from their bedrooms at the South Cottage to the Priest&#x27;s House for dinner.

The focal point of the garden was originally four almond trees, encased in a canopy of the white rose, &quot;Rosa mulliganii&quot;. By the 1960s, the weight of the roses had severely weakened the trees, and they were replaced with an iron arbour designed by Nigel Nicolson. Beneath the arbour is sited a Ming dynasty vase bought in Cairo. A lead statue of a Vestal Virgin, cast by Toma Rosandić from the wooden original which is in the Big Room, presides over the garden. Sackville-West intended that the statue should be enveloped by a weeping pear tree, &quot;Pyrus salicifolia&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27;, and the present tree was planted after her original was destroyed in the Great Storm of 1987. Lord considers the White Garden &quot;the most ambitious and successful of its time, the most entrancing of its type&quot;.

A possibly apocryphal story records a visit by the colour-loving gardener Christopher Lloyd, during which he is supposed to have scattered seeds of brightly coloured nasturtiums across the lawn. Troy Scott Smith, the current head gardener, is undertaking a major research project on the history of the White Garden with the intention of recreating the original planting scheme in its entirety. This project has seen the number of plants being propagated in the Sissinghurst nursery rise from 400 to over 530.

====Rose Garden====

The Rose Garden was constructed on the site of the old kitchen garden from 1937. It terminates the north–south axis running from the White Garden and concludes with a brick wall, designed by A. R. Powys and known as the Powys Wall, constructed in 1935. Old garden roses, those bred before 1867, formed the heart of the garden&#x27;s planting. Such roses appealed not only for their lavish appearance, but also for their history. The informal and unstructured massing of the plants was Sackville-West&#x27;s deliberate choice, and has become one of Sissinghurst&#x27;s defining features. Roses were supplied by, among others, Hilda Murrell of Edwin Murrell Ltd., notable rose growers in Shropshire, and the florist Constance Spry from her home Winkfield Place. In addition to using established suppliers and receiving plants as gifts from friends, Sackville-West sometimes sourced specimens herself. Sarah Raven records Sackville-West digging up the hybrid perpetual rose &#x27;Souvenir du Docteur Jamain&#x27; at an old nursery; Anne Scott-James noted that the rose had passed out of commerce and it was Sackville-West who returned it to cultivation. The Rose Garden is divided by the Roundel, constructed of yew hedging by Nicolson and Nigel in 1933. As elsewhere in the garden, the Trust has replaced the original grass paths with stone and brick, to cope with the increases in visitor numbers. Scott-James considered the roses in the Rose Garden &quot;one of the finest collections in the world&quot;. The writer Jane Brown describes the Rose Garden, more than any other including the White, as expressing &quot;the essence of Vita&#x27;s gardening personality, just as her writing-room enshrines her poetic ghost&quot;.

====Delos and Erechtheum====
Delos, between the Priest&#x27;s House and the courtyard wall, was the one area of the garden that neither Sackville-West nor Nicolson considered a success. She explained its origins in an article in &quot;Country Life&quot; in 1942 as being inspired by the terraced ruins covered with wild flowers she had observed on the island of Delos. Neither the shade nor the soil, nor its inter-relationships with other parts of the garden, have proved satisfactory, either in the Nicolson&#x27;s time or subsequently. The Erechtheum, named after one of the temples at the Acropolis, is a vine-covered loggia and was used as a place for eating out of doors.

====Cottage and Herb Gardens====

The dominating colours in the Cottage Garden are hot saturated shades of red, orange, and yellow, a colour scheme that both Sackville-West and Nicolson claimed as their own conception. Lord considers it as much a traditional &quot;cottage garden as Marie Antoinette was a milkmaid&quot;. Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by William Robinson, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of dahlias, a particular favourite of Nicolson&#x27;s, and the red-hot poker, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, &quot;I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers. Except for those beastly red-hot pokers which you have a weakness for, there is not an ugly flower in the whole place.&quot;

The Herb Garden contains sage, thyme, hyssop, fennel and an unusual seat built around a camomile bush. Known to the family as Edward the Confessor&#x27;s chair, it was constructed by Copper, the Nicolson&#x27;s chauffeur. Originally laid out in the 1930s, the garden was revitalised by John Vass in the years immediately after the Second World War. The Lion Basin in the centre of the garden was brought back from Turkey in 1914. Most of the over one hundred herbs in the garden are now started in the nurseries and planted out at appropriate times of year.

====Walks, the Nuttery, and the Moat====

The Lime Walk, also known as the Spring Garden, was the one part of Sissinghurst where Nicolson undertook the planting as well as the design. He had originally intended a single axis running straight from the Rose Garden, through the Cottage Garden, and then through the Nuttery to the moat, but the topography of the site precluded that. Instead, an angled walk was established in the mid-1930s, and substantially replanted in 1945–1962. Sackville-West was critical of the angularity of the design, comparing it to Platform 5 at Charing Cross station, but treasured it as her husband&#x27;s creation. &quot;I walked down the Spring Garden and all your little flowers tore and bit at my heart. I do love you so, Hadji. It is quite simple: I do love you so. Just that.&quot; The limes are pleached and the dominant plant is &quot;Euphorbia polychroma&quot; &#x27;Major&#x27;. Nicolson kept meticulous gardening records of his efforts in the Lime Walk from 1947 to the late 1950s and, providing consolation after the end of his parliamentary career, he described the walk as &quot;My Life&#x27;s Work&quot;.

The Yew Walk runs parallel to the Tower Lawn. Its narrow width has been problematic, and by the late 1960s the yew hedges were failing. Extensive pruning proved successful in revitalising the avenue.

The Nuttery was famed for its carpet of polyanthus. Nicolson called it &quot;the loveliest planting scheme in the whole world&quot;. Unlike the other gardens, where flowering plants were placed within flower beds, in the Nuttery and the Orchard plants were allowed to spread across lawns as though they were growing in the wild. By the 1960s, the plants were dying, and attempts to improve the soil did not assist. The primrose carpet was replaced in the 1970s by a mixture of woodland flowers and grasses.
The Moat Walk stands on the old bowling green constructed by Sir Richard Baker in the 1560s and his reconstructed moat wall provides the axis. The azaleas were bought with the £100 Heinemann prize Sackville-West received in 1946 for her last published poem, &quot;The Land&quot;. The wisteria were a gift from her mother, Lady Sackville, as were the six bronze vases. A bench designed by Lutyens terminates one end of the walk, the other focal point being the statue of Dionysus across the moat. The two arms of the moat that remain from the medieval house are populated by goldfish, carp, and golden orfe.

====Orchard====
The Orchard was an unproductive area of fruit trees when the Nicolsons arrived. The unplanned layout was retained as a contrast to the formality of most of the garden; the fruit trees were paired with climbing roses and the area provided space for the many gifts of plants and trees they received. The rose &quot;Rosa filipes&quot; &#x27;Kiftsgate&#x27;, a present from Sackville-West&#x27;s friend and fellow gardener Heather Muir of Kiftsgate Court, is one example. This part of the garden suffered particularly severe losses in the Great Storm of 1987 and much replanting has taken place. The Orchard is the setting for two structures planned by Nigel Nicolson and commissioned in memory of his father: the boathouse and the gazebo. The gazebo, of 1969, is by Francis Pym and has a candlesnuffer roof intended to evoke those of Kentish oast houses. The boathouse, of timber construction and with Tuscan colonnades, dates from 2002 and is by the local architectural firm Purcell Miller Tritton.

==Plants==
Tony Lord has noted that Sackville-West and Nicolson intended the gardens at Sissinghurst to be a source of personal enjoyment, rather than to be a public garden displaying rare plants. Aside from Sackville-West&#x27;s interest in collecting and preserving rare varieties of old roses, the other garden plants were selected primarily for their abilities to look good and grow successfully in their intended planting sites, as opposed to assembling a collection of rare plants from around the world. Later, in the 1960s, Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger decided to propagate the most successful flowering plant varieties in order to offer them for sale and make them more easily available to amateur gardeners.

===Roses===
The collection of rose varieties at Sissinghurst is considered to be extraordinary as well as to encapsulate Sackville-West&#x27;s approach to gardening. In 1953, John Vass counted 194 rose varieties on the property. A few modern rose varieties are included: the floribunda rose &#x27;Iceberg&#x27; is planted in the White Garden, having been supplied by Hilda Murrell to supplement plant losses after a hard winter following Sackville-West&#x27;s death, and the bright scarlet climbing hybrid tea &#x27;Allen Chandler&#x27; grows on each side of the entrance gate to the Top Courtyard.

The focus of Sackville-West&#x27;s collection was, however, on species roses and old garden varieties. Sackville-West described her love of the old roses, saying that one should &quot;discard the idea that roses must be limited to certain accepted and accustomed colours, and to welcome the less familiar purples and lilacs, and the striped, flaked, mottled variations which recall the old Dutch flower-paintings; to approach them, in fact, with open and unprejudiced eyes, and also with a nose that esteems the true scent of a rose warmed by the sun.&quot; She was especially fond of the bourbon roses &#x27;Madame Isaac Péreire&#x27; and &#x27;Madame Pierre Oger&#x27;. Graham Stuart Thomas, who helped locate rose varieties for Sissinghurst and advised Sackville-West on the design of the Rose Garden, described &#x27;Madame Isaac Péreire&#x27; as &quot;[p]ossibly the most powerfully fragrant of all roses&quot;, and &#x27;Madame Pierre Oger&#x27; as having a &quot;formal perfection unique among roses&quot;.

When she first visited the property, Sackville-West came upon a dark red, double-flowered form of &quot;Rosa gallica&quot; growing wild and apparently dating from earlier plantings there. She eventually planted it in the Orchard, and it is now known as the cultivar &#x27;Sissinghurst Castle&#x27;. In 1930, even before the deeds to the property had been signed, she planted the noisette rose &#x27;Madame Alfred Carrière&#x27; on the south face of the South Cottage, making it the first rose she would plant in the gardens.

In the Rose Garden itself, many roses were planted singly, but two deep pink varieties, the bourbon &#x27;Madame Lauriol de Barny&#x27; and the damask &#x27;La Ville de Bruxelles&#x27;, were planted closely in groups of three and allowed to grow together, providing focal points on the left and right sides, respectively, of the garden.

In the White Garden, &quot;Rosa mulliganii&quot; is trained over an arbour to provide the centrepiece of the design. Several varieties are trained to climb up trees in the Orchard. These include &#x27;Albéric Barbier&#x27;, described by Thomas as &quot;a great favourite&quot; among the hybrids of &quot;Rosa wichuraiana&quot;. Another is &#x27;Félicité et Perpétue&#x27;, a &quot;Rosa sempervirens&quot; hybrid that was named for the two daughters of the gardener to the Duke of Orléans in 1827, who were, in turn, named after Perpetua and Felicity. A third is the noisette &#x27;Madame Plantier&#x27;, of which Sackville-West wrote: &quot;I go out and look at her in the moonlight: she gleams, a pear-shaped ghost, contriving to look both matronly and virginal.&quot;
===Trees and hedges===
For the most part, Sackville-West and Nicolson simply kept the large trees that were already growing on the property, to serve as the major specimens. These included numerous ancient oaks that frame many of the individual gardens. The Orchard was made up of apple and pear trees that had been planted long before; Sackville-West and Nicolson decided to keep them and use them as supports for climbing roses. Similarly, the Nuttery consisted entirely of filberts that appear to have been planted around 1900.

Some trees were added to the plantings, notably the limes of the Lime Walk. A bed of &quot;Magnolia liliiflora&quot; &#x27;Nigra&#x27; is at the southern end of the Lower Courtyard, and some &quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot; are on the walls of the Top Courtyard. A coral tree is in the Lower Courtyard. Some &quot;Malus&quot; and &quot;Prunus&quot; previously in the Rose Garden died out, as have &quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;, &quot;Cercidiphyllum japonicum&quot;, and &quot;Koelreuteria paniculata&quot; in the Cottage Garden. A catalpa was planted as a focal point of the Lower Courtyard lawn in 1932, and Nicolson liked to sit beneath it and read, but it died in the 1960s.

Hedges play a critical role in defining the &quot;garden rooms&quot;. Yews, hornbeams, and box are each used in this way, clipped into formal square-edged rows of various heights. Yews are also pruned into vertical accents that mimic the shape of Italian cypress.

===Named cultivars===

In addition to the &#x27;Sissinghurst Castle&#x27; rose, multiple other flowering plants have been grown at Sissinghurst and given names honouring the property or the people associated with it. Sackville-West herself had low enthusiasm for naming plants in this way, and she and Nicolson actually dug up and discarded a rose that was named &#x27;Lady Sackville&#x27; after her mother. There are numerous plants that have been given trade names based on the gardens, including &quot;Tanacetum parthenium&quot; &#x27;Rowallane&#x27; which has often been mislabelled as &#x27;Sissinghurst&#x27;, but there are several that are grown at or were discovered at Sissinghurst and were named to reflect the association.

Sackville-West made an exception to her dislike of naming plants in memory of people and purchased &quot;Viola&quot; &#x27;Lady Sackville&#x27; late in her life, around 1960, planting it in the Delos. A few years after her death, a seedling appeared that seems to have been a spontaneous cross between &#x27;Lady Sackville&#x27; and the variety &#x27;Nellie Britton&#x27; that was growing alongside it. It had flowers of a rich pink that were larger than those of the parent varieties. The gardeners named it &#x27;Vita&#x27;. Sackville-West had also grown a variety of rosemary (&quot;Rosmarinus officinalis&quot;) that self-seeded in the Tower steps, and differed from the common variety in having upright rather than trailing stems, and flowers of a deeper shade of blue. It has come to be recognized as a distinct cultivar, and named &#x27;Sissinghurst Blue&#x27;.

In 1969, a gardener in Kent bred a cultivar of dwarf bearded iris with reddish-purple flowers. He gave a specimen to Sissinghurst, where it was planted in the Purple Border, and named &quot;Iris&quot; &#x27;Sissinghurst&#x27;. During the 1970s, a pink-flowered specimen of &quot;Glandularia&quot; (&quot;Verbena&quot;) was given to the garden and named &#x27;Sissinghurst&#x27;. In 1976, the garden was given a distinctive specimen of &quot;Pulmonaria officinalis&quot; that, unlike the species, has large white flowers (along with the white-spotted leaves of the species). It was planted in the White Garden and named &#x27;Sissinghurst White&#x27;. Around 1977, the gardeners purchased a collection of seedlings of &quot;Thalictrum aquilegiifolium&quot;. They selected the best plant, having larger flowers, and propagated it. This plant was added to the White Garden and named &#x27;White Cloud&#x27;. From a planting of &quot;Penstemon&quot; &#x27;Evelyn&#x27;, which is a selection of &quot;Penstemon barbatus&quot;, a specimen was named &#x27;Sissinghurst Pink&#x27;, although Lord does not consider it to be distinct from &#x27;Evelyn&#x27;.

In the late 1980s, Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger found a specimen of &quot;Phlox stolonifera&quot; with a remarkably rich purple colour in a florist&#x27;s shop near the Chelsea Flower Show. They planted it in the Top Courtyard and named it &#x27;Violet Vere&#x27; after Schwerdt&#x27;s mother, who had been President of the Wild Flower Society and was celebrating her ninetieth birthday.

<text>Sissinghurst is a small village in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England. Originally called &quot;Milkhouse Street&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Mylkehouse&quot;), Sissinghurst changed its name in the 1850s, possibly to avoid association with the smuggling and cockfighting activities of the Hawkhurst Gang. It is in the civil parish of Cranbrook and Sissinghurst.

The nearest railway station is at Staplehurst, to the north.

==Geography==
Sissinghurst is situated with Cranbrook to the south, Goudhurst to the west, Tenterden to the east and Staplehurst to the north. It sits just back from the A229 which goes from Rochester to Hawkhurst.

==History==
Sissinghurst&#x27;s history is similar to that of nearby Cranbrook. Iron Age working tools have been found and the village was for centuries a meeting and resting place for people travelling towards the south coast.

==Sissinghurst Castle Garden==
Sissinghurst&#x27;s garden was created in the 1930s by Vita Sackville-West, poet and gardening writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. Sackville-West was a writer on the fringes of the Bloomsbury group who found her greatest popularity in the weekly columns she contributed as gardening correspondent of &quot;The Observer&quot;, which incidentally – for she never touted it – made her own garden famous. The garden itself is designed as a series of &quot;rooms&quot;, each with a different character of colour and/or theme, divided by high clipped hedges and pink brick walls.

==Trinity Church==

The Church of England &#x27;Trinity Church&#x27; and was built in 1838. It is currently managed by Rev. Pete Deaves who is also Rector of Frittenden.

==People==
People of note who have lived in Sissinghurst include:
* Sir Richard Baker (–1645) a politician, historian and religious writer
* Laurence Drummond (1861–1946) a British Army general officer
* Sir Harold Nicolson (1886–1968) British diplomat, author and politician

* Vita Sackville-West CH (1892–1962) The Hon Lady Nicolson, English poet, novelist and gardener
* Pamela Schwerdt (1931–2009) joint head gardener at Sissinghurst Castle Garden from 1959 to 1990 and a pioneering horticulturalist
* Christopher Lee (1941–2021) a British writer, historian and broadcaster
* Ian Hislop (born 1960) editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot; and team captain of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, husband of Victoria Hislop.
* Victoria Hislop (born 1959) novelist and author.

<doc id="493352" wikidata="Q2530379" url="?curid=493352" title="Henry Bacon">
<text>Henry Bacon (November 28, 1866February 16, 1924) was an American Beaux-Arts architect who oversaw the engineering and design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., built between 1915 and 1922, which was his final project before his 1924 death.

==Early life and education==
Bacon was born in Watseka, Illinois. He studied briefly at the University of Illinois, Urbana in 1884, but left to begin his architectural career as a draftsman. 

==Career==


===Early career===
Bacon initially worked in the office of McKim, Mead &amp; White in New York City, one of the best-known architectural firms at the time. His works of that period were in the late Greek Revival and Beaux-Arts styles with which the firm was associated. They included the 1889 World Expo in Paris, Boston Public Library in Boston, the New York Herald Building, Harvard Club of New York City, Columbia University&#x27;s Morningside Heights campus, and Pennsylvania Station, each in New York City, and the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.

While at McKim, Mead &amp; White, Bacon won, in 1889, the Rotch Traveling Scholarship for architectural students. This gave him two years of study and travel in Europe, which he spent learning and drawing details of Roman and Greek architecture. In Turkey, he met his future wife, Laura Florence Calvert, daughter of a British consul. He traveled with another fellowship student, Albert Kahn from Detroit, Michigan, who also went on to become a leading industrial architect.

After returning to the U.S., Bacon worked for a few more years with his mentor, Charles McKim, including on such projects as the Rhode Island State House in Providence, Rhode Island. He served as McKim&#x27;s personal representative in Paris during the World Exposition in 1889 and in Chicago for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893, for which McKim, Mead &amp; White was designing several buildings.

In 1897, Bacon left with James Brite, a younger architect from the firm, to found the partnership of Brite and Bacon Architects. Brite was in charge of financial, administrative, and contracting aspects of the partnership, while Bacon was in charge of the architectural design and construction. The partnership immediately won the competition for the Jersey City, New Jersey&#x27;s public library and the Hall of History (now Hurst Hall) for American University in Washington, D.C. They built a number of public buildings and a small number of private residences, which most notably included La Fetra Mansion in Summit, New Jersey.

The partnership was selected in 1897 to build three private residences: La Fetra Mansion; Laurel Hill, a three-story Georgian mansion in Columbia, North Carolina; and Donald McRae House in Wilmington, North Carolina. The La Fetra Mansion was designed and built by Bacon, and his design was published in the September 1901 issue of &quot;&quot;, the preeminent architectural professional journal of its time. The LeFetra Mansion fully exhibits Bacon&#x27;s preference for Beaux-Arts Neo-Greek and Roman architectural styles. His simple and elegant lines, and his skill in dimensions and proportions, were described as expressing a stately elegance, peaceful tranquility, and sense of divine protection.
===Lincoln Memorial===
In 1897, following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Bacon was also approached by a group, which had organized to raise public and private funds to build a monument in Washington, D.C., to memorialize President Abraham Lincoln. Bacon began his conceptual, artistic, and architectural design for the Lincoln Memorial that year. He continued in the effort, although the funding to build the project was not secured until years later. The Brite and Bacon Partnership dissolved in 1902, partly resulting from Brite&#x27;s disagreement over Bacon&#x27;s passion and the unpaid time he spent on the memorial design.

===Prominent buildings and monuments===
After that, Bacon practiced under his own name with significant success, building a large number of public buildings and monuments which became renowned, until his death in 1924. His later works included the Danforth Memorial Library in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1908, the Ridgewood, New Jersey 1924 War Memorial in Van Neste Park; the train station in Naugatuck, Connecticut; Waterbury Hospital Waterbury, Connecticut; Court of the Four Seasons at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915; World War I Memorial at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Confederate Memorial in Wilmington, North Carolina; and many other distinguished public buildings and monuments.

In 1913, Bacon was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member, and he became a full member in 1917.

Bacon was very active as a designer of monuments and settings for public sculpture. He designed the Court of the Four Seasons for the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, and the World War I Memorial at Yale University. He collaborated with sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the Sen. Mark Hanna Monument in Cleveland, Ohio, and with Daniel Chester French on several monuments, notably the Lincoln Memorial&#x27;s pensive colossal Lincoln. Olin Memorial Library, one of Bacon&#x27;s buildings at Wesleyan University, houses many of Bacon&#x27;s documents and blueprints of the Lincoln Memorial.

Bacon rarely found time to design private residences. There are three known residential projects that are clearly his work. The first is the La Fetra Mansion in Summit, New Jersey, designed and built by the firm of Brite &amp; Bacon from 1897 to 1900. Bacon skillfully integrated into a residential setting many of his signature Greek Revival and Roman Renaissance elements and proportions. The resulting elegance was astoundingly masterful. The La Fetra Mansion was commissioned by industrialist Harold A. La Fetra of the Royal Baking Powder Company, which later merged with RJR Nabisco. The second is Donald McRae House in Wilmington, North Carolina, built for his close friend Donald McRae.

The third Bacon-designed private residence is Chesterwood House, which he designed for his friend, the noted sculptor Daniel Chester French, as his summer home and studio at Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Its exterior bears similarity to the La Fetra Mansion.
Bacon served as a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1921 until his death in 1924. 

In May 1923, President Warren G. Harding presented Bacon with the American Institute of Architects&#x27;s Gold Medal, making him the sixth recipient of the honor.

==Death and legacy==
Bacon died of cancer in New York City, and he is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Wilmington, North Carolina.

During World War II, a U.S. Navy Liberty Ship, the SS &quot;Henry Bacon&quot;, was named for Bacon. It was commissioned on November 11, 1942. In 1964, sculptor Joseph Kiselewski created the Henry Bacon Medal for Memorial Architecture, cast in bronze by the Medallic Arts Company in honor of Bacon.

<text>Ayeyarwady Region ( , , ; formerly Ayeyarwady Division and Irrawaddy Division) is a region of Myanmar, occupying the delta region of the Ayeyarwady River (Irrawaddy River). It is bordered by the Rakhine State to the northwest, the Bago Region to the north, Bago Region and Yangon Region to the east, and the Bay of Bengal to the south and west.

The region lies between approximately latitude 15° 40&#x27; and 18° 30&#x27; north and between longitude 94° 15&#x27; and 96° 15&#x27; east. It has an area of . The estimated 2022 population is more than 6.5 million. According to the 2014 Burmese National Census the population of the Ayeyarwady Region was 6,184,829, making it the second most populous of Burma&#x27;s states and regions after Yangon Region.

Ayeyarwady Region is flanked by the Rakhine Yoma (Arakan Mountains) range in the west. Large areas have been cleared for paddy cultivation, leading to its preeminent position as the main rice producer in the country, a position it has retained into the 21st century.

It has also a number of lakes. Of the rivers branching out from the mighty Ayeyarwady, Ngawun, Pathein and Toe are famous.

The capital city of Ayeyarwady division is Pathein.

Chaungtha Beach and Ngwesaung Beach are popular resorts for both foreigners and the Burmese.
They are in the west of the Ayeyarwady Region, an hour from Pathein city and four hours from Yangon city by road.

== Demographics ==

Bamar 4,873,027 (76.98%) and Karen 1,426,973 (22.5%) form the majority of the population, with a small minority of Rakhine (0.47%) in western coastal regions. Burmese is the &quot;lingua franca&quot;. The majority of the people are Buddhist, with small minorities of Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Baháʼís.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Buddhists make up 92.2% of Ayeyawady Region&#x27;s population, forming the largest religious community there. Minority religious communities include Christians (6.3%), Muslims (1.4%), and Hindus (0.1%) who collectively comprise the remainder of Ayeyawady Region&#x27;s population. 0.1% of the population listed no religion, other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee&#x27;s 2016 statistics, 42,494 Buddhist monks were registered in Ayeyawady Region, comprising 7.9% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (80.1%), followed by Shwegyin Nikaya (8.3%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 5,520 thilashin were registered in Ayeyawady Region, comprising 9.1% of Myanmar&#x27;s total thilashin community.

== Economy ==

Ayeyarwady Region is heavily forested and wood products are an important component of the economy. The principal crop of Ayeyarwady Region is rice, and the division is called the &quot;granary of Burma&quot;. In addition to rice, other crops include maize, sesame, groundnut, sunflower, beans, pulses, and jute. Fishery is also important; Ayeyarwady Region produces fish, prawn, fish-paste, dry fish, dry prawn, and fish sauce.

Despite the importance of agriculture to the region, landlessness is high in rural households. Most farms are small; nearly half are under 5 acres. Rice paddy agriculture is dominant during the monsoon but irrigation is limited, especially in smaller farms, during the dry season. Seeds are sourced from own reserves rather than from specialized traders. Yields from farms average 3.3 tons per hectare, lower than other Asian countries.

Ayeyarwady Region also has considerable tourist potential. The city of Pathein has numerous historic sights and temples. Outside Pathein are the beach resorts of Chaungtha Beach and the lake resort of Inye Lake. Inye lake is located in Kyonpyaw township, north east of Pathein. Inye lake is also well known for fishery, as the major supplier of fresh water fish. Chaungtha is located in Pathein township. However, hotel and transportation infrastructure is still very poorly developed.

== History ==
The Ayeyarwady delta region was Historically part of the Mon kingdoms like the Hanthawaddy Kingdom. This area fell under Burmese (and occasional Arakanese and Mon) rule from the 11th century AD onwards. Its subsequent history mirrors that of the rest of lower Burma.

An ancient overland pre-Tang trade route from Sichuan (modern Yunnan Province) to Bengal passed through Ayeyarwady.

=== Cyclone Nargis ===

Ayeyarwady Region was the site of heavy devastation when Cyclone Nargis made landfall in early May 2008. The cyclone made landfall on the town of Wagon near Haigyi Island. Labutta Township was most heavily struck with around 80,000 deaths. The cyclone&#x27;s path devastated the low-lying delta regions going through south-central Ayeyarwady Region and Bogale before entering neighbouring Yangon Region. Nargis was the most expensive tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean at the time, costing $12 billion in aid.

Burma&#x27;s state-controlled news media reported that Nargis left more than 66,000 people dead or missing after it struck the Irrawaddy Delta region May 2, unleashing torrential rains, 120 mph sustained winds and a storm surge. Foreign relief officials and diplomats said the death toll could exceed 100,000, making it the worst natural disaster in the recorded history of Myanmar. The final death toll was at least 146,000 with 90,000 confirmed dead and 56,000 or more missing.

==Administrative divisions==

Ayeyarwady Region consists of eight districts:
* Pathein District
* Kyonpyaw District
* Hinthada District
* Labutta District
* Maubin District
* Myanaung District
* Myaungmya District
* Pyapon District

Labutta District was formed in August 2008, three months after Cyclone Nargis hit the region. Kyonpyaw District and Myanaung District are the newest districts, formed in 2019 in the lead up to the 2020 Elections

Pathein is the capital city and capital. The region consists of 26 townships and 29 cities. In the townships there are 219 wards, 1912 village groups and 11651 villages.

== Education ==
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay. According to official statistics, less than 10% of primary school students in the division reach high school.

Pathein University is the main university in the state, and until recently the only four-year university in the state. In recent years, the military government, which closed down universities and colleges in the 1990s to quell student unrest, has &quot;upgraded&quot; former colleges and two-year institutes. The government now requires that students attend their local universities and colleges, such as Hinthada University and Maubin University.

== Health care ==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the health care infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor. For example, in 2003, Ayeyarwady Region had less than a quarter of hospital beds than Yangon Region although Ayeyarwady Region had a slightly greater population.

According to legend, two Mon princes from Thaton founded the city of Bago in 573 AD. They saw a female Hamsa standing on the back of a male Hamsa on an island in a huge lake. Believing this was an auspicious omen, the princes built a city called Hanthawady (Pali: Hamsavati) on the edge of the lake.

The Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentions the city around 850 AD. The Mon capital was still in Thaton at that time. The Thiruvalangadu plate describe Rajendra Chola I, the Chola Emperor from South India, as having conquered &quot;Kadaram&quot; in the fourteenth year of his reign- 1028 CE. According to one interpretation, Kadaram refers to Bago. More modern interpretations understand Kadaram to be Kedah in modern-day Malaysia, instead of Bago. The earliest reliable external record of Bago comes from Chinese sources that mention Jayavarman VII adding Pegu to the territory of the Khmer Empire in 1195. The Bamar from Bagan ruled the area in 1056. After the collapse of Bagan to the Mongols in 1287, the Mon regained their independence.

From 1369 to 1539, Hanthawady was the capital of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, which covered all of what is now lower Burma. The area came under Burman control again in 1539, when it was annexed by King Tabinshwehti of Kingdom of Taungoo. The kings of Taungoo made Bago their royal capital from 1539 to 1599, and used it as a base for their repeated invasions of Siam. As a major seaport, the city was frequently visited by Europeans, who commented on its magnificence. The Burmese capital was relocated to Ava in 1634. In 1740, the Mon revolted and briefly regained their independence, but Burmese King Alaungpaya sacked and completely destroyed the city (along with Mon independence) in 1757.

Burmese King Bodawpaya (1782–1819) rebuilt Bago, but by then the river had shifted course, cutting the city off from the sea. It never regained its previous importance. After the Second Anglo-Burmese War, the British annexed Bago in 1852. In 1862, with the formation of the province of British Burma, the capital was moved to Yangon.

==Health==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the health care infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor. For example, in 2003, Bago Region had less than a quarter of hospital beds than Yangon Region whose population was just slighter greater. More shocking still, in 2005, this division of five million had only 399 doctors in its public hospitals.

<text>Magway Region (, ; formerly Magway Division) is an administrative division in central Myanmar. It is the second largest of Myanmar&#x27;s seven divisions, with an area of . Pa Del Dam (ပဒဲဆည်) is one of the dams in Aunglan Township, Magway Division. The capital and second largest city of the Magway Division is Magway. The largest city is Pakokku. The major cities of Magway Division are Magway, Pakokku, Aunglan, Yenangyaung, Taungdwingyi, Chauk, Minbu, Thayet and Gangaw.

==Geography==
Magway Region sits approximately between north latitude 18° 50&#x27; to 22° 47&#x27; and east longitude 93° 47&#x27; to 95° 55&#x27;. It is bordered by Sagaing Region to the north, Mandalay Region to the east, Bago Region to the south, and Rakhine State and Chin State to the west.

==History==
Fossils of the early primates over 40 million years old were excavated in the Pondaung and Ponnya areas from Pakokku District in Magway Region, leading the government to proclaim that Myanmar as &quot;the birthplace of humanity in the world,&quot; a claim which is unsupported by anthropologists. An ancient city of the Pyu, Peikthano-myo, about 2,000 years old, is located in Taungdwingyi Township, Magway Region.

The history of Magway Region mirrors that of the other divisions of central Burma. The ancient name of Magway Region is Minbu Region (or) Minbu Province. Minbu Region was established with 3 districts. They are Minbu District, Thayet District, and Yenangyaung District. Its capital city was Yenangyaung. In 1950,Chauk township was moved to Yenangyaung District from Myingyan District.

On 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d&#x27;état, and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military. A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974.

The name of Minbu Region was changed to Magway Region and Yenangyaung District was abolished. Magway District was established with 6 townships. Pakokku Hill Tracts (or) Pakokku Province was abolished, and Pakokku District was added to the Magway Division and Mindat District was added to the Chin state. Magway Region was then divided into 4 districts: Magway District, Minbu District, Thayet District and Pakokku District. Its capital city was changed from Yenangyaung to Magway.

In 4 April 1996, Pakokku District was divided into two districts: Pakokku District and Gangaw District. Currently, Magway Region has a total of 5 districts and 25 townships.

==Administrative divisions==
Magway Region&#x27;s districts are Magwe, Minbu, Thayet, Pakokku and Gangaw, comprising 25 townships and 1,696 ward village tracts. Its capital city is Magwe (2020 urban population estimated as 85,214) and its largest city is Pakokku (2020 urban population estimated as 107,890).

Other major cities are Aunglan (2020 urban population estimated as 52,431), Yenangyaung (2020 urban population estimated as 49,938), Taungdwingyi (2020 urban population estimated as 47,739), Chauk (2020 urban population estimated as 47,568) and Minbu (2020 urban population estimated as 40,304).

==Government==
===Executive===
Magway Region Government

===Legislature===

===Judiciary===
Magway Region High Court

==Demographics==
The population of Magway Region is 3,912,711 in 2014. Over 95% the people are Bamar, with very small numbers of minorities including Chin, Rakhine, Karen, Shan, and a tiny Anglo-Burmese population. During colonial times, this part of Burma had a large Anglo-Burmese population, descended from Western oil workers and their Burmese partners.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Buddhists make up 98.8% of Magway Region’s population, forming the largest religious community there. Minority religious communities include Christians (0.7%), Muslims (0.3%), Hindus (0.1%), and animists (0.1%) who collectively comprise the remainder of Magway Region’s population.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee’s 2016 statistics, 31,349 Buddhist monks were registered in Magway Region, comprising 5.9% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (97%), followed by Shwegyin Nikaya (2.4%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 2,473 thilashin were registered in Magway Region, comprising 4.1% of Myanmar’s total thilashin community.

==Transport==
The Irrawaddy River is the major transportation system in Magway Region, both in terms of volume of goods and population served. Most major towns in the region are river ports on the Irrawaddy; among them are Magway, Pakokku, Minbu, Yenangyaung, Chauk, Allanmyo, and Thayetmyo. Pakokku&#x27;s river port is a major port of Magway Region and the third most important river port in Myanmar after Yangon port and Mandalay port.
The major form of transport for non-Irrawaddy areas is by road. The road system is less developed on the western side of the river. The towns are connected with two-lane roads. Most towns have regular bus transportation to Rangoon (Yangon) and Mandalay.Pakokku Bridge is part of the India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway and is the longest bridge in Myanmar.

The Pyay to Nyaung-U, Pakokku and Myingyan railway runs through eastern Magway with connections to the capital Naypyidaw, Rangoon and Mandalay. The major stops in Magway on that line are Taungdwingyi and Natmauk. In addition, there are two rail lines running north from the Irrawaddy port of Kyangin, one to Chaung-U in Sagaing Region and the other to the Myittha River valley past Myaing and Kyaw.

The capital Magway has a small non-commercial airport with air traffic for the city of Magway mostly coming in through Bagan Airport at Nyaung U some 113 km to the north along the Irrawaddy. There are commercial airports at Gangaw, Kyauktu, Pakokku, and Pauk. , however, none of them have regularly scheduled flights. Pakokku airport, however, plans to upgrade to an international airport soon.

==Economy==

The principal product of Magway Region is petroleum. It produces most of the oil and natural gas in Burma. Magway Region&#x27;s oil fields are located in Mann, Yenangyaung, Chauk, Kyauk-khwet, Letpando and Ayadaw.

In May 2002, Russia agreed to help Myanmar build a 10-megawatt nuclear reactor and two laboratories in the region. Other industries include cement, cotton weaving, and tobacco, iron and bronze. Magway Region produces a large quantity of edible oil as well as petroleum, hence gaining its reputation as the &quot;oil pot of Myanmar&quot;.

Pakokku is the largest rice market city of Upper Myanmar (Burma). Agriculture is another important practice, the major crops being sesamum and groundnut. Other crops grown are rice, millet, maize, sunflower, beans and pulses, tobacco, toddy, chili, onions, and potatoes. Famous products of Magway Region include Thanaka (Limonia acidissima) and Phangar (Chebulic myrobalan) fruit.

Only Pakokku and Yenangyaung have industrial zones.

==The Largest Rice Market of Upper Myanmar==
Pakokku is the biggest rice market in Upper Myanmar due to the rice requirement of the region itself and being a door to Chin State which also needs rice. Of the incoming rice to Pakokku, 70% is from the Ayeyawady Region (Myaungmya, Hinthada and Myanaung) and 30% is from Shwebo and Ye-U of the Sagaing Region. Some 20% of rice coming into the market of Pakokku is consumed by Pakokku itself, and the remaining 80% is sent to other township markets. Most buyers are from Myaing, Yesagyo, Pauk, Myingyan, Kalaymyo and Chin State. In the Pakokku market, consumption is 15% for top class, 50% for middle class and 35% for lower class rice. There are about 5 large rice wholesalers and 10 small rice wholesalers. A large rice wholesaler sells 500 to 1,500 bags per day, so it can sell 180,000 to 200,000 bags (9,000-10,000 tons) a year. Due to the smooth transportation and the booming market, the rice price becomes very high. Thus, the rice market in Pakokku has increased to double that of the Mandalay market.

==Education==
As of 2002, Magway Region have 3859 schools, of which only 70 are high schools. Only about 10% of the division&#x27;s primary school students reach high school.

Most of 12 colleges and universities in the division are located in Magway, Pakokku and Yenangyaung.

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the health care infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor. As of 2003, Magway Region had less than a quarter of hospital beds than Yangon Region with a slightly greater population.

==Notable sites==
* Fort Min Hla and Fort Kway Chaung: Two late-Konbaung-era forts built to resist a British invasion. The first is situated in the town of Minhla, while the latter is located at opposite bank of the Irrawaddy river.
* Thihoshin Pagoda: Famous Buddhist pagoda in Pakokku, built by King Alaungsithu.

<text>Sagaing Region (, ; formerly Sagaing Division) is an administrative region of Myanmar, located in the north-western part of the country between latitude 21° 30&#x27; north and longitude 94° 97&#x27; east. It is bordered by India&#x27;s Nagaland, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh states to the north, Kachin State, Shan State, and Mandalay Region to the east, Mandalay Region and Magway Region to the south, with the Ayeyarwady River forming a greater part of its eastern and also southern boundary, and Chin State and India to the west. The region has an area of . In 1996, it had a population of over 5,300,000 while its population in 2012 was 6,600,000. The urban population in 2012 was 1,230,000 and the rural population 5,360,000. The capital city of Sagaing Region is Sagaing and the administrative capital and largest city being Monywa.

==History==
===0 - 1200 A.D===
The Pyu were the first in recorded history to populate the area of Sagaing Region by the first century CE. The Burmans first migrated into Upper Myanmar by ninth century CE. The area came under the Pagan Kingdom certainly by the middle of 11th century when the King Anawrahta (r. 1044–1077) founded the Pagan Empire, which encompasses the modern day Myanmar.

===1287 - 1900 ===

After the fall of Pagan in 1287, the northwestern parts of Upper Myanmar came under the Sagaing Kingdom (1315–1364) ruled by Burmanized Shan kings. The area was ruled by the kings of Ava from 1364 to 1555 and the kings of Taungoo from 1555 to 1752. Konbaung Dynasty (1752–1885), founded by king Alaungpaya in Shwebo, became the last Burmese dynasty before the British conquest of Upper Burma in 1885. The area became Sagaing Division after the Burmese independence in January 1948.

In the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, Sagaing Region, which is part of the Bamar homeland, emerged as a stronghold of resistance against military rule. Myanmar Armed Forces have engaged in significant military offensives throughout the region to quell resistance and intimidate local villagers. Sagaing Region has since become the site of several high-profile massacres by military forces, including the 2022 Let Yet Kone massacre and the 2023 Tar Taing massacre.

==Administrative divisions==
As of 2022, Sagaing Region consists of 13 districts and 1 Self-Administered Zone divided into 34 townships with 198 wards and villages. The major cities are Sagaing, Shwebo, Monywa, Ye U, Katha, Kale, Tamu, Mawlaik and Hkamti. Mingun with its famous bell is located near Sagaing but can be reached across the Ayeyarwady from Mandalay.

In August 2010, three former townships of Hkamti District were transferred, in accordance with the 2008 constitution, to a new administrative unit, the Naga Self-Administered Zone.

== Demographics ==

The Bamar (Burmans) are the majority ethnic group in the dry regions and along the Mandalay-Myitkyina Railroad. Shan live in the upper Chindwin River valley. Kuki people which includes the Thadou people live in the south and along the Indo-Myanmar Border from Homalin to Tamu-Namphalong axis. Smaller ethnic groups native to the Region include the Kadu and Ganang, who live in the upper Mu River valley and Meza River valley. There are also an unknown number of Catholic Bayingyi people (at least 3,000), the descendants of 16th and 17th century Portuguese adventurers and mercenaries, who live in their ancestral villages on the expansive plains of the Mu River valley.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Buddhists, who make up 92.2% of Sagaing Region&#x27;s population, form the largest religious community there. Minority religious communities include Christians (6.6%), Muslims (1.1%), and Hindus (0.1%) who collectively comprise the remainder of Sagaing Region&#x27;s population. 0.1% of the population listed no religion, other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee’s 2016 statistics, 55,041 Buddhist monks were registered in Sagaing Region, comprising 10.3% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (83.8%), followed by Shwegyin Nikaya (16.1%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 9,915 thilashin were registered in Sagaing Region, comprising 16.4% of Myanmar&#x27;s total thilashin community.

==Ecology==
There are a number of protected areas in Sagaing Region, among them are Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary, and Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary in Homalin Township.

==Transport==

Hemmed in by two great rivers of Myanmar, the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin, river transport is a common way to move people and cargo. Much of the inland Sagaing Region relies on roads and rail in poor condition.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the chief occupation. The leading crop is rice, which occupies most of the arable ground. Other crops include wheat, sesame, peanut, pulses, cotton, and tobacco. The region being next to India, depends on the export import business from India. It is the gateway to India for Myanmar. Sagaing is Myanmar&#x27;s leading producer of wheat, contributing more than 80% of the country&#x27;s total production. Important minerals include gold, coal, salt and small amounts of petroleum. Industry includes textiles, copper refining, gold smelting, and a diesel engine plant. The Region has many rice mills, edible oil mills, saw mills, cotton mills, and mechanized weaving factories. Local industry includes earthen pots, silverware, bronze-wares, iron-wares and lacquerware.

Forestry is important in the wetter upper regions along the Chindwin River, with teak and other hardwoods extracted. As in other parts of the country, reforestation is not effective enough to maintain sustainable forestry. Since the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, illegal logging of teak and tamalan trees has surged in Sagaing Region, predominantly in key contested battlegrounds, including Kani, Yinmabin, Kantbalu, Indaw and Banmauk townships. Both the Burmese military and resistance groups have profited from the illegal logging trade. Smugglers transport the wood to India in order to circumvent economic sanctions, and use the Myanma Timber Enterprise to license the wood as being sourced from permitted areas.

==Education==
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay. According to official statistics, less than 10% of primary school students in Sagaing Region reach high school.

Sagaing Region has three national &quot;professional&quot; universities in the Monywa University of Economics, Sagaing University of Education and the Sagaing Institute of Education. Monywa University is the main liberal arts university in the region. Sagaing Institute of Education also known Sagaing University of Education is the one of two senior universities of education in Myanmar.

==Healthcare==
The general state of healthcare in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although healthcare is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the healthcare infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor. In 2003, Sagaing Region had less than a quarter of the number of hospital beds counted in Yangon Region, with a similar size of population.

<doc id="493366" wikidata="Q46910" url="?curid=493366" title="Chin State">
<text>Chin State (, ) is a state in western Myanmar. Chin State is bordered by Sagaing Division and Magway Division to the east, Rakhine State to the south, the Chattogram Division of Bangladesh to the west, and the Indian states of Mizoram to the west and Manipur to the north. The population of Chin State is about 488,801 according to the 2014 census, and its capital city is Hakha.

The state is named for the Chin people, an ethnic group native to Chin State and neighboring Rakhine State. Much of the state is mountainous and sparsely populated, with few transportation links and low levels of economic development. It also has Myanmar&#x27;s highest poverty rate, at 58%, according to a 2017 report.

==History==

===Early history===
Situated in the remote hilly region of the Chin Hills, Chin State was traditionally autonomous and far from their neighboring powers like Burman kingdoms in the east and Indian states in the west to reach. Until the British advancement in the region, independent city-states such as Ciimnuai (Chinwe/Chin Nwe) later shifted to Tedim and Vangteh in the north, Tlaisun (also recorded as Tashon) and Rallang in the mid-land, and Hakha, Thantlang and Zokhua (Yokwa) in the south played important political role in securing peace of the region, and each city-state practised its own independent sovereignty in their own rights.

===20th century===
Upon Burma&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1948, the Chin Hills Special Division was created, with its capital at Falam. Hakha later became the capital. However, three townships that are today part of present-day Chin State (Mindat, Kanpetlet and Matupi) were previously part of the Pakokku Hill Tracts of Pakokku District and Paletwa Township of the Arakan Hill Tracts, until 4 January 1974. On this date, the Chin Hills Special Division was granted state status and became Chin State.

&quot;Chin National Day&quot; is designated on 20 February to commemorate the &quot;General Assembly of Chinland&quot; held in 1948. The first celebration of Chin National Day was held in 1951, but it was not recognized by the Myanmar government until the 2010s.

===Myanmar civil war===

Chin State, like much of Myanmar, has been deeply affected by the Myanmar civil war since it broke out in 2021. Tens of thousands of Chin State residents have fled to neighboring Mizoram, India, and towns such as Thantlang were destroyed in the fighting. Since the war broke out, several armed opposition groups have emerged calling themselves the Chinland Defense Force. The groups are reportedly funded by the Chin diaspora and by the National Unity Government of Myanmar, an opposition government-in-exile.

On 6 December 2023 the Chin National Front adopted a Chinland Constitution, proclaiming the state of Chinland. But resistance groups from 5 townships (Falam, Kanpetlet, Matupi, Mindat, and Tedim) out of 9 townships in Chin State objected to this constitution. 

==Administrative divisions==

* Falam District Northern Chin State
** Falam Township
** Tedim Township

** Thantlang Township
* Matupi District of Central and Southwestern Chin State
** Matupi Township
** Rezua Sub-township
** Paletwa Township
* Mindat District of Southeastern Chin State
** Mindat Township
** Kanpetlet Township
Hakha District was formed by the first Chin State Hluttaw emergency meeting No. 2/2012 on 1 June. Matupi District was formed by the second Pyidaungsu Hluttaw regular meeting on 28 June 2017.

==Government==

Minority religious communities include Buddhists (8.0%), Islam (0.1%), Hindus (0.0%), and Animism and other religions (0.4%), including adherents of Pau Cin Hau, who collectively comprise the remainder of Chin State&#x27;s population. 0.1% of the population listed no religion, or other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated. Chin State is the only state in Myanmar with a majority Christian population.

Other important towns include Bhamo, Mohnyin and Putao.

Kachin State has Myanmar&#x27;s highest mountain, Hkakabo Razi at , forming the southern tip of the Himalayas, and a large inland lake, Indawgyi Lake.

==History==
===Kingdom of Nanzhao===
The Nanzhao Kingdom controlled much of Upper Burma, including modern-day Kachin State. The kingdom also used the territory as a staging ground to invade the Pyu city-states in modern-day Sagaing. E.R. Leach claimed that the Chinese referred to the Jingpo as Pu Man (蒲蠻) as a leftover from Nanzhao descriptions of Mon-Khmer speakers. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion.
===Kingdom of Dali===


After the fall of the Nanzhao Kingdom, the Dali Kingdom administered the lands inhabited by the Kachin people.

===Kingdom of Mongmao===

During the 14th-century, Mong Mao used the territories of modern-day Kachin State to launch incursions into Yunnan.

===Under Qing dynasty of China===
The Qing dynasty of China briefly controlled the present Kachin state during the 1760 Sino-Burmese War.

What is now Kachin State was historically inhabited by a diverse population of various ethnolinguistic groups, including the Rawang, the Lisu, the Jingpo, the Zaiwa, the Lashi/Lachik and the Lawngwaw/Maru, all of whom had overlapping territories and varying social structures. The term &quot;Kachin&quot; is a term given by the British during the colony period referring to ethnic groups living between the central Bamar heartland to the south and China to the north.

Traditional Kachin society was based on shifting hill agriculture. According to &quot;The Political Systems of Highland Burma: A Study of Kachin Social Structure&quot;, written by E. R. Leach, Kachin was not a linguistic category. Political authority was based on chieftains who depended on support from immediate kinsmen. Considerable attention has been given by anthropologists of the Kachin custom of maternal cousin marriage, wherein it is permissible for a man to marry his mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter, but not with the father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s daughter. In pre-colonial times, the Kachin were animist.

After the 1760s Qing-Konbaung war, the Chinese exercised a degree of control over the present-day northeastern Kachin State. During the British colonization of Burma, the Kachin Hills tribal autonomy was accepted by the British government. British forces carried out two expeditions against the Kachin in 1892 and 1896. In 1910, the British occupied Hpimaw (Pianma) in the &quot;Pianma Incident&quot;.

===Post-independence Burma===
The pre-independence Burmese government under Aung San reached the Panglong Agreement with the Shan, Kachin, and Chin peoples on 12 February 1947. The agreement accepted &quot;Full autonomy in internal administration for the Frontier Areas&quot; in principle and envisioned the creation of a Kachin State by the Constituent Assembly. Burma attained independence on 4 January 1948. Kachin State was formed in the same year out of the former British Burma civil districts of Bhamo and Myitkyina, together with the larger northern district of Puta-o. Kachin State was officially announced on 10 January 1948 and Kachin State Government held &quot;Mungdaw Masat Masat Manau&quot; (forming of Kachin State Manau) for three consecutive days since 9 to 11 January as happiness since that year they held Manau on 10 January every year until the 1962 Burmese coup d&#x27;état. The vast mountainous hinterlands are predominantly Kachin, whereas the more densely populated railway corridor and southern valleys are mostly Shan and Bamar. The northern frontier was not demarcated until the 1960s. Various Chinese governments had claimed the northern-half of Kachin State as Chinese territory since the 18th century. Before the British rule, roughly 75% of all Kachin jadeite ended up in China, where it was prized much more highly than the local Chinese nephrite.

===Kachin conflict===
The complex political situation started when the Kachin armed group was established on 25 October 1960, after the UN government announced the state religion as Buddhism, as the Kachin people stopped believing in the government administration system, established after the federal union was agreed upon in the 1947 Panglong agreement. Between 1962 and 2010, the military government ruled over Myanmar. Cease fire agreements between ethnic armed groups and the government were made starting in 1989. And then in 2011 the new government led by President Thein Sein, broke the cease fire agreement which was agreed upon by the former military government and the Kachin ethnic armed group in 1994, resuming fighting against the Kachin who are living in the northern part of Myanmar, northern part of Shan, near the China border on 9 June 2011. Because of the abrupt internal conflict, thousands of internally displaced people fled to refugee camps which are located in the government-controlled area as well in the Kachin Independence Army controlled area (Hlaing, 2005).

Kachin troops formerly formed a significant part of the Burmese army. With the unilateral of the Union of Burma constitution by the Ne Win regime in 1962, Kachin forces withdrew and formed the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) under the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). Aside from the major towns and railway corridor, Kachin State has been virtually independent from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on agriculture and trade with China, including of jade. After a Myanmar army offensive in 1994 seized the jade mines from the KIO, a peace treaty was signed, permitting continued KIO effective control of most of the State, under aegis of the Myanmar military. This ceasefire immediately resulted in the creation of numerous splinter factions from the KIO and KIA of groups opposed to the SPDC&#x27;s controversial peace accord, and the political landscape remains highly unstable.

KIO made a ceasefire agreement with the military government in 1994 while leaving political issues to be discussed with the next elected government. Throughout its struggle, both in the ceasefire and non-ceasefire period, KIO also made agreements with other ethnic rebels and alliances including the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), the National Democratic Front (NDF), and United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC). The main goal was to pressure the military government and restore the federal democratic government with greater autonomy to Kachin State. During its 17 years of ceasefire from 1994 to 2011 the KIO actively participated in the military-led constitution-drafting-process, attending the National Convention, which was boycotted by the democratic icon Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s National League for Democracy and ethnic political parties. The KIO together with 12 other ethnic groups demanded amendments of the draft to be more in line with a federal democratic system and to give autonomy to states (Zaw Oo &amp; Win Min 2007).

The seventeen-year ceasefire broke down and fighting between the Kachin Independence Organization and the government resumed in June 2011 after the Kachin Independent Army disallowed the government&#x27;s order to transform into a Border Guard Force and it claimed that the regime&#x27;s 2008 Constitution lacked federal democratic principles and equal political rights for ethnic minorities based on the Panglong Agreement. Renewed fighting between the Kachin Independence Army and the Burmese army began on 9 June 2011 at Ta-pein hydropower plan and continued throughout 2012. Initial reports suggested that from June to September 2011 a total of 5,580 Internally Displaced Persons from 1,397 households arrived at 38 IDP camps under Myanmar Government control. In August 2012 thousands of Kachin refugees were forced by the Chinese Government back into Myanmar despite the continued fighting there; NGOs like Human Rights Watch called to cease such action and pointed the illegality of doing so under international law. As of 9 October 2012, over 100,000 IDPs are taking shelter in various camps across Kachin State. The majority of IDPs (est. 70,000) are currently sheltering in KIA controlled territory. Fatality estimates were difficult to estimate but most reports suggested that between government troops, Kachin Independence Army rebels, and civilians upwards of 1,000 people had died in the conflict.

Even though many Kachins were already displaced internally, only around 150,000 people are reported as IDPs. The Kachins are currently the major target for the Burmese government, yet relatively few Kachins have chosen to resettle in countries such as the United States or Australia, in comparison to other Myanmar ethnic minorities, such as the Karens and Chins.

==Government==
The Kachin State Government consists of an executive (Kachin State Government), a legislature (Kachin State Hluttaw), and a judiciary.

==Demographics==

===Religion===
According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Buddhists, who make up 64.0% of Kachin State&#x27;s population, form the largest religious community there. Religious minority communities include Christians (33.8%), Muslims (1.6%), Hindus (0.4%), and animists (0.2%) who collectively comprise the remainder of Kachin State&#x27;s population. 2.8% of the population listed no religion, other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee&#x27;s 2016 statistics, 7,966 Buddhist monks were registered in Kachin State, comprising 1.5% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (95.3%), followed by the Shwegyin Nikaya (4.7%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 1,103 thilashin were registered in Kachin State, comprising 1.8% of Myanmar&#x27;s total thilashin community.

===Language===
Burmese and Jingpho are lingua francas of Kachin State. Since Burma achieved independence in 1948, significant numbers of Burmese speakers have settled in Kachin State, which has accelerated a language shift from Jingpho to Burmese. Other Kachin tribes speak and write their own language: the Zaiwa, the Rawang, and the Lisu, who speak both the Lisu language and the Lipo language. English is also widely spoken as a working language.

===Ethnicity===
The ethnic data from the 2014 census is available only with the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) and not released to the public. As of the 1983 Census, the ethnic composition was Bamar: 29.3%, Shan: 24.2% and Kachin: 38.1%. In a speech delivered on 2016, Min Aung Hlaing gave the ethnic composition of the Kachin state as follows: Bamar – 29.2%, Shan – 23.6%, Jingphaw – 18.97%, Lisu – 7%, Rawam – 5%, Lawwaw – 3.33%, Lacheik – 2.89%, Zaikwa – 1.57% and Others – 8%.

==Economy==

The economy of Kachin State is predominantly agricultural. The main products include rice, teak, sugarcane, opium. Mineral products include gold, jade, and rare-earth elements. Hpakant is well known for its jade mines. Bhamo is one of the border trading points between China and Myanmar. A significant amount of legal and illegal cross-border trade along the China–Myanmar border passes through Kachin State, through border posts operated by both the central government (e.g., Lweje) and ethnic armed organisations (e.g., Laiza and Kanpaikti).

===Jade mining===
Over 600 tons of jade stones, which were unearthed from Lone-Khin area in Hpakant Township in Kachin State, had been displayed in Myanmar Naypyidaw to be sold in November 2011. Most of the jade stones extracted in Myanmar, 25,795 tons in 2009–10 and 32,921 tons in 2008–09, are from Kachin State. The largest jade stone in the world, 3000 tons, 21 metres long, 4.8 metres wide and 10.5 metres high was found in Hpakant in 2000. The Myanmar government pays little attention to the deterioration of environment in Kachin because of jade mining. There has been erosion, flooding and mudslides. Several houses are destroyed every year.

===Hydropower===
In 2006, the Prime Minister General Thein Sein made an agreement with the China Power Investment Cooperation in Beijing to build seven dams in Kachin State. The controversial construction project of a huge 1,055 megawatt hydroelectric power plant dam, the Myitsone Dam, is ongoing. It is funded by China Power Investment Cooperation. When completed, the dam will measure 152 metre high and the electricity produced will be sold to China. This project displaced about 15,000 people and is one of 7 projects planned for the Irrawaddy River.

===Rare earth mining===
Kachin State is the world&#x27;s largest source of rare earths, which are critical in the supply chains of many multinational corporations, including Tesla and General Motors. In 2021, China imported of rare earths from Myanmar in December 2021, exceeding 20,000 tonnes. Rare earths were discovered near Pang War in Chipwi Township in the late 2010s.

As China has shut down domestic mines due to the severe environmental impact, it has largely outsourced rare earth mining to Kachin State. Chinese companies and miners illegally set up operations in Kachin State without government permits, and instead circumvent the central government by working with a Border Guard Force militia under the Tatmadaw, formerly known as the New Democratic Army – Kachin, which has profited from this extractive industry. Mining operations also began in areas controlled by the Kachin Independence Organisation in 2022.

Rare earth mining has contaminated and polluted the local environment, including waterways and forests, and eroded mountainous landscapes, and impacted the health of locals. Since the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, mining of rare earths in Kachin State has accelerated, due to lack of proper oversight. Land has also been seized from locals to conduct mining operations. , 2,700 mining collection pools scattered across 300 separate locations were found in Kachin State, encompassing the area of Singapore, and an exponential increase from 2016.

==Transportation==
Kachin State is served by the following airports:
*Bhamo Airport
*Myitkyina Airport
*Putao Airport
There is a railroad between Myitkyina and Mandalay (through Sagaing). The train takes 21–30 hours from Mandalay to Myitkyina.

==Education==
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay. It is especially a problem in Kachin State where over 60 years of fighting between the government and insurgents has displaced thousands of people. The following is a summary of the education system in the state.

==Health care==

The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. In general, the health care infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor but is especially worse in remote areas like Kachin State. The following is a summary of the public health care system in the state.

<text>Kayah State (, ), or Karenni State, is a state of Myanmar. Situated in eastern Myanmar, it is bounded on the north by Shan State, on the east by Thailand&#x27;s Mae Hong Son Province, and on the south and west by Kayin State. It lies approximately between 18° 30′ and 19° 55′ north latitude and between 96° 50′ and 97° 50′ east longitude. The area is . Its capital is Loikaw (also spelt Loi-kaw). The estimated population in the 2014 Myanmar Census was 286,738, the smallest among Myanmar&#x27;s seven states. It is inhabited primarily by the Karenni ethnic group, also known as Red Karen or Kayah, a Sino-Tibetan people.

==Geography==
Karenni (Kayah) State is located in the eastern part of Myanmar. The relief of Karenni (Kayah) State is mountainous with the Dawna Range and the Karen Hills also known as &quot;Karenni-Karen&quot; mountains separated by the Salween River as it flows through Karenni (Kayah) State. Balu Chaung flows from Inle Lake to Than Lwin River and converges with the Salween in southern Karenni (Kayah) State.

Lawpita Dam, built in 1950 as a bilateral reparation agreement with Japan, is a major hydroelectric production dam that produces a quarter of the total hydroelectric power generation in Myanmar.

==History==
===19th century and British rule===

Karenni States is the name formerly given to a group of states that included Kantarawadi, Kyebogyi and Bawlake. These states were located south of the Federated Shan States and east of British Burma. According to the 1930 census, the states had a total population of 58,761 with Kantarawadi (), 30,677, Kyebogyi (), 14,282 and Bawlake (), 13,802.

The British government recognised and guaranteed the independence of the Karenni States in an 1875 treaty June 21st with Burmese King Mindon Min, by which both parties recognised the area as belonging neither to Konbaung Burma nor to Great Britain. Consequently, the Karenni States were never fully incorporated into British Burma. The Karenni States were recognised as tributary to British Burma in 1892, when their rulers agreed to accept a stipend from the British government. In the 1930s, the Mawchi Mine in Bawlake was the most important source of tungsten in the world.

===Independence to 1988===

The Constitution of the Union of Burma in 1947 proclaimed that the three Karenni States be amalgamated into a single constituent state of the union, called Karenni State. It also provided for the possibility of secession from the Union after 10 years.

After this the Bamar government invaded Karenni State and in 1948 August 9th, the Karenni leader U Bee Htu Re started the resistance against the Invading Bamar government and military dictatorship which continues till the present day to regain freedom, self-determination, and to allow Karenni people to live in peaceful harmony with the environment on their own land. Therefore, the 9th August is called &quot;Karenni Resistance Day&quot;.

In September 8th 1948, the Karenni leader U Bee Htu Re was assassinated by central government militia for his opposition to the inclusion of the Karenni States in the Union of Burma. Therefore, the date of 8th September is called &quot;Karenni Martyr&#x27;s Day&quot;.

In 1952, the former Shan state of Mong Pai (1901. pop - 19,351) was added to Karenni State, and the whole renamed Kayah State, possibly with the intent of driving a wedge between the Karenni (in Kayah State) and the rest of the Karen people (in Karen State), both fighting for independence.

In 1957, pro-independence groups already active in the area formed the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), backed by its own army, the Karenni Army (KA). Apart from a brief ceasefire in 1995, the KA has been fighting ever since. Rivals to the KNPP include the leftist Kayan New Land Party (KNLP), and the Karenni National People&#x27;s Liberation Front (KNPLF), both of which are now allied with the Myanmar military.

===1988–2021===
In 1996, Myanmar&#x27;s State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) stepped up its campaign to crush Karenni independence with a population transfer program, forcibly moving villagers to designated relocation sites to deprive the pro-independence forces of bases of support. The Myanmar government has been accused of massive human rights violations in the region.

In June 2019, six young Karenni protesters were arrested after being sued by the Kayah State government for calling Chief Minister L Phaung Sho a &quot;traitor&quot; to Karennis due to a statue of Gen. Aung San being erected in Loikaw, the state capital.

In September 2020, Sho was impeached by the state&#x27;s parliament and subsequently removed as chief minister by President Win Myint due to his misuse of state funds, with Boss Ko appointed as acting chief minister in his stead.

===Post-2021===
In the context of the ongoing post-coup civil war, on 7 November 2023, the Karenni National People&#x27;s Liberation Front, Karenni Army, and Karenni Nationalities Defence Force launched a military offensive known as Operation 1107 against the ruling State Administration Council junta. An additional offensive, known as Operation 1111, started on 11 November 2023 with the aim of capturing Loikaw.
In an interview with &quot;The Irrawaddy&quot; on 28 November, the KNDF&#x27;s deputy commander-in-chief Marwi () claimed that the anti-junta forces controlled 80% of Kayah state and had control over half of Loikaw, where an interim Karenni state government was being established to replace the junta installed state government which had collapsed.

==Demographics==
Ethnographers classify anywhere from seven to ten ethnic groups (not including ethnic sub-groups) as native to Kayah State. In addition, Shan, Intha, and Bamar live in the north and Pa-O in surrounding hills. Each group is also known by more than one name. Clearly, ethnicity in Kayah State is a complex issue, made more complex by the current political situation. According to the 1983 census conducted by United Nations and the Burmese government, the Kayah composed 56.12%, while Bamar (17.58%), Shan (16.66%), Karen (6.45%), mixed races (2.08%), and other groups formed minorities. Ethnolinguists distinguish the following linguistic groups in Kayah State:
# Karenni (Red people)
# Padaung (Kayan)
# Bwe
# Geba
# Manumanaw (Kayaw)
# Yantale
# Zayein (Kayăn Lahta)
# Geko (Kayăn Kakhong)
# Yinbaw (Kayăn Kangan)
# Paku (Karen)

===Religion===
According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Buddhists, who make up 49.9% of Kayah State&#x27;s population, form the largest religious community there. Minority religious communities include Christians (45.8%), Muslims (1.1%), Hindus (0.1%), and animists (1.9%) who collectively comprise the remainder of Kayah State&#x27;s population. 1.2% of the population listed no religion, other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee’s 2016 statistics, 2060 Buddhist monks were registered in Kayah State, comprising 0.4% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (82.4%), followed by Shwegyin Nikaya (17.6%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 303 thilashin were registered in Kayah State, comprising 0.5% of Myanmar’s total thilashin community.

The Kayans&#x27; traditional religion is called Kan Khwan, and has been practised since the people migrated from Mongolia during the Bronze Age. It includes the belief that the Kayan people are the result of a union between a female dragon and a male human/angel hybrid.

The major religious festival is the three-day Kay Htein Bo festival, which commemorates the belief that the creator god gave form to the world by planting a small post in the ground. During this festival, held in late March or early April, a Kay Htoe Boe pole is erected and participants dance around the pole. This festival is held to venerate the eternal god and creator messengers, to give thanks for blessings during the year, to appeal for forgiveness, and pray for rain. It is also an opportunity for Kayan from different villages to come together to maintain the solidarity of the tribe.

The Kayan have a strong belief in augury and nothing is done without reference to some form of divination, including breaking thatch grass, but most importantly consulting the chicken bones.
Nowadays the annual Kay Htein Bo festival is always accompanied by a reading of the chicken bones to predict the year ahead. Fowl bone prognostication can be witnessed in the Kayan villages in Thailand&#x27;s Mae Hong Son province during the annual festival and during “Cleansing Ceremonies” which are held when a family has encountered misfortune. Dreams are also used to make predictions.

==Politics==
As with many other states in Myanmar, which have ethnic minority populations, Kayah state has experienced human rights abuses by the Burmese military junta and the Burmese armed forces.
Villagers live under the constant threat of rape, beatings, arbitrary arrest or execution, conscription as slave labour for the Myanmar army, and having their food and possessions taken without compensation.

&quot;The SPDC also arbitrarily closes roads for non-military travel in Karenni State,
further restricting villagers movements. Landmines are often planted along roads to prohibit the villagers&#x27; movements. Villagers, fearful of landmines and potential injuries, further restrict their own movements.

Even with a valid travel pass villagers are still vulnerable to abuses and exploitation. There have been reports of arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings and rapes of villagers who have had permission to travel. Villagers have also been shot at when they have been outside of their communities.&quot;

It has also been alleged that the relocation centers have inadequate access to water, food, medical services, and educational facilities. As of April 2024, more than 80% of the state&#x27;s population is classified as internally displaced. Thousands of Karenni people are in refugee camps in Thailand.

&quot;Currently there are 4,800 IDPs in eight forced relocation sites throughout Karenni
State. These relocation sites are a result of the Burmese military regimes mass
relocation program in Karenni State in 1996. Following the collapse of the
ceasefire between SLORC and the KNPP, tens of thousands of people were
forcibly evicted from their homes during this program.

&quot;Most relocation sites are located close to military camps, army bases and along
main roads. This increases the vulnerability of exploitation and abuse. IDPs are
subjected to force labour demands from the soldiers and arbitrary taxation
(essentially theft). IDPs are also vulnerable to torture; murder and rape by soldiers
and their movements are heavily restricted.

&quot;The relocation sites are also inadequate to sustain a healthy and economically
viable livelihood. The majority of relocation sites do not have sanitation facilities,
electricity or access to safe drinking water. The land surrounding the sites is
often barren and over populated. As productive land has usually been claimed by
the original inhabitants or confiscated by the soldiers, opportunities to farm are
limited. There are also very few employment opportunities in forced relocation
sites.&quot;
==Administration==
The state capital is Loikaw. The state is divided into 4 districts which are divided into 7 townships with 106 wards and villages.

==Transport==
Kayah State is served by Loikaw Airport and Loikaw Train station

==Economy==

Kayah State has a primarily extraction-based economy. The main crop is rice, mostly irrigated, with other important crops including millet, maize, sesame, groundnut, garlic, and vegetables. Mineral products include alabaster, tin, and tungsten. Valuable woods such as teak and pine were once produced, but the forests have largely been stripped bare by illegal logging authorised by the Tatmadaw (Burmese military). The hydroelectric power plant at Lawpita Falls outside of Loikaw is of strategic importance, as it supplies over 20% of Myanmar&#x27;s total electrical power.

Kayah State has theoretical tourist potential, if the political situation is resolved. The state has rugged mountains, river streams, lakes and waterfalls; however, transport and communication are difficult. At present, Kayah State is open to outsiders by permit only, which can be difficult to obtain depending on the current military situation. Even with a permit, usually only a radius around Loikaw is allowed. The central government effectively controls only Loikaw and parts of the western half of the state.
16 January 2012

As of 2018, the state is the most electrified in Myanmar, at 87%.

==Education==

* Loikaw University
* Technological University, Loikaw
* Computer University, Loikaw
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay. According to official statistics, Kayah State has the lowest number of public schools in the country. Loikaw University is the state&#x27;s main university.

==Health care==
Kayah State, most of Myanmar, has poor health care facilities due to the alleged mismanagement by the Burmese military junta and economic sanctions by the US government. Although health care is nominally free, in reality patients have to pay for medicine and treatment even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. As Kayah State is perhaps the most isolated state in Myanmar, it has great difficulties in addressing health concerns.
In 2016, Loikaw General Hospital was upgraded with the 1.945 billion yen funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The following is a summary of the public health care system in the state.

<text>Rakhine State (; Rakhine and , , ), formerly known as Arakan State, is a state in Myanmar (Burma). Situated on the western coast, it is bordered by Chin State to the north, Magway Region, Bago Region and Ayeyarwady Region to the east, the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Chattogram Division of Bangladesh to the northwest. It is located approximately between latitudes 17°30&#x27; north and 21°30&#x27; north and longitudes 92°10&#x27; east and 94°50&#x27; east. The Arakan Mountains or Rakhine Yoma separated Rakhine State from central Burma from North to South. Off the coast of Rakhine State there are some fairly large islands such as Ramree, Cheduba and Myingun. Rakhine State has an area of and its capital is Sittwe (formerly known as Akyab).

==Names==

The state was historically known as Arakan in English until the Burmese government adopted the English name Rakhine in 1989.
==History==


The history of the region of Arakan (now renamed Rakhine State) can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into the Dhanyawadi, Waithali, Laymro and Mrauk U. Mrauk U was conquered by the Konbaung dynasty of Burma in 1784–85, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongside Tanintharyi) was ceded to the British East India Company as war reparations by the Burmese. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma in British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part of the newly independent state.

===Independent kingdom===
Beginning in the 400s, the Pyus and Kanyans of Tibeto-Burman people began migrating westward, crossing the Arakan Mountains and settling in what is now Rakhine State. By the 1100s, they had consolidated control of the region, becoming a tributary state of the Pagan Empire until the 13th century. Over time, these Tibeto-Burmans mixed with Indo-Aryans and formed a distinct cultural identity, eventually becoming the Rakhine people (also known as the Arakanese).

According to Arakanese legend, the first recorded kingdom was founded by the Sakya clan of Buddha who are ancient Hindus Indo-aryans, centred around the northern town of Dhanyawadi, arose in the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famed Mahamuni Buddha image was cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Arakan from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Arakan culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains than its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Lemyo River as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.

After its partial dominance by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate and Bengal Sultanate, the final Kingdom of Mrauk U was founded in 1429 by Min Saw Mon. It is seen by the Arakanese people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade. The Kingdom of Mrauk-U went on to conquer Chittagong with the help of the Portuguese. The country steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss of Chittagong to the Mughal Empire. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakan.

===Burmese rule===
On 2 January 1785, the internally divided kingdom fell to invading forces of the Konbaung dynasty. The Mahamuni Image was taken away by the Burmese Forces as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by the Presidency armies and awarded to an Indian soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in the 2nd Battalion of the Bengal Army, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a temple at village Nadrai near Kasganj town in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh India. In the Treaty of Yandabo (1826), which ended hostilities, Burma ceded Arakan alongside Tanintharyi (Tenasserim) to British India. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period.

=== British rule ===
Rakhine was the centre of multiple insurgencies which fought against British rule, notably led by the monks U Ottama and U Seinda. During the Second World War, Rakhine was given autonomy under the Japanese occupation of Burma and was even granted its own army known as the Arakan Defense Force. The Arakan Defense Force went over to the allies and turned against the Japanese in early 1945. Rakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably the Arakan Campaign 1942–43 and the Battle of Ramree Island.
===Burmese independence===

In 1948, Rakhine became a division within the Union of Burma, and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement for secession and restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under General Ne Win constituted &quot;Rakhine State&quot; from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of the Rakhine people.

===2010 onwards (after 2008 constitution)===
Since 2010, Rakhine state has had two chief ministers: Hla Maung Tin and Major General Maung Maung Ohn. Hla Maung Tin ( January 2011 – 20 June 2014) was an elected Rakhine State Hluttaw member representing USDP from Ann Township in 2010 general election. He resigned from the post after recurrent intense inter-communal conflicts between Muslims and Rakhine ethnic groups in 2012–14. In 2014, he was replaced by Major General Maung Maung Ohn (30 June 2014 – present). Ohn was Deputy Minister for Border Affairs and head of the Rakhine State&#x27;s Emergency Coordination Center before he was named to become a military-appointed Rakhine State Hluttaw member by Election Commission on 21 June 2014. His appointment as Chief Minister was formalised on 30 June 2014 although Arakan National Party opposed it.

===2012 Rakhine State riots===

The 2012 Rakhine State riots were a series of conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists who are majority in the Rakhine State. Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines (who were a large majority) that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state. The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including the death of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines and murder of a Rakhine by Rohingyas.
From both sides, whole villages were &quot;decimated&quot;. According to the Burmese authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and up to 140,000 people have been displaced. The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, a state of emergency was declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region. Rohingya NGOs overseas have accused the Burmese army and police of targeting Rohingya Muslims through arrests and participating in violence. However, an in-depth research conducted by the International Crisis Group shows that both communities are grateful for the protection provided by the military. A number of monks&#x27; organisations have taken measures to block aid from NGOs that help Rohingyas. In July 2012, the Burmese Government did not include the Rohingya minority group in the census and classified them as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982. About 140,000 Rohingya in Burma remain confined in IDP camps.
The official of the United Nations and Human Rights Watch have described the persecution of the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing. The UN human rights envoy to Myanmar reported &quot;the long history of discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya community could amount to crimes against humanity&quot;, and there have been warnings of an unfolding genocide. Yanghee Lee, the UN special investigator on Myanmar, believes the country wants to expel its entire Rohingya population.

===Resurgence of armed conflict (2016–present)===
As of December 2024, the State Administration Council junta stably possesses only Sittwe Township, Kyaukpyu Township, and Munaung Township. The rest of Rakhine State is either controlled by the Arakan Army, or heavily contested.

===Political repression by the Myanmar government===
The NLD government refused to share executive power at state level after the Arakan National Party won a majority of votes in Rakhine State in the 2015 election. The Arakanese repeatedly complained that their proposals in parliament are frequently rejected or not addressed.

On 16 January 2018, thousands of Mrauk U residents staged a protest after officials banned a memorial event to mark the 233rd anniversary of the end of the Mrauk U kingdom. Local police opened fire on the crowd, killing seven and wounding 12. Two speakers of the event-Aye Maung, a prominent Rakhine politician, was charged under section 17(1) of Unlawful Associations Act and Sections 121 and 505 of the Penal Code, which relate to high treason and incitement and Wai Hun Aung, a Sittwe-based activist, was filed with public mischief charges under the Penal Code. Eight rakhine youths who were wounded in the protest were detained and charged under Article 6 (1) for allegedly destroying government property and public asset.

In 2017, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and the Tatmadaw rejected national-level political dialogue, which was a mandatory step of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), where regional stakeholders discuss suggestions at large-scale public consultations, the results of which are shared by representatives at the Union Peace Conference or 21st Century Panglong, to be held in Rakhine State. In February 2017, the Arakan Liberation Party—which is one of eight NCA signatories—proposed holding ethnic-based national-level political dialogue in Rakhine State, but Aung San Suu Kyi turned down the request, saying the ALP was not yet ready. The ALP made necessary preparations and submitted letters three times to request approval to hold the dialogue, but the government did not reply, and at the Joint Implementation Coordination Meeting (JICM) Aung San Suu Kyi again declined the request, citing sensitive issues involving the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State.

The Union Election Committee (UEC) announced on 16 October 2020 that the 2020 Myanmar general election would not be held in the townships of Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, Rathedaung, Buthidaung, Maung Daw, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Myebon, Mrauk U; two quarters and 52 village tracts within Kyaukphyu Township, three quarters and 29 village tracts within Ann Township, four quarters within Sittwe Township, and ten quarters and 52 village tracts within Toungup Township. The UEC argued that holding a free and fair election would not be possible in the townships due to ongoing violence. With the exception of Toungup Township, Rakhine ethnic parties are overwhelmingly dominant in these townships. The Rakhine Nationalities Development Party (RNDP) and Arakan National Party (ANP) won a majority of the seats in these townships the in 2010 and 2015 general elections. An estimated 1.2 million people in Rakhine State subsequently lost their voting rights.

===2019 internet shutdown===
The government of Myanmar authorised the shutdown of internet services in nine townships on 21 June 2019, including Ponnangyun, Kyauktaw, Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Rathedaung, Mrauk U, Minbya, and Myebon in Rakhine State, as well as Paletwa in Chin State.

The restriction was lifted in five of nine townships in September 2019: four in Rakhine State – Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Rathedaung and Myebon – and one township in Chin State, Paletwa. However, the restriction was re-imposed in those five townships in February 2020.

Around 100 students gathered in Yangon on 22 February 2020 and demanded an end to the internet cut-off in Rakhine and Chin states, where civilian casualties are mounting as government troops battle ethnic rebels, the Arakan Army. A case has been filed, on nine students who organised the protest, under section 19 of the Peaceful Assembly Law, which outlaws unauthorised assemblies and carries a maximum six-month prison sentence.

Internet services were restored in Maungdaw Township on 1 May 2020.

On 1 August 2020, 2G internet services were permitted in the remaining seven townships – Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Mrauk U,
Myebon, Ponnagyun and Rathedaung Townships in Rakhine State and Paletwa Township in Chin State. However, 3G and 4G services remained restricted.

On 2 February 2021, a day after the Tatmadaw seized power in a coup d&#x27;état, mobile internet services were restored in those eight townships in Rakhine State and Chin State. 

=== 2020 - Present ===

In November 2020, the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army (AA) reached an informal ceasefire, leading to a temporary reduction in hostilities in Rakhine State. However, after the military coup in February 2021, clashes resumed in the region. 

Following the military coup in February 2021, Rakhine State experienced intensified armed conflicts, particularly between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Arakan Army (AA). By September 2021, the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA), had gained control over roughly 75% of Rakhine’s townships.

In early 2024, the battle for the border town of Maungdaw resulted in heavy fighting, leading to numerous civilian casualties and displacements. Reports indicate that during this period, civilians, including the Rohingya population, were subjected to coordinated killings, large-scale arson attacks, and shelling. Notably, on August 5, 2024, an attack in Maungdaw targeted Rohingya civilians attempting to flee by boat, resulting in numerous deaths. 

On October 27, 2023, Operation 1027 was launched by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, consisting of the Arakan Army (AA), the Ta&#x27;ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). The offensive led to the capture of over 130 military outposts and strategic bases in northern Shan State, including the key border town of Laukkai. Reports indicated significant losses for the Myanmar military, with hundreds of soldiers killed and over 4,000 troops, including senior officers, surrendering. 

By February 2025, a CSIS report indicated that the Arakan Army had begun establishing local governments in the Rakhine townships under its control. However, little is known about their governance structure or the inclusion of non-Arakan ethnic groups. It remains unclear whether the AA will halt military operations after securing its claimed territory, as its offensives in Paletwa, Magway, and other areas suggest broader territorial ambitions. The group&#x27;s stance on Myanmar’s political future is also uncertain, while it previously sought autonomy under the 2018 constitution like the United Wa State Army, it may now pursue full statehood or independence.

==Demographics==

Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan Province), like many parts of Burma, has a diverse ethnic population. Official Burmese figures state Arakan State&#x27;s population as 3,118,963.

The ethnic Rakhine make up the majority, followed by a considerable population of Rohingya Muslims. The Rakhine reside mainly in the lowland valleys as well as Ramree and Manaung (Cheduba) islands. A number of other ethnic minorities like the Thet, Kamein, Chin, Mro, Chakma, Khami, Daingnet, Bengali Hindu and Maramagri inhabit mainly in the hill regions of the state.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee&#x27;s 2016 statistics, 12,943 Buddhist monks were registered in Rakhine State, comprising 2.4% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (88.9%), followed by Shwegyin Nikaya (3.9%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 534 thilashin were registered in Rakhine State, comprising 0.9% of Myanmar&#x27;s total thilashin community.

The Rakhine are traditionally Theravada Buddhists. As per the 1983 Census, 98.63% of the Rakhine in Rakhine State were Buddhist and another 1.19% were Muslim. The Chin were the 3rd largest ethnic group, contributing 4% of the population in the 1983 Census. At that time, out of the 64,404 Chin in Rakhine, 55.76% were Buddhist and 33.79% were Animist. Muslims constituted more than 80–96% of the population near the border with Bangladesh and the coastal areas. As per the 1983 Census, 99.82% of the Rohingya, 99.24% of the &quot;Other foreigners&quot;, 89.20% of the &quot;Mixed races&quot;, 85.50% of the Indians and 67.51% of the &quot;Pakistanis&quot; in Rakhine state were Muslims.

==Administrative divisions==

Rakhine State consists of seven districts, as below, showing areas and officially estimated populations in 2002:
* Maungdaw (3,538 km2; 763,844 people)
* Sittwe (12,504 km2; 1,099,568 people)
* Mrauk-U (recently created out of Sittwe District)
* Kyaukpyu (9,984 km2; 458,244 people)
* Ann (NA km2; NA people) 
* Taungup (NA km2; NA people) 
* Thandwe (10,753 km2; 296,736 people)
* Total Rakhine State: 36,778 km2; 2,915,000 people

Combined, these districts have a total of 17 townships and 1,164 village-tracts. Sittwe is the capital of the state.

==Transport==
Few roads cross the Arakan Mountains from central Burma to Rakhine State. The three highways that do are the Ann to Munbra (Minbya in Burmese pronunciation) road in central Rakhine, the Toungup to Pamtaung road in south central Rakhine, and the Gwa to Ngathaingchaung road in far southern Rakhine. Air travel still is the usual mode of travel from Yangon and Mandalay to Sittwe and Ngapali, the popular beach resort. Only in 1996 was a highway from Sittwe to the mainland constructed. The state still does not have a rail line (although Myanmar Railways has announced a 480-km rail extension to Sittwe from Pathein via Ponnagyun-Kyauttaw-Mrauk U-Minbya-Ann).

The airports in Rakhine State are
* Sittwe Airport
* Kyaukpyu Airport
* Thandwe Airport
* Ann Airport
* Manaung Airport

With Chinese investment, a deep sea port has been constructed in Kyaukphyu to facilitate the transport of natural gas and crude oil from the Indian Ocean to China without passing through Strait of Malacca.

Rivers useful for transportation in Rakhine are
* Naf River
* Kaladan River
* Lemro River
* Mayu River
==Economy==
Rakhine is one of the poorest states in Myanmar. Over 69% of the population live in poverty.

Rice is the main crop in the region, occupying around 85% of the total agricultural land. Coconut and nipa palm plantations are also important. Fishing is a major industry, with most of the catch transported to Yangon, but some is also exported. Wood products such as timber, bamboo and fuel wood are extracted from the mountains. Small amounts of inferior-grade crude oil are produced from primitive, shallow, hand-dug wells, but there is yet unexplored potential for petroleum and natural gas production.

Tourism is slowly being developed. The ruins of the ancient royal town Mrauk U and the beach resorts of Ngapali are the major attractions for foreign visitors, but facilities are still primitive, and the transportation infrastructure is still rudimentary.

While most places in Myanmar have chronic power shortages, in rural states like Rakhine the problem is greater. In 2009, the electricity consumption of a state of 3 million people was 30 MW, or 1.8% of the country&#x27;s total generation capacity. In December 2009, the military government added three more hydropower plants, Saidin, Thahtay Chaung and Laymromyit, at a cost of over US$800 million. The three plants together can produce 687 megawatts, with surplus electricity distributed to other states and divisions. 

Additionally, as of November 2024, reports indicate that over 2 million people in Rakhine State are at risk of famine due to reduced food production and ongoing conflicts. Without urgent action, it is predicted that 95% of the population will regress into survival mode.

== Global Interests ==

===China===
China considers Rakhine State as a strategic interest. Rakhine State hosts several major Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, including the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port and oil and gas pipelines. This region serves as an important land and maritime route, allowing China access to the Indian Ocean and reducing its dependence on the Strait of Malacca.

Myanmar also acts as a buffer state for China in managing Western and Indian influence in Southeast Asia. Despite international criticism, China has maintained close relations with Myanmar&#x27;s military while also engaging with major ethnic armed organizations (EAOs). Given its significant economic and political interests, China expects any governing authority in Rakhine State, including the Arakan Army and its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA), to ensure the security of Chinese investments. 

=== India ===
India sees Myanmar as an important partner under its &quot;Act East&quot; policy, which aims to improve connectivity and strengthen India&#x27;s influence in Southeast Asia. India’s main concerns include ensuring stability in its northeastern states and balancing China&#x27;s growing presence in Myanmar. India has invested in strategic projects such as the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.

Like China, India also maintains flexible diplomacy by engaging with both Myanmar’s military government and EAOs operating near its borders, including the AA. The AA could seek stronger ties with India by emphasizing shared security interests and economic cooperation. This could include protecting India’s infrastructure projects in Rakhine State and proposing trade or development initiatives that align with India’s regional ambitions. Some Indian policymakers may see the AA as a potential counterweight to China’s influence in Myanmar’s coastal regions.

=== Others ===
The United States and European countries may support Rakhine state&#x27;s political aspirations if it aligns with their broader goals of democracy and human rights. If the AA establishes a governance model in the state that reflects democratic principles, it could attract diplomatic engagement from Western nations. However, shifts in U.S. political leadership and global trends in democratic governance may affect the level of support and engagement.

Bangladesh, which shares a border with Rakhine State, is primarily concerned about stability and potential refugee movements. The country hosts around one million Rohingya refugees who fled Rakhine State, and it has expressed interest in their safe return. Bangladesh’s stance on the Rakhine state depends on how it addresses Rohingya-related issues.

==Education==
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay. The following is a summary of the public school system in the state in academic year 2013–2014. 
Sittwe University is the main university in the state.

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. In general, the health care infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor but is worse in remote areas like Rakhine State. The entire Rakhine State has fewer hospital beds than the Yangon General Hospital. The following is a summary of the public health care system in the state.

<text>Shan State (, ; , ) is a state of Myanmar. Shan State borders China (Yunnan) to the north, Laos (Louang Namtha and Bokeo Provinces) to the east, and Thailand (Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son Provinces) to the south, and five administrative divisions of Myanmar in the west. The largest of the 14 administrative divisions by land area, Shan State covers 155,800 km2, almost a quarter of the total area of Myanmar. The state gets its name from the Burmese name for the Tai peoples: &quot;Shan people&quot;. The Tai (Shan) constitute the majority among several ethnic groups that inhabit the area. Shanland is largely rural, with only three cities of significant size: Lashio, Kengtung, and the capital, Taunggyi. Taunggyi is 150.7 km northeast of the nation&#x27;s capital Naypyitaw.

The Shan state, with many ethnic groups, is home to several armed ethnic groups. While the military government has signed ceasefire agreements with most groups, vast areas of the state, especially those east of the Salween River, remain outside the central government&#x27;s control, and in recent years have come under heavy ethnic-Han Chinese economic and political influence. Other areas are under the control of military groups such as the Shan State Army.

According to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Shan State is the region that produces the most opium in Myanmar, though production has declined in recent years.

== Names and etymology ==
Muang Tai (Shan: ) is the native name for the region as well as a term used for the Tai-inhabited parts of Myanmar outside of Shan State. &quot;Muang&quot; (မိူင်း) means country in Tai languages and is used before the names of other countries, e.g. &quot;Muang Maan&quot; (Myanmar).

Shan Pyi () derives from a Burmese corruption of the name &quot;Siam&quot; which is an old name for Lower Thailand. &quot;Pyi&quot; is a Burmese word meaning country and thus &quot;Shan Pyi&quot; can be translated as Shan State. Officially, the region is called &quot;Shan State&quot; in English and &quot;Shan Pyine&quot; in Burmese but the &quot;ne&quot; in often dropped in colloquial speech.

Lanjao (Shan: လၢၼ်ႉၸဝ်ႈ) or Nanzhao is a classical name for a kingdom which included most of the land that makes up modern Shan State. Lanjao, alongside &quot;Muang Tai&quot; are often used in political and nationalist dialogue when referring to the region.

==History==


Shan State is the unitary successor state to the Burmese Shan States, the princely states that were under some degree of control of the Irrawaddy valley-based Burmese kingdoms.

Historical Tai-Mao states extended well beyond the Burmese Shan States, ranging from full-fledged kingdoms of Assam in the northwest to Lan Xang in the east, to Lan Na and Ayutthaya in the southeast, as well as several petty princely states in between, covering present-day northern Chin State, northern Sagaing Region, Kachin State, Kayah State in Myanmar as well as Laos, Thailand and the southwestern part of Yunnan, China. The definition of Burmese Shan States does not include the Ava Kingdom and the Hanthawaddy Kingdom of the 13th to 16th centuries, although the founders of these kingdoms were Burmanized Shans and Monized Shans, respectively.

===Early history===
The founding of Shan States inside the present-day boundaries of Burma began during the Pagan Kingdom in the Shan Hills and accelerated after 1287, when the Pagan Kingdom fell to the Mongols. The Tai people, who came south with the Mongols, stayed, and quickly came to dominate much of northern to the eastern arc of Burma—from northwestern Sagaing Division to Kachin Hills to the present-day Shan Hills. The most powerful Shan states were Mong Yang (Mohnyin) and Mong Kawng (Mogaung) in present-day Kachin State, followed by Hsenwi (Theinni), Hsipaw (Thibaw) and Mong Mit (Momeik) in present-day northern Shan State. Smaller Shan states, such as Kale in northwestern Sagaing Division, Bhamo in Kachin State, Yawnghwe (Nyaungshwe) and Kengtung (Kyaingtong) in Shan State, and Mong Pai (Mobye) in Kayah State, played a precarious game of paying allegiance to more powerful states, sometimes simultaneously.

The newly founded Shan States were multi-ethnic, and included other ethnic minorities such as the Chin, the Kachin, the Wa, the Ta&#x27;ang, the Lisu, the Lahu, the Pa O, and the Kayah. Although Burmanised Shans founded the Ava Kingdom that ruled central Burma, other Shan states, Mohnyin in particular, constantly raided Ava territories throughout the years. A Mohnyin-led Confederation of Shan States finally conquered Ava in 1527.

===Toungoo and Konbaung periods (1555–1885)===
In 1555, King Bayinnaung dislodged Shan king Sithu Kyawhtin from Ava. By 1557 he went on to conquer all of what would become known as the Burmese Shan states under his rule, from the Assamese border in the northwest to those in Kachin Hills and Shan Hills, including the two most powerful Shan states, Mohnyin and Mogaung. The Shan states were reduced to the status of governorships, but the Saophas were permitted to retain their royal regalia and their feudal rights over their own subjects. Bayinnaung introduced Burmese customary law and prohibited all human and animal sacrifices. He also required the sons of Saophas to reside in the Burmese king&#x27;s palace, essentially hostages, in order to ensure the good conduct of their fathers and to receive training in Burmese court life. Burmese kings continued this policy until 1885 when the kingdom fell to the British. (The northernmost Shan states, in Yunnan, had already fallen to the Chinese Ming dynasty by the middle of the 15th century.)

The reach of the Burmese sovereign waxed and waned with the ability of each Burmese monarch. Shan states became briefly independent following the collapse of the first Toungoo dynasty, in 1599. The Restored Toungoo dynasty under King Nyaungyan and King Anaukpetlun recovered the Shan states, including the two strongest—Monhyin and Mogaung by 1605 and Lan Na by 1615. In the early-18th century, the rule of Burmese monarchs declined rapidly and by the 1730s, the northernmost Shan states, many of which had paid dual tribute to China and Burma, had been annexed by the Qing Dynasty of China. The annexed border states ranged from Mogaung and Bhamo in present-day Kachin State to Hsenwi and Kengtung in present-day Shan State to Sipsongpanna (Kyaingyun) in present-day Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan.

In the middle of the 18th century, the Burmese Konbaung dynasty&#x27;s reassertion of the easternmost boundaries of Burmese Shan states led to war with China. It made four separate invasions of Burma from 1765 to 1769, during the Sino-Burmese War. The Burmese success in repelling Chinese forces laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between Burma and China.

The present-day boundary of southern Shan State vis-à-vis Thailand was formed shortly thereafter. Burma lost southern Lan Na (Chiang Mai) in 1776 and northern Lan Na (Chiang Saen) in 1786 to a resurgent Bangkok-based Siam, ending more than two centuries of Burmese suzerainty over the region. It retained only Kengtung on the Burmese side. The southern border of Shan State remained contested in the following years. Siam invaded Kengtung in 1803–1804 and 1852–1854, and Burma invaded Lan Na in 1797 and 1804. Siam occupied Kengtung during World War II (1942–1945).

Throughout the Burmese feudal era, Shan states supplied much manpower in the service of Burmese kings. Without Shan manpower, the Burmans alone would not have been able to achieve their victories in Lower Burma, Siam, and elsewhere. Shans were a major part of Burmese forces in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824–1826, and fought valiantly—a fact that the British commanders acknowledged.

After the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, the Burmese kingdom was reduced to Upper Burma alone. The Shan states—especially that east of the Salween River, were essentially autonomous entities, paying token tribute to the king. In 1875, King Mindon, to avoid certain defeat, ceded Karenni states, long part of Shan states, to the British. When the last king of Burma, Thibaw Min, ascended the throne in 1878, the rule of central government was so weak that Thibaw had to send thousands of troops to tame a rebellion in the Shan state of Mongnai and other eastern Shan states for the remainder of his six-year reign.

===Colonial period (1886–1948)===

On 28 November 1885, the British captured Mandalay, officially ending the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 11 days. But it took until 1890 for the British to subdue all of the various Shan states. Under the British colonial administration, established in 1887, the Shan states were ruled by their saophas as feudatory princely states of the British Crown. The British placed Kachin Hills inside Mandalay Division and northwestern Shan areas under Sagaing Division. In October 1922, the Shan and the Karenni states were merged to create the Federated Shan States, under a commissioner who also administered the Wa States. This arrangement survived the constitutional changes of 1923 and 1937.

During World War II, most of the Shan states were occupied by the Japanese. Chinese Kuomintang forces who illegally entered Burmese territory came down to northeastern Shan states to face the Japanese. Thai forces, allied with the Japanese, occupied Kengtung and surrounding areas in 1942, annexing the territory to the Thai state.

After the war, the British returned, while many Chinese KMT forces stayed inside Burmese Shan states. Negotiations leading to independence at the Panglong Conference in February 1947 secured a unitary Shan State, including former Wa states, but without the Karenni states. More importantly, Shan State gained the right of secession in 10 years from independence.

===Independence (1948–2010)===
Soon after gaining independence in January 1948, the central government led by U Nu faced several armed rebellions. The most serious was the Chinese Nationalist KMT invasion of Shan State in 1950. Driven out by the Chinese Communist forces, Nationalist KMT armies planned to use the region east of the Salween River as a base from which to regain their homeland. In March 1953, the KMT forces, with US assistance, were on the verge of taking the entire Shan State and within a day&#x27;s march of the state capital Taunggyi. The Burmese army drove the invaders east across the Salween, but much of the KMT army and their progeny have remained in the eastern Shan State under various guises to the present day. The Burmese army&#x27;s heavy-handedness fueled resentment.

In 1961, Shan saophas led by Sao Shwe Thaik, the first president of Burma and saopha of Yawnghwe, proposed a new federal system of government for greater autonomy, although the Shans had the constitutional right to secede. Though Shan leaders promised not to exercise the right, the Burmese army led by Gen. Ne Win thought the proposal was secessionist. Gen. Ne Win&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1962 brought an end to the Burmese experiment with democracy and with it, the call for greater autonomy for ethnic minorities. The coup fueled the Shan rebellion, started in 1958 by a small group called &quot;Num Hsük Han&quot; (&#x27;young warriors&#x27;), now joined by the Shan State Army (SSA).

By the early-1960s, eastern Shan State festered with several insurgencies and warlords, and it emerged as a major opium-growing area, part of the so-called Golden Triangle. Narcotics trafficking became a vital source of revenue for all insurgencies. Major forces consisted of the SSA and the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), as well as those of the drug lords Khun Sa, and Lo Hsing Han. By the mid-1960s, CPB had begun receiving open support from China. Thailand also began a decades-long policy of support for non-communist Burmese rebels. Families of insurgent leaders were allowed to live in Thailand, where insurgent armies were free to buy arms, ammunition, and other supplies.

In the late-1980s and 1990s, the military government signed ceasefire agreements with 17 groups, including all major players in Shan State. An uneasy truce has ensued, but all forces remain heavily armed. Today, the 20,000-strong United Wa State Army (UWSA) is the largest armed group, and is heavily involved in the narcotics trade. Under the 2008 Constitution, endorsed by the Burmese junta, certain UWSA-controlled areas were given the status of an autonomous region.

In recent decades, Chinese state and ethnic Chinese involvement in Shan State has deepened. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China have come to work in Upper Burma since the 1990s. Chinese investment in the state has funded everything from hydro power and mining projects to rubber plantations, logging, and wildlife trade. Wa and Kokang regions, led by local leaders, use the Chinese yuan and operate on Chinese Standard Time.

===New constitution (2010–present)===

In the general election of November 2010, 117 seats were open for Shan State Parliament (or Shan State Hluttaw): two each for 55 townships and seven seats for different ethnic constituencies. But elections for Mongmao, Pangwaun, Pangkham, Namphan, and Mong La Township Constituencies were canceled. Fifty-four candidates from Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), 31 from Shan Nationalities Democratic Party (SNDP), six from PaO National Organization, four from Ta&#x27;ang (Palaung) National Party, three each from Inn National Development Party and Wa Democratic Party, four from three other parties, and two independent candidates were elected. Only one candidate from National Unity Party (Burma) was elected for Shan State Hluttaw (2011), although it was the second largest party in term of numbers of candidates.

In 2011, Aung Myat (aka Sao Aung Myat), a former military officer of the Myanmar Army and a USDP candidate of Pindaya constituencies, was named as Chief Minister of Shan State Government. Two candidates from SNDP were named for the first Shan State Government. Sai Ai Pao (aka Sai Aik Paung) was named for Industry and Mining Minister and Sai Naw Kham (aka Tun Tun Aung) was named for Construction Minister. In the Shan State cabinets (2011), one was from the Myanmar Army and six were from the Union Soldiery and Development Party (USDP).

Sai Mauk Kham (aka Maung Ohn), one of the two vice presidents of Myanmar (2011–2015), was elected from Shan State No. 3 Constituency as a National Assembly candidate in the November 2010 election.

According to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the region produces the most opium in Myanmar, accounting for 82% (331 metric tons) of the country&#x27;s total output (405 metric tons) in 2020. However, opium poppy cultivation has declined year-on-year since 2015. In 2020, cultivation in Shan State declined a further 12%, with reductions taking place in East, North and South Shan with respective decreases of 17%, 10% and 9% from previous levels in 2019.

Following the 2021 coup and the ensuing civil war, Shan State saw fierce fighting between the military junta and the alliance of ethnic armed rebel groups. In November 2023, the rebels launched an offensive which overran much of Shan State, taking multiple towns, military outposts, and border crossings with China.

==Geography==
Most of the Shan State is a hilly plateau, the Shan Plateau, which together with the higher mountains in the north and south forms the Shan Hills system. The gorge of the Thanlwin (Salween/Namhkong) River cuts across the state. Inle Lake where the leg-rowing Intha people live in floating villages, in the great Nyaung Shwe &quot;plain&quot;, is the second largest natural expanse of water in Burma, shallow but long and wide. Pindaya Caves near Aungpan are vast limestone caverns which contain 6,226 Buddha images.

The road to Taunggyi via Kalaw and Aungpan branches off at Thazi from the main Yangon–Mandalay Road; another road via Ywangan and Pindaya branches off from Kyaukse south of Mandalay. The railhead stops short of Taunggyi at Shwenyaung, again from Thazi junction, and nearby Heho has an airport.

A severe magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck in Tarlay, Tachileik Township, the eastern part of Shan State, on 24 March 2011. It killed more than 70 and injured more than 100 people. 390 houses, 14 Buddhist monasteries, and nine government buildings were damaged.

==Administrative divisions==
Shan State is traditionally divided into three sub-states: Southern Shan State (1–2), Northern Shan State (3–7), and Eastern Shan State (8–11). It is officially divided into 13 districts:

#Taunggyi (တောင်ကြီး)
#Loilen (Loilem) (လွလႅမ်)
#Kyaukme (ကျောက်မဲ)
#Muse (မူဆယ်)
#Laukkaing (Laogai) (လောက်ကိုင်)
#Kunlong (ကွမ်းလုံ)
#Lashio (လာရှိုး)
#Keng Tung (ကျိုင်းတုံ)
#Mong Hsat (မိုင်းဆတ်)
#Mong Hpayak (မိုင်းဖြတ်)
#Tachileik (တာချီလိတ်)
#Hopang (part of Wa Self-Administered Division)
#Matman (part of Wa Self-Administered Division)

An additional district, Hopang District, was formed as the 12th district of Shan State in September 2011 by combining the townships of Mongmao, Pangwaun, Namphan, and Pansang from Lashio District with Matman Township from Kengtung District, as well as the townships and subtownships of Hopang, Panlong, and Namtit from Kunlong District.
==Government==

===Executive===

The Shan State Government is the cabinet of Shan State in Myanmar.

===Legislature===

The legislature of Shan State in Burma, called Hluttaw was established on 8 February 2016. It is a unicameral body, consisting of 137 members—103 elected members and 34 military representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;uec3/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, Sai Long Hseng of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) leads the Hluttaw.
=== Judiciary ===
The Shan State High Court is the judiciary of Shan State.

== Shan national anthem ==
The national anthem of Shan State (Shan: ၵႂၢမ်းၸိူဝ်ႉၸၢတ်ႈတႆး &quot;Kwam Jue Jaat Tai&quot;) was composed by Dr Panyan on 7 February 1947.

==Demographics==
The people of Shan State can be divided into ten primary ethnic groups: the Shan (Tai), Pa-O, Intha, Lahu, Lisu, Taungyo, Danu, Palaung, Ahka, and Kachin (Jingpo).

The valleys and tableland are inhabited by the Shan people, who resemble the Thai, Siam, and Lao people in language and customs. They are largely Buddhists and are mainly engaged in agriculture. Among the Shans live the Bamar, Han Chinese, and Karens. The hills are inhabited by various peoples, notably the Wa, who are numerous in the north and along the Chinese border. The Palaung people are numerous in the Northern Shan State, in the townships of Namkham, Muse, Namhpaka, Kutkai, and Lashio along the China-Myanmar border, and in the middle of Shan State, in the townships of Namhsan, Kyaukme, and Hsipaw. Some of the Palaung people can also be found in Kalaw Township in the Southern Shan State. 

The Lisu people are numerous in the Northern Shan State, in the townships of Mongmit, Hsipaw, Kyaukme, Namhsan, Namhpaka, Kutkai, Namtu, Lashio, Hopang, and Tangyan, as well as the Kokang region. There is also a numerous Lisu population in the Southern Shan State, in the townships of Taunggyi, Pekon, Hopon, Mongpon, Loilem, Lai-Hka, Nansang, Mong Nai, Mong Pan, and Mong Ton. The Jingpo people are numerous along the Chinese border in the Northern Shan State, in the townships of Namkham, Muse, Namhpaka, Kutkai, Mungmyit Kodawng, Kengtung, and Lashio. The Jingpo people in Shan State are estimated to number over 200,000.

There is a dwindling population of Anglo-Burmese in major hill stations, such as Kalaw and in Taunggyi, a hold-over from the colonial period.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Buddhists make up 81.7% of Shan State&#x27;s population, forming the largest religious community there. Minority religious communities include Christians (9.8%), Muslims (1%), Hindus (0.1%), and animists (6.6%) who collectively comprise the remainder of Shan State&#x27;s population. 0.9% of the population listed no religion, other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated.

According to the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee’s 2016 statistics, 77,513 Buddhist monks were registered in Shan State, comprising 14.5% of Myanmar&#x27;s total Sangha membership, which includes both novice samanera and fully-ordained bhikkhu. Shan State is home to Myanmar&#x27;s largest samanera community. 

The majority of monks belong to the Thudhamma Nikaya (97%), followed by Shwegyin Nikaya (2.9%), with the remainder of monks belonging to other small monastic orders. 3,814 thilashin were registered in Shan State, comprising 6.3% of Myanmar&#x27;s total thilashin community.
==Economy==
Silver, lead, and zinc are mined, notably at the Bawdwin mine, and there are smelters at Namtu. Rubies are extracted in large quantity in Mong Hsu Township with output peaking in the late-1990s and early 2000s.

Teak is cut, and rice and other crops are grown. Shan State is known for its garden produce of all sorts of fresh fruit and vegetables thanks to its temperate and sunny climate. Itinerant markets that travel from place to place, setting up on every fifth day in each small town or village, are typical, although large towns have permanent markets. It is part of the Golden Triangle, an area in which some of the world&#x27;s opium and heroin are still illegally produced, and it has become a leading global production area for methamphetamine. Drug trafficking is controlled by local warlords in partnership with foreign organized crime groups, some of whom have private armies amounting to thousands of soldiers. Much of the methamphetamine (&quot;ya ba&quot;) that ends up across the Mekong and wider Asia Pacific region is produced in Shan as well.

There are some border trading centers along the Shan State border and neighboring countries. Muse, the biggest border trading center along the Myanmar–China border and Tachileik, another important trading center between Myanmar and Thailand are in Shan State.

The construction project of Sino-Burma pipelines of oil and gas that passes through northern part of Shan State was started in September 2010 and was finished in June 2013.

==Education==
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are limited outside the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay. It is especially a problem in Shan State where vast areas are beyond government control. According to official statistics, only about 8% of primary school students in Shan State reach high school.

Taunggyi University is the main university in the state, and until recently the only four-year university in the state. The military government, which closed down universities and colleges in the 1990s to quell student unrest, has &quot;upgraded&quot; former colleges and two-year institutes. The government now requires that students attend their local universities and colleges, such as Lashio University, Kyaingtong University, Panglong University.

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5 to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack basic facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of the public health system in the state, in fiscal year 2002–2003.

<doc id="493378" wikidata="Q3847402" url="?curid=493378" title="Hanabiramochi">
<text>is a Japanese sweet (&quot;wagashi&quot;), usually eaten at the beginning of the year. Hanabiramochi are also served at the first tea ceremony of the new year.

==Origin==
The name &quot;hanabiramochi&quot; literally means &quot;flower petal mochi&quot;. The original form of Hanabiramochi is &quot;Hishihanabira&quot;, a dessert that was eaten by the Imperial family at special events coinciding with the beginning of the year.

&quot;Hanabiramochi&quot; was first made in the Meiji Era, and is now a familiar New Year &quot;wagashi&quot;.

==Form==
The exact shape of &quot;hanabiramochi&quot; is strictly defined by tradition. The white &quot;mochi&quot; covering is flat and round, folded over to form a semicircular shape, and must have a pink color showing through in the center of the confection, fading to a white at the edge. Unlike a &quot;daifuku&quot;, the &quot;mochi&quot; must not completely seal the insides.

In the center of a &quot;hanabiramochi&quot; is a layer of &quot;anko&quot;, a sweet bean paste, commonly the white kind made from sweetened mung beans. In the very center is a thin strip of sweetly flavoured &quot;gobo&quot; (burdock), which protrudes from the &quot;mochi&quot; on both sides.

==Significance and symbolism==
Each element of the &quot;hanabiramochi&quot; is significant:

The red colour showing through the white &quot;mochi&quot; is not only appropriate to the celebration of the new year, but also evokes the Japanese apricot/plum (&quot;ume&quot;) blossom, which in turn represents the purity, perseverance, and renewal associated with the New Year.

The &quot;gobo&quot; represents pressed &quot;ayu&quot;, a fish exclusive to East Asia, and a prayer for a long life.

<text>John Dillon (4 September 1851 – 4 August 1927) was an Irish politician from Dublin, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for over 35 years and was the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party. By political disposition, Dillon was an advocate of Irish nationalism, originally a follower of Charles Stewart Parnell, supporting land reform and Irish Home Rule.

==Early life==
John Dillon was born in Blackrock, Dublin, a son of the former &quot;Young Irelander&quot; John Blake Dillon (1814–1866). Following the premature death of both his parents, he was partly raised by his father&#x27;s niece, Anne Deane. He was educated at Catholic University School, at Trinity College Dublin and at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. He afterwards studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, then ceased active involvement in medicine after he joined Isaac Butt&#x27;s Home Rule League in 1873, winning notice in 1879 when he attacked Butt&#x27;s weak parliamentary handling of Irish Home Rule. His family&#x27;s financial means enabled him to turn and devote all his energies to political life.

He became a leading land reform agitator as a member of the original committee of the Irish National Land League, spearheading the policy of &quot;boycotting&quot; advocated by Michael Davitt with whom he was allied in close friendship. He entered the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1880 as member for County Tipperary, and was at first an ardent supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. He travelled to the United States with Parnell on a fund-raising mission for the Land League. On his return, he denounced William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 as achieving nothing for small farmers. His views on agrarian reform and on Home Rule led him to be branded an extremist, which resulted in his arrest from May until August 1881 under the Irish Coercion Act.

==Radical reformer==

Again imprisoned for agitation in October 1881 together with Parnell, William O&#x27;Brien and others in Kilmainham Gaol, he signed the &quot;No Rent Manifesto&quot; in solidarity although not fully in agreement with it. Parnell sought to end the Land War by agreeing to the Kilmainham Treaty after which they were released from prison in May 1882. Shortly afterwards they received the freedom of the city of Dublin. Unhappy with Parnell&#x27;s &quot;New Departure&quot; and because his health had suffered, he resigned his seat in Parliament on 6 March 1883, and retired from politics to Colorado in America where his brother lived. Returning in 1885, Parnell nominated him as the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate for East Mayo in the general election in November 1885, where he was returned unopposed. He represented the constituency without a break until 1918.

He was one of the prime movers in the Irish Land League&#x27;s famous Plan of Campaign instigated by Timothy Healy and organised by Timothy Harrington, which provided, that in the case of excessive rents the tenant should pay his rent to the Land League instead of the landlord, and in case of eviction be supported by the general fund. Dillon was compelled by the Court of Queens Bench in December 1886 to find securities for good behaviour, but two days later he was arrested while receiving rents on Lord Clanricarde&#x27;s estate at Portumna, County Galway. In this instance, the jury disagreed, but in April 1887 he was again imprisoned under Coercion and upon release, he resumed agrarian agitation with a speech during a demonstration in September where O&#x27;Brien was on trial in Mitchelstown during which the crowd threw stones at the police who then shot three civilians, known as the &quot;Mitchelstown massacre&quot;. When in 1888 he defended Munster farmers he was again imprisoned for six months under the provisions of the new Criminal Law Procedure Bill, or Coercion Act. In all he was imprisoned six times.

==Anti-Parnellite course==

He was released in September, and in the spring of 1889 sailed for Australia and New Zealand, where he collected funds for the Nationalist party. On his return to Ireland he was again arrested, but, being allowed bail, sailed to America, and failed to appear at the trial. He returned to Ireland by way of Boulogne, where he and William O&#x27;Brien held long and indecisive discussions with Parnell after his divorce crisis over his continued leadership of the Irish Parliamentary Party. When these broke down they surrendered to the police in February, and were interned in Galway gaol from where they were released in July 1890.

Both he and O&#x27;Brien had become increasingly perturbed with the tenor of Irish politics as epitomised by Timothy Healy. After Parnell&#x27;s divorce case, the leader refused to step down and the party split. Dillon was one of his strongest opponents and joined the majority anti-Parnellite block, the Irish National Federation (INF), with Justin McCarthy becoming its leader. John Redmond led the minority pro-Parnellite Irish National League (INL) after Parnell&#x27;s death later in 1891. When the Liberals reclaimed office in 1892 Dillon took part in the negotiations on the second Home Rule Bill, the Irish Government Bill 1893, which was rejected by the House of Lords. Although he never lost sight of home rule or the land question, particularly the evicted tenants, he now concentrated on the day-to-day running of the INF as deputy chairman.

==Party manoeuvrings==
When home rule became postponed after the Conservative Party returned to power in 1895, Dillon took the opportunity to expel Healy from his influence in the party. He also opposed Horace Plunkett in his attempts to bring Unionists and Nationalists together, and his efforts to help small farmers through his cooperative movement. In November Dillon married Elizabeth Mathew at the Brompton Oratory who bore him six children. In February 1896 he took over as chairman of the INF on McCarthy&#x27;s resignation. That autumn he arranged a convention of the Irish race, which included 2,000 delegates from various parts of the world. In 1897 Dillon opposed in the House of Commons the Address to Queen Victoria on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee, on the ground that her reign had not been a blessing to Ireland, and he showed the same uncompromising attitude in 1901 when a grant to Lord Roberts was under discussion, accusing him of systematised inhumanity. He was suspended on 20 March 1902 for violent language addressed to Joseph Chamberlain, calling the then Colonial Secretary a &quot;damned liar&quot;.

Dillon was present in January 1898 when William O&#x27;Brien launched his &quot;United Ireland League&quot; (UIL) from an agrarian platform in Ballina, County Mayo. Though helping to establish its constitution Dillon was very ambivalent about this new association, marking the first strains in the O&#x27;Brien-Dillon relationship. The year was also eventful with the attainment of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which put the administration of local affairs into Irish hands, not at all favoured by Dillon before attaining full Home Rule. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s UIL spread rapidly, forcing the divided factions, the INL and the INF, of the Irish Parliamentary Party to reunite under Redmond in 1900, with Dillon as deputy Party leader. He faithfully supported Redmond in the following years.

==Conciliation unthinkable==
Dillon played a decisive role in opposing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;doctrine of conciliation&quot; in Irish politics, especially during the 1902 Land Conference and after O&#x27;Brien won the subsequent Wyndham Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903. O&#x27;Brien was viciously attacked by Dillon, who bore an instinctive dislike of negotiations with landlords, unwilling to accommodate the landlord class, he never shed his mistrust of dialogue with Unionists. His theory was that agrarian unrest better favoured achieving Home Rule by putting relentless pressure on landlords and the government. His attacks and those of the party&#x27;s Freeman&#x27;s Journal alienated O&#x27;Brien who left the Party in November 1903. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s engagement during 1904–5 with the Irish Reform Association and his appraising of the 1907 Irish Council Bill were equally condemned by Dillon who despised all dealings with the &quot;hereditary enemy&quot;. The ensuing breach never healed. Dillon subsequently gained control of the UIL through his protégé, its new secretary Joseph Devlin, MP for Belfast West, with whom Dillon always maintained a close alliance.

With the UIL and the IPP practically fused into a single body, Dillon later had MP members associated with O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s policy of conciliation, amongst them Thomas O&#x27;Donnell and D. D. Sheehan, expelled as &quot;factionists&quot; from the party. The Home Rule Movement, influenced very greatly by Dillon, reverted to a narrow traditional stand, which opposed any chance of an inclusive nationalism and failed to include new interests within Catholic society. His Home Rule Movement was largely a confessional ethnic body, sustained largely by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an exclusively Catholic and secret fraternity, largely under the control of his close associate Joe Devlin. Dillion&#x27;s Home Rule Movement was characterised by permanent class war and did not facilitate the working of the Wyndham Land Act; conflict above victory.

Dillon suffered occasional health incapacities causing irregular attendance at Westminster, particularly when his wife died in 1907 though after the Liberals returned to power in 1906, he was more often consulted. Between 1910 and 1914 the Irish Home Rule question re-emerged, introduced by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. In his approach to Irish self-government under Home Rule took a more uncompromising stand than Redmond&#x27;s, who during the Ulster crisis of 1913 was prepared to concede a large measure of local autonomy to Ulster. On 15 and 16 January Dillon spent lunch at the Commons with one of his closest supporters, Guardian editor, C. P. Scott, and ardent home ruler, he urged the Irish leader to lobby the new Labour MPs. It was unthinkable for Dillon, who put the integrity of Ireland foremost: he poured scorn on Edward Carson&#x27;s Ulster Unionist Party and their Ulster Volunteers&#x27; threat of civil war as being a gigantic bluff. Scott courted Dillon&#x27;s opinion most assiduously at the Bath Club and his Manchester home in favour of &quot;gradual strengthening of the military force in Ulster&quot;, without support the police might &quot;cave in altogether&quot;. &quot;Incredibly weak&quot; Dillon was unable to prevent Carson&#x27;s amendments to Crewe&#x27;s Home Rule bill. Likewise Dillon condemned O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s new All-for-Ireland League&#x27;s proposals for concessions to Ulster as encouraging their demands. He remained inflexible at various meetings, including the 1914 Buckingham Palace Conference&#x27;s endeavour to settle the problem of Ulster. He agreed only reluctantly to Redmond conceding to six counties temporarily opting out of the Home Rule Act 1914, which in September received Royal Assent but was suspended for the duration of World War I.

Dillon was a strong opponent of giving women the vote, telling a group of women that &quot;women&#x27;s suffrage will I believe, be the ruin of our western civilisation. It will destroy the home, challenging the headship of man, laid down by God. It may come in your time - I hope not in mine.&quot;

== Uncompromising stand for peace ==
With the outbreak of the Great War Dillon accepted Redmond&#x27;s decision to follow Britain&#x27;s support of the Allied war effort, but he abstained from recruiting for the Irish divisions. The 1916 Rising took the Irish Party by surprise. He intervened with David Lloyd George to halt the 90 sentences of execution pronounced by &quot;field court-martial&quot; (in camera without defence or jury) under martial law by General Maxwell after he declared the rebellion &quot;treason in time of war&quot;. He told Scott his party must support Conscription or lose the election. But on 10 January, they did just that &quot;to make their protest&quot; with Lib-Lab assistance. Dillon insisted that if they went ahead they would &quot;fill the whole country&quot; with the same type of radicals, as opposed to imprisonment. This would leave the radicals with as many supporters as could &quot;fit in a single gaol cell&quot;. He attacked the Government in the House of Commons and declared that the rebels were &quot;wrong&quot;, but had fought &quot;a clean fight&quot;. Intervention to halt the executions after the 15th; an unbridgeable chasm in Anglo-Irish relations. The secret trials and executions had changed public opinion into sympathy for the rebels. He was involved in May 1916 with Lloyd George&#x27;s futile attempt to implement Home Rule after the Rising, which failed in July on the issue of the exclusion or not of Ulster. He declined a nomination to the Irish Convention on Home Rule in 1917.

After Redmond&#x27;s death on 6 March 1918, Dillon returned to Ireland to take up the party leadership. When the allied armies on the Western Front were hit and thrown into a temporary severe retreat by the German spring offensive, which decimated the 10th and 16th Irish divisions, the Government attempted a month later in panic to extend conscription to Ireland, which Dillon opposed with tenacity, and in protest withdrew all Irish Members from the House of Commons. The attempt to impose conscription jointly linked with implementing Home Rule disgusted the wider Irish public and resulted in an immediate swing of support to Sinn Féin which precipitated their election landslide after the war.

Dillon attempted to persuade the Government in July 1918 to implement Irish self-government by introducing a motion for self-determination in the Commons. He made clear in September that the goal of Home Rule could only be &quot;the establishment of national self-government, including full and complete executive, legislative and fiscal power&quot;, and that national solidarity was essential. But he completely underestimated the need to offer provisions for Ulster concerns, a fatal misjudgement shared by most Nationalists and Republicans alike.

It was left to Dillon to fight a last campaign in the general election of December 1918. After a failure to reach a pact with Sinn Féin, his party was swept into oblivion. He was defeated in East Mayo by Éamon de Valera&#x27;s 8,975 votes to his 4,514. Retiring from politics, Dillon was not spared witnessing the violent epoch of the Anglo-Irish War, the implementation of Home Rule in Northern Ireland, the ensuing Partition of Ireland endorsed by the Irish Free State and the resulting Irish Civil War.

==Family background==
He got married in 1895 to Elizabeth, daughter of Lord Justice J. C. Mathew, who bore him six children. Tall and slim he cut an imposing figure, his personal reputation hampered at times by a pessimistic and gloomy nature as well as conservative views on labour and women. He died in a London nursing home at the age of 76, on 4 August 1927, and was buried four days later in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. There is a street named after him in Dublin&#x27;s Liberties, beside the old Iveagh Market.

One of his six children was James Mathew Dillon (1902–1986), a prominent Irish politician and leader of the National Centre Party and of Fine Gael (1957–1966), also Minister for Agriculture.

==Commemoration==
John Dillon Street in Dublin city is named after him.

<doc id="493383" wikidata="Q877127" url="?curid=493383" title="Administrative divisions of Myanmar">
<text>Myanmar is divided into 21 administrative divisions, which include seven regions, seven states, one union territory, one self-administered division, and five self-administered zones.

== Table ==
Following is the table of government subdivisions and its organizational structure based on different regions, states, the union territory, the self-administered division, and the self-administered zones:

The regions were called divisions prior to August 2010, and four of them are named after their capital city, the exceptions being Sagaing Region, Ayeyarwady Region and Tanintharyi Region. The regions can be described as ethnically predominantly Burman (Bamar), while the states, the zones and Wa Division are dominated by ethnic minorities.

Yangon Region has the largest population and is the most densely populated. The smallest population is Kayah State. In terms of land area, Shan State is the largest and Naypyidaw Union Territory is the smallest.

Regions and states are divided into districts (; &quot;kha yaing&quot; or &quot;khayaing&quot;, ). These districts consist of townships (; &quot;myo-ne&quot;, ) that include towns (; &quot;myo&quot;, ), wards (; &quot;yatkwet&quot;, )) and village tracts (; &quot;kyayywa oksu&quot;, ). Village tracts are groups of adjacent villages (; &quot;kyayywa&quot;, ).

==Structural hierarchy==

*Some townships are divided into Subtownships (), which are semi-official parts of a township administered separately. Many reports will use subtownships, especially more established subtownships used by the main townships themselves.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Regions, States, and Union Territory ===

=== Self-Administered Division and Self-Administered Zones ===



==System of administration==

The administrative structure of the states, regions and self-administering bodies is outlined in the new constitution adopted in 2008.

=== Regions and States ===
Executive authority is held in each state or region by a Regional or State Government consisting of a Chief Minister, other ministers and an Advocate General. The President appoints the Chief Minister from a list of qualified candidates in the regional or state legislature; the regional or state legislature must approve the President&#x27;s choice unless they can prove that he or she does not meet the constitutional qualifications.

Legislative authority resides with the State Hluttaw or Regional Hluttaw made up of elected civilian members and representatives of the Armed Forces. Both divisions are considered equivalent, the only distinction being that states have large ethnic minority populations and regions are mostly populated by the national majority Burmans / Bamar.

=== Naypyidaw Union Territory ===
The constitution states that Naypyidaw shall be a Union Territory under the direct administration of the President. Day-to-day functions would be carried out on the President&#x27;s behalf by the Naypyidaw Council led by a Chairperson. The Chairperson and members of the Naypyidaw Council are appointed by the President and shall include civilians and representatives of the Armed Forces.

=== Self-Administered Division and Self-Administered Zones ===
Self-Administered Zones and Self-Administered Divisions are administered by a Leading Body. The Leading Body consists of at least ten members and includes State or Regional Hluttaw members elected from the Zones or Divisions and other members nominated by the Armed Forces. The Leading Body has both executive and legislative powers. A Chairperson is head of each Leading Body.

Within Sagaing Region:

* Naga (Leshi, Lahe, and Namyun townships)

Within Shan State:

* Danu Self-Administered Zone (Ywangan and Pindaya townships),
* Kokang Self-Administered Zone (Konkyan and Laukkai townships)
* Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone (Namshan and Manton townships)
* Pa&#x27;O Self-Administered Zone (Hopong, Hshihseng, and Pinlaung townships),
* Wa Self-Administered Division (Hopang, Mongmao, Panwai, Pangsang, Naphan, and Metman townships)

=== Districts and Townships ===
Districts are the second-order divisions of Myanmar and are often named after a population center within the district of the same name. Shan State has the most districts, even excluding Self-Administered Zones and Divisions. Naypyidaw Union Territory and Mon State have the least with just 2 districts. The District&#x27;s role is more supervisory as the 330 townships are the basic administrative unit of local governance and are the only type of administrative division that covers the entirety of Myanmar. A District is led by a District Administrator and a Township is administered by a Township Administrator. Both are appointed civil servants through the General Administration Department (GAD) of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). The Minister of Home Affairs is to be appointed by the military according to the 2008 constitution. 

Most local governance services are offered at the Township level; few services are offered at the District level. The Township Administrator is the key focal point for most interactions with the government and the Township Administrator serves as a representative of the State or Region government and executes functions on behalf of the State or Region. All Township governments are staffed by 34 GAD civil servants regardless of population, although larger townships may have several Township committees that coordinate with the Township and report to the District. Subtownships exist for many but not all townships. They can be created for many reasons including, townships with large areas, townships with a large natural barrier or townships with a lopsided population distribution. These subtownships are unofficial, but can be used by the Township administration and national ministries for data collection and administrative ease.

=== Wards, Village Tracts and Municipalities ===
The fourth and lowest level of administration is the ward for urban areas and village tract for rural areas. Some townships include areas not part of any ward or village tract. Village Tracts may contain up to 8 distinct villages. Most townships contain at least one ward/town, and are usually named after the population center. As of reforms in 2012 and 2013, Ward and Village Tract administrators are now typically elected, but report to the appointed Township Administrator. Ward Administrators and Village Tract Administrators (also called just Village Administrators) are supported by 100-household-heads and 10-household-heads who are collectively called area leaders.

Most cities in Myanmar are contained within one township like Pathein. In some cases, the rural portions of the township may be administered semi-independently as sub-townships. In larger cities, like Mandalay, the municipality may be functionally administered at a district level with townships acting de facto as subdivisions of a city. In Yangon, the administrative jurisdiction of the Yangon City Development Committee overlap across 33 townships and all 4 of Yangon Region&#x27;s districts. The definition of a city is ambiguous with the Burmese term (&#x27;myo&#x27;) being translated as any urban area. The General Administration Department only explicitly defines the three cities of Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw.

==History==
===British colonisation===
In 1900, Burma was a province of British India, and was divided into two subdivisions: Lower Burma, whose capital was Rangoon with four divisions (Arakan, Irrawaddy, Pegu, Tenasserim), and Upper Burma, whose capital was Mandalay with six divisions (Meiktila, Minbu, Sagaing, North Federated Shan States and South Federated Shan States).

On 10 October 1922, the Karenni States of Bawlake, Kantarawaddy, and Kyebogyi became a part of the Federated Shan States. In 1940, Minbu division&#x27;s name was changed to Magwe, and Meiktila Divisions became part of Mandalay District.

===Post-independence===
Upon independence, on 4 January 1948, the Chin Hills area was split from Arakan Division to form Chin Special Division, and Kachin State was formed by carving out the Myitkyina and Bhamo districts of Mandalay Division. Karen State was also created from Amherst, Thaton, and Toungoo Districts of Tenasserim Division. Karenni State was separated from the Federated Shan States, and Shan State was formed by merging the Federated Shan States and the Wa States.

In 1952, Karenni State was renamed Kayah State. In 1964, Rangoon Division was separated from Pegu Division, whose capital shifted to Pegu. In addition, Karen State was renamed Kawthoolei State.

In 1972, the Hanthawaddy and Hmawbi districts were moved under Rangoon Division&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In 1974, after Ne Win introduced a constitution, Chin Special Division became a state, and its capital moved from Falam to Hakha. Kawthoolei State&#x27;s name was reverted to Karen State. Mon State was created out of portions of Tenasserim Division and Pegu Division. Mon State&#x27;s capital became Moulmein, and Tenasserim Division&#x27;s became Tavoy. In addition, Rakhine Division was granted statehood.

In 1989, after the coup d&#x27;état by the military junta, the names of many divisions in Burma were altered in English to reflect Burmese pronunciations.

After 1995, in Kachin State Mohnyin District was created out of Myitkyina District as part of the peace agreement with the Kachin Independence Army.

===2008 Constitution===
The 2008 Constitution stipulates the renaming of the 7 &quot;divisions&quot; ( in Burmese) as &quot;regions&quot; ( in Burmese). It also stipulates the creation of Union territories, which include the capital of Nay Pyi Taw and ethnic self-administered zones ( in Burmese) and self-administered divisions ( in Burmese). These self-administered regions include the following:

* Danu Self-Administered Zone: consisting of Ywangan and Pindaya townships in Shan State
* Kokang Self-Administered Zone: consisting of Konkyan and Laukkai townships in Shan State
* Naga Self-Administered Zone: consisting of Leshi, Lahe, and Namyun townships in Sagaing Region
* Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone: consisting of Namhsan and Manton townships in Shan State
* Pa-O Self-Administered Zone: consisting of Hopong, Hsihseng, and Pinlaung townships in Shan State
* Wa Self-Administered Division: consisting of Hopang, Mongmao, Panwai, Nahpan, Metman, and Pangsang (Pankham) townships in Shan State

On 20 August 2010, the renaming of the 7 divisions and the naming of the 6 self-administered zones was announced by Burmese state media.

<text>Sir Richard Leslie Taylor (born 8 February 1965) is the founder, creative director and head of New Zealand film prop and special effects company Wētā Workshop.

==Early life==
Taylor was born in Cheadle, Cheshire, England, on 8 February 1965, and emigrated as a child to New Zealand, where his family lived at Te Hihi, and later the Auckland suburb of Patumahoe. He was naturalised as a New Zealand citizen in 1974. Taylor studied at Wesley College, Paerata, and then became a graduate of the former Wellington Polytechnic.

==Career==
Peter Jackson, Taylor and his company created all of the props, costumes, prosthetics, miniatures and weaponry for Jackson&#x27;s epic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. For his work on the three films, he shared in winning four Academy Awards. This included two for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in Make Up and Visual Effects, and two for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; in Costume Design and Make Up. He was nominated for Costume Design for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

Taylor can be seen and heard on all of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; DVDs, in behind-the-scenes documentaries and on the audio commentaries on the extended edition DVDs. He also appeared on set to give direction to actors and stunt personnel in several fight scenes.

Both Richard Taylor and Wētā Workshop appear in the documentary film &quot;Reclaiming the Blade&quot;, where they discussed the creative and technical process of how movie props (specifically swords) are created at Wētā Workshop. Swords created by Wētā for films such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; are featured in the film as well.

In the 2004 New Year Honours, Taylor was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to design and the film industry. In the 2010 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Taylor was promoted to Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film.

Wētā Workshop has also worked on &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Richard Taylor and his crew designed and built all the armor, weapons and special props for the film. The company were also heavily involved in the making of Peter Jackson&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;King Kong&quot; for which he won his fifth Academy Award, in Visual Effects.

In April 2009, Richard Taylor won the supreme award at the World Class New Zealand Awards. The awards honour New Zealand&#x27;s tall poppies who are successful on an international level.

In February 2012 Taylor was named New Zealander of the year, beating finalists World of Wearable Art founder Suzie Moncrieff and Auckland plastic surgeon Sharad P. Paul, nominated for his work on skin cancer.

By 2014, Taylor&#x27;s company, Wētā Workshop, was involved with Magic Leap, a startup company reported to be working on projects relating to augmented reality and computer vision that received over USD $4.5 billion of venture funding by 2024.

In May of 2020, due to economic fallout resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between Taylor&#x27;s Weta Workshop and Magic Leap came to an end, when the latter company laid off about 1,000 staff members worldwide. All of the Magic Leap employees in New Zealand were laid off, and the partnership with Weta Workshop was dissolved.

==Awards and nominations==
* Nominated: Best Costume Design, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001)
* Won: Best Makeup, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001)

<text>Bruce Frank Vento (October 7, 1940 – October 10, 2000) was an American educator and politician, a Democratic-Farmer-Labor member of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 until his death in 2000, representing .

==Early life==

Vento was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and was educated at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in Minneapolis, where he received his BA in 1961. He later, in 1965, received a B.S with honors, from the University of Wisconsin River Falls. He was a public school teacher in St. Paul, Minnesota prior to entering politics.

==Career==
Vento served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1971 until 1976 before entering the House. Vento is recognized for his efforts in cleaning the environment and promoting affordable housing. He is also widely known for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986, which provides federal money for shelter programs.

==Legacy==
The Bruce Vento Regional Trail runs through St. Paul, Minnesota. Along this path, by the Johnson Parkway just north of Phalen Avenue, a memorial grove has also been named in his honor. The Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, a former railroad yard and informal trash dumping area in Lowertown St. Paul is also named for the Congressman, who lived nearby and supported this model reclamation project. East Consolidated Elementary School in St. Paul was renamed Bruce Vento Elementary School in 2000.

==Hmong Veterans&#x27; Naturalization Act==
Vento introduced the first bill in the US Congress to grant honorary U.S. citizenship to Laotian and Hmong veterans who served in the &quot;U.S. Secret Army&quot; in Laos during the Vietnam War. The legislation, the Hmong Veterans&#x27; Naturalization Act of 2000 was passed by the House and Senate following his death and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Vento worked with the Lao Veterans of America, the Lao Veterans of America Institute, the Center for Public Policy Analysis and others to research and advance the legislation in Congress, Washington, D.C., and the Lao- and Hmong-American community. Vento worked with Hmong elders and community leaders in the Twin Cities and across the United States, including Cherzong Vang, Colonel Wangyee Vang and others to build support for the legislation which took over 10 years to gain the bipartisan support for passage on Capitol Hill, Congress and the White House.

==Death==
Vento died in 2000 while still a member of Congress from pleural mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer, as a result of exposure to asbestos. He had already announced that he would not run for a 13th term in 2000. Since he died a month before the election, no special election or new candidates were needed to replace him. State Representative Betty McCollum, a fellow DFLer, succeeded him.

<text>Pointe-au-Père () is a district (&quot;secteur&quot;) of the city of Rimouski, Quebec, which is located in the central part of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region in eastern Quebec at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. Its population was 4,240 in 2002, the year it merged with Rimouski. It is named after Father Henri Nouvel, who celebrated the first mass there in 1663.

Pointe-au-Père lighthouse along with the Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père museum are major regional tourist attractions.

Murderer Dr Crippen was arrested when the steam ship , on which he was trying to escape with his mistress, who was disguised as his son, reached Pointe-au-Père.
On May 29, 1914, the RMS &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; sank in the Saint Lawrence River near this village, with a loss of 1,012 lives.

Pointe-au-Père tide station serves as the reference point for measuring mean sea level for the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, which is the reference point for determining altitude in North America.

Since 1986, the Government of Canada officially created the Pointe-au-Père National Wildlife Area, which houses a variety of fauna and flora, very popular for birdwatchers.

<doc id="493389" wikidata="Q147707" url="?curid=493389" title="Solanum dulcamara">
<text>Solanum dulcamara is a species of vine in the genus &quot;Solanum&quot; (which also includes the potato and the tomato) of the family Solanaceae. Common names include bittersweet, bittersweet nightshade, bitter nightshade, blue bindweed, Amara Dulcis, climbing nightshade, felonwort, fellenwort, felonwood, poisonberry, poisonflower, scarlet berry, [[Snake berry|snakeberry]], trailing bittersweet, trailing nightshade, violet bloom, and woody nightshade.

It is native to Europe and Asia, and widely naturalised elsewhere, including North America.

==Overview==
It occurs in a very wide range of habitats, from woodlands to scrubland, hedges and marshes.

&quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; is a semi-woody herbaceous perennial vine, which scrambles over other plants, capable of reaching a height of 4 m where suitable support is available, but more often 1–2 m high. The leaves are 4–12 cm long, roughly arrowhead-shaped, and often lobed at the base. The flowers are in loose clusters of 3–20, 1–1.5 cm across, star-shaped, with five purple petals and yellow stamens and style pointing forward. The fruit is an ovoid red berry about 1 cm long, soft and juicy, with the aspect and odour of a tiny tomato, and edible for some birds, which disperse the seeds widely. However, the berry is poisonous to humans and livestock, and the berry&#x27;s attractive and familiar look makes it dangerous for children.

It is native to northern Africa, Europe, and Asia, but has spread throughout the world. The plant is relatively important in the diet of some species of birds such as European thrushes, which feed on its fruits, being immune to its poisons, and scatter the seeds abroad. It grows in all types of terrain with a preference for wetlands and the understory of riparian forests. Along with other climbers, it creates a dark and impenetrable shelter for varied animals. The plant grows well in dark areas in places where it can receive the light of morning or afternoon. An area receiving bright light for many hours reduces its development. It grows more easily in rich wet soils with plenty of nitrogen. When grown for medicinal purposes, it is best grown in a dry, exposed environment.

It is a nonnative species in the United States.

==History==
&quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; has been valued by herbalists since ancient Greek times. In the Middle Ages the plant was thought to be effective against witchcraft, and was sometimes hung around the neck of cattle to protect them from the &quot;evil eye&quot;. It has been suggested that the plant was used both medicinally and to induce altered states of mind in Anglo-Saxon England.

John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; (1597) states that &quot;the juice is good for those that have fallen from high places, and have been thereby bruised or beaten, for it is thought to dissolve blood congealed or cluttered anywhere in the intrals and to heale the hurt places.&quot;

==Biological activity==
This plant is one of the less poisonous members of the Solanaceae. Instances of poisoning in humans are very rare on account of the fruit&#x27;s intensely bitter taste. Incidentally, the fruit has been reported to have a sweet aftertaste, hence the vernacular name &quot;bittersweet&quot;.

The poison in this species is believed to be solanine. The alkaloids, solanine (from unripe fruits), solasodine (from flowers) and beta-solamarine (from roots) have been found to inhibit the growth of &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Solanine and solasodine extracted from &quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; showed antidermatophytic activity against &quot;Chrysosporium indicum&quot;, &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot; and &quot;T. simil&quot;, thus it may cure ringworm.

The stems are approved by the German Commission E for external use as supportive therapy in chronic eczema.

== Medicinal use ==
&quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; has a variety of documented medicinal uses, all of which are advised to be approached with proper caution as the entirety of the plant is considered to be poisonous. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally. There have only been records of medicinal use for adults (not children) and it is possible to be allergic to &quot;Solanum dulcamara;&quot; medicinal use is not advised in these cases.

=== Use of stem ===
The stem of &quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; is believed to be considerably less poisonous than the rest of the plant, and it has mostly been used in treatment for conditions of the skin. There are records of it being used to treat mild recurrent eczema, psoriasis, scabies, and dermatomycosis. Stems are harvested when they do not yet have leaves (or the leaves have already fallen) and are shredded into small pieces. They are mostly known to be applied in the form of liquid onto the skin, but infusing it into a drink is also possible, though not recommended. The stem has also been used in treatment for bronchitis, asthma, and pneumonia.

=== Use of leaves, fruit, and root ===
The leaves of &quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; have been known to treat warts and tumors, while the fruit can treat conditions of the respiratory tract and joints. It has been documented that Indigenous people of North America used the roots for relief of fever and nausea.

== Symbolism ==
&quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; has been used as a symbol of fidelity. This is in reference to its curious property of combining extreme bitterness with surprising sweetness – hence its common name &quot;bittersweet&quot;. This symbolism is seen in Christian art from the Middle Ages as well as in bridal wreaths.

<text>Homogenic is the third studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk. It was released on 22 September 1997 by One Little Indian Records. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B, and Markus Dravs, the album marked a stylistic change, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland.

&quot;Homogenic&quot; was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was halted due to media attention from Björk surviving a murder attempt by a stalker. She later relocated to Spain to record the album. It marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Bell, whom she would cite as a major influence on her musical career.

Upon its release, &quot;Homogenic&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. It topped the Icelandic albums chart, peaking at number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. The album produced five singles—&quot;Jóga&quot;, &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Alarm Call&quot;, and &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;—and was further promoted with the Homogenic tour (1997–1999). Retrospectively, &quot;Homogenic&quot; has continued receiving critical acclaim, being listed among the best albums of all time by numerous critics.

== Recording and production ==
After an extensive tour in support of her 1995 album &quot;Post&quot;, Björk returned to her home in Maida Vale with an urgent need to write new songs as a form of therapy. Björk would let audio engineer Markus Dravs into her home studio to start creating new songs. The sessions with Dravs and Björk were casual, with Björk allowing Dravs freedom with the album. Björk only left the studio to cook meals for the both of them. One of the first songs created during the sessions was &quot;5 Years&quot; which Dravs created the fast beat for. The progress of &quot;Homogenic&quot; in these sessions was halted due to a media sensation caused by the suicide of Björk&#x27;s stalker Ricardo López. To deal with the stress of being at home during this incident, Björk imagined herself as the protagonist in a Spanish soap opera. The character&#x27;s image inspired a song titled &quot;So Broken&quot; which she sang to herself in her kitchen. The song was later included on the Japanese release of the album.

To record in privacy away from the sudden unwanted media interest, Björk&#x27;s tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Spain. Björk went to Málaga and arranged to meet with flamenco guitarist Raimundo Amador. Björk had originally intended to stay in Málaga only briefly, but later decided to record the entirety of &quot;Homogenic&quot; there. Björk made a final trip out of the country before staying in Spain. As she had done since moving to London, Björk returned to Iceland for Christmas. While there, she wrote more new songs for &quot;Homogenic&quot;, including &quot;Jóga&quot;. Before returning to Spain to record, Björk was sidetracked by a two-week worldwide press tour for the promotion of her remix album &quot;Telegram&quot;, which had just been released. After returning to the studio in Spain in late January, Björk decided to end work with producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;, as she felt they had &quot;stopped surprising each other&quot;. Björk had intended to produce the album alone, but sought collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO&#x27;s Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Björk on &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on &quot;Post&quot;. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed to the production of &quot;Homogenic&quot;, but were unable due to their production on the album &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Björk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add rhythmic patterns. Björk had wanted to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;; Bell was credited for the majority of the album&#x27;s production, including the songs &quot;Pluto&quot;, &quot;Alarm Call&quot;, and the bassline in &quot;Jóga&quot;. Björk stated that she &quot;trusts and respects what [Bell] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell&quot;. Other unorthodox methods of recording were used during the production, including Björk wanting to record outside on the porch and using non-professionals to help with production, such as Rebecca Storey, who was hired as a babysitter but added to the production staff after showing interest in the equipment.

String arrangements were added late in the recording process. Björk had friend Eumir Deodato conduct, transcribe and compose original pieces for the few songs that Björk did not arrange for herself. To keep with the Icelandic theme of the album, Björk ordered the services of the Icelandic String Octet. By June 1997, the album was behind schedule and Björk was uncertain of the final track listing and unhappy with some of the recorded vocals.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Homogenic&quot; is an electronica, trip hop, art pop, and experimental album. Before production began on &quot;Homogenic&quot;, Björk wanted to create an album with &quot;a simple sound&quot; and &quot;only one flavour&quot;. Heather Phares of AllMusic described the sound of &quot;Homogenic&quot; as a &quot;fusion of chilly strings (courtesy of the Icelandic String Octet), stuttering, abstract beats, and unique touches like accordion and glass harmonica&quot;. The album differs from her previous two releases stylistically, and Neva Chonin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated the album was &quot;certain to be rough going for fans looking for the sweet melodies and peppy dance collages of her earlier releases&quot;. As with other Björk releases, it has been difficult for critics to classify &quot;Homogenic&quot; within a musical genre. &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; considered that &quot;Björk has managed to create something so refreshingly unique that trying to categorize and label the music is rather dubious.&quot; Writing for &quot;Beats Per Minute&quot;, Cole Zercoe felt &quot;Homogenic&quot; represented a pinnacle work of trip hop, forming part of &quot;a sort of holy trinity of this musical aesthetic&quot; along with Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot; and Portishead&#x27;s &quot;Dummy&quot;.

Björk wanted &quot;Homogenic&quot; to have a conceptual focus on her native Iceland. Producer Markus Dravs recalled Björk wanting it to sound like &quot;rough volcanoes with soft moss growing all over it...&quot; In an interview for &quot;Oor&quot;, Björk explained that &quot;in Iceland, everything revolves around nature, 24 hours a day. Earthquakes, snowstorms, rain, ice, volcanic eruptions, geysers... Very elementary and uncontrollable. But at the other hand, Iceland is incredibly modern; everything is hi-tech. The number of people owning a computer is as high as nowhere else in the world. That contradiction is also on &quot;Homogenic&quot;. The electronic beats are the rhythm, the heartbeat. The violins create the old-fashioned atmosphere, the colouring.&quot;

Björk&#x27;s vocals on &quot;Homogenic&quot; range from primitive-sounding screams to a traditional singing method used by Icelandic choir men, a combination of speaking and singing as illustrated in the song &quot;Unravel&quot;. The majority of songs on &quot;Homogenic&quot; have lyrics about love and failed relationships. The song &quot;Jóga&quot; was written as a tribute to her best friend and tour masseuse of the same name. Björk called &quot;All is Full of Love&quot; a song about &quot;believing in love&quot; and that &quot;Love isn&#x27;t just about two persons. It&#x27;s everywhere around you&quot;. &quot;All Neon Like&quot; contains snippets of a poem Björk wrote called &quot;Techno Prayer&quot; in 1996. The song &quot;5 Years&quot; appeared in live form a few weeks after her breakup with musician Tricky and music journalists considered it a response to it. &quot;Bachelorette&quot; was originally written for director Bernardo Bertolucci for his film &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;. Björk later faxed Bertolucci, informing him the song would be used for her album instead. &quot;Bachelorette&quot; and &quot;Jóga&quot; were written with Icelandic poet Sjón, because Björk wanted to use epic lyrics. &quot;Immature&quot; was written about mistakes in past relationships, shortly after the breakup with Goldie. Björk described &quot;Pluto&quot; as about &quot;being plastered, that need to destroy everything so you can start again&quot;. &quot;Unravel&quot; is a song about lamenting love, with brief flashes of hope.

== Title and artwork ==

The album&#x27;s production began with the working title of &quot;Homogeneous&quot;, but Björk changed it to &quot;Homogenic&quot; shortly afterwards. Björk wanted to create an album with &quot;a simple sound&quot; and &quot;only one flavour&quot;, hence the title. The title has also been speculated to be suggesting the concept of home, which Björk had said to be incorporating into &quot;Homogenic&quot; in an interview with Jam!:
The themes of &quot;Homogenic&quot; are reflected in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. According to McQueen biographer Andrew Wilson, Björk approached McQueen after seeing the futuristic image of model Devon Aoki in the February 1997 edition of Visionaire. Dressed by McQueen and photographed by Nick Knight, who shot the &quot;Homogenic&quot; cover as well, Aoki wears a pink funnel-necked dress with her skin cast in a blueish metallic hue, one eyeball blankly white, a large safety pin closing a slash through her forehead, and her hair pulled into tight buns as she challenges the camera with a direct gaze.

Björk explained her vision for the &quot;Homogenic&quot; cover, which carries a resemblance to &quot;someone who is put into an impossible situation, so impossible that she has to become a warrior. A warrior who has to fight not with weapons, but with love. I had 10 kilos of hair on my head, and special contact lenses and a manicure that prevented me from eating with my fingers, and gaffer tape around my waist and high clogs so I couldn&#x27;t walk easily.&quot;

== Release and promotion ==

The album was released later than One Little Indian Records had intended. Björk was behind schedule and the album&#x27;s cover design by Nick Knight needed a reshoot. Towards the end of August 1997, One Little Indian delayed the album by a month. &quot;Homogenic&quot; was released on 22 September 1997 on One Little Indian in the United Kingdom and on 23 September Elektra Records in North America on compact disc and cassette. The album was later issued on vinyl and DualDisc formats. The Japanese version of &quot;Homogenic&quot; included several bonus tracks and remixed versions of songs. The DualDisc release featured the full album on the CD side and the DVD side included the album with superior sound quality and the music videos for the singles.

Promotion of &quot;Homogenic&quot; started on 8 June 1997, when Björk performed several songs from the album at the Tibetan Freedom Concert held at Downing Stadium in New York City. The album was launched on 15 July at the Old Truman Brewery in London. In the United Kingdom, Björk performed the lead single &quot;Jóga&quot; on &quot;TFI Friday&quot; on 19 September, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 3 October. She performed the second single &quot;Bachelorette&quot; on the American sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 18 October, at the 1997 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; with &quot;Jóga&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot; on 29 November, and again in the United States on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on 22 May 1998. In France, Björk performed &quot;Bachelorette&quot; with &quot;Jóga&quot; on &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot; on 11 February, and with &quot;Hunter&quot; on &quot;Hit Machine&quot; on 20 June. She performed the fourth single &quot;Alarm Call&quot; on &quot;&quot; on 5 December.

When the release of &quot;Homogenic&quot; was delayed by a month, its tour began with the audience not being familiar with the album&#x27;s songs since it had not been released yet. The tour started at the beginning of September with a backing band that consisted only of Mark Bell and made stops in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain, and England. These shows were brief live shows lasting about half an hour consisting of only new material. Another tour took place in late October and lasted less than four weeks. Stops on this tour included Italy, Switzerland, France, England, Scotland, Germany, Ireland, and Denmark. In late November, Björk was diagnosed with a kidney infection and while she was still healthy she was advised to take a three-week rest and was forced to cancel her American tour. In 1998, a North American tour with Radiohead was announced but canceled later due to difficulty of changing the stage between performances of the acts. Björk had another tour in the middle of 1998 through Europe, and outside of the continent through other countries, including Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Opening acts for portions of the tour included electronic musician μ-Ziq.

==Singles==
&quot;Jóga&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Homogenic&quot; on 15 September 1997 to widespread critical acclaim. It peaked atop the Íslenski Listinn Topp 40 in Iceland, while reaching the top 20 in Finland. Due to its formats, it was initially ineligible to enter the UK Singles Chart, but later peaked at number 191. Its mostly computer-animated accompanying music video was directed by Michel Gondry and focuses primarily on different Icelandic terrains and landscapes with Björk&#x27;s presence only in the beginning and towards the end.

&quot;Bachelorette&quot; was released as the second single on 8 December. While less successful than &quot;Jóga&quot; in Björk&#x27;s native Iceland, peaking at number six, it was an improvement from &quot;Jóga&quot; in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at numbers 21 and two on the UK Singles Chart and UK Indie Chart, respectively. Gondry returned to direct the music video for &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, which features Björk as Bachelorette, a woman who finds a book titled &quot;My Story&quot; buried in her garden which begins to write itself, describing what Bachelorette does as she describes it. It won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video.

&quot;Hunter&quot; was released as the third single on 5 October 1998. Despite being critically acclaimed, it was a commercial failure, as it peaked only at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart. Its accompanying music video, directed by Paul White, features a close-up of a bald Björk singing into the camera as she morphs into a polar bear and then back to her original state.

&quot;Alarm Call&quot; was originally scheduled for release as the third single, but switched places with &quot;Hunter&quot;. It was released as the fourth single on 30 November 1998 and returned Björk to the top ten of Íslenski Listinn Topp 40, as its French mix peaked at number ten. In the UK, the song peaked at numbers 33 and three on the UK Singles Chart and UK Indie Chart, respectively. The song&#x27;s accompanying music video was directed by Alexander McQueen, who designed the cover artwork for &quot;Homogenic&quot;, and features Björk floating on a raft on a river in the jungle and her scenes are intercut with footage of snakes, crocodiles, and other animals, with Björk playing with them.

&quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; was released as the fifth and final single on 7 June 1999. DVD single was simultaneously released; some publications regard it as the first DVD single release ever. Critically acclaimed, the song peaked at numbers 24 and three on the UK Singles Chart and UK Indie Chart, respectively. It became the only single from &quot;Homogenic&quot; to enter a chart in the United States, peaking at number eight on the Dance/Electronic Singles Sales chart. Directed by Chris Cunningham, the song&#x27;s music video depicts Björk as a robot being assembled in a factory, who passionately kisses another robot. The video is often cited as one of the best of all time and a milestone in computer animation; it has been displayed in art exhibitions and was on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Homogenic&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Homogenic&quot; could have been stuffy and dull — Sting with a sex-change operation. It&#x27;s a testament to Bjork&#x27;s continued weirdness that even overtures toward adulthood come out delightfully skewed&quot;. Neva Chonin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited it as &quot;one of the boldest – and most exciting – albums of the year&quot;, while &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Richard Cromelin wrote that it &quot;affirms [Björk&#x27;s] stature as one of pop music&#x27;s most uncompromising adventurers&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Ted Kessler praised &quot;Homogenic&quot; as Björk&#x27;s best album and &quot;her most emotional, highly charged and groovy record, as well as a stinging triumph for the spirit of adventure,&quot; while &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; remarked that it &quot;boldly ventures into the techno future while never losing its intensely personal vision and human heart&quot;. In another positive review, &quot;Spin&quot; opined that with the album, Björk didn&#x27;t &quot;demonize the artificial and assign innocence to the natural.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that her voice on &quot;Homogenic&quot; was &quot;like a beacon guiding the listener through a strange, wonderful forest of sound.&quot;

Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the &quot;emotional kick&quot; that she found &quot;Post&quot; lacked, in addition to lyricism she found to be &quot;less opaque&quot;. Though &quot;Music Week&quot; praised the album for its &quot;darker atmosphere&quot; and &quot;more consistent sound&quot;, a more negative review came from Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, who said in contrast that &quot;&quot;Homogenic&quot; is stylish enough, and it&#x27;s as restlessly creative as you&#x27;d expect, but the album rarely gives Björk&#x27;s songs a chance to assert themselves&quot;.

==Accolades==
American critics rated &quot;Homogenic&quot; highly in year-end polls. It ranked at number nine in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, while &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it number four in their &quot;Top 20 Albums of the Year&quot;. In Britain, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked it at number 33 in the &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 15 in a critics&#x27; poll. In 2024, the album was ranked at number 45 on Apple Music&#x27;s 100 Best albums of All Time.

&quot;Homogenic&quot; was nominated in the Best Alternative Music Performance category at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards (1998), losing to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

Michel Gondry&#x27;s music video for &quot;Bachelorette&quot; was nominated for Best Short Form Music Video at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards (1999), but lost to Jonas Åkerlund&#x27;s video for Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. At the next year&#x27;s ceremony, Chris Cunningham&#x27;s video for &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; was nominated for the same award, but lost to Korn&#x27;s &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot;.

&quot;Homogenic&quot; earned Björk the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist at the 1998 ceremony. Accepting the award, she declared: &quot;I am grateful grapefruit.&quot;

Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke cited it as his favourite album. &quot;She&#x27;s a real genius,&quot; he said. &quot;No one&#x27;s been as radical or innovative and still made pop music. I got into it when I was first discovering music. It still has a deep resonance for me.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Homogenic&quot; debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart on 4 October 1997, spending 17 weeks on the chart. It debuted at number six on the Australian Albums Chart on 12 October 1997, but descended to number 45 after five weeks on the chart. The album debuted at number eight on the New Zealand Albums Chart on 12 October 1997, and peaked at number six the following week, but descended after six weeks on the chart.

In the United States, &quot;Homogenic&quot; debuted at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, spending a total of nine weeks inside the chart, where its final position was at number 164. The album was certified gold on 1 August 2001 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies. &quot;Homogenic&quot; debuted at twenty on the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming Björk&#x27;s first album to enter the chart but spent only one week there. It was certified gold by the Music Canada on 12 June 1998.

== Impact and legacy ==

In the years following its release, &quot;Homogenic&quot; has continued to receive acclaim from critics, audiences and musicians. In a retrospective review, Heather Phares of AllMusic cited &quot;Homogenic&quot; as being more emotionally deep than any of Björk&#x27;s previous work and called it a &quot;seamless fusion of chilly strings, stuttering, abstract beats, and unique touches like an accordion and glass harmonica.&quot; In 2002, &quot;Homogenic&quot; placed at number ten on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s list of &quot;The Greatest Electronic Albums of the 20th Century&quot;. In 2003, it was placed at number 21 on the music webzine &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the top one hundred albums of the 1990s, in which it was praised as &quot;one of the most perfectly formed records of any era, and it is entirely possible that Björk will never approach this level of consistently enrapturing beauty again&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; critic Sal Cinquemani wrote that &quot;if not the greatest electronic album of all time, it&#x27;s certainly the greatest of its decade&quot;. The same year, &quot;Spin&quot; writer Phoebe Reilly called it Björk&#x27;s &quot;most sublime and vulnerable album&quot; in a career retrospective. In 2011, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed the album at number one on their list of best albums of the 1990s. In 2017, Philip Sherburne of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; observed that it &quot;showcased a newly focused side of the musician while embracing all of her most provocative contradictions.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 202 on its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 2023, British &quot;GQ&quot; ranked it at number four on their list of ten best electronic albums of all time.

According to &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot;, &quot;Homogenic&quot; is &quot;one of the most groundbreaking albums of all-time, an album that assuredly caused countless hearts to soar.&quot; With &quot;Homogenic&quot;, Björk has been credited for connecting art pop to electronic dance music. Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork described the album as impactful on Björk&#x27;s own discography, stating: &quot;In retrospect, it&#x27;s easy to see the way that &quot;Homogenic&quot; paves the way for later career triumphs like &quot;Vespertine&quot; and &quot;Vulnicura&quot;: In its formal audacity and sustained emotional intensity, it represents a phase shift from &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;, fine though they were.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Radiohead singer Thom Yorke called the song &quot;Unravel&quot; &quot;one of the most beautiful songs I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; The band would cover the song as part of a 2007 live webcast. Their guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien claimed Björk inspired them to change their musical style for their fourth studio album &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), stating: &quot;I think we&#x27;ve all been a bit envious about the way Björk has been able to reinvent music.&quot; &quot;Homogenic&quot; has also been noted to have had influence on Kanye West by various sources, as he departed hip hop in favor of a more experimental sound for his fourth studio album &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; (2008).

<doc id="493399" wikidata="Q622324" url="?curid=493399" title="Loudness">
<text>In acoustics, loudness is the subjective perception of sound pressure. More formally, it is defined as the &quot;attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud&quot;. The relation of physical attributes of sound to perceived loudness consists of physical, physiological and psychological components. The study of apparent loudness is included in the topic of psychoacoustics and employs methods of psychophysics.

In different industries, loudness may have different meanings and different measurement standards. Some definitions, such as ITU-R BS.1770 refer to the relative loudness of different segments of electronically reproduced sounds, such as for broadcasting and cinema. Others, such as ISO 532A (Stevens loudness, measured in sones), ISO 532B (Zwicker loudness), DIN 45631 and ASA/ANSI S3.4, have a more general scope and are often used to characterize loudness of environmental noise. More modern standards, such as Nordtest ACOU112 and ISO/AWI 532-3 (in progress) take into account other components of loudness, such as onset rate, time variation and spectral masking.

Loudness, a subjective measure, is often confused with physical measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. Weighting filters such as A-weighting and LKFS attempt to compensate measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the typical human.

== Explanation ==
The perception of loudness is related to sound pressure level (SPL), frequency content and duration of a sound. The relationship between SPL and loudness of a single tone can be approximated by Stevens&#x27;s power law in which SPL has an exponent of 0.67. A more precise model known as the &quot;Inflected Exponential function&quot;, indicates that loudness increases with a higher exponent at low and high levels and with a lower exponent at moderate levels.

The sensitivity of the human ear changes as a function of frequency, as shown in the equal-loudness graph. Each line on this graph shows the SPL required for frequencies to be perceived as equally loud, and different curves pertain to different sound pressure levels. It also shows that humans with normal hearing are most sensitive to sounds around 2–4 kHz, with sensitivity declining to either side of this region. A complete model of the perception of loudness will include the integration of SPL by frequency.

Historically, loudness was measured using an ear-balancing method with an audiometer in which the amplitude of a sine wave was adjusted by the user to equal the perceived loudness of the sound being evaluated. Contemporary standards for measurement of loudness are based on the summation of energy in critical bands.

== Hearing loss ==
When sensorineural hearing loss (damage to the cochlea or in the brain) is present, the perception of loudness is altered. Sounds at low levels (often perceived by those without hearing loss as relatively quiet) are no longer audible to the hearing impaired, but sounds at high levels often are perceived as having the same loudness as they would for an unimpaired listener. This phenomenon can be explained by two theories, called &quot;loudness recruitment&quot; and &quot;softness imperception&quot;.

Loudness recruitment posits that loudness grows more rapidly for certain listeners than normal listeners with changes in level. This theory has been accepted as the classical explanation.

Softness imperception, a term coined by Mary Florentine around 2002, proposes that some listeners with sensorineural hearing loss may exhibit a normal rate of loudness growth, but instead have an elevated loudness at their threshold. That is, the softest sound that is audible to these listeners is louder than the softest sound audible to normal listeners.

==Compensation==
The &quot;loudness&quot; control associated with a loudness compensation feature on some consumer stereos alters the frequency response curve to correspond roughly with the equal loudness characteristic of the ear. Loudness compensation is intended to make the recorded music sound more natural when played at a lower levels by boosting low frequencies, to which the ear is less sensitive at lower sound pressure levels.

==Normalization==
Loudness normalization is a specific type of audio normalization that equalizes perceived level such that, for instance, commercials do not sound louder than television programs. Loudness normalization schemes exist for a number of audio applications.

===Broadcast===
* Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act
* EBU R 128

===Movie and home theaters===
* Dialnorm

===Music playback===
* Sound Check in iTunes
* ReplayGain
* Normalization systems built into streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube.

==Measurement==
Historically sone (loudness &quot;N&quot;) and phon (loudness level &quot;LN&quot;) units have been used to measure loudness.

A-weighting follows human sensitivity to sound and describes relative perceived loudness for at quiet to moderate speech levels, around 40 phons.

Relative loudness monitoring in production is measured in accordance with ITU-R BS.1770 in units of LKFS. Work began on ITU-R BS.1770 in 2001 after 0 dBFS+ level distortion in converters and lossy codecs had become evident; and the original Leq(RLB) loudness metric was proposed by Gilbert Soulodre in 2003. Based on data from subjective listening tests, Leq(RLB) compared favorably to numerous other algorithms. CBC, Dolby and TC Electronic and numerous broadcasters contributed to the listening tests. Loudness levels measured according to the Leq(RLB) specified in ITU-R BS.1770 are reported in LKFS units.

The ITU-R BS.1770 measurement system was improved for made multi-channel applications (monaural to 5.1 surround sound). To make the loudness metric cross-genre friendly, a relative measurement gate was added. This work was carried out in 2008 by the EBU. The improvements were brought back into BS.1770-2. ITU subsequently updated the true-peak metric (BS.1770-3) and added provision for even more audio channels, for instance 22.2 surround sound (BS.1770-4).

<doc id="493403" wikidata="Q2254404" url="?curid=493403" title="Differentiable curve">
<text>Differential geometry of curves is the branch of geometry that deals with smooth curves in the plane and the Euclidean space by methods of differential and integral calculus.

Many specific curves have been thoroughly investigated using the synthetic approach. Differential geometry takes another path: curves are represented in a parametrized form, and their geometric properties and various quantities associated with them, such as the curvature and the arc length, are expressed via derivatives and integrals using vector calculus. One of the most important tools used to analyze a curve is the Frenet frame, a moving frame that provides a coordinate system at each point of the curve that is &quot;best adapted&quot; to the curve near that point.

The theory of curves is much simpler and narrower in scope than the theory of surfaces and its higher-dimensional generalizations because a regular curve in a Euclidean space has no intrinsic geometry. Any regular curve may be parametrized by the arc length (the &quot;natural parametrization&quot;). From the point of view of a theoretical point particle on the curve that does not know anything about the ambient space, all curves would appear the same. Different space curves are only distinguished by how they bend and twist. Quantitatively, this is measured by the differential-geometric invariants called the &quot;curvature&quot; and the &quot;torsion&quot; of a curve. The fundamental theorem of curves asserts that the knowledge of these invariants completely determines the curve.

== Definitions ==

A &quot;parametric&quot; -&quot;curve&quot; or a -&quot;parametrization&quot; is a vector-valued function 
formula_1
that is -times continuously differentiable (that is, the component functions of are continuously differentiable), where formula_2, formula_3, and is a non-empty interval of real numbers. The of the parametric curve is formula_4. The parametric curve and its image must be distinguished because a given subset of formula_5 can be the image of many distinct parametric curves. The parameter in can be thought of as representing time, and the trajectory of a moving point in space. When is a closed interval , is called the starting point and is the endpoint of . If the starting and the end points coincide (that is, ), then is a &quot;closed curve&quot; or a &quot;loop&quot;. To be a -loop, the function must be -times continuously differentiable and satisfy for .

The parametric curve is if
formula_6
is injective. It is if each component function of is an analytic function, that is, it is of class .

The curve is &quot;regular of order&quot; (where ) if, for every ,
formula_7
is a linearly independent subset of formula_5. In particular, a parametric -curve is if and only if for any .

== Re-parametrization and equivalence relation ==
Given the image of a parametric curve, there are several different parametrizations of the parametric curve. Differential geometry aims to describe the properties of parametric curves that are invariant under certain reparametrizations. A suitable equivalence relation on the set of all parametric curves must be defined. The differential-geometric properties of a parametric curve (such as its length, its Frenet frame, and its generalized curvature) are invariant under reparametrization and therefore properties of the equivalence class itself. The equivalence classes are called -curves and are central objects studied in the differential geometry of curves.

Two parametric -curves, formula_9 and formula_10, are said to be if and only if there exists a bijective -map such that
formula_11
and
formula_12
 is then said to be a of .

Re-parametrization defines an equivalence relation on the set of all parametric -curves of class . The equivalence class of this relation simply a -curve.

An even &quot;finer&quot; equivalence relation of oriented parametric -curves can be defined by requiring to satisfy .

Equivalent parametric -curves have the same image, and equivalent oriented parametric -curves even traverse the image in the same direction.

==Length and natural parametrization==

The length of a parametric -curve formula_13 is defined as
formula_14
The length of a parametric curve is invariant under reparametrization and is therefore a differential-geometric property of the parametric curve.

For each regular parametric -curve formula_13, where , the function is defined
formula_16
Writing , where is the inverse function of . This is a re-parametrization of that is called an &quot;&quot;, &quot;natural parametrization&quot;, &quot;unit-speed parametrization&quot;. The parameter is called the of .

This parametrization is preferred because the natural parameter traverses the image of at unit speed, so that
formula_17
In practice, it is often very difficult to calculate the natural parametrization of a parametric curve, but it is useful for theoretical arguments.

For a given parametric curve , the natural parametrization is unique up to a shift of parameter.

The quantity
formula_18
is sometimes called the or action of the curve; this name is justified because the geodesic equations are the Euler–Lagrange equations of motion for this action.

== Frenet frame ==

A Frenet frame is a moving reference frame of orthonormal vectors which are used to describe a curve locally at each point . It is the main tool in the differential geometric treatment of curves because it is far easier and more natural to describe local properties (e.g. curvature, torsion) in terms of a local reference system than using a global one such as Euclidean coordinates.

Given a -curve in formula_5 which is regular of order the Frenet frame for the curve is the set of orthonormal vectors
formula_20
called Frenet vectors. They are constructed from the derivatives of using the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm with
formula_21

The real-valued functions are called generalized curvatures and are defined as
formula_22

The Frenet frame and the generalized curvatures are invariant under reparametrization and are therefore differential geometric properties of the curve. For curves in formula_23 formula_24 is the curvature and formula_25 is the torsion.

===Bertrand curve===
A Bertrand curve is a regular curve in formula_23 with the additional property that there is a second curve in formula_23 such that the principal normal vectors to these two curves are identical at each corresponding point. In other words, if and are two curves in formula_23 such that for any , the two principal normals are equal, then and are Bertrand curves, and is called the Bertrand mate of . We can write for some constant .

According to problem 25 in Kühnel&#x27;s &quot;Differential Geometry Curves – Surfaces – Manifolds&quot;, it is also true that two Bertrand curves that do not lie in the same two-dimensional plane are characterized by the existence of a linear relation where and are the curvature and torsion of and and are real constants with . Furthermore, the product of torsions of a Bertrand pair of curves is constant.
If has more than one Bertrand mate then it has infinitely many. This only occurs when is a circular helix.

== Special Frenet vectors and generalized curvatures ==

The first three Frenet vectors and generalized curvatures can be visualized in three-dimensional space. They have additional names and more semantic information attached to them.

=== Tangent vector ===

If a curve represents the path of a particle, then the instantaneous velocity of the particle at a given point is expressed by a vector, called the &quot;tangent vector&quot; to the curve at . Mathematically, given a parametrized curve , for every value of the parameter, the vector
formula_29
is the tangent vector at the point . Generally speaking, the tangent vector may be zero. The tangent vector&#x27;s magnitude
formula_30
is the speed at the time .

The first Frenet vector is the unit tangent vector in the same direction, defined at each regular point of :
formula_31
If is the natural parameter, then the tangent vector has unit length. The formula simplifies:
formula_32
The unit tangent vector determines the orientation of the curve, or the forward direction, corresponding to the increasing values of the parameter. The unit tangent vector taken as a curve traces the spherical image of the original curve.

=== Normal vector or curvature vector ===

A curve &quot;normal vector&quot;, sometimes called the curvature vector, indicates the deviance of the curve from being a straight line.
It is defined as
formula_33

Its normalized form, the unit normal vector, is the second Frenet vector and is defined as
formula_34

The tangent and the normal vector at point define the osculating plane at point .

It can be shown that . Therefore,
formula_35

===Curvature===
The first generalized curvature is called curvature and measures the deviance of from being a straight line relative to the osculating plane. It is defined as
formula_36
and is called the curvature of at point . It can be shown that
formula_37

The reciprocal of the curvature
formula_38
is called the radius of curvature.

A circle with radius has a constant curvature of 
formula_39
whereas a line has a curvature of 0.

=== Binormal vector ===
The unit binormal vector is the third Frenet vector . It is always orthogonal to the unit tangent and normal vectors at . It is defined as

formula_40

In 3-dimensional space, the equation simplifies to
formula_41
or to 
formula_42
That either sign may occur is illustrated by the examples of a right-handed helix and a left-handed helix.

=== Torsion ===
The second generalized curvature is called and measures the deviance of from being a plane curve. In other words, if the torsion is zero, the curve lies completely in the same osculating plane (there is only one osculating plane for every point ). It is defined as
formula_43
and is called the torsion of at point .

=== Aberrancy ===
The third derivative may be used to define aberrancy, a metric of non-circularity of a curve.

== Main theorem of curve theory ==

Given functions:
formula_44
then there exists a unique (up to transformations using the Euclidean group) -curve which is regular of order and has the following properties:
formula_45
where the set
formula_20
is the Frenet frame for the curve.

By additionally providing a start in , a starting point in formula_5 and an initial positive orthonormal Frenet frame with
formula_48
the Euclidean transformations are eliminated to obtain a unique curve .

== Frenet–Serret formulas ==

The Frenet–Serret formulas are a set of ordinary differential equations of first order. The solution is the set of Frenet vectors describing the curve specified by the generalized curvature functions .

<doc id="493406" wikidata="Q473061" url="?curid=493406" title="Jim Ramstad">
<text>James Marvin Ramstad (May 6, 1946 – November 5, 2020) was an American lawyer and politician who represented Minnesota&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, Ramstad served in the Minnesota Senate from 1981 to 1991.

Ramstad was first elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1981 and was reelected until 1990, when he was elected to represent Minnesota’s 3rd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ramstad won reelection in the suburban congressional district eight times, all by landslide margins. He had a reputation as a moderate Republican. Ramstad chose to retire and not seek reelection in 2008. He was succeeded by Republican State Representative Erik Paulsen. Throughout his legislative career and later life, Ramstad, empowered by his prior struggles with alcoholism, was a notable advocate for addiction recovery.

In 2020, Ramstad died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 74.

==Early life and education==
Ramstad was born in Jamestown, North Dakota on May 6, 1946. He was educated at the University of Minnesota and the George Washington University Law School. He was an officer in the United States Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974. He also worked as a private practice attorney and as a legislative aide to the Minnesota House of Representatives.

==Career==
He served on the Wayzata-Plymouth Chemical Health Commission, Plymouth Human Rights Commission, and the Minnesota State Human Rights Advisory Committee from 1979 to 1980.

Ramstad was a Republican member of the Minnesota State Senate from 1981 to 1990 before entering the U.S. Congress. He served in the 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th, 109th, and 110th congresses, beginning on January 3, 1991. He first defeated former Minneapolis city councilman Lou DeMars in the 1990 election.

===Tenure===
Ramstad was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1991 until 2009, representing Minnesota&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, one of eight congressional districts in Minnesota. On September 17, 2007 Ramstad announced he would not seek reelection in 2008. He reiterated his statement on December 19, 2007.

Ramstad considered ending discrimination against those suffering from mental health and addiction problems a major part of his legacy. He worked under both Republican and Democratic majorities to pass a Mental Health Parity Bill. Mental Health Parity was eventually passed and signed into law in December, 2008.

Ramstad was mentioned as a possible candidate for Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in the administration of President Barack Obama. However, the position eventually went to former Seattle police chief Gil Kerlikowske.

Ramstad considered running for Governor of Minnesota in the 2010 election, but decided not to.

At the time of his death, Ramstad was a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics where he was leading a study group titled The Policy and Politics of Addiction.

===Political positions===
Ramstad was a member of The Republican Main Street Partnership. He was pro-choice and supported embryonic stem cell research. He was opposed to gay marriage. He voted in favor of an amendment to a whistleblower protection bill that would have allowed the government to influence stem-cell research.

He was considered to be the most moderate Republican member of the Minnesota delegation in the 109th Congress, scoring 68 percent conservative by a conservative group and 21% progressive by a liberal group.

==Personal life==
Ramstad was a recovering alcoholic. For a time, he was Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy&#x27;s Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor. He was a long-time advocate for addiction treatment and recovery services, and at the time of his death he had been sober for 39 years.

Ramstad&#x27;s sister, Sheryl Ramstad, is a Tax Court judge in Minnesota. Ramstad was a member of the United Church of Christ.

On February 25, 2008, it was announced that Ramstad had been elected to the board of directors of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

In 2010, Ramstad joined alliantgroup as a senior advisor on their Strategic Advisory Board.

He died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on November 5, 2020, aged 74, at his home in Wayzata, Minnesota.

<text>The Peasants&#x27; Land Bank () was a financial institution in the Russian Empire founded by nobles during the reign of Alexander III.

==History==
The Peasants&#x27; Land Bank was created to help peasants purchase their own farms. The Peasants&#x27; Land Bank was somewhat limited in its effectiveness by a lack of funding; it was also not nearly as generous as the Nobles&#x27; Land Bank, which had lower interest rates. Nikolai von Bunge also abolished the poll tax, which was only paid by peasants, in 1886, which helped to reduce the financial burden the peasants faced.

The bank began operations in April 1883, with nine branches. In 1888, its activity was extended to include the Kingdom of Poland; by 1891, it had thirty-nine branches.

Each bank was managed by a council consisting of: a manager; an assistant manager; three others appointed by the Ministry of Finance; and lastly a member representing the Ministry of Agriculture.

Under Peter Stolypin, the Land Bank was extended to make it easier for the peasants to set up their own farms, and by 1907, 670.3 million roubles had been repaid out of a total of 2,012 million.

<text>Scaramouche is a historical novel by Rafael Sabatini, originally published in 1921. A romantic adventure, &quot;Scaramouche&quot; tells the story of a young lawyer during the French Revolution. In the course of his adventures, he becomes an actor portraying Scaramouche (a roguish buffoon character in the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;). He also becomes a revolutionary, politician, and fencing-master, confounding his enemies with his powerful orations and swordsmanship. He is forced by circumstances to change sides several times. The book also depicts his transformation from cynic to idealist.

The three-part novel opens with the line: &quot;He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad.&quot; This line is Sabatini&#x27;s epitaph, inscribed on his gravestone in Adelboden, Switzerland. It is also inscribed on an archway in the entrance of the Humanities Quadrangle at Yale University.

==Plot==

===The Robe===
Andre-Louis Moreau, educated as a lawyer, lives in the village of Gavrillac in Brittany with his godfather, Quentin de Kercadiou, the Lord of Gavrillac, who refuses to disclose Moreau&#x27;s parentage. Moreau has grown up alongside Aline, de Kercadiou&#x27;s niece, and their relationship is that of cousins. Because he loves her as a cousin, he warns her against marrying the Marquis de la Tour d&#x27;Azyr; however, she is ambitious and wishes to marry high, so she ignores him. A peasant, Mabey, is shot for poaching by the gamekeeper of the Marquis de la Tour d&#x27;Azyr, on the Marquis&#x27;s instructions. The idealistic Philippe de Vilmorin, a seminarian and Moreau&#x27;s closest friend, denounces the act as murder. While pleading with the Marquis for justice, de Vilmorin is provoked into duelling with the Marquis and is killed for his &quot;gift of eloquence&quot;, which the Marquis fears will set the common people against the clergy and nobility. 

Moreau vows to avenge the death by undertaking Vilmorin&#x27;s work, even though Moreau himself does not believe in the cause. He sets off from Gavrillac for Rennes, expecting that the King&#x27;s lieutenant in Brittany will see justice done. After being brushed off by the arrogant official, who refuses to act against a man of the Marquis&#x27; status, Moreau discovers a large political gathering where one of the speakers against the nobility&#x27;s excesses has been assassinated. Much to the surprise of his peers, who think he is on the side of the aristocracy, Moreau uses de Vilmorin&#x27;s arguments to deliver a speech with inspiring rhetoric. Moreau goes on to Nantes and, using the name &quot;Omnes Omnibus&quot;, whips up the crowds there. These events set the stage for the French Revolution and make Moreau a wanted man.

===The Buskin===
To hide from the law, Moreau joins a troupe of traveling commedia dell&#x27;arte actors, led by M. Binet. He takes on the role of Scaramouche, the scheming rogue. He discovers an aptitude for acting and writing that propels the troupe from near-poverty to success and the Feydau theater in Nantes. Binet, who plays &quot;Pantaloon&quot;, grows ever more resentful of Moreau and his influence in the troupe. Moreau becomes engaged to Binet&#x27;s daughter, Climene, but after Andre-Louis reveals that he is not of noble birth, she (to her father&#x27;s delight) accepts a proposition from the Marquis de la Tour d&#x27;Azyr and becomes his mistress. 

Aline learns of the affair and, furious with the Marquis for carrying on with Climene while he is supposed to be wooing her, Aline breaks off relations with him. The Marquis, now notorious for brutally quelling an uprising in Rennes, is lying low in Nantes. When he attends a performance, Moreau reveals his presence to the audience and sparks a riot. When Binet, furious at being ruined, attacks Moreau, Moreau shoots him in self-defense. Binet is wounded, and Moreau escapes. It is later revealed that, during Binet&#x27;s recovery, his entire troupe deserted him and actually thrived without him; he and his daughter (who was &quot;dumped&quot; by the Marquis following the riot) are both completely ruined.

===The Sword===
Moreau is now forced to go into hiding. Arriving in Paris, he finds a fencing academy seeking &quot;a young man of good address with some knowledge of swordsmanship&quot;. Moreau manages to convince M. Bertrand des Amis, the &quot;&quot; (master at arms), to hire him. Eventually, des Amis sees that Andre-Louis shows promise as a swordsman and makes him his apprentice. Over time, Andre-Louis develops his own style of fencing, based on calculations of different moves, and the school begins to prosper. With the outbreak of the French Revolution, M. des Amis is killed in a street riot, and Moreau inherits the school. When he is established at the now-thriving school, he reconciles with his godfather, thanks to Aline and Mme. de Plougastel. Mme. de Plougastel is a relative of his godfather; Moreau has seen her only once in his life, but she takes an almost maternal interest in him. 

The reconciliation is brief, however. After learning of his swordsmanship, Moreau&#x27;s friends convince him to take a seat in the Estates General of 1789. They face the scourge of &quot;spadassinicides&quot;, aristocratic senators who provoke inexperienced Republicans to fight duels and wound or kill them, just as the Marquis did to de Vilmorin. Indeed, de La Tour d&#x27;Azyr is the chief &quot;spadassinicide&quot;. Andre-Louis turns the tables and succeeds in killing or seriously wounding all who challenge him. Finally, Moreau manages to goad the Marquis into challenging him to a duel; at last, he can confront the murderer of his childhood friend, de Vilmorin. Hearing of this, Mme. de Plougastel and Aline hasten to stop the duel. They do not arrive in time, and they see the Marquis leaving the field, wounded, but not fatally. Andre-Louis becomes a full-time member of the National Assembly, and the Marquis becomes a counter-revolutionary.

In 1792, Paris is up in arms and the Tuileries are stormed by a mob. Mme. de Plougastel and Aline are there and in grave danger because the former&#x27;s husband is a counter-revolutionary. Returning from an errand in Brittany, Moreau learns that his godfather needs travel permits to allow these two women to leave Paris, and he travels to Gavrillac to visit de Kercadiou. De Kercadiou tells him of the plight of Aline and Mme. de Plougastel in Paris. Moreau agrees to rescue Aline, but does not agree to help Mme. de Plougastel until Kercadiou reveals to Andre-Louis that Mme. de Plougastel is his mother. Moreau secures the needed travel permits and leaves to deliver them to the women. 

However, before he arrives, de La Tour d&#x27;Azyr, on the run from the mob, seeks shelter in the same apartment as the women. He and Andre-Louis draw pistols on each other. Mme. de Plougastel is forced to reveal that the Marquis is Moreau&#x27;s father. Andre-Louis refuses to reconcile with the Marquis but decides to end the feud with him and gives him one of the travel permits. De La Tour d&#x27;Azyr crosses safely to Austria and enters the service of the king of Austria.

Moreau knows that he cannot remain in Paris, or even in France, because of his recent actions. He decides to cross the border with the women and his godfather. After safely escaping from Paris and returning to relative safety in Gavrillac, Andre-Louis and Aline unravel their misconceptions about their feelings for each other and declare their love.

==&quot;Scaramouche the Kingmaker&quot;==
A decade later, Sabatini wrote a sequel titled &quot;Scaramouche the Kingmaker&quot; that was not as well received. It was Sabatini&#x27;s first attempt at a series.

The book continues the adventures of Andre-Louis Moreau, beginning where the original &quot;Scaramouche&quot; ends. Moreau conceives and then masterminds, with the Baron de Batz, a plan to destroy the Revolution and restore the monarchy. Their plan is to expose the Revolutionary leaders—hitherto thought of by the French populace as incorruptible patriots—as corrupt profiteers. While Andre-Louis is in France, working for the restoration, in Germany, the Regent of France attempts to seduce Andre-Louis&#x27;s fiancée, Aline de Kercadiou.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Scaramouche&quot; was adapted into several works:
*A play by Barbara Field
*After a trip to the United States, composer Darius Milhaud wrote a theatrical piece, &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1922), for saxophone and orchestra.
*A feature film, &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1923), starring Ramon Novarro as Moreau and Lewis Stone as the Marquis de la Tour d&#x27;Azyr
*A tradaptation, () (1929), a novel in Sinhala by Martin Wickremasinghe
*A remake, &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1952) with Stewart Granger, which includes one of the longest swashbuckling sword-fighting scenes ever filmed. Lewis Stone appears as Georges de Valmorin
*&quot;Niklāvs Strunke, who often resided in Italy from 1923, was considered the connoisseur of commedia dell&#x27;arte in Latvia.&quot; Osvalds Lemānis helped to choreograph the Latvian adaptation of &quot;Scaramouche&quot;, with performer Rūdolfs Saule, performing the role as an itinerant violinist who had wandered into Leilon&#x27;s castle. Obsessed by the striving to subdue other people, the musician &quot;destroys the harmony of souls creating a devilish atmosphere of anxiety and foreboding&quot;.

<text>Beth Nicole Torbert (born June 15, 1971) is a Canadian singer best known by her stage name Bif Naked. Between 1996 and 2016, she was among the top 150 selling Canadian artists in Canada. She charted #1 on Billboard Canada for the single Spaceman and was heavy rotation on MTV TRL for the video Moment of Weakness. The album I Bificus was multiplatinum internationally.

==Early life and education==
Bif Naked was born in New Delhi, India, on June 15, 1971, to teenage parents attending boarding school. She was subsequently adopted by American missionaries. She spent part of her childhood in Lexington, Kentucky, where her father was a professor at the University of Kentucky. She went to Kelsey Elementary School in The Pas, Manitoba, for a couple of years. After living for a time in Dauphin, Manitoba, her family eventually settled in Winnipeg. She graduated from John Taylor Collegiate and studied theatre at the University of Winnipeg. After University, she began pursuing a career as a stand-up comic.

The name &quot;Bif&quot; started as a nickname based on the mispronunciation of her real name, Beth.

==Career==
After spending several years singing with several underground bands, Bif Naked independently released a self-titled solo album, &quot;Bif Naked&quot;, in 1994, and &quot;I Bificus&quot; in 1998. In 1999 she toured across Canada.

Another solo album, &quot;Purge&quot; was released in 2001. She also released a spoken word album called &quot;Okenspay Ordway: Things I Forgot To Tell Mommy&quot;. In 2005, after narrowing it down from over fifty songs, she released &quot;Superbeautifulmonster&quot;, which featured thirteen tracks. &quot;The Promise&quot;, which was recorded while Bif was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, was released in 2009 and was dedicated to her fans. The album featured tracks mixed by Juno Award winner Mike Fraser. In 2011, after doing acoustic sets on tour, Bif released an acoustic record on Her Royal Majesty&#x27;s Records late-2013, featuring acoustic versions of her past songs as well as four previously unreleased tracks. The album is entitled &quot;BIF NAKED FOREVER: Acoustic Hits and Other Delights&quot;. Bif has also been involved on a side project, &quot;Jakkarta&quot;.

Prior to her solo career, Torbert played with punk bands Gorilla Gorilla and Chrome Dog. She has toured Europe, the United States, and Canada as a headlining act, and has performed on bills with: Snoop Dogg, Billy Idol, Dido, Devin Townsend, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, Chrissie Hynde, Foo Fighters, The Cult, Prodigy, Smashing Pumpkins, Ministry, Green Day, and many more.

She recorded a rendition of the Christmas classic, &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; CD &quot;&quot; in 1999 and was also featured on the &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; soundtrack with a cover of Twisted Sister&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;. (which was additionally used as David Arquette&#x27;s entrance theme while he was on WCW Monday Nitro). The song &quot;Dawn&quot;, taken from &quot;Purge&quot;, was featured in the film &quot;American Psycho 2&quot;, starring Mila Kunis and William Shatner.

She made a guest appearance in the song &quot;Fucker&quot;, on Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s album &quot;The New Black&quot; in 2006. Bif Naked has also made guest appearances with artists such as SNFU on the songs &quot;One Last Loveshove&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Thick&quot;. She also appeared on the Dead Celebrity Status album &quot;Blood Music&quot; on the track titled &quot;In This Day and Age&quot;. In 2011, she recorded a duet with Vancouver-based yogi and Nettwerk recording artist Will Blunderfield for the international version of his album &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

Bif Naked has also appeared in music videos for other artists including: &quot;Believe Me&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; by Moist and Liveonrelease&#x27;s &quot;Get with It.&quot; In 2009, she appeared in the video for Simple Plan&#x27;s &quot;Save You&quot; near the end along with other people (such as Sharon Osbourne and René Angélil) who have survived or have been treated for cancer.

Aside from her music career, Bif has also pursued acting. In 1990, she appeared in the film &quot;Archangel&quot;, where she was credited as &quot;Bif Torbert,&quot; playing a Russian soldier. In 1997, she played a liquor store manager in &quot;The Boys Club&quot;. She appeared in the television series &quot;Once a Thief&quot; in 1998, playing Nastassja Momomame. In 2000, she voiced the character Alison in the &quot;Daria&quot; movie, &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, playing a bisexual art camp attendee who attempts to seduce Jane Lane. She appeared in the Canadian indie films &quot;Lunch with Charles&quot; (2001) and &quot;Crossing&quot; (2005), the latter of which she recorded the song &quot;My Greatest Masterpiece&quot; for. She has done hosting work for the CBC Television series &quot;ZeD&quot; (becoming their first host in 2002), and for Bodog, hosting &quot;Bodog Fight&quot; in 2006 as well as a reality series chronicling the days leading up to her marriage with Vancouver Sun sports writer, Ian Walker, in 2007 called &quot;Bif Naked Bride&quot;.

<text>Ondo Town is the second largest town in Ondo State, Nigeria. Ondo Town is the trade center for the surrounding region; commercial crops such as yams, cassava, grain, tobacco and cotton are grown, the latter of which is often used to weave a culturally significant cloth known as Aso Oke fabric, which is commonly used to make clothing amongst the local population. Ondo Town is the largest producer of cocoa products in the region.

The title of the king of the town, who reigns as a direct descendant of the fabled Emperor Oduduwa, is &quot;Osemawe&quot;. Osamawe title originated from an unusual situation as reported by Nigerian Punch that when the favoured wife of the first Monarch had a set of twins, the king was embarrassed because it was then an abomination. He was so bewildered by the birth of the twins that he exclaimed, ‘Ese omo re’ (meaning these children are an abomination). It is said that this exclamation has through linguistic evolution changed into ‘Osemawe’, which is the title of the monarch of Ondo today. The present reigning monarch is Dr. Adesimbo Victor Kiladejo, who was crowned in September 2006 following the death of the former king, Dr. Festus Ibidapo Adesanoye.

<doc id="493413" wikidata="Q465843" url="?curid=493413" title="John Kline (politician)">
<text>John Paul Kline Jr. (born September 6, 1947) is an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from from 2003 to 2017. The district included most of the southern suburbs of the Twin Cities. A member of the Republican Party, Kline served as the Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce from 2011 until 2017. Kline retired from Congress at the end of his term in January 2017.

==Early life and education==
Kline was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the son of Litta Belle (née Rodman) and John Paul Kline, Sr. He is a 1965 graduate of W. B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. He earned a B.A. in biology at Rice University in 1969 and a Master of Public Administration from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania in 1988.

==Career==

Before his election to Congress, Kline was a 25-year career commissioned officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he was a senior military aide to Presidents Carter and Reagan and was responsible for carrying the President&#x27;s football. During his military career, Kline was a Naval Aviator who served as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, commanded all Marine aviation forces in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia, flew &quot;Marine One,&quot; the Presidential helicopter, in HMX-1, and served as Program Development Officer at Headquarters Marine Corps. He received numerous medals and commendations, including the Defense Superior Service Medal, four awards of the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, three awards of the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Presidential Service Badge. Kline retired from the Marine Corps as a colonel.

==Personal life==
Kline and his second wife, Vicky, live in Burnsville, Minnesota. Kline has two children and four grandchildren. Kline was previously married to Christine Lewis.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities
* Committee on Education and the Workforce (Chairman)
** As Chairman of the full committee, Rep. Kline may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees of which he is not already a voting member.
** Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
** Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
** Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Constitution Caucus

===Political positions===
Kline supported President Bush&#x27;s plan to increase troop levels in Iraq in January 2007.

During Kline&#x27;s 2008 bid for reelection he discussed his opposition to earmarks and his refusal to request them for his district.

In 2006, Kline voted to maintain the legal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. He voted for the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.

Kline opposed restrictions on gun ownership. He voted to repeal parts of the firearms ban for Washington, D.C. He described himself as &quot;a collector of antique guns and a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment&quot;.

Kline stated, &quot;Job creation is our nation&#x27;s no. 1 challenge and Congress must make it our no. 1 priority.&quot; He spoke in support of education reform designed to encourage parent involvement and teacher accountability. He opposed any tax increases and stated that such strategies must be taken &quot;off the table.&quot; In remarks made to fellow representatives, Kline said, &quot;we are watching a massive growth of government power, size, and spending, and I deem that unacceptable.&quot;

In 2013 Kline proposed a bill that, among other adjustments, changed the rate on subsidized Stafford loans from 3.4% to 5.9%. The bill linked the rate of interest to the rate of US borrowing.

Kline voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. His campaign site stated that &quot;he opposed Obamacare because it is a seriously flawed law that was too big, was passed too fast, and does too much harm.&quot;

===Legislation===
On April 1, 2014, Kline introduced the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend and reauthorize both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization. It was intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million. The bill passed in the House on May 7, 2014.

===Political campaigns===
Kline made his first run for office in 1998, when he challenged 6th District Democratic incumbent Bill Luther and lost, taking 46% of the vote. He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while George W. Bush narrowly carried the district.

After the 2000 census, Minnesota&#x27;s congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged. The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities&#x27; southern suburbs. At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor. The remapping left the home of the 2nd District&#x27;s freshman incumbent, Republican Mark Kennedy, just inside the reconfigured 6th District. Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district. After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.

During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the &quot;No New Taxes Party.&quot; This was done in retaliation for an ad the National Republican Congressional Committee ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. Luther subsequently admitted that his campaign had known about Garst&#x27;s false flag campaign. Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther&#x27;s 42%.

Kline then defeated Democratic Burnsville City Councilwoman Teresa Daly to win a second term in 2004 and former FBI Special agent and whistleblower Coleen Rowley, one of &quot;Time magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Persons of the Year&quot;, with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former Watertown mayor Steve Sarvi and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.

Kline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham&#x27;s PAC. After Cunningham&#x27;s indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.

Kline&#x27;s reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.

On September 3, 2015, Kline announced that he would not seek reelection in 2016.

===Campaign finance===
In the 2014 election cycle, Kline&#x27;s largest campaign contributor was the Apollo Group, a corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions. The corporation gave $33,100 to Kline&#x27;s campaign.

===Bill Maher&#x27;s &quot;Flip a District&quot; contest===
In 2014, he was the &quot;winner&quot; of comedian Bill Maher&#x27;s &quot;Flip a District&quot; from a group of 16 semifinalists nominated by viewers nationwide.

The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; reported Kline planned to raise $100,000 to counteract the notoriety brought by Maher&#x27;s campaign. Kline&#x27;s spokesman said, &quot;Minnesotans are tired of sleazy and slimy politics&quot; but Kline&#x27;s opponent &quot;certainly isn&#x27;t.&quot; Kline&#x27;s opponent, Mike Obermueller, reported a 700% increase in fundraising.

==Electoral history==

;2014
In 2014 Kline again faced Democrat Mike Obermuller. This time incumbent Kline defeated Obermuller by a 17-point margin.

;2012
In 2012, Kline defeated Democrat Mike Obermueller by 8%.

<doc id="493414" wikidata="Q44808" url="?curid=493414" title="Patrick Volkerding">
<text>Patrick Volkerding (born October 20, 1966) is the founder and maintainer of the Slackware Linux distribution. Volkerding is Slackware&#x27;s &quot;Benevolent Dictator for Life&quot; (BDFL), and is also known informally as &quot;The Man&quot;.

==Personal life==
Volkerding earned a Bachelor of Science in computer science from Minnesota State University Moorhead in 1993. Volkerding is a Deadhead, and by April 1994 had already attended 75 Grateful Dead concerts.

Volkerding is a Church of the SubGenius affiliate/member. The use of the word &quot;slack&quot; in &quot;Slackware&quot; is an homage to J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs. About the SubGenius influence on Slackware, Volkerding has stated: &quot;I&#x27;ll admit that it was SubGenius inspired. In fact, back in the 2.0 through 3.0 days we used to print a dobbshead on each CD.&quot;

Volkerding is an avid homebrewer and beer lover. Early versions of Slackware would entreat users to send him a bottle of local beer in appreciation for his work.

Volkerding was married in 2001 to Andrea and has a daughter Briah Cecilia Volkerding (b. 2005).

===Illness===
In 2004, Volkerding announced via mailing list post that he was suffering from actinomycosis, a serious illness requiring multiple rounds of antibiotics and with an uncertain prognosis. This announcement caused a number of tech news outlets to wonder about the future of the Slackware project. As of 2012, both Volkerding and the Slackware project were reported to be in a healthy state again.

==Slackware Linux==
Michael Johnston of Morse Telecommunications paid Volkerding $1 per copy sold. After that six-month contract, Robert Bruce of Walnut Creek CDROM began publishing Slackware as a CD-ROM set. Robert Bruce later became Volkerding&#x27;s partner in &quot;Slackware Linux, Inc.&quot; with Volkerding owning a non-controlling, minority, 40% share. Due to underpayment, Patrick Volkerding, &quot;told them to take it down or I&#x27;d suspend the DNS for the Slackware store&quot;.

Walnut Creek CDROM, 60% owner of &quot;Slackware Linux, Inc.&quot;, was sold to BSDi and later to Wind River Systems.

Chris Lumens and others worked for Slackware, but due to underpayment, these people lost their jobs.

For the last several years, Volkerding has managed Slackware with the help of many volunteers and testers.

==Awards==
In 2014, Volkerding received the O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Award.

<text> (Swedish for &#x27;the Vasa race&#x27;) is an annual long distance cross-country ski race held on the first Sunday of March. The course starts in the village of Berga, just south of Sälen in western Dalarna, Sweden, and ends in the town of Mora in the central part of the province. It is the oldest cross-country ski race in the world, as well as the one with the highest number of participants.

The race was inspired by a notable journey King Gustav Vasa made from Mora to Sälen when he was fleeing from Christian II&#x27;s soldiers during the winter of 1520–1521 in the beginning of the Swedish War of Liberation. According to legend, he fled on skis. The modern competition started in 1922 and it has been a part of the Worldloppet events since 1979.

== Origin ==
In 1520, the young nobleman Gustav Ericsson Vasa was fleeing from the troops of Christian II, king of Denmark, Sweden and Norway (the Kalmar Union). Much of the Swedish nobility was in opposition to the king, and had nicknamed him &quot;Christian the Tyrant&quot;. In a move to silence the opposition, Christian invited the Swedish aristocracy to a reconciliation party in Stockholm, only to have them, including Gustav&#x27;s parents, massacred in what came to be known as the Stockholm Bloodbath.

Gustav fled through Dalarna, fearing for his life if he were discovered by the king&#x27;s troops. He spoke to the men of Mora at a gathering and tried to convince them to raise a levy and start a rebellion against King Christian. The men refused to join the rebellion, and Gustav started out west, toward Norway to seek refuge. However, the men in Mora changed their minds after hearing that the Danish rulers had decided to raise taxes, and now they wanted to join the rebellion with Gustav as their leader. They sent out the two best skiers in the county, two brothers from Mora, Lars and Engelbrekt, to search for him and they caught up with him at Sälen. On 6June 1523, Gustav Vasa was crowned King of Sweden, after having defeated the Danish king Christian and dissolved the Kalmar Union. Since that day, Sweden has been an independent nation.

While Gustav traveled from Mora to Sälen, the modern race is run the opposite way, finishing in Mora.

== History ==

The idea for the race was published in &quot;Westmanlands Läns Tidning&quot; on 10February 1922 by Anders Pers from Mora. On 5March 1922, the board of IFK Mora decided to organize a trial race. Newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; sponsored the race with SEK 1,000 and with finances secured the first race was held on 19March 1922. 136 participants registered for the race and 119 started. The winner was 22-year-old Ernst Alm from Norsjö Sports Club in 7:32:49. He is also the youngest ever winner of the race.

In the 80th race, held on 7March 2004, about 15,500 skiers competed in the main event. More than 40,000 participated in one of the seven different races held during the first week of March. Vasaloppet is one of the races in the long distance cup Ski Classics.

When Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme was assassinated just two days before the race in 1986, a cancellation of that year&#x27;s race was considered. However, the race proceeded as planned with the 10,000 participants observing a moment of silence before the start.

=== Women&#x27;s participation ===

Women winners in Vasaloppet have received awards since 1997. Before that, in 1922–23 and 1981–96, women were allowed to race, but did not receive awards. The first woman to participate was Margit Nordin from Grängesberg in 1923, at 10:09:42. &quot;Falu Kuriren&quot; wrote about the event: &quot;... an incredible ovation greeted the only lady competitor, Miss Margit Nordin. Miss Nordin was lifted high on strong arms and she received flowers and cheers&quot;.

Through the years following the first race, there were many heated debates about women&#x27;s participation. A majority of officials, mostly male, within sports organizations as well as in society in general, were opposed to women in the race. This led to women being banned from the race from 1924 until 1980. The ban was introduced because it was considered bad for women&#x27;s health to participate in such a competition. The ban was criticized, especially after 1960. Some defended the ban saying that allowing women would diminish the race&#x27;s reputation as a tough challenge. Several women did nevertheless participate during the ban, disguised as men. Two of the women who disguised themselves in 1978, Birgitta Westhed and Britt Dohsé, were assisted by professional make-up artist from the Gothenburg City Theatre, who changed their looks using wigs, moustache and a full beard. Westhed was interviewed by TV during the race, which put women&#x27;s participation higher on the media agenda.

=== Motto ===

The motto of Vasaloppet (&#x27;In [our] fathers&#x27; tracks for future victories&#x27;) is written on a portal erected over the finish line in Mora. At the first race, the finish line was simply marked with white board between two flag poles with the word (&#x27;Finish&#x27;) on it. The second year a more stately portal with the motto was fashioned. In 1986, the portal was made permanent and has since become a significant landmark in Mora.

=== Kranskulla and kransmas ===
A tradition connected to the race is the custom to choose a . This is a woman who is given the honor of hanging a laurel victory wreath around the neck of the winner of the race as he crosses the finish line. She is dressed in the traditional folk costume of Dalarna. With the introduction of the women&#x27;s race, Tjejvasan in 1988, a male is also appointed. During the year, those who have been appointed as and serve as ambassadors for the race.

== The race ==

=== Organization ===
The race is organized by the non-profit organization Vasaloppsföreningen Sälen-Mora that was registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office in 1992 and is owned by two local sports clubs, IFK Mora and . The organization has approximately 35-year-round employees who work with planning, preparing and developing the events.

=== Stations ===
Traditionally since 1958, (&#x27;bilberry-soup&#x27;) made by Ekströms food company, is served at the stations along the course. The Swedish word for bilberry, , literally means &#x27;blueberry&#x27;. About 50,000 liters are served during the Vasaloppet week. In addition, sports drinks and &quot;Vasaloppet buns&quot; are also served. Coffee is served at the Eldris station.

For a number of years, Ekströms had the logo for their printed on the number tags worn by the participants in the race. The word was printed in large bold letters, which resulted in the participants being called — a double meaning and pun since the word is also used to describe a &quot;rookie&quot;.

=== Track profile ===
=== The Rope ===
The Rope, also referred to as &quot;The Dreaded Rope&quot;, is a series of ropes drawn across the track at certain times to prevent participants, who have no chance of reaching the finish line in Mora before the area is closed, to continue. The ropes in Vasaloppet are drawn at seven of the stations: Smågan, Mångsbodarna, Risberg, Evertsberg, Oxberg, Hökberg and Eldris. The race starts at 8:00 a.m. and the finish area is closed at 8:15 p.m. just before the prize ceremony. There is artificial light from Eldris, but skiers should not go in darkness before that place, which also sets a limit for the rope times.

== World cup race ==
Since 1978, Vasaloppet is included in the Worldloppet Ski Federation, a series of long-distance cross-country skiing races. In 2006, the Vasaloppet was included in the FIS Cross-Country World Cup; a large complement of World Cup racers joined the men&#x27;s field for the full distance. Owing to the distance— longer than the longest race usually skied in the World Cup—as well as the proximity to the just-concluded Olympic Games in Turin, the race was again dominated by long-distance specialists rather than World Cup racers. Daniel Tynell won the race, just ahead of Jerry Ahrlin, while Anders Aukland – who has skied on both the Norwegian national World Cup team and in marathons like the Vasaloppet – finished third. The women&#x27;s World Cup Vasaloppet was held over the previous day, rather than being integrated with the full Vasaloppet. Marit Bjørgen from Norway won, though the field included only World Cup racers, since the marathon specialists chose to race in the full-distance event the next day.

=== Winners&#x27; nationalities ===
Sweden is the most prolific producer of winners, with 74 titles (including two all-Sweden ties, in 1928 and 1988), or 90% of the 82 contested races. (The race was canceled in 1932, 1934, and 1990). Norway has produced seven winners: Ole Ellefsæter, 1971; Anders Aukland, 2004; Jørgen Aukland, 2008 and 2013; John Kristian Dahl, 2014, 2016 and 2017, Petter Eliassen, 2015, Andreas Nygaard, 2018,Tore Björseth Berdal, 2019. Two countries have produced two winners: Finland (Pekka Kuvaja, 1954; Pauli Siitonen, 1973) and Austria (Walter Mayer, 1980; Mikhail Botvinov, 1997). Five countries have produced one winner: East Germany (Gert-Dietmar Klause, 1975), the Soviet Union (Ivan Garanin, 1977), France (Jean-Paul Pierrat, 1978), Switzerland (Konrad Hallenbarter, 1983), and Estonia (Raul Olle, 2000).

Sweden won every race until 1954, when Pekka Kuvaja of Finland won the race. The next non-Swede to win was Ole Ellefsæter of Norway (1971), who kicked off a decade in which Sweden won just five titles and racers from five other countries won the five other titles. Sweden won 8 of the titles in the 1980s (Austria [Mayer, 1980] and Switzerland [Hallenbarter, 1983] each won one title in that decade), and 8 more in the 1990s (Austria won one more title in that decade [Botvinov, 1997], and the race was canceled once [1990]). In the 2000s, Sweden won seven races, Norway won twice (Anders Aukland, 2004; Jørgen Aukland, 2008), and Estonia won once (Olle, 2000).

<text>Gilbert William Gutknecht Jr. (pronounced ), born March 20, 1951, is an American former politician. Gutknecht was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives first elected in 1994 to represent Minnesota&#x27;s 1st congressional district. Gutknecht lost his 2006 reelection bid to DFL candidate Tim Walz, and his term ended in January 2007.

==Background==
Gutknecht was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa. He graduated from high school in 1969 and was the first member of his extended family to attend college, graduating with a degree in business from the University of Northern Iowa in 1973.

After college, Gutknecht was a school supplies salesman for 10 years. He went to auction college in 1978 and conducted his first real estate auction in 1979.

Gutknecht is married to Mary Catherine Keefe. The couple has three grown children and has lived in Rochester, Minnesota for more than 30 years, where they are members of Pax Christi Catholic Church.

==Career in politics==

===Minnesota Legislature===
In 1983, Gutknecht was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives, where he served until 1994. He was the Republican floor leader for three years.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Gutknecht was elected to the U.S. House in 1994, running for a seat left open when six-term Representative Tim Penny (DFL) retired. He served six terms, in the 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th, and 109th congresses, but in the November 2006 election lost his attempt to continue for a seventh.

During his tenure in Congress, Gutknecht served as chair of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Operations Oversight, Nutrition and Forestry, vice chair of the Science Committee, and as a member of the Government Reform Committee.

In April 1995, The journal Science quoted Gutknecht&#x27;s legislative aide Brian Harte as saying the federal effort to study AIDS based on the HIV/AIDS link &quot;will be seen as the greatest scandal in American history and will make Watergate look like a no-fault divorce.&quot;

In August 2002, Gutknecht voiced his support for expansion plans by the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, despite opposition from many constituents in Mankato and Rochester who were concerned about noise and traffic problems.

He was the only Minnesota Republican to vote against the Central American Free Trade Agreement. He cited the sugar beet growers in his district as one reason to oppose the trade bill, which ultimately passed by a vote of 217–215.

He also sponsored legislation that would have legalized drug imports from other countries, despite opposition from the Food and Drug Administration. It passed the House but the provision fell from the final version, largely based on White House opposition and an administration report critical of imports.

In January 2006, Gutknecht also opposed his party&#x27;s leadership when he called for new elections for all leadership posts except the speaker. He said Republicans needed to win back the trust of the American people in the wake of the Jack Abramoff scandal.

In mid-2006, after returning from Iraq, Gutknecht said that the U.S. should partially withdraw troops from that country, again deviating from the Republican administration&#x27;s stance.

Gutknecht was considered to be the third most conservative member of the Minnesota delegation in the 109th Congress, scoring 92% conservative by a conservative group and 7% progressive by a liberal group.

===Events of 2006 and election defeat===
Gutknecht ran for re-election in 2006. During the 1994 campaign, he had signed the Contract with America, which called for a Constitutional Amendment to limit congressional terms to 12 years. The &quot;contract&quot; called for a vote on this amendment. &quot;If we ever break this contract, throw us out.&quot; In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton&quot; that congressional term limit laws are unconstitutional, so a constitutional amendment is the only way to implement term limits. Gutknecht voted for such a proposed amendment in 1995, which failed to muster the two-thirds vote for it to move on to the Senate. After Gutknecht was elected in November 1994, he pledged to serve no more than 12 years. In March 1995 he drafted a bill that would bar House members from accruing additional pension benefits after they have served for six terms. &quot;The purpose is to provide one more incentive for people to stay no longer than 12 years,&quot; he said.

In November 1999, Gutknecht said he was not sure he would abide by his past recommendation that legislators serve no more than 12 years. He said he still liked term limits in principle, but he noted that the topic was no longer a front-burner issue in the public mind. According to the Associated Press, he &quot;backtracked&quot; from his 1995 term-limit pledge in May 2004, stating that the voters should be the ones making the decision. In March 2005 he announced he was running for a seventh term.

In March 2006, Gutknecht told a group of Minnesota State University, Mankato College Republicans and other students that the role they would take on in the elections in 2006 would be just as pivotal as the part played by Minnesota&#x27;s 1st Regiment to hold the line at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. &quot;We&#x27;re asked to stand in that gap and there are big stakes in this election,&quot; Gutknecht said. &quot;And remember, had we lost the Battle of Gettysburg, we might have lost the war.&quot;

Gutknecht had always chosen to submit filing petitions when running for Congress instead of paying the $300 election filing fee, calling this a more fiscally conservative approach. Gutknecht was the only major party candidate in Minnesota to submit filing petitions in 2006. In August 2006, Louis Reiter of Elgin, Minnesota filed papers with the Minnesota Supreme Court seeking to disqualify Gutknecht from having his name appear on the September 12, 2006 primary ballot. The filing was prepared by DFL election attorney Alan Weinblatt, and argued that all candidates are subject to a time limit for petitions, and that most of the petition signatures were gathered before the July 4–18, 2006 period which the lawsuit claimed was applicable. Gutknecht filed the petitions on July 5, 2006, the first day possible for such filings. He had never previously been challenged on this point. The state Supreme Court heard the case on August 22, 2006, and denied the attempt to disqualify Gutknecht the same day.

On August 17, 2006, WCCO-TV News in Minneapolis reported that members of Gutknecht&#x27;s campaign made edits to his Wikipedia article. They replaced part of the page with his official congressional biography, removing references to his term-limit pledges. Gutknecht&#x27;s office used the account &quot;Gutknecht01&quot; to attempt previous edits on July 24; that account was then notified (via its talk page) of Wikipedia policies against self-editing.

Gutknecht defeated Gregory Mikkelson in the Republican primary on September 12, 2006, 87%–13%. Gutknecht was unsuccessful in his bid for a seventh term, losing to DFLer Tim Walz. After the election, Gutknecht was asked about a possible return to politics. He replied &quot;That&#x27;s a little like asking a woman who&#x27;s just come out of a 38-hour labor and delivered a baby, &#x27;Well, don&#x27;t you want to get pregnant again?&#x27; Not today.&quot;

<doc id="493423" wikidata="Q211718" url="?curid=493423" title="Beret">
<text>A beret ( , ; ; ; ) is a soft, round, flat-crowned cap made of hand-knitted wool, crocheted cotton, wool felt, or acrylic fibre.

Mass production of berets began in the 19th century in Southern France and the north of Spain, where they were already common headwear, and the beret remains associated with these countries. Berets are worn as part of the uniform of many military and police units worldwide, as well as by other organizations.

== History ==
Archaeology and art history indicate that headwear similar to the modern beret has been worn since the Bronze Age across Northern Europe and as far south as ancient Crete and Italy, where it was worn by the Minoans, Etruscans and Romans. Such headgear has been popular among the nobility and artists across Europe throughout modern history.

Dutch artist, Rembrandt, 15 July 1606 - 4 October 1669, was well known for wearing a beret and it is believed he inspired the beret’s association with artists. 

The Basque-style beret was the traditional headwear of Aragonese and Navarrian shepherds from the Ansó and Roncal valleys of the Pyrenees, a mountain range that divides southern France from northern Spain. The commercial production of Basque-style berets began in the 17th century around Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the Béarn province of southern France. Originally a local craft, beret-making became industrialised in the 19th century. The first factory, Beatex-Laulhere, claims production records dating back to 1810. By the 1920s, berets were associated with the working classes in a part of France and Spain and by 1928 more than 20 French factories and some Spanish and Italian factories produced millions of berets.

In Western fashion, men and women have worn the beret since the 1920s as sportswear and later as a fashion statement.

Military berets were first adopted by the French Chasseurs Alpins in 1889. After seeing these during the First World War, British General Hugh Elles proposed the beret for use by the newly formed Royal Tank Regiment, which needed headgear that would stay on while climbing in and out of the small hatches of tanks. They were approved for use by King George V in 1924. Another possible origin of the RTR beret is that it was suggested to Alec Gatehouse by Eric Dorman-Smith. While the two officers were serving at Sandhurst in 1924, Gatehouse, who had transferred to the Royal Tank Corps, had been given the task of designing a practical headgear for the new corps. Dorman-Smith had toured Spain, including the Basque region, with his friend Ernest Hemingway during the past few years, and had acquired a black Basque beret during his travels.

The black RTR beret was made famous by Field Marshal Montgomery in the Second World War.

==Wear==

The beret fits snugly around the head, and can be &quot;shaped&quot; in a variety of ways – in the Americas it is commonly worn pushed to one side. In Central and South America, local custom usually prescribes the manner of wearing the beret; there is no universal rule and older gentlemen usually wear it squared on the head, jutting forward. It can be worn by both men and women.

Military uniform berets feature a headband or sweatband attached to the wool, made either from leather, silk or cotton ribbon, sometimes with a drawstring allowing the wearer to tighten the cap. The drawstrings are, according to custom, either tied and cut off or tucked in or else left to dangle. The beret is often adorned with a cap badge, either in cloth or metal. Some berets have a piece of buckram or other stiffener in the position where the badge is intended to be worn.

Berets are not usually lined, but many are partially lined with silk or satin. In military berets, the headband is worn on the outside; military berets often have external sweatbands of leather, pleather or ribbon. The traditional beret (also worn by selected military units, such as the Belgian Chasseurs Ardennais or the French Chasseurs Alpins), usually has the &quot;sweatband&quot; folded inwardly. In such a case, these berets have only an additional inch or so of the same woollen material designed to be folded inwardly.

Newer beret styles made of Polar fleece are also popular.

==National traditions and variants==

===Basque Country ===

Berets came to be popularised across Europe and other parts of the world as typical Basque headgear, as reflected in their name in several languages (e.g. &quot;béret basque&quot; in French; &quot;Baskenmütze&quot; in German; &quot;Basco&quot; in Italian; &quot;Tascu/Birritta&quot; in Sicilian; or &quot;baskeri&quot; in Finnish), while the Basques themselves use the words &quot;txapela&quot; or &quot;boneta&quot;. They are very popular and common in the Basque Country. The colours adopted for folk costumes varied by region and purpose: black and blue are worn more frequently than red and white, which are usually used at local festivities. The people of Aragon and the Basque country adopted red berets while the black beret became the common headgear of workers in both Spain and France.

A big commemorative black beret is the usual trophy in sport or &quot;bertso&quot; competitions, including Basque rural sports, the Basque portions of the Tour de France, and the Vuelta Ciclista al Pais Vasco. It may bear sewn ornamental references to the achievement or contest.

=== France ===
The black beret was once considered the national cap of France in Anglo-Saxon countries and is part of the stereotypical image of the Onion Johnny. It is no longer as widely worn as it once was, but it remains a strong sign of local identity in the southwest of France. When French people want to picture themselves as &quot;the typical average Frenchman&quot; in France or in a foreign country, they often use this stereotype from Anglo-Saxon countries. There are today, three manufacturers in France. Laulhère (who acquired the formerly oldest manufacturer, Blancq-Olibet, in February 2014 ) has been making bérets since 1840. The beret still remains a strong symbol of the unique identity of southwestern France and is worn while celebrating traditional events.

===Spain===

In Spain, the beret is usually known as the &quot;boina&quot;, sometimes also as &quot;bilbaína&quot; or &quot;bilba&quot;. They were once common men&#x27;s headwear across the north and central areas of the country. The first areas to wear it were the Basque Country, Navarre, Aragon and Castile, but its use spread over rest of Spain during the 19th century.

In the 20th century, the beret became part of a common stereotype of rural people, often with negative connotations of boorishness and uncouthness, found in expressions such as &quot;paleto de boina a rosca&quot; (&quot;a hick wearing a screwed-on beret&quot;), which has greatly reduced the popularity of the beret in Spain.

===Scotland===
There are several traditional Scottish variants of the beret, notably the &quot;Scottish bonnet&quot; or &quot;Bluebonnet&quot; (originally &quot;bonaid&quot; in Gaelic), whose ribbon cockade and feathers identify the wearer&#x27;s clan and rank. Other Scottish types include the &quot;tam-o&#x27;-shanter&quot; (named after a Robert Burns&#x27; character in one of his poems) and the striped &quot;Kilmarnock cap&quot;, both of which feature a large pompom in the centre.

==Uses==

=== As uniform headwear ===
The beret&#x27;s practicality has long made it an item of military, police and other uniform clothing.

Among a few well-known historic examples are the Scottish soldiers, who wore the blue bonnet in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Volontaires Cantabres, a French force raised in the Basque country in the 1740s to the 1760s, who also wore a blue beret, and the Carlist rebels, with their red berets, in 1830s Spain.

The French Chasseurs alpins, a corps of mountain troops created in 1888, were the first permanently established military force to wear the military beret as a standard headgear. As retained until the present day the chasseur beret is a large and somewhat floppy headdress.

In the 20th century, royal approval was given for the Royal Tank Corps to adopt the black beret in 1924, with the 11th Hussars adopting a brown beret in 1928. In World War II, the Royal Dragoons adopted the grey beret at the end of 1939, with other mechanised units of the British Army, such as the Royal Armoured Corps and the Guards Armoured Division, adopting the black beret in 1941. British officer Bernard Montgomery (&quot;Monty&quot;) took to wearing a black beret given to him by the driver of his command vehicle in 1942, and it became his trademark.

The maroon beret (not to be confused with the red beret), was officially introduced in July 1942 at the direction of Major-General Frederick Browning, commander of the British 1st Airborne Division, and soon became an international symbol of airborne forces. In the 1950s the U.S. Army&#x27;s newly conceived Special Forces units began to wear a green beret as headgear, following the custom of the British Royal Marines, which was officially adopted in 1961 with such units becoming known as the &quot;Green Berets&quot;, and additional specialized forces in the Army, U.S. Air Force and other services also adopted berets as distinctive headgear.

===In fashion and culture===

The beret is part of the long-standing stereotype of the intellectual, film director, artist, &quot;hipster&quot;, poet, bohemian and beatnik. The painter Rembrandt and the composer Richard Wagner, among others, wore berets. In the United States and Britain, the middle of the 20th century saw an explosion of berets in women&#x27;s fashion. In the latter part of the 20th century, the beret was adopted by the Chinese both as a fashion statement and for its political undertones. Berets were also worn by bebop and jazz musicians like Dizzy Gillespie, Gene Krupa, Wardell Gray and Thelonious Monk.

===As a revolutionary symbol===

&quot;Guerrillero Heroico&quot;, an iconic photograph of the Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, shows him wearing a black beret with a brass star.

In the 1960s several activist groups adopted the black beret. These include the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), the ETA (who wore black berets over hoods in public appearances), the Black Panther Party of the United States, formed in 1966, and the &quot;Black Beret Cadre&quot; (a similar Black Power organisation in Bermuda). In addition, the Brown Berets were a Chicano organisation formed in 1967. 

The Young Lords Party, a Latino revolutionary organisation in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, also wore berets, as did the Guardian Angels unarmed anti-crime citizen patrol units originated by Curtis Sliwa in New York City in the 1970s to patrol the streets and subways to discourage crime (red berets and matching shirts).

===Rastafarians===

Adherents of the Rastafari movement often wear a very large knitted or crocheted black beret with red, gold and green circles atop their dreadlocks. The style is often erroneously called a &quot;kufi&quot;, after the skullcap known as &quot;kufune&quot;. They consider the beret and dreadlocks to be symbols of the biblical covenant of God with his chosen people, the &quot;black Israelites&quot;. This style of hat is also known as a Rastacap.

<text>The Mureș () or Maros (; German: &quot;Mieresch&quot;, ) is a river in Eastern Europe. Its drainage basin covers an area of . It originates in the Hășmașu Mare Range in the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, Romania, rising close to the headwaters of the river Olt, and joins the Tisza at Szeged in southeastern Hungary. In Romania, its length is and its basin size is .

The Mureș River flows through the Romanian counties Harghita, Mureș, Alba, Hunedoara, Arad and Timiș, and the Hungarian county Csongrád. The largest cities on the Mureș/Maros are Târgu Mureș, Alba Iulia, Deva and Arad in Romania as well as Makó and Szeged in Hungary.

The Hungarian reaches of the Mureș/Maros are long as the state border. Some on the northern side of the river are protected as part of the Körös-Maros National Park. The Maros Floodplain Protected Area consists of gallery forests, floodplain meadows and of forest reserve near Szeged.

Salt used to be traded in medieval times on the river on large rafts.

==Name==
The river is known to be first mentioned by Herodotus in 485 BC bearing the name &quot;Maris&quot; (Μάρις). Strabo calls it &quot;Marisos&quot; (Μάρισος). It was known in Latin as the &quot;&quot;; the Mureș is also mentioned, as &quot;Morisis&quot; (Μορήσης), in a document of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, in 948 AD.

It was also known in German variously as the &#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27;, owing to Transylvanian Saxon settlements and prior Habsburg rule. It was known in Turkish as the &#x27; or &quot;&quot; under the Ottomans.

<text>A tepal is one of the outer parts of a flower (collectively the perianth). The term is used when these parts cannot easily be classified as either sepals or petals. This may be because the parts of the perianth are undifferentiated (i.e. of very similar appearance), as in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, or because, although it is possible to distinguish an outer whorl of sepals from an inner whorl of petals, the sepals and petals have similar appearance to one another (as in &quot;Lilium&quot;). The term was first proposed by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1827 and was constructed by analogy with the terms &quot;petal&quot; and &quot;sepal&quot;. (De Candolle used the term &quot;perigonium&quot; or &quot;perigone&quot; for the tepals collectively; today, this term is used as a synonym for &quot;perianth&quot;.)

== Origin ==

Undifferentiated tepals are believed to be the ancestral condition in flowering plants. For example, &quot;Amborella&quot;, which is thought to have separated earliest in the evolution of flowering plants, has flowers with undifferentiated tepals. Distinct petals and sepals would therefore have arisen by differentiation, probably in response to animal pollination. In typical modern flowers, the outer or enclosing whorl of organs forms sepals, specialised for protection of the flower bud as it develops, while the inner whorl forms petals, which attract pollinators.

Tepals formed by similar sepals and petals are common in monocotyledons, particularly the &quot;lilioid monocots&quot;. In tulips, for example, the first and second whorls both contain structures that look like petals. These are fused at the base to form one large, showy, six-parted structure (the perianth). In lilies the organs in the first whorl are separate from the second, but all look similar, thus all the showy parts are often called tepals. Where sepals and petals can in principle be distinguished, usage of the term &quot;tepal&quot; is not always consistent – some authors will refer to &quot;sepals and petals&quot; where others use &quot;tepals&quot; in the same context.

In some plants the flowers have no petals, and all the tepals are sepals modified to look like petals. These organs are described as petaloid, for example, the sepals of hellebores. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are also referred to as &quot;petaloid&quot;, as in petaloid monocots, orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid monocots.

== Properties and shape ==
Terms used in the description of tepals include pubescent (with dense fine, short, soft hairs, downy), puberulent (minutely pubescent, hairs barely visible to the naked eye) and puberulous (dense covering of very short soft hairs). Tepal shape is described in similar terms to those used for leaves (see Glossary of leaf morphology).

<doc id="493428" wikidata="Q4802646" url="?curid=493428" title="Aryan Republican Army">
<text>The Aryan Republican Army (ARA), also dubbed &quot;The Midwest Bank bandits&quot; by the FBI and law-enforcement, was a white nationalist terrorist gang which robbed 22 banks in the Midwest from 1994 to 1996. The bank robberies were spearheaded by Donna Langan. The gang, who had links to Neo-Nazism and white supremacism, were alleged to have conspired with convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing terrorist attack. Although it has never been proven, many theorists believe the ARA funneled robbery money to help fund the bombing as a direct response to the Waco and Ruby Ridge sieges.

Inspired to rob banks in order to support white supremacist movements by Mark Thomas, the ARA, founded in 1992 by Langan and her best friend from school Richard Lee Guthrie Jr., considered itself a leaderless organization. Although the group was mainly a criminal enterprise, its agenda was terrorist like. After filming and producing right-wing propaganda videos, the group grew and recruited bank robber affiliates: Michael Brescia, Shawn Kenny, Kevin McCarthy, and Scott Stedeford. With the bank heist money, the gang began to stockpile weapons and ammunition in preparation for a future race war. At bank after bank, the bandits became infamous because they left their signature decoy grenades and their pipe bombs as calling cards, a strategy which was implemented to help the gang escape and delay the FBI&#x27;s pursuit. The bandits used a strict time keeper who called out at elapsed intervals and made sure that they were in and out of the heists within 90 seconds. The time keeping, along with the members wearing of presidential masks, were moves which were believed to be lifted directly from the Kathryn Bigelow film &quot;Point Break&quot;. In addition to wearing Nixon, Reagan and Clinton masks, the ARA also wore jackets and hats emblazoned with &quot;FBI,&quot; &quot;ATF&quot; or other law-enforcement acronyms.

The FBI was unaware of the existence of the ARA until one of its members was apprehended. In early 1996, the group began to fall apart as its members were arrested after former members of the group became informants as part of a plea bargain. Guthrie was arrested in Cincinnati on January 15, 1996, concluding a 2-hour chase by FBI agents. Soon after, Guthrie gave up his counterpart Langan. Three days later on January 18, 1996, the FBI arrested Langan after a 50-round shoot out near a safe house in Columbus, Ohio.

== Activities ==
Members of the Aryan Republican Army were responsible for a series of 22 bank robberies in the American Midwest. They reportedly targeted banks in the Midwest due to their belief that the security measures which were taken there would be less thorough. The group often left fake explosive devices at the banks which they robbed in order to divert law enforcement officials who could potentially chase them. Known members of the ARA include Langan, Guthrie, Michael William Brescia, Mark William Thomas, Shawn Kenny, Kevin McCarthy, and Scott Stedeford. Subsequent to their arrest, Guthrie, Langan, McCarthy and Thomas became witnesses for the prosecution. Guthrie was found hanged while in custody, a day before he was to give a television interview about an alleged cover-up which was related to the death of Kenneth Michael Trentadue, who was also found hanged while he was in custody. Otherwise, all of the gang&#x27;s members received prison sentences of varying lengths, on an array of state and/or federal charges.

==Connections to the Oklahoma City bombing==
Several accounts have linked the ARA with Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 and injured hundreds more.

Brescia and Guthrie both resided for a time at Elohim City, Oklahoma, a private community made up of followers of the late Christian Identity pastor Robert G. Millar, and other persons associated with right-wing extremist and white nationalist-style views. Other ARA members were known to frequent Elohim City as well. Elohim City security director Andreas Strassmeir was a known associate of Timothy McVeigh (having met him at a Tulsa gun show), and federal investigators determined that McVeigh had made a phone call to Elohim City on April 5, 1995, just two weeks prior to the Oklahoma City bombing (although no one at Elohim City claims to have spoken with him).

Additionally, five separate women from a nightclub in Tulsa have each identified Brescia as the man who was paying for McVeigh&#x27;s drinks on April 8, 1995, just three days after McVeigh&#x27;s suspicious phone call. Two more women in Kansas reported that McVeigh and Brescia were frequent associates, while Guthrie bore a distinct physical resemblance to &quot;John Doe Number Two&quot;. McVeigh&#x27;s sister, Jennifer, also claimed that he had been one of the participants in several, unspecified bank robberies.

David Paul Hammer, a convicted murderer who was imprisoned with McVeigh at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, has alleged that McVeigh told him details of the Oklahoma City bombing that contradict the account related in court. According to Hammer, McVeigh claimed to have been working as a deep cover operative for the US Department of Defense, having infiltrated ARA and participated in several of the group&#x27;s bank robberies. McVeigh is further alleged to have indicated Strassmeir and several others at Elohim City were similarly government agents involved in surveillance of extremist elements of the American far-right.

==Donna Langan==
Langan was born Peter Kevin Langan in 1958 on Saipan in the South Pacific Islands. She grew up in Vietnam, where her father served in the military and CIA, before moving to the United States when Langan was 6 years old. In 1974, at age 16, Langan was sentenced to up to 20 years for robbing a man of $78 and fleeing police. Langan moved to Ohio in 1988, where she converted to Mormonism and became an ordained minister at what authorities describe as a Ku Klux Klan-affiliated church. During the early 1990s, Langan and her childhood friend Richard Guthrie formed the Aryan Republic Army, a white supremacist group with motives to overthrow the US government. The group turned to robbing banks in order to fund their movement. On January 18, 1996, the FBI arrested Langan. Langan, a transgender woman, who publicly renounced her political and racist views, served 18 years in a male prison before being transferred to a female penitentiary after a legal fight in 2014 during the Obama administration. In 2017, Langan and 435 other transgender inmates from federal prisons led an LGBT activist group in an effort to challenge the Trump administration&#x27;s positions regarding transgender prisoners.

==Other members and associates==
===Richard Lee Guthrie Jr.===
Nicknamed &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, Richard Lee Guthrie Jr. grew up within blocks of Langan in Wheaton, Maryland, although they didn&#x27;t become close until years later. After getting kicked out of the Navy in 1983 for painting a swastika on the side of a ship and threatening superiors, Guthrie attended gatherings of the Aryan Nations and traveled the country distributing Christian Identity propaganda.

Guthrie pled guilty in 1996 to three bank robberies in Ohio, and to 16 more in seven states, as well as to weapons charges and credit card fraud. Following a plea agreement, he was to provide authorities with information about terrorist organizations similar to the Aryan Republican Army. On July 12 of that same year, prison officials found Guthrie hanging in his cell, an apparent suicide.

===Michael William Brescia===

A resident of Elohim City and a former student at LaSalle University in Philadelphia, Michael William Brescia was recruited for the ARA by Aryan Nations Pennsylvania state leader, Mark W. Thomas. Brescia was named in a lawsuit filed by the grandparents of a victim of the bombing as being &quot;John Doe 2&quot; seen with McVeigh in the days prior to the bombing. A female friend of McVeigh also identified Brescia as a friend of McVeigh&#x27;s then known only as &quot;Mike&quot;.

===Shawn Kenny===
A 1991 Oak Hills High School graduate and one-time Aryan Nations member from Cincinnati, Shawn Kenny already had a racist background prior to being befriended by Langan at a law seminar. Kenny, himself, says he had discussed recruiting robbers with Thomas in 1994.

Despite his criminal history and alleged relationship with Timothy McVeigh, he joined the U.S. Army sometime after the ARA was dissolved and an investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing had taken place.

===Scott Anthony Stedeford===
Growing up in a middle-class town in Pennsylvania, Stedeford was introduced to the Christian Identity Doctrine and then fell in with the revolutionary movement. During this time, he was also the founding member and frontman of the RAC band, Day of the Sword. Guthrie says to have met Stedeford through Berks County right-wing leader, Mark Thomas.

===Mark William Thomas===
A member of both the Aryan Nations and Ku Klux Klan, Thomas was ordained an Identity Minister during a stay at Aryan Nations&#x27; Idaho headquarters in 1990.

After being indicted in January 1997, Thomas told reporters that at least one gang member was involved in the Oklahoma bombing, according to a newspaper clip in FBI files.

===Kevin McCarthy===
A native Pennsylvanian, Kevin &quot;Blondie&quot; McCarthy spent his adolescence experimenting with drugs before eventually becoming a resident of the Elohim City compound in the fall of 1994. McCarthy was also the bass player for Stedeford&#x27;s group, Day of the Sword.

Under a plea agreement, McCarthy became a government witness and testified in a pre-trial hearing against Langan in Columbus, Ohio. McCarthy received a lengthy prison term for bank robbery, and was released from prison in 2007.

===Chevie Kehoe===

A fellow white supremacist and resident of the Elohim City compound, Chevie Kehoe was contracted by the Aryan Republican Army to assassinate the Mueller family. The Mueller family were brief residents of Elohim City that had been privy to information dealing with the alleged connection of the Aryan Republican Army to the Oklahoma City bombing. Prior to murdering the Mueller family (with his accomplice Daniel Lewis Lee), Chevie had sold guns to the ARA.

===Dennis Mahon===

While his exact connection to group has not been revealed, white supremacist Dennis Mahon is known to have been close friends with members of the Aryan Republican Army during his stay at Elohim City.

A handful of videos were taken which depict Dennis Mahon engaging in paramilitary training alongside Andreas Strassmeir and Carol Howe, as well as a few other individuals which have not been identified. The unidentified militants in the footage may be some members of the Aryan Republican Army, since they lived at Elohim City around the same time that the video was recorded. In addition to this, the anonymous persons are seen wearing balaclavas in some videos, while in others, they either sport camouflage face paint or are simply too far away from the camera for them to be seen in detail.

==Sentences==
==Popular culture==
In 2010, the Aryan Republican Army was the subject of episode 82 of the television series &quot;Gangland&quot;.

<doc id="493430" wikidata="Q3817" url="?curid=493430" title="Banteay Meanchey province">
<text>Banteay Meanchey (, , ) is a province of Cambodia located in the far northwest. It borders the provinces of Oddar Meanchey to the north, Siem Reap to the east, Battambang to the south, and shares an international border with Thailand to the west. Its capital and largest city is Serei Saophoan.

Banteay Meanchey is the 13th largest province in Cambodia. With a population of 861,883, it ranks as the ninth most populous in the nation. The city of Poipet in the western part of the province is an international border crossing into Thailand. Banteay Meanchey is one of the nine provinces that are part of the Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve.

==Etymology==

&quot;Banteay Meanchey&quot; means &quot;Victorious Fortress&quot; in Khmer. The word &quot;chey&quot; () is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;jaya&quot; () meaning &quot;victory&quot; with &quot;mean&quot; () means &quot;to have&quot;, so the combination of both literally means &quot;to have victory&quot; and &quot;banteay&quot; () is a Khmer word meaning &quot;fortress&quot; or &quot;castle&quot;.

==History==
The area was part of the extensive Khmer Empire. Its most notable remains is the Banteay Chhmar temple in the north of the province, built in 12th century towards the 13th century. Other lesser known temples are the Banteay Neang and Banteay Torp temples.

In the 1795 Siam took control over Western Cambodia, and made the area into Siamese province of Inner Cambodia with the administration capital in Phra Tabong (Battambang). This province lasted until 1907 when Siam traded Inner Cambodia for the return of Trat and Dan Sai. In the same year, King Sisowath decided to split the return Inner Cambodian province into Battambang province (which included Sisophon) and Siem Reap province. When Thailand re annexed western Cambodia 1941, Sisophon was split off Battambang province and was an administration capital of Phibunsongkram province which lasted until 1946 when the whole region was return to the French control.

In 1988 the province Banteay Meanchey was split off from Battambang, originally consisting of the five districts Mongkol Borei, Thmar Puok, Serei Saophoan, Preah Net Preah and Phnom Srok.

During the Cambodian Civil Wars of the 1970s and 1980s Banteay Meanchey province was on the frontlines of much of fighting and as a result it is one of the three most heavily mined provinces in Cambodia along with Pailin and Battambang.

==Geography==

Banteay Meanchey is mostly covered by extensive lowlands, with a few uplands to the north and east. The main rivers are the Mongkol Borei and the Sisophon Rivers. The province is bordered with Battambang to the south, Siem Reap to the East, Odar Meanchey to the North and Thailand to the West and North.
==Religion==

The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 99.3% of the people in Banteay Meanchey province are Buddhists. About 0.4% population of Banteay Meanchey province follow Islam followed by Chams. Christianity is followed by 0.2% in the province.

==Economy==

=== Poipet International Border Checkpoint ===

Banteay Meanchey has one of Cambodia&#x27;s busiest checkpoints, Poipet International Border Checkpoint, for both people and goods. The checkpoint oversees approximately 2,000 tourists (50,000 tourists or 14% of nation&#x27;s tourists annually in 2015) and 300 trucks carrying goods every day. In response to the increase of trade between Cambodia and Thailand, a new border checkpoint, Stueng Bot which is only 7 km from Poipet Checkpoint, is being constructed and slated to be completed by 2018. The new checkpoint will focus on trade while leaving Poipet Checkpoint for tourists.

=== Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Industry ===
O&#x27;Neang Special Economic Zone was officially approved in 2006. In 2014, the zone hosted 5 factories includings CAMPAC Co. Ltd, a Thai company which produces package for jewellery, Hi-Tech Apparel (Cambodia) Co., Ltd., ML Intermate Apparel (Cambodia) Co., Ltd., SIMMER Inter Co., Ltd., and Wireform Precision Parts Co., Ltd. O&#x27;Neang employed 1,200 workers. In recent years, Japanese and Cambodian investors jointly established a new Special Economic Zone, Sanco. The 66.5 hectare zone has already attracted NHK Spring, a Japanese car-seat manufacturer and Toyota supplier. In March 2015, Toyota Tsusho Corporation (Toyota Tsusho) announced that it will establish Techno Park Poipet Pvt. Co., Ltd. to optimize its regional supply chains. The park will provide subcontracted auto part service and plans to service 10 or more companies by 2020. Thanks to its cheap labour cost, cheaper and stable electricity supply from Thailand ( $0.16 per kilowatt), its proximity to Bangkok and favorable investment policy, Poipet is seen as a future industrial city of the Northwestern part of Cambodia.

=== Transportation ===
Banteay Meanchey sits on a strategic cross point that directs to Thailand, Siem Reap (Angkor Wat) and Battambang (gateway to Phnom Penh and Vietnam). As of 2018, infrastructure such as national roads, provincial roads and railway have been improved significantly. The historical re-operation of Royal Railway that links Thailand to Phnom Penh and Cambodia&#x27;s seaport city started in April 2018. In this first phase, people can travel by train from Poi Pet to Sereisophorn and Battambang. Links from Battambang to Pursat, Kampong Chhnang and Phnom Penh will soon be completed. The national road number 5 is being upgraded to meet international standard. The project is funded by Japanese government in a broader plan to connect Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. 
=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture, particularly rice paddy, plays very important role in the province&#x27;s economy.

== Administration ==
The province is subdivided into 7 districts (&quot;srok&quot;) and 2 municipalities (&quot;krong&quot;), which are further subdivided into 55 communes (&quot;khum&quot;) and 10 quarters (&quot;sangkat&quot;), and 654 villages (&quot;phum&quot;).

== Attractions ==

===Banteay Chhmar ===
Prasat Banteay Chhmar () is one of the masterpieces of the great king Jayavarman VII built between the 12th-13th century. Despite its magnificent architecture, the temples are lesser known to tourists and the world. Unlike other Angkorean temples, Banteay Chhmar is not well-conserved. The damages caused by war, looters and nature are very apparent. The temple is being on Cambodia&#x27;s tentative list for UNESCO&#x27;s world heritage in order to increase conservation and awareness.

<text>Battambang (, , ) is a province of Cambodia in the far northwest of the country. Bordering provinces are Banteay Meanchey to the north, Pursat to the east and south, Siem Reap to the northeast, and Pailin to the west. The northern and southern extremes of the province&#x27;s western boundaries form part of the international border with Thailand. In addition, Tonlé Sap forms part of the northeastern boundary between Siem Reap and Pursat. Its capital and largest city is Battambang.

It is the fifth most populous province in Cambodia. In land area, Battambang is the fifth largest province of Cambodia. Battambang is one of the provinces included in the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve.

The province features a range of cultures as well as natural resources. Seventy five percent of the area is jungles and mountains. The area has a tropical climate.

==Etymology==

&quot;Battambang&quot; literally means &#x27;[to] lose [a] stick&#x27; in Khmer, referring to the local legend of Preah Bat Dambang Kranhoung.

In Thai, the province is called &quot;Phra Tabong&quot;.

==History==

Battambang was annexed by both Siam and Cambodia from time to time because its location is in between both kingdoms. A majority of the local population is of Khonpor or Chong ethnicity, a part of the Austro-Asiatic family.

<text>Kampong Cham (, UNGEGN: ; ) is a province of Cambodia located on the central lowlands of the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong Chhnang to the west, Kampong Thom and Kratié to the north, Tboung Khmum to the east, and Prey Veng and Kandal to the south. Kampong Cham was officially divided into two provinces on 31 December 2013 in what was seen by many as a political move by the ruling party. All land west of the Mekong remained Kampong Cham while land east of the river became Tbong Khmum province. Prior to this division, Kampong Cham extended eastward to the international border with Vietnam, was the eleventh largest province in Cambodia, and with a population of 1,680,694, was the most populous province in Cambodia. Its capital and largest city is Kampong Cham.

==Etymology==

Kampong Cham is the corrupted word of &quot;Kampong Rong Chamm&quot; means &#x27;The Waiting Port&#x27; then shorten as &quot;Kampong Chamm&quot;, Later, the sound changed to &quot;Kampong Cham&quot; in Khmer. &quot;Kampong&quot; means &#x27;port&#x27; or &#x27;harbor&#x27;. &quot;Chamm&quot; refers to the &#x27;waiting&#x27;. A symbol the province is known for is two snakes sinuously wrapped around each other, which is located at the capital city bridge, Kampong Cham. Meanwhile, in Malay, the name Kampong Cham comes from the word &quot;Kampong&quot; &#x27;village&#x27; and &quot;Cham&quot; refers to the Cham ethnic group.

==Geography==
Kampong Cham is primarily lowlands. The main river is the Mekong River, which forms the eastern border of the province, separating it from Tbong Khmum province.

== Administration ==

Kampong Cham is subdivided into 9 districts and 1 municipality which in turn are subdivided into communes (&quot;khum&quot;) which are further divided into villages (&quot;phum&quot;). The province formerly consisted of 16 districts, however a request by Hun Sen&#x27;s government to split the province in two was made after his ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) lost the province to the opposition in the July 2013 elections. The CPP won only eight of the available 18 National Assembly seats in Hun Sen&#x27;s home province. The request, which was ostensibly made in order to improve administrative efficiency in the large province, was approved by King Sihamoni on 31 December 2013. The 10 districts that remain in Kampong Cham province overwhelmingly voted for the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy, while five of the six districts cut out from Kampong Cham to form Tboung Khmum province were won solidly by the CPP.

<text>Kampong Chhnang ( ; meaning &#x27;Port of Pottery&#x27;) is one of the central provinces (&quot;khaet&quot;) of Cambodia. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Kandal, Kampong Speu, and Pursat. The provincial capital is the city of Kampong Chhnang.

==Etymology==

<text>Kampong Thom (, UNGEGN: ; lit. &#x27;Great Port&#x27;) is a province (&quot;khaet&quot;) of Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Siem Reap to the northwest, Preah Vihear to the north, Stung Treng to the northeast, Kratie to the east, Kampong Cham and Kampong Chhnang to the south, and the Tonle Sap to the west.

The provincial capital is Stung Saen, a town of approximately 30,000 people on the banks of the Stung Sen River.

Kampong Thom is Cambodia&#x27;s second largest province by area. There are a number of significant Angkorian sites in the area, including Prasat Sambor Prei Kuk and Prasat Andet temples. As one of the nine provinces bordering Tonle Sap Lake, Kampong Thom is part of the Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve.

==Etymology==

&quot;Kampong Thom&quot; in Khmer means &#x27;great port&#x27; or &#x27;great harbor&#x27;. &quot;Kampong&quot; in Khmer translates as &#x27;port&#x27; or &#x27;harbor&#x27;. The word &quot;Kampong&quot; is shared in other Asian languages, the Malay and Indonesian, both meaning &#x27;village&#x27;. &quot;Thom&quot; in the Khmer language means &#x27;big&#x27;, &#x27;grand&#x27;, or &#x27;large&#x27;.

== Administration ==
The province is divided into eight districts and one municipality, further divided into 81 communes.

== History ==
The previous name of the province was &quot;Kampong Pous Thom&quot; (&#x27;Port&#x27;, &#x27;City of the Great Snakes&#x27;). According to local legend, at a lakeside dock near the Sen River, a pair of large snakes inhabited a nearby cave. On every Buddhist holiday, the snakes would make appearances to the people nearby who then began to refer to the area as &quot;Kampong Pous Thom&quot;. Eventually the snakes disappeared and the name was shortened to &quot;Kampong Thom&quot;. During the Colonial Cambodia period, the French divided Cambodian territory into provinces and named most of them according to the local popular names for the respective areas.

Kampong Thom was a powerful capital in Southeast Asia during the Funan period. Prasat Sambor Prei Kuk, dating from the Chenla era, is in Kampong Thom province.

== Geography ==
Two of the three core areas in Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve lie in Kampong Thom.
* Boeng Chhmar (14,560 hectares), and
* Stung Saen (6,355 hectares).
==Religion==
The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 98.6% of the people in Kampong Thom are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years, besides that there are Cham Muslims from Tboung Khmum who came here recently to encroach on the forest land here. A small percentage follow Christianity.

== Economy ==
Much of Kampong Thom is on the floodplain of the Tonlé Sap lake. In 2003–2004, it was a significant producer of wild fish (18,800 tons) and the fourth largest producer of fish through aquaculture in Cambodia (1,800 tons). Most of the fish-raising is done by home production, with a growing segment devoted to rice field aquaculture.

Kampong Thom is also one of the largest producers of cashew nuts in Cambodia, with 6,371 hectares under production in 2003–2004.

<text>Koh Kong (, , ) is a province (&quot;khaet&quot;) of Cambodia. Its capital is Khemarak Phoumin (Koh Kong).

==Geography==
The most southwestern province of Cambodia, Koh Kong has a long undeveloped coastline and a mountainous, forested, and largely inaccessible interior which includes part of the Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia&#x27;s largest national park (Botum Sakor National Park), and a section of Kirirom National Park.

==History==
From 1795 to 1904 the area was under Siamese administration with the local name of &quot;Koh Kong&quot;. During the reign of King Mongkut the name &quot;Patchan Khiri Khet&quot; was given to the city as a counterpart to Prachuap Khiri Khan, a city on the same latitude which also had its name changed during the same year. In 1904, the region and the city of Trat was ceded to French Indochina in exchange of French troop evacuation from Chanthaburi. In 1907 Trat was returned to Siam in exchange for the Siamese province of Inner Cambodia while Koh Kong remained part of French Cambodia.

After Cambodia&#x27;s liberation from the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Koh Kong province was quite under-populated. After the national government encouraged people to live in Koh Kong, there has been a net influx of people. It is estimated that the average annual growth rate in Koh Kong is 16%, which has put pressure on the mangrove resources in the province. Koh Kong&#x27;s towns have developed rapidly partially in response to market pressures from Thailand and because of immigration from other parts of Cambodia.

==Economy==
The province has been the site of a Sino-Cambodian port development project in Dara Sakor. The project is planned to spread over 45,000 hectares, to include casinos, golf courses, and resorts. A 20 kilometre stretch of coastline will be turned into a deep-water port to accommodate cruise ships as well as freight. Near the port, an airfield with a runway 3,400 metres is longer than needed for commercial flights, while its turning bays are too small for civilian aircraft. Therefore, analysts suspect that the port project is a Cambodian-Chinese civil-military collaboration that will permit the Chinese navy to use the facilities as a forward operating base. Responding to US concerns, Prime Minister Hun Sen has denied the charge, pointing out that the Cambodian constitution &quot;...has no provision for accommodating foreign military bases on its soil.&quot;

==Districts==
The province is divided into six districts and one municipality:

==Border crossing==
The province is an increasingly popular gateway to Cambodia from Hat Lek in eastern Thailand (Trat), in part due to the reasonably direct access to the port and beach resort town of Sihanoukville. The border is at Cham Yeam, about 14 km from Koh Kong.

Traveling to Koh Kong has been made easier, as bridges have been built, the first in 2002. The landmark Koh Kong Bridge was built by L.Y.P. Group. It is the second longest bridge in Cambodia (Neak Loeung Bridge took the number one spot in 2015). The 1,900-meter crossing can be seen connecting provincial town of Koh Kong to Koh Kong Resort and the Thai border. In 2007 a new sealed road (National Route 48) was completed from the town to Sre Ambel on the Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville highway, including four new bridges donated by the Thai government. They opened in May 2008.

==Notable People==
Eh Phouthong - Kun Khmer kickboxer.

<doc id="493462" wikidata="Q785896" url="?curid=493462" title="Kratié province">
<text>Kratié (, ), alternatively spelled Kracheh, is a province of Cambodia located in the northeast. It borders Stung Treng to the north, Mondulkiri to the east, Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham to the west, and Tboung Khmum, and the country of Vietnam to the south.

The province’s capital is the town of Kratié located within the Kratié Municipality.

==Name==
&quot;Kratié&quot; is the French spelling derived from the Khmer &quot;Krâchéh&quot; ([krɑːceh]).

==History==

The area now known as Kratié was part of the early first millennium Kingdom of Funan until Funan itself was superseded and absorbed in the 6th century by Chenla. Sampheak Borak, the former Royal Capital during the Chenla Era, is located in Sambo District. In addition, Kratié has Vihear Sasar Muayroy Pagoda built in the 16th century. This pagoda is related to a Khmer legend Krapeur Nen Thun (Venerable Monk Thun, the Crocodile). Kratié has several temples built in the 8th century such as Khvas Pi, Pram, and Koh Kring that has perfect deities, ancient halls, Khmer ancient houses, and French-style buildings. The area near Kratié along the Mekong River was one of the most densely populated regions of the pre-Angkorian era of Cambodia.

Lon Nol was the province&#x27;s governor in 1945. During the Vietnam and Cambodian Civil Wars and the subsequent Vietnamese presence against Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, intense fighting took place in Kratié. Operation Menu, the 1969-1970 United States bombing campaign targeting Vietnamese supply routes and bases in Cambodia and Laos, resulted in heavy bombardment of Kratié. Recovering unexploded ordnance and de-mining has been a major initiative since at least the mid-2000s.

On December 30, 1978, Vietnamese forces captured Kratié to fight against Khmer Rouge.

==Geography==

The Mekong River flows from the north to the south of the province; approximately 140 km of the river is located in Kratié. The river is home to Irrawaddy dolphins, fish, and birds. The flow of the Mekong River at Kratié town varies greatly. There are hundreds of seasonally flooded islands in the river. As of 2007, the Cambodian government planned to build a dam on the Mekong River near Kratié town. The province also contains many forests, the Phnom Pram Poan mountain range, Phnom Prech, and rubber plantations. Eastern Kratié is an important bird area.

The province is mostly covered in dense forest. Craters from Operation Menu bombings during the Vietnam War, some of which are filled with water, are still visible in the countryside. Some land in Kratié is used for agriculture, though a smaller percentage than elsewhere in Cambodia.

The province has a monsoonal climate, with a cool season from November to March, a hot season from March to May, and a rainy season from May to October. Flooding is frequent in Kratié; the Mekong may overflow by as much as 4 m during the rainy season.

Kratié is known for its attractive riverside scenery and its green villages and paddies, and the river dolphins.

Kratié&#x27;s fisheries are part of the Upper Mekong River Zone, which is important support for migratory species and subsistence fishing but does not play a major role in commercial fishing.

Forests in Kratié tend to be open and less dense than elsewhere in Cambodia; they are generally made up of deciduous trees that lose their leaves during the dry season.

==Government==
Sar Cham Rong is the governor of Kratié province and Hoeu Sidem is the deputy governor. In the 2007 commune council elections, the vast majority of seats went to members of the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party. Women make up 17.4% of commune council members. In 2005, Kratié received 1.69 billion riel from the commune/sangkat fund, of which development funds were 1.20 billion riel and funds for administration were 0.49 billion riel.
==Economy and transportation==
Rice cropping plays an important role in the provincial economy

Most Kratié residents are subsistence farmers or fishers. 78% of residents are employed in agriculture. Thirty percent of Kratié households live on less than US$1 per day; the province&#x27;s poverty rate of 32% is somewhat lower than the national average of 39%. Some gold mining occurs in Kratié. Most soil in Kratié is poor; the province primarily grows perennial industrial crops like rubber. Kratié has the potential to be an ecotourism destination. Kratié&#x27;s road system is poorly developed. As of 1998, the average household possessed 0.48 hectares of agricultural land, and 37% were landless.

==Social issues==
Land concessions often cover land customarily owned or used by people in Kratié province. In 2004, community land organizers were threatened by the military after they confiscated chainsaws used for illegal logging. An indigenous people&#x27;s organization is active in Kratié province.

==Health, education, and development==
Schistosomiasis is a problem in Kratié province. The incidence of malaria and dengue fever rose sharply in the mid-2000s; this increase has been attributed to changes in climate. Malaria is hyperendemic in Kratié&#x27;s forests. The provincial infant mortality rate of 97/1,000 and child mortality rate of 80/1,000 are significantly higher than the national average (68/1,000 and 53/1,000, respectively).

Kratié is one of the poorest provinces in Cambodia but, in 2015, was ranked fifth in the nation for the high-school exam pass rate. Schools struggle to attract teachers to the poor and overwhelmingly rural province. Teachers are sent to the province from Phnom Penh, the nation&#x27;s capital, but they are new teachers who see an opportunity to pass a teacher&#x27;s exam that is less rigorous in remote areas. These new teachers rarely stay more than a year or two due to the low pay, leaving local officials having to do without and students often having to continue studies by themselves.

==Demographics==

There is a substantial Vietnamese minority in Kratié province. Kratié is home to seven indigenous groups: Bunong, Kouy, Mil, Khonh, Kraol, Steang, and Thamoun. Approximately 70% of the province&#x27;s residents live along the Mekong River; the area beyond the river is sparsely populated.
