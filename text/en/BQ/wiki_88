<text>A white buffalo or white bison is an American bison possessing white fur, and is considered sacred or spiritually significant in several Native American religions; therefore, such buffalo are often visited for prayer and other religious rituals. The coats of buffalo are almost always brown and their skin a dark brown or black; however, white buffalo can result from one of several physical conditions:

* They may be albinos, in which case they will remain unpigmented throughout their lives, and may also have hearing and vision problems.
* They may be leucistic, with white fur but blue eyes, instead of the pink seen in albinos.
* They may have a rare genetic condition which causes a buffalo to be born white, but to become brown within a year or two as it matures.
* They may be beefalo, a bison–cattle crossbreed, and thus have inherited the white coloration from their cattle ancestry.

== Spiritual significance ==

The white buffalo is a sacred sign in Lakota and other Plains Indians religions. Chief Arvol Looking Horse is the current keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe.

The story of the pipe is that,

The story is also a prophecy. White Buffalo Calf Woman told the people that she would return in the form of a white buffalo calf and that it would be both a blessing and a warning. When the white animal shows its sacred color there will be great changes upon the earth. The births in the early 1990s and 2000s of white buffalo calves were seen by indigenous Americans to be worrying portents. Arvol and many others interpret those changes to mean the current ecological crises taking place. If humanity continues to live without harmony with the earth it will be cursed, but if spiritual unity and harmony with the earth is achieved humanity will be blessed.
== Individual white buffalo ==

* In 1833, a white bison was killed by the Cheyenne. The Cheyenne killed this white bison during the Leonid Meteor Shower (The Night the Stars Fell) and scribed a peace and trade treaty on its skin. This event was documented by historian Josiah Gregg and other travelers on the Santa Fe Trail.
* On October 7, 1876, a buffalo hunter named J. Wright Mooar killed a white buffalo in the Deep Creek drainage near Snyder, Texas. He retained the hide his entire life, despite reports that Theodore Roosevelt offered him $5000 for the hide. White Buffalo Park is presently located near the site of the shooting.

* A bison named Big Medicine (1933–1959) was born in the wild on the National Bison Range on Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. The name &quot;Big Medicine&quot; was chosen due to the sacred power attributed to white bison. Following its death in 1959, its body was preserved and is being displayed at the Montana Historical Society in Helena.
* A white buffalo was recorded at the U.S. Army Arctic Testing Center, Fort Greely, Alaska. There is a copyrighted photograph of it in &quot;Seeing the White Buffalo&quot; by Robert Pickering. This buffalo was part of a herd that had been relocated from Montana.
* A female named Miracle (not to be confused with Miracle Moon), was born at a farm near Janesville, Wisconsin, on August 20, 1994. Her fur fully transitioned to brown as she matured, and she gave birth to four calves of her own before dying of natural causes on September 19, 2004. Additionally, a calf died aged 4 days in 1996. A third white calf was born in August 2006 which died after being struck by lightning in November of the same year. Kathleen Buerer wrote a memoir about her 1994 visits to Miracle, &quot;By the Side of the Buffalo Pasture&quot;.
* Medicine Wheel, a white buffalo was born on May 9, 1996, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, on the Merrival farm. In 2000, Medicine Wheel escaped his pasture and was shot by a tribal police officer.
*Mahpiya Ska (Sioux language) or White Cloud was an albino female buffalo born on July 10, 1996, at Shirek Buffalo Ranch. After her birth, she was loaned to the city of Jamestown, North Dakota, where she lived out the most of her life. Through genetic testing, she was certified a true Albino American Bison. She died on November 14, 2016, shortly after being returned to her birthplace.
**White Cloud had a white calf on August 31, 2007, which was named Dakota Miracle. While Dakota Miracle was white like his mother, he was not a true albino. He lived out his entire life at the National Buffalo Museum in Jamestown before dying on June 28, 2019, due to complications from leucism.
* Spirit Mountain Ranch donated a herd of white buffalo to the Sacred World Peace Church and Alliance, The SWPA has successfully bred six generations of white buffalo starting from a single white female, almost all with brown fathers. Their herd includes 17 white buffalo as of February 23, 2015:
** Miracle Moon (female, born April 30, 1997), calf of Big Momma (brown). Miracle Moon (the first white of this line) has been DNA tested, and is shown to be 100% buffalo, or bison.
** Rainbow Spirit (female, born June 8, 2000, calf of Miracle Moon)
** Mandela Peace Pilgrim (female, born July 18, 2001, calf of Miracle Moon)
** Arizona Spirit (male, born July 1, 2002, calf of Miracle Moon)
** Sunrise Spirit (female, born May 22, 2004, calf of Mandela Peace Pilgrim)
** Spirit Thunder (male, born May 27, 2004, calf of Rainbow Spirit)
** Chief Hiawatha (male, born May 16, 2005, calf of Miracle Moon)
* Tupelo Buffalo Park and Zoo in Tupelo, Mississippi, owned a white buffalo bull named Tukota (&quot;Too-ko-ta&quot;)
* A male white buffalo named Spirit of Peace was born on April 17, 2005, on the Blatz Bison Ranch in Fort St. John, British Columbia. Spirit of Peace died on June 1 of the same year, probably as a result of his premature birth.
*A female white buffalo calf was born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, on June 3, 2005, at Buffalo Crossing, a buffalo ranch and tourist facility. She was named Cante Pejute (Medicine Heart in the Lakota language) in a traditional ceremony led by Steve McCullough, a Lakota/Shawnee from Indiana.
* A male named Blizzard was born in March 2006 on the farm of an anonymous rancher, who arranged to have the calf transported to Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in recognition of his spiritual significance to First Nations people.
* A third white buffalo was born on the Heider farm (see &quot;Miracle&quot; above) on August 25, 2006. The male calf was named Miracle&#x27;s Second Chance and was unrelated to Miracle. The Heiders planned to breed the male with the descendants of Miracle, but during a thunderstorm late November 26, 2006, five buffalo on the Heider farm were killed in a lightning strike, including Miracle&#x27;s Second Chance.
* Lightning, formerly known as Kenahkihinén (Kĕ-Nah‛-Ki-Nĕn, from the Lenape language meaning &#x27;Watch Over Us&#x27;), a male white buffalo, was born November 12, 2006, at Woodland Zoo in Farmington, Pennsylvania.
* On May 31, 2008, a third white calf was born to a normal brown two-year-old at the National Buffalo Museum, Jamestown, North Dakota.
* On May 9, 2011, a white buffalo calf Silver Spirit was born to Mother Miracle Moon.
* On May 12, 2011, a white male buffalo calf named Lightning Medicine Cloud (Wakinya Pejuta Mahpiya in Lakota) was born near Greenville, Texas during a thunderstorm on the ranch of Arby Little Soldier. In May 2012, less than year after its birth, Lightning Medicine Cloud was found dead, thought to have been butchered and skinned by an unknown individual; his mother was found dead the next day. A necropsy determined that they died of natural causes, from a bacterial infection called blackleg. In April 2012, Lightning Medicine Cloud&#x27;s father was killed by a lightning strike.
* On June 16, 2012, a white male buffalo calf was born on Peter Fay&#x27;s dairy farm in Goshen, Connecticut. The calf was temporarily called Tatanka Ska (&#x27;white buffalo&#x27; in Lakota). Four elders from the Oglala Sioux Tribe, along with Fay and members of the Lakota, Seneca, Mohawk, and Cayuga tribes, performed a naming ceremony on July 28 at the farm; the calf was named Yellow Medicine Dancing Boy. Fay plans to care for the buffalo rather than sell it for meat.
* On July 4, 2012, a white female buffalo calf named &quot;Baby&quot; was born on Steve and Carol Sarff&#x27;s Countryside Buffalo Ranch in Avon, Minnesota. She died on July 20.

* In December 2020, Wildlife Prairie Park obtained two leucistic white bison from a farm where they were kept as pets: the male Tatanka and female Lakota. Tatanka and Lakota had one offspring in April 2021, Tallulah, who is also white. Tatanka died shortly after showing signs of illness in October 2022. Lakota gave birth to another white bison in February 2023.

* June 4, 2024, a white buffalo calf was born in Yellowstone National Park and was photographed a few minutes later by the visitor Erin Braaten. Lakota Sioux chief Arvol Looking Horse said in an interview with the Associated Press &quot;The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning. We must do more,&quot; while Troy Heinert, executive director of the South Dakota–based InterTribal Buffalo Council said that the buffalo appeared genuine as it has a black nose, black hooves and dark eyes.

<doc id="506498" wikidata="Q2006961" url="?curid=506498" title="Yeren">
<text>The yeren (, &#x27;wild man&#x27;) is a cryptid apeman reported to inhabit remote, mountainous regions of China, most famously in the Shennongjia Forestry District in the Hubei Province. Sightings of &quot;hairy men&quot; have remained constant since the Warring States Period circa 340 BC through the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), before solidifying into the modern legend of the yeren. Generally, they are described as savage, strong, and fast-moving, living in mountain caves and descending only to raid villages in search of food or women.

Scientific interest in such apemen erupted in the 1950s and 1960s in conjunction with pseudoscientific discoveries relating to Bigfoot and the yeti, but pressure by the Maoist government to leave behind these kinds of legends and folk stories repressed further interest in the yeren until its dissolution in 1976. Afterwards, large expeditions were launched by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to investigate alleged eyewitness accounts, footprints, hairs, and bodies as &quot;yeren fever&quot; took hold, with scientists working with an unprecedented reliance on citizen science. The yeren was often speculated to be a far removed human relative, such as &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; or &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;. All forwarded evidence of the creature originated from known animals — namely bears, monkeys, and gibbons — and scientific interest waned by the late 1980s. Nonetheless, organized yeren research still persists, though no serious scientific institutions recognize such apemen.

The creature has become an artistic icon of wildness and nature, and was used in the wake of the Cultural Revolution to challenge sexually restrictive and egalitarian ideals, as well as to address deforestation and other environmental issues in China.

==Antiquity==
Oral traditions and literature of &quot;wild men&quot; () and similar creatures have persisted for millennia in Chinese folklore. Their oldest ostensible appearance in writing may lie in the &quot;Jiu Ge&quot; (&quot;Nine Songs&quot;) by Qu Yuan who lived from 340 to 278 BC in the state of Chu during the Warring States period. His 9th Song speaks of a &quot;mountain spirit&quot; (); these characters generally refer to a human figure. The mountain spirit has variously been interpreted as a humanlike creature clad in a fig leaf, a yaoguai (a demon), or an ogre. In 1982, Chinese paleoanthropologist Zhou Guoxing discovered a 2,000 year old lantern with an ornament apparently depicting a &quot;hairy man&quot; (), which similarly speaks to an ancient tradition surrounding wild men.
Written reports of &quot;wildmen&quot; become more frequent in the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), though they are quite inconsistent in how visually human these creatures are. Other supposed early descriptions of hairy wildmen include:
*The &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot; and &quot;Erya&quot; compiled in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC mention a fast-moving, long-haired creature using a character commonly translated as &quot;baboon&quot; () that supposedly ate people:

*The &quot;Erya&quot; also mentions a creature using a character translated as &quot;orangutan&quot; (), an animal not native to China, or more generally &quot;ape&quot;. In 139 BC, Gao Yu described the xingxing in the &quot;Huainanzi&quot; as having the face of a human but the &quot;body of a beast&quot;.
*In 650 AD, Zhao Yanshou detailed a band of maoren who scaled a city wall.

On account of their &quot;wild&quot; nature, these creatures were often portrayed as lustful, capturing and raping villagers, the latter especially if the victim was female. Usually referred to as the jue (), these apemen purportedly lack females entirely and need to abduct and rape women to breed. The reverse is said for the &quot;wild women&quot; or &quot;wild wives&quot; () or sometimes xingxing, where they would abduct and sling men over their backs, carrying them up the mountain to wed.


The exact name &quot;yeren&quot; has typically been used in the mountains of the Shennongjia Forestry District in the Hubei Province, though the earliest written reports of the yeren are from Fang County north of Shennongjia. In 1555, during the Qing dynasty, its local newspaper &quot;Fangxianzhi&quot; published a story about a group of yeren sheltering in nearby mountain caves which preyed on their dogs and chickens. In rural Hubei, the yeren were rumored to be the descendants of the runaway laborers conscripted to build the Great Wall of China. Other newspapers as well as Chinese natural history works, such as Li Shizhen&#x27;s 1578 &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot;, frequently mention yeren or similar apemen.

==Description==
Testimonies of the alleged creature typically agree the yeren walks upright and stands over tall; is covered in tawny hair all over the body, especially long at the scalp; and has a face reminiscent of both an ape and a human. Other common descriptors include black-red hair, distended eyes, long arms hanging all the way down to the knees, and big feet. The yeren supposedly laughs when coming across a human.

==Scientific interest==
===Mao era===
Reported sightings of apemen increased during the 20th century, prompting small scientific investigations in the 1950s and 60s. The first such expeditions focused more on the yeti, a similar apeman cryptid from Tibet, funded by the Soviet Yeti Research Commission. The Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) headquartered in Beijing followed suit and included the yeti as part of its survey of Mount Everest in 1959. Prominent paleoanthropologist Pei Wenzhong communicated to Soviet colleagues a small collection of similar apeman reports across China. In 1962, another prominent paleoanthropologist, Wu Rukang, led an investigation of reports from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the Yunnan Province, but dismissed them as a misidentified gibbon. Separately, Professor Mao Guangnian linked the yeti with the yeren. His interest in the topic began when he heard his colleague Wang Zelin&#x27;s story of an apeman shot dead in 1940 while in the field on behalf of the Yellow River Water Control Committee.

During the Mao era (1949–1976) under chairman Mao Zedong, fervent government campaigns aimed to squash superstitious beliefs and to quell debates surrounding mysterious apemen. They believed stories of yeren, ghosts, and spirits would impair productivity, such as by scaring farmers from tending to their fields, and circulating such stories were sometimes punishable offenses. Scientific interest quickly dwindled and Guangnian became one of the only scientists researching the yeren. He used primarily recent scientific reports and ancient literature as opposed to contemporary eye witness accounts. Other scientists, such as Pei, ascribed apemen testimonies to scientific illiteracy and strong superstitious beliefs among villagers in these remote areas, though they remained supportive of further study. Guangnian, nonetheless, argued that, by studying yeren, he could replace superstitions with scientific fact. He speculated yeren are the source of Chinese ghost and spirit folklore, much like how manatees allegedly inspired some mermaid stories. Soviet historian Boris Porshnev suggested these apemen are a relict population of Neanderthals, but Guangnian believed the yeren were far too primitive, more likely a descendant of the giant Chinese ape &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;.

===Post-Mao &quot;yeren fever&quot;===

In 1974, historian Li Jian, the vice secretary of the Prefectural Propaganda Department of Shennongjia recorded testimonies from locals regarding the yeren, the oldest occurring in 1945. This earned Li the nickname &quot;The Minister of Yeren&quot;. His work attracted the attention of Liu Minzhuang, a professor at East China Normal University, as well as several IVPP scientists, in 1976. As the Mao Era ended on the downswing of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the taboo against superstitions diminished, and popular Western works regarding the yeti and the similar North American Bigfoot were translated into Chinese. Coupled with Li and Liu&#x27;s work and increasing commercialization with newly wrought publishing freedoms, interest in apemen surged as &quot;yeren fever&quot; took hold. In subsequent years, Liu would become the most prominent worker on the yeren, earning the nickname &quot;The Professor of Yeren&quot;.

In 1977, Zhou Guoxing along with military personnel, zoologists, biologists, and photographers launched a yeren expedition in Shennongjia on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (though the group size was probably counterproductive, generating too much noise). Subsequent expeditions comprising scientists, technicians, government officials, and local villagers collected alleged footprints, hair samples, and sightings of the yeren, published in scientific journals, pop science magazines, and newspapers. Yeren hunts effected an unprecedented involvement of untrained laypeople, and was by-and-large fueled by citizen science. In 1981, the China Wildman Research Society formed with the help of the famous Chinese paleoanthropologist Jia Lanpo, and offered a cash reward for a yeren body, ¥5,000 dead and ¥10,000 alive (at the time, $1,750 and $3,500).

Much like Guangnian, the majority of scientists worked to prove these apemen were undiscovered early offshoots of humanity rather than supernatural entities, while a minority maintained they were misidentified ordinary animals. The most popular candidates include a descendant of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; or an undiscovered Chinese variant of the African &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; (at the time considered to be gigantic like &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;). Another notable hypothesis, though not the most popular among scientists, was that the yeren are a backwards and unevolved race of modern humans, often supported by racist comparisons with local ethnic minorities. In 1984, local Li Mingzhi, when detailing his yeren sighting, remarked that at first he, &quot;thought it was a local Wa woman climbing the mountains to collect pig food.&quot; The yeren being a far removed human relative would have confirmed several popular Chinese theories of the time, which depended strongly on Marxism. Most notably is Friedrich Engels&#x27; concept of &quot;labor created humanity&quot;, because, despite being bipedal with hands free to labor, the yeren did not organize into a laborious society and remained evolutionarily stagnant. It would also support the Out of Asia theory (that modern humans evolved in Asia) which was being overturned by the now-popular Out of Africa hypothesis. Consequently, hypothetical yeren society was often characterized using Marxist feminism, a polygynous and matriarchal one. Yeren were also sometimes ascribed feelings of love and familial bonding; for example, in 1976, a pregnant yeren was rumored to be searching for her &quot;husband&quot; in Shennongjia.

By the 1980s, whole books about the yeren were being published, and a substantial collection of such literature has since amassed. Some yeren hunters — generally men — dedicated their lives to the chase, leaving their families behind. In 1981, Li received funding by the Chinese Anthropological Society to found the Chinese Yeren Investigative Research Association. Four of their exhibitions that decade garnered audiences upwards of 400,000.

===Conclusion===

As all expeditions had failed to turn up convincing evidence, scientific interest plummeted by the late 1980s. Alleged bodies, hairs, and footprints actually came from various known animals, including humans, Himalayan brown bears, Tibetan blue bears, Asian black bears, macaques, goral, and serow. Purported &quot;monkey boy&quot; skulls, supposed evidence of yeren/human hybrids, actually belonged to fully human children who suffered spinocerebellar ataxia. Since they usually are reported to have occurred at a distance, eyewitnesses may have misidentified bears, gibbons, and monkeys. Additionally, many eyewitness accounts were likely completely fabricated or embellished.

Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, the government began constricting private organizations and discouraged the ideas and observations of lay peoples (including on scientific matters). Concurring with this trend, in 1994, Li&#x27;s Yeren Association was subsumed by the China Association for Science and Technology (though it is largely funded by members instead of governments), and was renamed the Strange and Rare Animals Exploration and Investigation Committee. Further study is still not ubiquitously reproved in Chinese academic circles, though mainstream academia does not consider the yeren to be real. One of the only academics left attempting to prove the creature&#x27;s existence is American anthropologist Jeffrey Meldrum.

==In popular culture==
Owing to their mysterious yet humanlike atmosphere, the yeren became a popular symbol in fiction writing of wildness and savagery. Kidnapping stories from antiquity have inspired modern, though usually far less graphic, imaginative retellings. Among the more popular was Song Youxing&#x27;s &quot;A Yeren Seeks a Mate&quot; which erotically described an attractive female yeren with big breasts and long hair, as such a subject is often portrayed both in literature and by eyewitnesses. It was particularly significant as the yeren was described as a loving wife (to an abducted husband) and mother, and the story juggles feminine sexuality with traditional family values, concepts under much discussion and evolution subsequent to the egalitarian and sexually conservative Mao Era. Ascribing such qualities to a normally savage subject makes for easy contrast with &quot;civilized&quot; people with differing values, popular in the midst of the &quot;primitivism&quot; trend of the 1970s and 80s in China, which celebrated &quot;primitive&quot; ethnic minorities. In Post-Mao China, the yeren became an ideal of humanity in its natural state, untainted by the malices and vices of civilization, especially in reference to the humanitarian crises of the Cultural Revolution.

Alongside the giant panda, the yeren was also used to spotlight environmental issues in China in the 1970s and 80s, specifically widespread deforestation which many researchers were worried would lead to the extinction of the yeren before it could be discovered. &quot;Yeren fever&quot; may have been at play, among many other factors, in the establishment of the Shennongjia National Nature Reserve in 1983.

Hubei capitalizes on the creature&#x27;s infamy to attract tourists to remote villages within the province. A statue depicting a female yeren and her child exists within the nature preserve, serving as another popular tourist attraction.

In the film &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, one of David Lo Pan&#x27;s henchmen, the Wild-Man, is based on the yeren.

<doc id="506514" wikidata="Q623133" url="?curid=506514" title="El Corte Inglés">
<text>El Corte Inglés S.A. (), headquartered in Madrid, is the biggest department store group in Europe and ranks third worldwide. Its primary source of sales is from department stores, followed by internet sales. It is a family business, with most stock held by relatives of the deceased businessmen Ramon Areces Rodriguez and César Rodríguez González (1882–1966), and the Ramon Areces foundation.

El Corte Inglés is Spain&#x27;s and Portugal&#x27;s only remaining department store chain. El Corte Inglés has been a member of the International Association of Department Stores since 1998. Stores tend to be very large in size and offer a wide range of products: stores may sell music, movies, portable and household electronics, furniture, hardware, books, clothes, groceries, gourmet food, cars, and real estate.

==History==

In 1934, the founders Ramón Areces Rodriguez and Cesar Rodriguez Gonzalez bought a tailor&#x27;s shop (which began in 1890) located on one of Madrid&#x27;s central streets, &quot;calle Preciados&quot;, at the corner of &quot;calle Carmen&quot; and &quot;calle Rompelanzas.&quot; They made it into a limited company. The property where the shop was located had been owned by Julián Gordo Centenera since 1930. The prime location of the property soon attracted the attention of an Asturian businessman, Pepin Fernandez, who was looking to expand a business called &quot;Sederias Carretas&quot; which he had started in 1934 with a capital contribution from his cousin Cesar Rodriguez Gonzales. His plan was to purchase all of the properties on the block to construct a new building to house his business, a vision which was later realized in the form of Galerias Preciados.

Around 1920, at 15, Areces had gone to Havana, Cuba, and worked at the famous retail chain Almacenes El Encanto, where he learned the basics of department store business. Cesar Rodriguez had asked Pepin Fernandez to hire his nephew Ramon Areces in &quot;Sederias Carretas&quot; shortly after his return from Cuba. Pepin refused, so Cesar requested that he at least allow Ramon to operate El Corte Inglés while plans to acquire the block and construct the new building were finalized. Pepin, who had also learned the department store business at &quot;Almacenes El Encanto&quot;, accepted the request, and transferred ownership of El Corte Inglés to Cesar on 23 December 1935, and acquired the property where it was located on behalf of &quot;Sederias Carretas&quot; soon after. Once Cesar took ownership of El Corte Inglés, he designated Ramon Areces as manager, a position which he held until his death, including during the Spanish civil war.

When the war ended in 1939, El Corte Inglés moved to &quot;calle Preciados&quot;, on the corner of &quot;calle Tetuan&quot;, near the location of &quot;Almacenes el Aguila&quot;, to make way for the new Galerias Preciados building. In 1940, Areces turned the tailor&#x27;s shop into a &quot;sociedad limitada&quot;&quot;,&quot; registering with 1 million pesetas of capital and shares divided equally between Cesar Rodriguez, who became the first president of El Corte Inglés S.L., and Ramon Areces, whose share of the capital contribution came from a loan facilitated by his uncle. As the business expanded, eventually Cesar Rodriguez became the majority shareholder, although Areces remained in charge of strategic decisions and the day-to-day operations of the business.

In 1945 and 1946, El Corte Inglés acquired its new building and expanded to encompass 2,000 square meters of retail space on 5 floors, and shifted to a department store organizational style similar to that of Galerias Preciados, which had been operational since 1943. The company saw continuous growth until 1952, when it converted its legal structure from a &quot;sociedad limitada&quot; to a &quot;sociedad anónima&quot; in which Cesar Rodriguez remained president and majority shareholder, a position which he held until his death in 1966. After this, Ramon Areces, who until then had been managing director, became the president and largest shareholder.

The competition between El Corte Inglés and Galerias Preciados in the 1950s and 60&#x27;s caused a revolution in Spanish retail distribution. Seasonal discounts, organized ad campaigns, air conditioned stores, massive use of publicity, large scale use of display windows, customer loyalty cards, point of sale data collection, and more. The expansion of El Corte Inglés began in 1962 with the opening of its second department store in Barcelona, and expansion continues until the present. Expansion also diversified into other formats including Hipercor, first introduced in Seville in 1980. In 1969, the company started to branch out of the retail sector, first opening a travel agency, Viajes El Corte Inglés, in 1969, followed by a telecom and computing equipment wholesaler, Investronica, in 1980, and an IT services and software development company, Informática El Corte Inglés (IECISA), in 1986.

After Areces died in 1989, his nephew Isidoro Álvarez became his successor and continued to expand the business while emphasizing self-reliant financing methods, opaque management techniques, and careful investment. In 1995, El Corte Inglés bought out Galerías Preciados, which was its only serious competitor. Galerias Preciados had entered bankruptcy. In addition to acquiring its arch-rival, El Corte Inglés purchased all of the Marks &amp; Spencer stores in the Iberian peninsula in 2001.

El Corte Inglés entered into a partnership with Repsol in 1998, through which El Corte Inglés would operate convenience stores at Repsol fuel stations. These stores were initially known as Repsol-Supercor, or Repsol-Opencor after 2008, while those not attached to fuel stations were called Opencor. In 2001, El Corte Inglés opened a retail fashion outlet called Sfera. Its first big-box store, Bricor, specializing in home decor and DIY supplies, opened in 2006.

In October 2013, the firm sold a 51% stake in the financing department to the Spanish banking group Grupo Santander for around €140 million. From 2014 to 2018 the CEO of the company was Dimas Gimeno. In March 2018, El Corte Inglés closed its store on La Rambla of Barcelona.

In 2019, El Corte Inglés sold IECISA to GFI for €300 million. In June 2020, El Corte Inglés bought the private security and services company MEGA 2 for 28 million euros.

=== International expansion ===
The first attempts at international expansion happened in 1981 with the acquisition of the Harris Company, a chain of mid-sized department stores in the United States. The venture was unsuccessful, and in 1998 El Corte Inglés made a deal with Gottschalks, an American department store chain. Gottschalks took over management of the Harris Company&#x27;s stores and gave El Corte Inglés 16% of Harris Company stock. It turned out to be a total loss later, when Gottschalks declared bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

That experience led to the company taking a much more conservative approach with its 2001 expansion in Portugal, with a store in Lisbon, followed in 2006 with a store in Vila Nova de Gaia, opposite the city of Porto. In 2006, just as it opened its second store outside of Spain (in &quot;Vila Nova de Gaia&quot;), the company announced expansion outside the Iberian Peninsula: Italy was to be the first country to host a store, but owing to the ongoing Eurozone crisis, the plan was suspended, as well as the opening of the third store in Portugal.

Various food products bearing the El Corte Inglés brand are marketed in Latin American stores.

== Business ==
According to Deloitte&#x27;s report on &quot;Global Powers of Retailing,&quot; El Corte Inglés ranked 97th in 2020, down 27 places from 2019, when it ranked 69th. This made it the 3rd largest retailer by volume in Spain, behind Inditex and Mercadona. Total retail revenue in 2020 amount to €12,077 million. As of 2008, it was the second largest family business in Spain, and the 66th largest in the world.

The company&#x27;s retail revenue and net profit both increased continuously until 2007, when they began to drop. The company has not since returned to its 2007 peak of revenue, which was close to €18,000 million, with €747.6 million net profits. Since then, both revenue and profits declined until 2015, and then increased until 2019.

=== Shareholders ===
Although the company is known for jealously guarding its privacy, numerous statements have indicated that the Ramón Areces Foundation is the biggest shareholder, with 37% of the company&#x27;s shares willed to the foundation by its founder. Isidoro Alvarez controls these shares as president of the foundation, together with his own shares, which are believed to be somewhere between 15 and 27% of total shares, making him the largest shareholder.

Cartera de Valores IASA is the second biggest shareholder, with 22% of shares. Approximately 9% of shares are owned by the children of Luis Areces, Ramon Areces&#x27; brother, via the &quot;Corporacion Ceslar&quot;. Equal parts of approximately 3% of the shares, were divided between the four brothers of the Areces Fuentes brothers, sons of Ramon Areces&#x27; other brother Celestino. The brothers acquired these shares through inheritance after the liquidation of the holding company. After a lengthy legal conflict, however, they sold their shares to El Corte Inglés.

Ingondel S.L. which held 6% of El Corte Inglés&#x27; capital, was property of descendants of César Rodríguez. It was acquired in 2009. A 7% share is in the hands of Cartera Mancor, S.L., which is also made up of the descendants of César Rodríguez, by way of Paloma García Peña.

Approximately 3% is held by other members of the administrative council, and the remainder is divided between the treasure and some 3000 directors and executives of the company. It is presumed that these shareholders are always employees while they hold shares, since there are restrictions on the transfer of shares.

In December 2016 they reached their monthly peak, with more than 14 million unique users and more than 30 million visits to www.elcorteingles.es, increasing to 32 million in January 2017, becoming the most visited Spanish commercial website in Spain.

Since 1999 its General Director of Electronic Commerce and Distance Sales Division is Ricardo Goizueta Sagues and the Digital Director or Chief Digital Officer (CDO) is, since 2012, José María Fernández Ortega.

== Business model ==
Like Galerias Preciados in its time, El Corte Inglés&#x27; business model was based on introducing American style department stores to Spain during a period where Spain was emerging from economic isolation and autarky. As such, its business model revolved around the idea of a store where customer could buy everything, hence its slogan &quot;The store for all your shopping&quot; (&quot;La tienda de todas tus compras).&quot; Stores aimed not only to offer a wide variety of articles, but also goods of different levels of quality, with goods divided into departments with additional services such as home deliveries, wedding lists, repairs included in sale price, etc., as well as satisfaction and quality assurances through money-back guarantees.

This model depends on the performance of the following actors:

=== Customers ===
The company&#x27;s main business model has remained constant until the present. Its social and corporate responsibility documents emphasize five pillars of commitment to the customers: quality, service, assortment, specialization, and guarantees. This approach has been used to build customer loyalty.

In the food department, the company has launched a generic brand called Aliada. The El Corte Inglés shopping card is a credit card which was introduced in 1968, and is one of the most popular in Spain, with 11.58 million active cards in Spain in 2017. Card holders have a one-month grace period to pay off the balance of their card, with an option to defer payment for up to three months without interest, although administrative fees apply. Payment can also be deferred with low interest payments for up to 36 months. The card also grants holders the right to at least 2 hours free parking in store parking garages, and allows the purchase of any product sold in El Corte Inglés centers. Since 2006, the card can also be used to pay for fuel at Repsol fuel stations.

=== Human resources ===
In 2011, the company&#x27;s workforce was made up of 99,323 employees, down from 102,699 the previous year. 93% of those had long-term contracts, and 71% were full-time. The median age of employees was 39 years, with 13 years of experience. 37% of total employees were male compared to 63% female, although in management males outnumbered females.

Annual reports indicated that in 2012, the total number of employees further declined to 96,678, 94% of whom were full time, and 64% of whom were female. The relationship between El Corte Inglés and its employees has traditionally been formal, familiar, and paternalistic, with the company trying to establish feedback between the company and its employees. The company provides training and educational assistance, financial services, and discounts or financing for purchasing goods and services.

The company has received criticism for discriminating against women, harassment of labor unions, is directly implicated in exploitative labor practices. In the majority of the company&#x27;s locations, union elections are won by Fetico or FASGA, a national retail union accused of being a yellow union by the UGT and CCOO. Some companies in the El Corte Inglés group, such as Induyco, have been criticized by groups like Oxfam for issues of precarious work and exploitation of textile workers in third world countries.

=== Suppliers ===
The company has pursued vertical integration since early on, especially with textiles, when Ramon Areces and other shareholders founded Induyco in 1949, and which became a &quot;sociedad anonimo&quot; in 1955. Induyco, in spite of having a non-proprietary relationship with El Corte Inglés, initially had El Corte Inglés as its exclusive wholesale client, and its employees were offered benefits as if they belonged to the same group. Later, Induyco still had El Corte Inglés as its majority client, although the relationship was no longer exclusive, though its share structure remained the same, and Isidoro Alvarez was the president. In 2010 El Corte Inglés integrated Induyco into its corporate structure, and in 2012 it ceased activities.

In the field of texties, in addition to Induyco, the company created &quot;Confecciones Teruel&quot; in 1975 and &quot;Industrias del Vestido&quot; in 1976. Both companies got the majority of their capital from the Induyco group which itself was part of &quot;Investronica&quot; and &quot;Invesgen&quot;. Its creation was motivated by labor conflicts which occurred at Induyco during those years. In the field of supplying special materials for sale, the company created &quot;Mostoles Industrial&quot; in the same way as Induyco. &quot;Mostoles Industrial&quot;, unlike Induyco, retained El Corte Inglés as its exclusive customer while having a non-proprietary relationship with it. &quot;Mostoles&quot; is most well known for its production of kitchen furniture for the &quot;Forlady&quot; brand.

On the side of real estate development, the company created &quot;Construcción, Promociones e Instalaciones S.A.&quot; in 1976, whose capital is derived in its entirety from the El Corte Inglés group, and which is responsible for the construction of new stores and renovation of existing ones.

=== Publicity and advertising ===
El Corte Inglés has one of the biggest advertising budgets in Spain. In 2011, the group was the biggest advertiser in Spain, with an investment of 171.3 million euros, and as an individual El Corte Inglés itself was the third biggest, with a budget of 99.8 million euros. The company periodically conducts large publicity campaigns like &quot;Semana Fanstisca&quot; (Fantasic Week) and the &quot;Ocho Dias de Oro&quot; (the Eight Golden Days) by announcing discounts on its products. On the Christmas holiday, it organizes an animation spectacle called &quot;Cortylandia&quot; in its main stores.

Furthermore, part of El Corte Inglés&#x27; company culture includes sponsoring a number of activities that also serve as a form of advertising. For example, the El Corte Inglés Rally is a rally race that ran on the Canary Islands from 1977 to 2001.

The company spent around 300 million euro from 2008 through 2011 with the construction of a new building at Castellana 85, dedicated to decoration, that was then integrated with the existing one. After the remodeling and reorganization, merchandise was presented in a differentiated and themed way, in addition to new brands, services, and spaces, such as the &quot;Gourmet Experience&quot; a food hall with sales of gourmet products, and dining options such as seafood, Asian, Italian, Iberian specialties, hamburgers, grilled meats and fish, cheeses, skewers, fresh pastries, and fresh juices.

<text>&quot;Gerontion&quot; is a poem by T. S. Eliot that was first published in 1920 in &quot;Ara Vos Prec&quot; (his volume of collected poems published in London) and &quot;Poems&quot; (an almost identical collection published simultaneously in New York). The title is Greek for &quot;little old man,&quot; and the poem is a dramatic monologue relating the opinions and impressions of an elderly man, which describes Europe after World War I through the eyes of a man who has lived most of his life in the 19th century. Two years after it was published, Eliot considered including the poem as a preface to &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, but was talked out of this by Ezra Pound. Along with &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; and &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, and other works published by Eliot in the early part of his career, &#x27;&quot;Gerontion&quot; discusses themes of religion, sexuality, and other general topics of modernist poetry.

==History==
&quot;Gerontion&quot; is one of the handful of poems that Eliot composed between the end of World War I in 1918 and his work on The Waste Land in 1921. During that time, Eliot was working at Lloyds Bank and editing &quot;The Egoist&quot;, devoting most of his literary energy to writing review articles for periodicals. When he published the two collections in February, 1920 &quot;Ara Vos Prec&quot;, &quot;Gerontion&quot; was almost the only poem he had never offered to the public before and was placed first in both volumes.

Two earlier versions of the poem can be found, the original typescript of the poem as well as that version with comments by Ezra Pound. In the typescript, the name of the poem is &quot;Gerousia&quot;, referring to the name of the Council of the Elders at Sparta. Pound, who was living in London in 1919, was helping Eliot revise the poem (encouraging him to delete roughly one third of the text). When Eliot proposed publishing &quot;Gerontion&quot; as the opening part of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, Pound discouraged him: &quot;I do not advise printing Gerontion as preface. One don&#x27;t miss it at all as the thing now stands. To be more lucid still, let me say that I advise you NOT to print Gerontion as prelude.&quot; The lines were never added to the text and remained an individual poem.

==The poem==
&quot;Gerontion&quot; opens with an epigraph (from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;) which states:
:Thou hast nor youth nor age
:But as it were an after dinner sleep
:Dreaming of both.

The poem itself is a dramatic monologue by an elderly character. The use of pronouns such as &quot;us&quot; and &quot;I&quot; regarding the speaker and a member of the opposite sex as well as the general discourse in lines 53–58, in the opinion of Anthony David Moody, presents the same sexual themes that face Prufrock, only this time they meet with the body of an older man. The poem is a monologue in free verse describing his household (a boy reading to him, a woman tending to the kitchen, and the Jewish landlord), and mentioning four others (three with European names and one Japanese) who seem to inhabit the same boarding house. The poem then moves to a more abstract meditation on a kind of spiritual malaise. It concludes with the lines,
:Tenants of the house
:Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.
which describes the monologue as the production of the &quot;dry brain&quot; of the narrator in the &quot;dry season&quot; of his age. Hugh Kenner suggests that these &quot;tenants&quot; are the voices of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and that Eliot is describing the method of the poem&#x27;s narrative by saying that the speaker uses several different voices to express the impressions of Gerontion. Kenner also suggests that the poem resembles a portion of a Jacobean play as it relates its story in fragmented form and lack of a formal plot.

==Themes==
Many of the themes within &quot;Gerontion&quot; are present throughout Eliot&#x27;s later works, especially within &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. This is especially true of the internal struggle within the poem and the narrator&#x27;s &quot;waiting for rain&quot;. Time is also altered by allowing past and present to be superimposed, and a series of places and characters connected to various cultures are introduced.

===Religion===
To Donald J. Childs, the poem attempts to present the theme of Christianity from the viewpoint of the modernist individual with various references to the Incarnation and salvation. Childs believes that the poem moves from Christmas Day in line 19 (&quot;in the Juvescence of the year&quot;) to the Crucifixion in line 21 as it speaks of &quot;depraved May&quot; and &quot;flowering Judas&quot;. He argues that Gerontion contemplates the &quot;paradoxical recovery of freedom through slavery and grace through sin&quot;. In line 20, the narrator refers to Jesus as &quot;Christ the tiger&quot;, which emphasizes judgment rather than compassion, according to Jewel Spears Brooker in &quot;Mystery and Escape: T. S. Eliot and the Dialectic of Modernism&quot;.

Peter Sharpe states that &quot;Gerontion&quot; is the poem that shows Eliot &quot;taking on the mantle of his New England Puritan forebears&quot; as Gerontion views his life as the product of sin. Sharpe suggests that Christ appears to Gerontion as a scourge because he understands that he must reject the &quot;dead world&quot; to obtain the salvation offered by Christianity. However, other critics disagree; Russell Kirk believes that the poem is &quot;a description of life devoid of faith, drearily parched, it is cautionary&quot;. Marion Montgomery writes that Gerontion&#x27;s &quot;problem is that he can discover no vital presence in the sinful shell of his body&quot;.

In &quot;The American T. S. Eliot&quot;, Eric Whitman Sigg describes the poem as &quot;a portrait of religious disillusion and despair&quot;, and suggests that the poem, like &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, explores the relationship between action and inaction and their consequences. To this, Alfred Kazin adds that Eliot, especially in &quot;Gerontion&quot; shows that &quot;it is easier for God to devour us than for us to partake of Him in a seemly spirit.&quot; To Kazin, it is religion, not faith that Eliot describes through the narrative of &quot;Gerontion&quot;, and that religion is important not because of its spirituality but because of &quot;the &#x27;culture&#x27; it leaves&quot;. Kazin suggests that in lines 33–36 the poem attempts to show how Eliot tells his generation that history is &quot;nothing but human depravity&quot;:
:After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now 
:History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors 
:And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,
:Guides us by vanities.
Nasreen Ayaz argues that in the fourth movement of the poem, Gerontion shows that his loss of faith in Christianity has resulted in an emotional sterility to go along with the physical. In that stanza he remembers a former mistress and regrets that he no longer has the ability to interact with her on a physical level. The &quot;closer contact&quot; sought by the narrator represents both the physical longing of intimacy as well as the emotional connection he previously had with the female described in the poem.

In lines 17–19, Gerontion alludes to the Pharisees&#x27; statement to Christ in Matthew 12:38 when they say &quot;Master, we would see a sign from thee.&quot; The narrator of the poem uses these words in a different manner:

:Signs are taken for wonders. &quot;We would see a sign!&quot;
:The word within a word, unable to speak a word,
:Swaddled with darkness.
James Longenbach argues that these lines show that Gerontion is unable to extract the spiritual meaning of the Biblical text because he is unable to understand words in a spiritual sense: &quot;Gerontion&#x27;s words have no metaphysical buttressing, and his language is studded with puns, words within words. The passage on history is a series of metaphors that dissolve into incomprehensibility&quot;.

===Sexuality===
The narrator of the poem discusses sexuality throughout the text, spending several lines, including lines 57–58 where he says:
:I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it
:Since what is kept must be adulterated?
Ian Duncan MacKillop in &quot;F. R. Leavis&quot; argues that impotence is a pretext of the poem the same way that embarrassment is the pretext of &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;. He argues that the narrator writes each line of the poem with an understanding that he is unable to fulfill any of his sexual desires. Gelpi, in &quot;A Coherent Splendor: An American Poetic Renaissance&quot; also states that the poem is centred upon the theme of impotence, arguing that old age brings the poet &quot;not wisdom but confirmed decrepitude and impotence.&quot; He also argues that this theme continues into Eliot&#x27;s later works &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; and &quot;Four Quartets&quot;. To Sharpe, the inability of the narrator to carry out his sexual desires leads him to &quot;humiliated arrogance&quot; and the &quot;apprehension of Judgement without the knowledge of God&#x27;s mercy.

In lines 59–60, the speaker explains that he has lost his physical senses due to his age:
:I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch: 
:How should I use them for your closer contact?
Marion Montgomery, writing in &quot;T. S. Eliot: an Essay on the American Magus&quot;, equates the loss of these senses with the mindset that controls the narrative of the poem. Gerontion has lost the ability to partake in the same sexual endeavours that face Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s hero in &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;, yet Montgomery believes he has &quot;turned from innocent hope to pursue significance in the dark forces of the blood&quot;. Gerontion&#x27;s exploration of sinful pleasures takes place in his mind, according to Montgomery, as he can &quot;discover no vital presence in the sinful shell of his body&quot;.

== Other prominent lines ==
The phrase &quot;wilderness of mirrors&quot; from the poem has been alluded to by many other writers and artists. It has been used as the titles of plays by Van Badham and Charles Evered, of novels by Max Frisch, and of albums by bands such as Waysted. Rock singer Fish entitled his first solo album &quot;Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;.

Some commentators believe that James Jesus Angleton took the phrase from this poem when he described the confusion and strange loops of espionage and counter-intelligence, such as the Double-Cross System, as a &quot;wilderness of mirrors&quot;. It thence entered and has since become commonplace in the vocabulary of writers of spy novels or of popular historical writing about espionage. It was the title of an episode of the television series &quot;JAG&quot; where the protagonist is subjected to disinformation.

Another prominent line in the poem, &quot;In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering judas/To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk&quot;, is the origin of the title of Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;Flowering Judas and Other Stories&quot; (1930).

==Sources==
There is a connection between &quot;Gerontion&quot; and Eliot&#x27;s understanding of F. H. Bradley&#x27;s views. In Eliot&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, later published as &quot;Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley&quot;, Eliot explores Bradley&#x27;s philosophy to determine how the mind relates to reality. By relying on Bradley, Eliot is able to formulate his own scepticism and states: &quot;Everything, from one point of view, is subjective; and everything, from another point of view is objective; and there is no &quot;absolute&quot; point of view from which a decision may be pronounced.&quot; In terms of poetic structure, Eliot was influenced by Jacobean dramatists such as Thomas Middleton that relied on blank verse in their dramatic monologues. Lines within the poems are connected to the works of a wide range of writers, including A. C. Benson, Lancelot Andrewes, and Henry Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;.

==Critical response==
Eliot scholar Grover Smith said of this poem, &quot;If any notion remained that in the poems of 1919 Eliot was sentimentally contrasting a resplendent past with a dismal present, &quot;Gerontion&quot; should have helped to dispel it.&quot; Bernard Bergonzi writes that &quot;Eliot&#x27;s most considerable poem of the period between 1915 and 1919 is &#x27;Gerontion&#x27;&quot;. Kirk believes that &quot;To me, the blank verse of &#x27;Gerontion&#x27; is Eliot&#x27;s most moving poetry, but he never tried this virile mode later.&quot;

The literary critic Anthony Julius, who has analysed the presence of anti-Semitic rhetoric in Eliot&#x27;s work, has cited &quot;Gerontion&quot; as an example of a poem by Eliot that contains anti-Semitic sentiments. In the voice of the poem&#x27;s elderly narrator, the poem contains the line, &quot;And the Jew squats on the window sill, the owner [of my building] / Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp.&quot;

<text>SmartMedia is an obsolete flash memory card standard owned by Toshiba, with capacities ranging from 2 MB to 128 MB. The format mostly saw application in the early 2000s in digital cameras and audio production. SmartMedia memory cards are no longer manufactured.

==History==
The SmartMedia format was launched in the summer of 1995 to compete with the MiniCard, CompactFlash, and PC Card formats. Although memory cards are nowadays associated with digital cameras, digital audio players, PDAs, and similar devices, SmartMedia was pitched as a successor to the computer floppy disk. Indeed, the format was originally named Solid State Floppy Disk Card (SSFDC), and the physical design resembles a miniature 3.5&quot; floppy disk. The SSFDC forum, a consortium aiming to promote SSFDC as an industry standard, was founded in April 1996, consisting of 37 initial members.

A SmartMedia card consists of a single NAND flash chip embedded in a thin plastic card, although some higher-capacity cards contain multiple linked chips. It was one of the smallest and thinnest of the early memory cards, only 0.76 mm thick, and managed to maintain a favorable cost ratio as compared to the others. SmartMedia cards lack a built-in controller chip, which kept the cost down. This feature later caused problems, since some older devices would require firmware updates to handle larger capacity cards. The lack of built-in controller also made it impossible for the card to perform automatic wear levelling, a process which prevents premature failure of any individual block by ensuring that write operations are evenly distributed across the whole device.

SmartMedia cards can be used in a standard 3.5&quot; floppy drive by means of a FlashPath adapter. This remains one of SmartMedia&#x27;s most distinctive features. This method was not without its own disadvantages, as it required special drivers offering only very basic file read/write capability (or read-only on Macintosh systems) and was limited to floppy-disk transfer speeds. However, this was not so troublesome in the earlier days of the format, when card sizes were limited (generally 8–16 MB), and USB interfaces were both uncommon and low-speed, with digital cameras connecting by &quot;high-speed&quot; serial links that themselves needed drivers and special transfer programs. The 15 minutes taken to read a nearly full 16 MB card directly to hard disk by Flashpath using the slowest (128 kbit/s) PC floppy controller was still simpler and slightly faster than the quickest reliable (115.2 kbit/s) serial link, without the need for connection, synching and thumbnail previewing, and only beaten by expensive parallel-port-based external card readers that could do the same job in 2 minutes or less (≳1000 kbit/s, comparable to USB 1.0) when connected to a compatible high-speed ECP or EPP port (and ~5 minutes using a basic PPT in failsafe mode).

Typically, SmartMedia cards were used as storage for portable devices, in a form that could easily be removed for access by a PC. For example, pictures taken with a digital camera would be stored as image files on a SmartMedia card. A user could copy the images to a computer with a SmartMedia reader. A reader was typically a small box connected by USB or some other serial connection. Computers, both laptops and desktops, occasionally had SmartMedia slots built in until the mid-2000&#x27;s, for instance the 2005 Toshiba Tecra A4. While availability of dedicated SmartMedia readers has dropped off, readers that read multiple card types (such as 4-in-1, 10-in-1) continued production, but even these have decreased in quantity over time, with many dropping SmartMedia in favour of microSD and/or Memory Stick Micro. As of August 2024 only legacy card readers remain in production.

The Japan-exclusive 1998 Nintendo 64 game &quot;Mario no Photopi&quot; had two SmartMedia slots integrated into its cartridge and could facilitate transfers between devices and cards, and was marketed as supporting Fujifilm&#x27;s &quot;Digital Imaging Services&quot; for printing saved images.

Some digital audio production equipment of the early 2000s relied on SmartMedia storage, such as the Yamaha QY100 Music Sequencer, Roland MC-09 “PhraseLab” synthesizer, Korg Electribe ES-1 and ES-1 MKII, Korg Triton LE workstation, and the Zoom PS-04 &quot;Palmtop Studio&quot;.

SmartMedia was popular in digital cameras and reached its peak in about 2001, when it garnered nearly half of the digital-camera market. It was backed especially by Fujifilm and Olympus, though the format started to exhibit problems, as camera resolutions increased. Cards larger than 128 MB were not available, and the compact digital cameras were reaching a size where even SmartMedia cards were too big to be convenient. Eventually Toshiba switched to smaller, higher-capacity Secure Digital cards, and SmartMedia ceased to have major support after Olympus and Fujifilm both switched to xD. It did not find as much support in PDAs, MP3 players, or pagers as some other formats, especially in North America and Europe, though there was still significant use.

SmartMedia cards larger than 128 MB were never released, although there were rumors of a 256 MB card being planned. Technical specifications for the memory size were released, and the 256 MB cards were even advertised in some places. Some older devices cannot support cards larger than 16 or sometimes 32 MB without a firmware update, if at all. 
SmartMedia cards came in two formats 5 V and the more modern 3.3 V (sometimes marked 3 V) named for their main supply voltages. The packaging was nearly identical, except for the reversed placement of the notched corner. Many older SmartMedia devices only support 5 V SmartMedia cards, whereas many newer devices only support 3.3 V cards. In order to protect 3.3 V cards from being damaged in 5 V-only devices, the card reader should have some mechanical provision (such as detecting the type of notch) to disallow insertion of an unsupported type of card. Some low-cost 5 V-only card readers do not operate this way, and inserting a 3.3 V card into such a 5 V-only reader will result in permanent damage to the card. Dual-voltage card readers are highly recommended.

There is an oversized xD-to-SmartMedia adapter that allows xD cards to use a SmartMedia port, but it does not fit entirely inside a SmartMedia slot. There is a limit on the capacity of the xD card when used in such adapters (sometimes 128 MB or 256 MB), and the device is subject to the restrictions of the SmartMedia reader as well.

SmartMedia memory cards are no longer manufactured as of around 2006. There have been no new devices designed for SmartMedia for quite a long time now. Smartmedia cards are still frequently available on eBay mostly in used condition, with new cards coming up from time to time.

Defective SmartMedia cards are known to exist, either having missing pins or having the corner cut on the wrong side. SmartMedia cards were designed to have the top-right corner cut off (pin side up) but some were designed with the top left or bottom right cut off.

=== Copy protection ===
Many SmartMedia cards include a little-known copy-protection feature known as &quot;ID&quot;. This is why many cards are marked with &quot;ID&quot; beside the capacity. This gave every card a unique identification number for use with copy-protection systems. One of the few implementations of this primitive DRM system was by the Korean company Game Park, which used it to protect commercial games for the GP32 handheld gaming system. Samsung&#x27;s 1999 Yepp Hip-Hop MP3 player also used the feature in order to implement Secure Digital Music Initiative DRM.
=== Write protection ===
A small circle on one side of the SmartMedia card could be covered with a metalic sticker to make the card read-only unless or until the sticker was removed.

===Format errors and data loss===

Some SmartMedia cards can reportedly become corrupt and unusable if read or written by some (unspecified) card-reading devices. Affected SmartMedia cards will be unusable, and the camera or device will be unable to format, read or write to the card. Data loss and a change in the capacity that the device displays are also signs of a low-level format corruption or a corrupted CIS (Card Information System).

<text>Smoky quartz is a brownish grey, translucent variety of quartz that ranges in clarity from almost complete transparency to an almost-opaque brownish-gray or black crystals. The color of smoky quartz is produced when natural radiation, emitted from the surrounding rock, activates color centers around aluminum impurities within the crystalline quartz. 

==Varieties==

Morion is a very dark brown to black opaque variety. Morion is the German, Danish, Spanish and Polish synonym for smoky quartz. The name is from a misreading of &quot;mormorion&quot; in Pliny the Elder. 

Cairngorm is a variety of smoky quartz found in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland. It usually has a smoky yellow-brown colour, though some specimens are greyish-brown. It is used in Scottish jewellery and as a decoration on kilt pins and the handles of (anglicised: &quot;sgian-dubhs&quot; or &quot;skean dhu&quot;). The largest known cairngorm crystal is a specimen kept at Braemar Castle.

==Uses==
Smoky quartz is common and was not historically important, but in recent times it has become a popular gemstone, especially for jewelry.

Sunglasses, in the form of flat panes of smoky quartz, were used in China in the 12th century.

<doc id="506540" wikidata="Q2890246" url="?curid=506540" title="National Electoral Council (Venezuela)">
<text>The National Electoral Council (, CNE) is the head of one of the five branches of government of Venezuela under its 1999 constitution. It is the institution that has the responsibility of overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections and referendums in Venezuela at the local, regional, and national levels. The creation of the CNE was ratified in Venezuela&#x27;s 1999 constitutional referendum. Following the election of Nicolás Maduro into the presidency, the CNE has been described, by the president&#x27;s opponents, as being pro-Maduro.

==History==
The CNE was preceded by the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE), which was established under an electoral law on September 11, 1936. This entity was replaced by the CNE in 1997 with the passage of a new Organic Law of Suffrage and Participation.

== Structure ==

The National Electoral Council (CNE) is composed of five persons; three of them nominated by civil society, one by the faculties of law and political science at national universities, and one by the Citizen Power. The three members nominated by civil society shall have six alternates in ordinal sequence, and each appointed by the universities and the Citizen Power has two alternates, respectively. Members of the National Electoral Council last seven years in office and be elected separately: the three nominated by civil society at the beginning of each period of the National Assembly, and the other two in the middle of it. Members of the National Electoral Council shall be appointed by the National Assembly with the vote of two thirds of its members. Members of the National Electoral Council will designate from among its members its president, in accordance with the law. (Article 296, Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela).

==Leadership==
In 2010, the five rectors of the CNE were Tibisay Lucena (CNE president); Sandra Oblitas Ruzza (CNE vice president; also President of the Civil and Electoral Registry Commission); Vicente José Gregorio Díaz Silva (President of the Political Participation and Finance Commission); Socorro Elizabeth Hernández de Hernández; and (member of the Civil and Electoral Registry Commission). Xavier Antonio Moreno Reyes was the CNE&#x27;s general secretary. Roberto Ignacio Mirabal Acosta was a legal consultant.

, four of the CNE rectors were the same as those of 2010, except that Vicente Díaz had been replaced by .

In June 2020, Indira Alfonzo became president of the CNE. The other four rectors, , were (CNE vice-president); Tania D&#x27;Amelio Cardiet; Gladys María Gutiérrez Alvarado; and .

, the five rectors of the CNE were (president); (vice-president); Tania D&#x27;Amelio Cardiet; Alexis José Corredor Pérez; and Roberto Antonio Picón Herrera.

Starting in August 2023, the five rectors of the CNE were Elvis Eduardo Hidrobo Amoroso (CNE president); Carlos Enrique Quintero Cuevas (CNE vice-president); Rosalba Gil Pacheco; ; and Aime Clarisa Nogal Méndez. At the time of their appointments, Amoroso, Quintero and Gil Pacecho were seen as representing the government, while Delpino and Nogal were seen as representing the opposition.

==Analysis==

The electoral system of Venezuela, administered under the 1999 Constitution as one of the five branches of government, is controversial. The Supreme Tribunal of Justice, with the majority supporting Chávez, elected officials to the supposedly non-partisan National Electoral Council of Venezuela (CNE) despite the 1999 Constitution stating for the National Assembly of Venezuela to perform the task. That resulted with the CNE board having a majority consisting of Chavistas or those that supported Chávez. Since then, the Venezuelan government controlled by the PSUV ruling party manipulated elections, holding control of the CNE, the media and through government spending.

According to the United States Department of State, there is &quot;widespread pre- and post-election fraud, including electoral irregularities, government interference, and manipulation of voters&quot; and &quot;opposition political parties [have] operated in a restrictive atmosphere characterized by intimidation, the threat of prosecution or administrative sanction on questionable charges, and restricted media access&quot;. International observers have had difficulties monitoring the elections, though the Bolivarian government accepts the praise of their elections from UNASUR allies.

Several different criticisms of the Venezuelan electoral system were made. In 2005, it was alleged that the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, with a pro-Chávez majority, appointed officials to the Venezuelan National Electoral Council despite the 1999 Constitution stipulating that this task was to be performed by the National Assembly. As a result, the CNE&#x27;s board of directors was composed predominantly of individuals aligned with Chavismo. Since then, the Venezuelan government, controlled by the ruling PSUV, has manipulated elections by maintaining control over the CNE, utilizing media outlets, and leveraging government spending. According to the United States Department of State, there was &quot;widespread pre- and post-election fraud, including electoral irregularities, government interference, and voter manipulation,&quot; and &quot;opposition political parties operate in a restrictive atmosphere characterized by intimidation, threats of prosecution or administrative sanctions on questionable charges, and restricted media access.&quot; International observers had difficulties monitoring the elections.

On June 12, 2020, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice appointed CNE rectors after the controversial ruling of legislative omission by the opposition-majority Parliament, which, according to the Constitution of Venezuela, is responsible for selecting the electoral body directors. This was agreed upon between Nicolás Maduro&#x27;s government and the interim government of Juan Guaidó. The TSJ&#x27;s decision has been criticized by the opposition and international observers, as it violates the separation of powers and undermines democracy in the country. Additionally, it adds to a series of actions taken by Maduro&#x27;s government seen as attempts to consolidate its control over the Venezuelan state apparatus and suppress the opposition.

While the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela authorizes the Supreme Tribunal of Justice to appoint members of the Electoral Body when the National Assembly fails to reach a minimum percentage of deputies, beyond the composition of the electoral body, the organization of the electoral act and the formation of polling stations ensure the invulnerability of the vote as they are composed of randomly selected community members, witnesses, and political party representatives. The electoral act is entirely electronic, consisting of the following steps:

#The voter enables the vote with their fingerprint, ensuring one voter, one vote.
#The voter makes their selection on the machine&#x27;s touchscreen.
#The voting machine prints a receipt, which the voter verifies and deposits in the ballot box.
#At the close of the electoral act, results are totaled, transmitted by each machine, and the corresponding minutes are printed.
#90% of the ballot boxes are audited in the presence of the community.
#Copies of the minutes are given to the representatives of the political parties present, who transmit them to their own computing centers.
As observed, both voters and participating political organizations can verify the voter&#x27;s intention multiple times during the electoral act, making the electoral results difficult to tamper with.

=== Supreme Tribunal of Justice Intervention in 2020 ===
On June 5, 2020, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela (TSJ) declared the constitutional omission of the National Assembly of Venezuela and empowered itself to appoint the rectors of the National Electoral Council. On June 11, 2020, the IV legislature of the National Assembly of Venezuela did not recognize the TSJ&#x27;s decision and decided to continue the process of nominating candidates for CNE rectors, which was halted during the months of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Despite the lack of precedent or legal basis in the Venezuelan Constitution for TSJ intervention, on June 13, 2020, it appointed the new electoral directors based on the ruling declaring the legislative omission.

=== Smartmatic and the Constituent Election ===
Smartmatic, the company responsible for providing the electronic voting system in Venezuela, publicly denounced &quot;data manipulation&quot; during the elections for the Constituent Assembly. This denunciation was made at a press conference in London by the company&#x27;s CEO, Antonio Mugica, who pointed out a discrepancy of at least one million votes between the official figures and those recorded by their system in August 2017. The National Electoral Council (CNE) of Venezuela, in turn, rejected these accusations, defending the official participation figure of 41.53%, equivalent to 8 million voters. CNE President Tibisay Lucena described Mugica&#x27;s statements as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;baseless&quot;.

Smartmatic has been the provider of voting technology in Venezuela since 2004. Smartmatic stated that, unlike previous elections, in the 2017 election, there were no opposition auditors present, who are considered essential as process witnesses. The absence of these auditors was due to the opposition&#x27;s decision not to participate in these elections. Given the situation, several countries announced that they would not recognize the election results. The Venezuelan opposition had previously estimated a participation rate of 12.4% of the electoral roll, translating to about 2.4 million voters.

After Smartmatic&#x27;s denunciation, opposition leader Julio Borges stated that the company&#x27;s declarations confirmed the opposition&#x27;s previous allegations and described the situation as a &quot;global earthquake.&quot; On the other hand, Antonio Mugica asserted that Smartmatic had irrefutable evidence of the manipulation of participation data. Despite Smartmatic&#x27;s significant contributions to various elections in Venezuela and other countries, the company has not been free from controversy. In the past, it was accused of having ties with the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. However, with its international growth, the firm appears to have prioritized its credibility and reputation over any previous relationship with the Venezuelan government.

=== ExClé C.A ===
The company ExClé C.A, a subsidiary of the Argentine company Ex-Clé S.A, was contracted after Smartmatic&#x27;s withdrawal by Dr. Rafael Simón Jiménez, who was a CNE rector, to acquire voting machines in 2020. ExClé C.A was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of State on December 18, 2020, after the 2020 Venezuelan parliamentary election.

=== Parliamentary Elections in Venezuela ===

On Sunday, December 6, Venezuela held its parliamentary elections. These elections, called by the Nicolás Maduro government and widely boycotted by the opposition, raised concerns and controversy over their legitimacy. Maduro, who controls the country&#x27;s judicial system and electoral bodies, is determined to reclaim the National Assembly in 2021. If successful, this would further consolidate his government&#x27;s power and weaken the opposition, led by Juan Guaidó. Guaidó, recognized by many as Venezuela&#x27;s interim president, would see his term as a deputy officially end on January 4, 2021.

Several events highlighted concerns about the 2024 parliamentary election&#x27;s procedural legitimacy. A new National Electoral Council was elected without National Assembly approval. There were judicial interventions in political parties and an illegal increase in the number of parliamentarians. The outcome of these elections and how they are perceived internationally may have had significant implications for Venezuelan politics and international relations. Some countries, like Brazil and members of the Lima Group, stated that they would not recognize the results if deemed fraudulent. The position of Guaidó and his international recognition could also have been affected by the outcome and perception of these elections.

<doc id="506545" wikidata="Q958236" url="?curid=506545" title="Polish Beer-Lovers' Party">
<text>The Polish Beer-Lovers&#x27; Party (PPPP; ) was a satirical Polish political party that was founded in 1990. Originally, the party&#x27;s goal was to promote cultural beer-drinking in English-style pubs instead of vodka (and, thus, fight alcoholism); however, the party eventually developed a serious platform based around tax reform and green politics.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The party was founded by the cast and crew of a late 80&#x27;s Polish comedy series called &quot;The Beer Scouts&quot; () as &quot;a continuation of [the] TV program.&quot; Janusz Rewiński, an actor on the show, was elected leader of the party in April 1991. Andrzej Kołodziejski and Adam Halber, two editors for the now defunct magazine &quot;Pan&quot;, were responsible for most of the party&#x27;s early promotion.

=== Rise and 1991 election ===

The humorous name and disillusionment with Poland&#x27;s political transformation led some Poles to vote for and/or join the party, with it having 10,000 registered members by July 1991. The nature of the party&#x27;s appeal to its supporters was reflected in frequently-heard remarks that, maybe with the PPPP at the helm, &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t be better but for sure it would be funnier.&quot;

Although it started as a joke party, its members developed a serious platform with time, such as stopping the domestic sale of leaded gasoline. Moreover, the idea of political discussion in establishments that served quality beer became a symbol of freedom of association and expression, intellectual tolerance, and a higher standard of living.

In the 1991 parliamentary elections, the PPPP won 16 seats in the Sejm, capturing 3.27% of the vote.

=== Disbanding and successor groups ===
Soon after the election, the party split into Big Beer and Little Beer factions, despite Rewiński&#x27;s claims that &quot;beer is neither light nor dark, it is tasty.&quot; , future president of the Polish National Party, became leader of the PPPP in 1992 after Rewiński was accused of &quot;cryptic financial operations.&quot; The PPPP dissolved in 1993 after it suffered a major defeat in that year&#x27;s parliamentary election, receiving only 0.1% of the vote.

The Big Beer faction assumed the name Polish Economic Program (PPG; ). Dropping its satirical element, it became associated with the Democratic Union (UD). The Little Beer faction became associated with the Liberal Democratic Congress in a coalition of liberal pro-market parties, which supported the candidacy of Hanna Suchocka as prime minister.

In 2007, there was an unsuccessful attempt to revive the party by activists associated with Bubel.

<text>The spice trade involved historical civilizations in Asia, Northeast Africa and Europe. Spices, such as cinnamon, cassia, cardamom, ginger, pepper, nutmeg, star anise, clove, and turmeric, were known and used in antiquity and traded in the Eastern World. These spices found their way into the Near East before the beginning of the Christian era, with fantastic tales hiding their true sources.

The maritime aspect of the trade was dominated by the Austronesian peoples in Southeast Asia, namely the ancient Indonesian sailors who established routes from Southeast Asia to Sri Lanka and India (and later China) by 1500 BC. These goods were then transported by land towards the Mediterranean and the Greco-Roman world via the incense route and the Roman–India routes by Indian and Persian traders. The Austronesian maritime trade lanes later expanded into the Middle East and eastern Africa by the 1st millennium AD, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar.

Within specific regions, the Kingdom of Axum (5th century BC–AD 11th century) had pioneered the Red Sea route before the 1st century AD. During the first millennium AD, Ethiopians became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea. By this period, trade routes existed from Sri Lanka (the Roman Taprobane) and India, which had acquired maritime technology from early Austronesian contact. By the mid-7th century AD, after the rise of Islam, Arab traders started plying these maritime routes and dominated the western Indian Ocean maritime routes.

Arab traders eventually took over conveying goods via the Levant and Venetian merchants to Europe until the rise of the Seljuk Turks in 1090. Later the Ottoman Turks held the route again by 1453 respectively. Overland routes helped the spice trade initially, but maritime trade routes led to tremendous growth in commercial activities to Europe. 

The trade was changed by the Crusades and later the European Age of Discovery, during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper, became an influential activity for European traders. From the 11th to the 15th centuries, the Italian maritime republics of Venice and Genoa monopolized the trade between Europe and Asia. The Cape Route from Europe to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope was pioneered by the Portuguese explorer navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, resulting in new maritime routes for trade.

This trade, which drove world trade from the end of the Middle Ages well into the Renaissance, ushered in an age of European domination in the East. Channels such as the Bay of Bengal served as bridges for cultural and commercial exchanges between diverse cultures as nations struggled to gain control of the trade along the many spice routes. In 1571 the Spanish opened the first trans-Pacific route between its territories of the Philippines and Mexico, served by the Manila Galleon. This trade route lasted until 1815. The Portuguese trade routes were mainly restricted and limited by the use of ancient routes, ports, and nations that were difficult to dominate. The Dutch were later able to bypass many of these problems by pioneering a direct ocean route from the Cape of Good Hope to the Sunda Strait in Indonesia.

==Origins==

People from the Neolithic period traded in spices, obsidian, sea shells, precious stones and other high-value materials as early as the 10th millennium BC. The first to mention the trade in historical periods are the Egyptians. In the 3rd millennium BC, they traded with the Land of Punt, which is believed to have been situated in an area encompassing northern Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and the Red Sea coast of Sudan.

The spice trade was associated with overland routes early on, but maritime routes proved to be the factor which helped the trade grow. The first true maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia. They established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka from around 1500 BC to 600 BC, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, lashed-lug and sewn-plank boats, and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, and sugarcane), as well as spices endemic to the Spice Islands (cloves and nutmeg). It also connected the material cultures of India and China later on via the Maritime Silk Road. Indonesians in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium AD. It continued into historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road.

In the first millennium BC the Arabs, Phoenicians, and Indians were also engaged in sea and land trade in luxury goods such as spices, gold, precious stones, leather of exotic animals, ebony and pearls. The sea trade was in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The sea route in the Red Sea was from Bab-el-Mandeb to Berenike, from there by land to the Nile, and then by boats to Alexandria. Luxury goods including Indian spices, ebony, silk and fine textiles were traded along the overland incense route.

In the second half of the first millennium BC the Arab tribes of South and West Arabia took control over the land trade of spices from South Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea. These tribes were the M&#x27;ain, Qataban, Hadhramaut, Saba and Himyarite. In the north the Nabateans took control of the trade route that crossed the Negev from Petra to Gaza. The trade enriched these tribes. South Arabia was called Eudaemon Arabia (the elated Arabia) by the Greeks and was on the agenda of conquests of Alexander of Macedonia before he died. The Indians and the Arabs had control over the sea trade with India. In the late second century BC, the Greeks from the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt learned from the Indians how to sail directly from Aden to the west coast of India using the monsoon winds (as did Hippalus) and took control of the sea trade via Red Sea ports.

Spices are discussed in biblical narratives, and there is literary evidence for their use in ancient Greek and Roman society. There is a record from Tamil texts of Greeks purchasing large sacks of black pepper from India, and many recipes in the 1st-century Roman cookbook &quot;Apicius&quot; make use of the spice. The trade in spices lessened after the fall of the Roman Empire, but demand for ginger, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg revived the trade in later centuries.

==Arab trade and medieval Europe==
Rome played a part in the spice trade during the 5th century, but this role did not last through the Middle Ages. The rise of Islam brought a significant change to the trade as Radhanite Jewish and Arab merchants, particularly from Egypt, eventually took over conveying goods via the Levant to Europe. At times, Jews enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the spice trade in large parts of Western Europe.

The spice trade had brought great riches to the Abbasid Caliphate and inspired famous legends such as that of Sinbad the Sailor. These early sailors and merchants would often set sail from the port city of Basra and, after many ports of call, would return to sell their goods, including spices, in Baghdad. The fame of many spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon are attributed to these early spice merchants.

The Indian commercial connection with South East Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and Persia during the 7th and 8th centuries. Arab traders — mainly descendants of sailors from Yemen and Oman — dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and linking to the secret &quot;spice islands&quot; (Maluku Islands and Banda Islands). The islands of Molucca also find mention in several records: a Javanese chronicle (1365) mentions the Moluccas and &quot;Maloko&quot;, and navigational works of the 14th and 15th centuries contain the first unequivocal Arab reference to Moluccas. Sulaima al-Mahr writes: &quot;East of Timor [where sandalwood is found] are the islands of &quot;Bandam&quot; and they are the islands where nutmeg and mace are found. The islands of cloves are called &quot;Maluku&quot; ...&quot;

Moluccan products were shipped to trading emporiums in India, passing through ports like Kozhikode in Kerala and through Sri Lanka. From there they were shipped westward across the ports of Arabia to the Near East, to Ormus in the Persian Gulf and Jeddah in the Red Sea and sometimes to East Africa, where they were used for many purposes, including burial rites. The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to trade with India and China. Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen.

Indian spice exports find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century). Chinese traveler Xuanzang mentions the town of Puri where &quot;merchants depart for distant countries.&quot;

From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. From the 8th until the 15th century, maritime republics (Republic of Venice, Republic of Pisa, Republic of Genoa, Duchy of Amalfi, Duchy of Gaeta, Republic of Ancona and Republic of Ragusa) held a monopoly on European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving spices, incense, herbs, drugs and opium, made these Mediterranean city-states extremely wealthy. Spices were among the most expensive and in-demand products of the Middle Ages, used in medicine as well as in the kitchen. They were all imported from Asia and Africa. Venetian and other navigators of maritime republics then distributed the goods through Europe.

==Age of Discovery: a new route and a New World==

The Republic of Venice had become a formidable power and a key player in the Eastern spice trade. Other powers, in an attempt to break the Venetian hold on spice trade, began to build up maritime capability. Until the mid-15th century, trade with the East was achieved through the Silk Road, with the Byzantine Empire and the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa acting as middlemen.

The first country to attempt to circumnavigate Africa was Portugal, which had, since the early 15th century, begun to explore northern Africa under Henry the Navigator. Emboldened by these early successes and eyeing a lucrative monopoly on a possible sea route to the Indies, the Portuguese first rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 on an expedition led by Bartolomeu Dias. Just nine years later in 1497, on the orders of Manuel I of Portugal, four vessels under the command of navigator Vasco da Gama continued beyond to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi and sailed across the Indian Ocean to Calicut, on the Malabar Coast in Kerala in South India — the capital of the local Zamorin rulers. The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore; the Portuguese Empire was the earliest European seaborne empire to grow from the spice trade.

In 1511, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca for Portugal, then the center of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic and exploratory missions, including to the Moluccas. Learning the secret location of the Spice Islands, mainly the Banda Islands, then the world source of nutmeg, he sent an expedition led by António de Abreu to Banda, where they were the first Europeans to arrive, in early 1512. Abreu&#x27;s expedition reached Buru, Ambon and Seram Islands, and then Banda.

From 1507 to 1515 Albuquerque tried to completely block Arab and other traditional routes that stretched from the shores of Western India to the Mediterranean Sea, through the conquest of strategic bases in the Persian Gulf and at the entry of the Red Sea. 

By the early 16th century the Portuguese had complete control of the African sea route, which extended through a long network of routes that linked three oceans, from the Moluccas (the Spice Islands) in the Pacific Ocean limits, through Malacca, Kerala and Sri Lanka, to Lisbon in Portugal. 

The Crown of Castile had organized the expedition of Christopher Columbus to compete with Portugal for the spice trade with Asia, but when Columbus landed on the island of Hispaniola (in what is now Haiti) instead of in the Indies, the search for a route to Asia was postponed until a few years later. After Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513, the Spanish Crown prepared a westward voyage by Ferdinand Magellan in order to reach Asia from Spain across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. On October 21, 1520, his expedition crossed the Strait of Magellan in the southern tip of South America, opening the Pacific to European exploration. On March 16, 1521, the ships reached the Philippines and soon after the Spice Islands, ultimately resulting decades later in the Manila Galleon trade, the first westward spice trade route to Asia. After Magellan&#x27;s death in the Philippines, navigator Juan Sebastian Elcano took command of the expedition and drove it across the Indian Ocean and back to Spain, where they arrived in 1522 aboard the last remaining ship, the &quot;Victoria&quot;. For the next two-and-a-half centuries, Spain controlled a vast trade network that linked three continents: Asia, the Americas and Europe. A global spice route had been created: from Manila in the Philippines (Asia) to Seville in Spain (Europe), via Acapulco in Mexico (North America). 

==Cultural diffusion==
One of the most important technological exchanges of the spice trade network was the early introduction of maritime technologies to India, the Middle East, East Africa, and China by the Austronesian peoples. These technologies include the plank-sewn hulls, catamarans, outrigger boats, and possibly the lateen sail. This is still evident in Sri Lankan and South Indian languages. For example, Tamil &quot;paṭavu&quot;, Telugu &quot;paḍava&quot;, and Kannada &quot;paḍahu&quot;, all meaning &quot;ship&quot;, are all derived from Proto-Hesperonesian &quot;*padaw&quot;, &quot;sailboat&quot;, with Austronesian cognates like Javanese &quot;perahu&quot;, Kadazan &quot;padau&quot;, Maranao &quot;padaw&quot;, Cebuano &quot;paráw&quot;, Samoan &quot;folau&quot;, Hawaiian &quot;halau&quot;, and Māori &quot;wharau&quot;.

Austronesians also introduced many Austronesian cultigens to southern India, Sri Lanka, and eastern Africa that figured prominently in the spice trade. They include bananas, Pacific domesticated coconuts, &quot;Dioscorea&quot; yams, wetland rice, sandalwood, giant taro, Polynesian arrowroot, ginger, lengkuas, tailed pepper, betel, areca nut, and sugarcane.

Hindu and Buddhist religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with economic activity and commerce as patrons, entrusted large funds which would later be used to benefit local economies by estate management, craftsmanship, and promotion of trading activities. Buddhism, in particular, traveled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art, and literacy. Islam spread throughout the East, reaching maritime Southeast Asia in the 10th century; Muslim merchants played a crucial part in the trade. Christian missionaries, such as Saint Francis Xavier, were instrumental in the spread of Christianity in the East. Christianity competed with Islam to become the dominant religion of the Moluccas. However, the natives of the Spice Islands accommodated to aspects of both religions easily.

The Portuguese colonial settlements saw traders, such as the Gujarati banias, South Indian Chettis, Syrian Christians, Chinese from Fujian province, and Arabs from Aden, involved in the spice trade. Epics, languages, and cultural customs were borrowed by Southeast Asia from India, and later China. Knowledge of Portuguese language became essential for merchants involved in the trade. The colonial pepper trade drastically changed the experience of modernity in Europe, and in Kerala and it brought, along with colonialism, early capitalism to India&#x27;s Malabar Coast, changing cultures of work and caste.

Indian merchants involved in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, notably present day Malaysia and Indonesia, where spice mixtures and black pepper became popular. Conversely, Southeast Asian cuisine and crops was also introduced to India and Sri Lanka, where rice cakes and coconut milk-based dishes are still dominant.

European people intermarried with Indians and popularized valuable culinary skills, such as baking, in India. Indian food, adapted to the European palate, became visible in England by 1811 as exclusive establishments began catering to the tastes of both the curious and those returning from India. Opium was a part of the spice trade, and some people involved in the spice trade were driven by opium addiction.

<text>A straw poll, straw vote, or straw ballot is an ad hoc or unofficial vote. It is used to show the popular opinion on a certain matter, and can be used to help politicians know the majority opinion and help them decide what to say in order to gain votes. 

Straw polls provide dialogue among movements within large groups. Impromptu straw polls often are taken to see if there is enough support for an idea to devote more meeting time to it, and (when not a secret ballot) for the attendees to see who is on which side of a question. However, in meetings subject to Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, motions to take straw polls are not allowed. 

Among political bodies, straw polls often are scheduled for events at which many people interested in the polling question can be expected to vote. Sometimes polls conducted without ordinary voting controls in place (i.e., on an honor system, such as in online polls) are also called &quot;straw polls&quot;.

The idiom may allude to a straw (thin plant stalk) held up to see in what direction the wind blows, in this case, the metaphorical wind of group opinion.

==Per country==
===United States===
A formal straw poll is common in American political caucuses. Such straw polls can be taken before selecting delegates and voting on resolutions. The results of straw polls are taken by the media to influence delegates in caucus later (as well as delegates to political conventions), and thus serve as important precursors. Straw polls are also scheduled informally by other organizations interested in the U.S. presidential election.

Well-known American straw polls include the Ames Straw Poll and the Texas Straw Poll, both conducted on behalf of their respective state Republican Party organizations. Being run by private organizations, they are not subject to public oversight or verifiability. However, they provide important interactive dialogue among movements within large groups, reflecting trends like organization and motivation.

The Ames straw poll achieved a reputation as a meaningful straw poll during the presidential campaign because of its large voter turnout and relatively high media recognition, as well as Iowa&#x27;s being the first state to vote in caucuses before the primaries. In 2015 the Iowa Republican Party voted to abolish the poll, after a majority of presidential candidates declined to participate. The Iowa State Fair Straw Polls for both the Republican and Democratic races were conducted at the Iowa State Fair instead.

The U.S. territories of Guam and since 2024 Puerto Rico hold presidential straw polls during every presidential election, despite the island&#x27;s having no official say in the election.

===China===
Since the 1990s, membership of the Chinese Politburo has been determined through deliberations and straw polls by incumbent and retired members of both the Politburo and the Standing Committee.

==Other types of polls==
Straw polls are contrasted with opinion polls, usually conducted by telephone and based on samples of the voting public. Straw polls can also be contrasted with honor-system polls (such as online polls), in which ordinary voting controls are absent. In an ordinary event-based straw poll, controls common to elections are enforced: voting twice is prohibited; polls are not open for inordinately long periods of time; interim results are not publicized before polls close; etc. Honor-system polls may be conducted wholly online, conducted at one location over a period of months, conducted with interim results publicized, or even conducted with explicit permission to vote multiple times.

The meaning of results from the varying poll types is disputed. Opinion polls are generally conducted with statistical selection controls in place and are thus called &quot;scientific&quot;, while straw polls and honor-system polls are conducted among self-selected populations and are called &quot;unscientific&quot;. However, as predictors of poll results among larger populations (i.e., elections), each method has known flaws.

A margin of error is intrinsic in any subset polling method, and is a mathematical function of the difference in size between the subset and the larger population; sampling error is constant across different poll methods with the same sample sizes. Selection bias, nonresponse bias, or coverage bias occurs when the conditions for subset polling significantly differ from the conditions for the larger poll or election; event-based straw polls, where registration often closely mirrors voter registration, suffer less from nonresponse bias than opinion polls, where inclusion generally means owning a landline phone, being the party that answers the phone, being willing to answer the poll questions, and being a &quot;likely voter&quot; based on pollster criteria. Response bias occurs when respondents do not indicate their true beliefs, such as in bias due to intentional manipulation by respondents, haste, social pressure, or confusion; such biases may be present in any polling situation. Wording of questions may also inject bias, although this is more likely in a telephone setting than in an event-based ballot setting.

By relying on identity information, such as that publicly traceable to telephone numbers or voter registration addresses and that voluntarily provided by respondents such as age and gender, polls can be made more scientific. Straw polls may be improved by: asking identity questions, tracing group-based trends, and publishing statistical studies of the data. Opinion polls may be improved by more closely mirroring the larger poll or election anticipated, such as in wording of questions and inclusion procedure. Honor-system polls may be improved by adding ordinary voting controls; for example, online polls may rely on established social-networking and identity providers for verification to minimize multiple voting.

<doc id="506580" wikidata="Q6551417" url="?curid=506580" title="Linda Bove">
<text>Linda Bove is a Deaf American actress, her most notable role being a fictionalized version of herself in the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1971 to 2002. Bove was the first Deaf actress to be a member of the program&#x27;s recurring cast.

==Early life and education==
Bove was born in Garfield, New Jersey, a Deaf child born to two Deaf parents. She has one brother, Michael, who is hearing. As a child, she attended St. Joseph School for the Deaf in The Bronx, New York and subsequently Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf in Trenton, New Jersey, from which she graduated in 1963. She attended Gallaudet College, now Gallaudet University, studying library science. From there, she became interested in theatre. She participated in several theatrical productions at Gallaudet including &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; and poetic characterizations of the &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;. In her senior year, she studied in a Summer School Program at the National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD).

Bove is an active member of the Deaf arts community.

==Career==

===Television===
Bove appeared in an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; as Allison, Arthur Fonzarelli&#x27;s deaf love interest. She also performed on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, with the latter role making her one of the first deaf actors to become a regular on a soap opera series.

She also performed as a member of the National Theatre of the Deaf, founded in 1967.

Many cast members, crew, and technicians of the shows on which Bove has performed have learned sign language from her.

====Sesame Street====
Linda, portrayed by Bove, was a character on the children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. When Bove debuted on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with NTD in April 1971 (Episode 0243) as the Deaf character of her namesake, she was the first deaf performer on the show. Initially appearing sporadically, she became a regular member of the cast in 1975, and she continued to appear until 2002, making Linda the longest-running deaf character and Bove the longest-working Deaf actor on a single series in television history. In 2019, Linda returned to the franchise in the television special &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Celebration&quot;, 17 years after her last appearance. She has introduced millions of children to sign language and issues surrounding the Deaf community, increasing public awareness of Deaf culture and to reassure others who are Deaf to be proud of who they are. Her character owns a very playful dog, Barkley.

Linda communicated only in American Sign Language and interacted with other members of the Sesame Street community as a citizen and resident of the community. The person who most often interpreted for her was Bob and eventually, he and Linda were portrayed in a romantic relationship. Linda made her living as a librarian, and had an assistant, Micki Barnett, who would read stories to the children, while Linda signed them.

The staff writers at &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were initially unsure of how to write for her. Bove said, 

In addition to playing Linda, Bove appeared frequently in various sketches and silent segments, where she was often paired up with Maria, played by Sonia Manzano, often playing a supporting role in Manzano&#x27;s Charlie Chaplin silent film sketches (with occasional voiceovers), usually just as a woman in the sketch, but played a second Tramp if two were needed (e.g. the mirror sketch and the opening umbrellas sketch). Manzano and Bove worked in many other sketches together, both with and without dialogue, on-camera, or voiceover.

===Theatre===
In the 1970s, Bove and some of her colleagues started the Little Theatre of the Deaf to attract more deaf people, including children, to theater and the company gained national and international attention. It dealt with communication among deaf people and the importance of teaching sign language to deaf children.

In 1979, Bove and NTD traveled on a 30,000 mile world tour. Their biggest success was in Japan, where their show was attended by the royal family and they were invited to appear on a Japanese television show.

In 1991, Bove and her husband Ed Waterstreet founded Deaf West Theatre in Los Angeles, the first theater company run by deaf actors. While working with DWT, she starred in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, based on Joan of Arc. The company performs plays in sign language and adjusts dialog accordingly. Signed dialog is interpreted into spoken language in order to bridge the gap between the deaf and hearing communities.

She appeared in several roles in the national tour of the Deaf West production of &quot;Big River&quot; in 2005.
Bove was also involved in a number of other projects in the Deaf community, several related to children. She had a brief role in &quot;The Land Before Time IV&quot;: when the dinosaur characters would speak, Bove would appear in a picture-in-picture box in the lower corner of the screen signing the dialog. She has also made many videos in American Sign Language such as &quot;Sign Me a Story&quot; and has starred in several productions of the play &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;.

===Interpreting===
In 2004, Bove obtained credentials as a Certified Deaf Interpreter from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. Since then she has worked in that role in a variety of settings, including legal settings and White House briefings.

== Personal life ==
In 1970, Bove married Ed Waterstreet, whom she met when they both worked at the National Theatre of the Deaf.

==Filmography==
==Publications==
In 1980, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and the National Theatre of the Deaf collaborated on publishing a book, &quot;Sign Language Fun With Linda Bove&quot;

== Recognition ==
*Bove received an award in 1974 from AMITA, an Italian-American women&#x27;s organization, in recognition for her work on television.
*1991 - received an honorary degree from Gallaudet University
*1992 - Bernard Bragg Artistic Achievement Award
*July 3, 2012 Bove was presented with the Media Advocacy Award in recognition of her &quot;success in advancing the civil, human and linguistic rights of the American deaf and hard of hearing community through use of the media and social networking&quot;.

<text>Roy Kerr, also known as the Freelance Hellraiser, is an English DJ, producer, remixer and one of the creators of the UK bootleg (mashup) scene.

==Career==
Under the Freelance Hellraiser name, Kerr gained fame with a mashup in 2001 called &quot;A Stroke of Genius&quot;, which combined an instrumental edit of the Strokes&#x27; track &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; with Christina Aguilera&#x27;s pop hit &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;. Although originally greeted by a cease and desist order by RCA (the label which both Aguilera and the Strokes are signed to), he went on to remix Aguilera&#x27;s single &quot;Fighter&quot;, as well as tracks for Placebo and ex-Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft. &quot;A Stroke of Genius&quot; was later dubbed as &quot;the song that defines the decade&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 2006, he released his album &quot;Waiting for Clearance&quot;, featuring such artists as Jan Hammer, Iain Archer and Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody. The following year, he formed Kid Gloves with Anu Pillai, writing and producing two songs for Ladyhawke&#x27;s gold-selling eponymous debut album, including the single &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;.

===Collaborations===
In 2004, he was commissioned by Paul McCartney to remix some lesser-known McCartney tracks as preshow entertainment for his tour of that year. Those tracks, and several more, were released under the name Twin Freaks. In 2009, Kid Gloves contributed to Little Boots&#x27; gold-selling debut album, &quot;Hands&quot;, writing and producing her duet, &quot;Symmetry&quot;, with the Human League&#x27;s Phil Oakey.

<text>A compendium (: compendia or compendiums) is a comprehensive collection of information and analysis pertaining to a body of knowledge. A compendium may concisely summarize a larger work. In most cases, the body of knowledge will concern a specific field of human interest or endeavour (for example: hydrogeology, logology, ichthyology, phytosociology or myrmecology), while a general encyclopedia can be referred to as a &quot;compendium of all human knowledge&quot;.

The word &quot;compendium&quot; arrives from the Latin word &quot;compeneri&quot;, meaning &quot;to weigh together or balance&quot;. The 21st century has seen the rise of democratized, online compendia in various fields.

==Meaning, etymology and definitions==
The Latin prefix &#x27;con-&#x27; is used in compound words to suggest, &#x27;a being or bringing together of many objects&#x27; and also suggests striving for completeness with perfection. And &quot;compenso&quot; means balance, poise, weigh, offset.

The entry on the word &#x27;compendious&#x27; in the &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; says &quot;concise, abridged but comprehensive&quot;, &quot;concise compilation comprising the general principles or leading points of a longer &#x27;system or work. Its etymology comes from a Medieval Latin use (com+pendere), literally meaning to weigh together.

==Examples==

A field guide is a compendium of species found within a geographic area, or within a taxon of natural occurrence such as animals, plants, rocks and minerals, or stars. Bestiaries were medieval compendiums that catalogued animals and facts about natural history, and were particularly popular in England and France around the 12th century.

A cookbook is a compendium of recipes within a given food culture.

An example would be the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, a concise 598-question-and-answer book which summarises the teachings of the Catholic Church.

Most nations have compendiums or compilations of law meant to be comprehensive for use by their judiciary; for example, the 613 commandments, or the United States Code.

The collected works of Aristotle is a compendium of natural philosophy, metaphysics, language arts, and social science.

The single volume &quot;Propædia&quot; is &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&#x27;s compendium of the many volumes of its &quot;Macropaedia&quot;.

The Bible is a group of many writings of the law, prophets, and writings of the Hebrew Bible held to be comprehensive and complete within Judaism and called the Old Testament by Christianity.

Some well known literary figures have written their own compendium. An example would be Alexandre Dumas, author of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, and a gourmand. His compendium on food titled &quot;From Absinthe to Zest&quot; serves as an alphabet for food lovers.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Compendium&quot; appears as a Latin pun in the English translation of the Franco-Belgian comics &quot;The Adventures of Asterix&quot;, where it is the name of one of the four Roman military camps surrounding the Gaulish village where the protagonists reside.

Compendium Records was the name of a record store and label, which operated in Oslo, Norway, between 1974 and 1977.

<text>Carlos Norman Hathcock II (May 20, 1942 – February 22, 1999) was a United States Marine Corps (USMC) sniper with a service record of 93 confirmed kills. Hathcock&#x27;s record and the extraordinary details of the missions he undertook made him a legend in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was honored by having a rifle named after him: a variant of the M21 dubbed the Springfield Armory M25 White Feather, for the nickname &quot;White Feather&quot; given to Hathcock by the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN).

Hathcock was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on May 20, 1942, to parents Carlos Norman Hathcock I (1919–1985) and Mae Thompson (1920–1989). He grew up in Wynne, Arkansas, living with his grandmother Myrtle (1900–2000) for the first 12 years of his life after his parents separated. While visiting relatives in Mississippi, he took to shooting and hunting at an early age, partly out of necessity to help feed his poor family. He would go into the woods with his dog and pretend to be a soldier and hunt imaginary Japanese soldiers with the German Mauser which his father, a veteran of two wars, brought back from World War II. He hunted at that early age with a .22-caliber Stevens Model 15A
 single-shot rifle. 

Hathcock dreamed of being a Marine throughout his childhood, and so on May 20, 1959, his 17th birthday, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Hathcock married Josephine &quot;Jo&quot; Bryan (&quot;née&quot; Broughton; 1930–2016) on the date of the Marine Corps birthday, November 10, 1962. Jo gave birth to a son, whom they named Carlos Norman Hathcock III.

==Career==
Before deploying to South Vietnam, Hathcock had won shooting championships, including matches at Camp Perry and the Wimbledon Cup. In 1966, Hathcock started his deployment in the Vietnam War as a military policeman and later became a sniper after Captain Edward James Land pushed the Marines into raising snipers in every platoon. Land later recruited Marines who had set their own records in sharpshooting; he quickly found Hathcock, who had won the Wimbledon Cup, the most prestigious prize for long-range shooting, at Camp Perry in 1965.

=== Confirmed kills ===
During the Vietnam War, Hathcock had 93 confirmed kills of People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong personnel. In the Vietnam War, kills had to be confirmed by the sniper&#x27;s spotter and a third party, who had to be an officer. Snipers often did not have a third party present, making confirmation difficult, especially if the target was behind enemy lines, as was usually the case.

===Confrontations with North Vietnamese snipers===
The Viet Cong and PAVN called Hathcock &quot;Lông Trắng&quot;, translated as &quot;White Feather&quot;, because of the white feather he kept in a band on his bush hat. After a platoon of Vietnamese snipers was sent to hunt down &quot;White Feather&quot;, many Marines in the same area donned white feathers to deceive the enemy. These Marines were aware of the impact Hathcock&#x27;s death would have and took it upon themselves to make themselves targets in order to confuse the counter-snipers.

One of Hathcock&#x27;s most famous accomplishments was shooting an enemy sniper through the enemy&#x27;s own rifle scope, hitting him in the eye and killing him. Hathcock and John Roland Burke, his spotter, were stalking the enemy sniper in the jungle near Hill 55, the firebase from which Hathcock was operating, southwest of Da Nang. The sniper, known only as the &quot;Cobra&quot;, had already killed several Marines and was believed to have been sent specifically to kill Hathcock. When Hathcock saw a glint (light reflecting off the enemy sniper&#x27;s scope) in the bushes, he fired at it, shooting through the scope and killing the sniper. Hathcock took possession of the dead sniper&#x27;s rifle, hoping to bring it home as a &quot;trophy&quot;, but after he turned it in and tagged it, it was stolen from the armory.

Hathcock stated in interviews that he killed a female Viet Cong platoon leader called &quot;the Apache woman&quot;, with a reputation for torturing captive U.S. Marines, around the firebase at Hill 55. However, scholars such as Jerry Lembcke have cast doubt on Hathcock&#x27;s account and questioned the existence of &quot;Apache&quot;.

Hathcock only once removed the white feather from his bush hat while deployed in Vietnam. During a volunteer mission days before the end of his first deployment, he crawled over 1,500 yards of field to shoot a PAVN general. This effort took four days and three nights without sleep and with constant inch-by-inch crawling. Hathcock said he was almost stepped on as he lay camouflaged with grass and vegetation in a meadow shortly after sunset. At one point he was nearly bitten by a bamboo viper, but had the presence of mind to avoid moving and giving up his position. As the general exited his encampment, Hathcock fired a single shot that struck the general in the chest, killing him.

After this mission, Hathcock returned to the United States in 1967. He missed the Marine Corps, however, and returned to Vietnam in 1969, where he took command of a platoon of snipers.

===Medical evacuation===
On September 16, 1969, Hathcock&#x27;s career as a sniper came to a sudden end along Highway 1, north of Landing Zone Baldy, when the LVTP-5 he was riding on struck an anti-tank mine. Hathcock pulled seven Marines from the flame-engulfed vehicle, suffering severe burns (some third-degree) to his face, arms, and legs, before someone pulled him away and placed him in water because he was unaware of how badly he had been burnt. While recovering, Hathcock received the Purple Heart. Nearly 30 years later, he received a Silver Star for this action. Hathcock and the seven Marines he pulled from the vehicle were evacuated by helicopter to hospital ship , then to a naval hospital in Tokyo, and ultimately to the burn center at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.

===Post-Vietnam War and health decline===
After returning to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to the extreme injuries he suffered in Vietnam, he was in nearly constant pain, but continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock&#x27;s health began to deteriorate, and he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. Just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final pay grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines because he felt as if the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him to overcome his depression.

Hathcock provided sniper instruction to police departments and select military units, such as SEAL Team Six.

==Later life and death==
Hathcock once said that he survived in his work because of an ability to &quot;get in the bubble&quot;, to put himself into a state of &quot;utter, complete, absolute concentration&quot;, first with his equipment, then his environment, in which every breeze and every leaf meant something, and finally on his quarry. After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: &quot;Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter.&quot; He copied Hemingway&#x27;s words on a piece of paper. &quot;He got that right,&quot; Hathcock said. &quot;It was the hunt, not the killing.&quot; Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: &quot;I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It&#x27;s my job. If I don&#x27;t get those bastards, then they&#x27;re gonna kill a lot of these kids dressed up like Marines. That&#x27;s the way I look at it.&quot;

Hathcock&#x27;s son, Carlos Hathcock III, later enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps; he retired from the Marine Corps as a Gunnery Sergeant after following in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a shooter and became a member of the Board of Governors of the Marine Corps Distinguished Shooters Association.

Hathcock died on February 22, 1999, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, aged 56, from complications resulting from multiple sclerosis. He is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Gardens in Norfolk, Virginia.

==Awards and decorations==
Hathcock&#x27;s awards include:

==Legacy==
Hathcock remains a legend in the U.S. Marine Corps. The Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock Award is presented annually by the National Defense Industrial Association &quot;to recognize an individual who ... has made significant contributions in operational employment and tactics of small arms weapons systems which have impacted the readiness and capabilities of the U.S. military or law enforcement.&quot; The Marine Corps League (MCL) sponsors an annual program with 12 award categories, which includes the Gunnery Sergeant Carlos N. Hathcock II Award presented &quot;to an enlisted Marine who has made an outstanding contribution to the improvement of marksmanship training.&quot; A sniper range named for Hathcock is at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

In 1967, Hathcock set the record for the longest sniper kill. He used an M2 .50 Cal Browning machine gun mounted with a telescopic sight at a range of , killing a Vietcong guerrilla. In 2002, this record was broken by Canadian snipers (Rob Furlong and Arron Perry) from the third battalion of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry during the War in Afghanistan. Hathcock was one of several individuals to utilize the M2 Browning machine gun in the sniping role. This success led to the adoption of the .50 BMG cartridge as a viable sniper round. Springfield Armory designed a highly accurized version of their M1A Supermatch rifle with a McMillan Stock and match grade barrel and dubbed it the &quot;M-25 White Feather&quot;. The rifle had a likeness of Hathcock&#x27;s signature and his &quot;white feather logo&quot; marked on the receiver. Turner Saddlery similarly honored Hathcock by producing a line of leather rifle slings based on his design. The slings are embossed with Hathcock&#x27;s signature. On March 9, 2007, the rifle and pistol complex at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar was officially renamed the Carlos Hathcock Range Complex.

===Books===
Hathcock is the subject of a number of books including:
** reissued as a paperback in 1988, , 
** reprinted 2001,

==Weaponry==
Hathcock generally used the standard sniper rifle: the Winchester Model 70 chambered for .30-06 Springfield cartridges, with the standard 8-power Unertl scope. He also used the M40 Remington 700 chambered in .308 with a Redfield 3-9x Scope. On some occasions, however, he used a different weapon: the M2 Browning machine gun, on which he mounted an 8X Unertl scope, using a bracket made by metalworkers of the SeaBees. Hathcock made a number of kills with this weapon in excess of 1,000 yards, including his record for the longest confirmed kill at 2,500 yards (since surpassed). Hathcock carried a Colt M1911A1 pistol as a sidearm.

==In popular culture==
Hathcock&#x27;s career as a sniper has been used as a basis for a variety of fictional snipers, from the &quot;shooting through the scope incident&quot; to the number of kills he made.

===Film===
*The H2 documentary, &quot;Sniper: Inside the Crosshairs&quot; (March 10, 2015), depicted a sniper team that successfully reenacted the &quot;through the scope&quot; shot.
*The 1993 film &quot;Sniper&quot;, starring Tom Berenger and Billy Zane, was loosely based on Hathcock&#x27;s first Vietnam tour. Scenes include the &quot;through the scope&quot; shot, as well as the assassination of the General.
*The 1998 movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; reproduced the &quot;through the scope&quot; shot against a German sniper.

===Television===
*The Discovery Channel series &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested the question of shooting another sniper through his riflescope. Episode 67, entitled &quot;Firearms Folklore&quot; (November 29, 2006) featured the test: &quot;Can a bullet travel through a sniper&#x27;s scope and kill him?&quot; Using a police industry standard SWAT sniper rifle and standard police match ammunition, the MythBusters fired several shots at a scoped rifle mounted on a ballistics gel dummy. The bullet was unable to hit the dummy: it was either stopped or deflected by the multiple layers of lenses in the scope, leaving the dummy relatively unharmed. Without any clear evidence that a bullet can penetrate a sniper scope, the MythBusters decided to label the myth as &quot;busted&quot;. But, due to much debate by viewers, it was revisited in episode 75. Using a period-accurate scope (this story originates from reports of Carlos Hathcock in the Vietnam War, and the scope used by Hathcock&#x27;s opponent did not have the numerous internal optical elements of the scopes tested), it was found to be plausible.
*Hathcock was mentioned in the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;One Shot, One Kill&quot;, when a white feather was found at two crime scenes where the victims were shot and killed by a sniper. The series&#x27; protagonist, Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a former Marine scout sniper, realized the significance of the feather as the perpetrator&#x27;s &quot;calling card&quot;, referencing Hathcock&#x27;s nickname during the Vietnam War (&quot;White Feather Sniper&quot;). He credits Hathcock with &quot;39 confirmed kills&quot;, apparently having transposed the digits of Hathcock&#x27;s actual 93 confirmed kills.
*Hathcock&#x27;s duel with Cobra was mentioned in the History Channel &quot;Sniper - Inside The Crosshairs&quot; in 2016. As in &quot;Mythbusters&quot;, this show also tested the question of whether shooting a sniper through his scope was possible and came to the conclusion that it was highly plausible after four shots by a modern Marine sniper.

===Books===
*Author Stephen Hunter has on many occasions admitted that he took the inspiration for his series character Bob Lee Swagger from Hathcock.

<text>The term &quot;Cinema of Korea&quot; (or &quot;Korean cinema&quot;) encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.

South Korean films enjoyed a &quot;Golden age&quot; during the late 1950s and 1960s, but by the 1970s had become generally considered to be of low quality. Nonetheless, by 2005 South Korea became a nation that watched more domestic than imported films in theatres. This was partially a result of laws placing limits on the number of foreign films able to be shown per theatre per year, but this was mostly due to the growth of the Korean entertainment industry, which quadrupled in size during this period. In the theaters, Korean films must be played for 73 days per year since 2006, a similar restriction that exists in countries like the UK and France. On cable TV 25% domestic film quota will be reduced to 20% after KOR-US FTA. It has been noted that Korean movies have consistently outperformed foreign with very few exceptions in the Korean box office.

== Early period (until 1926) ==
According to the October 19, 1897 issue of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Motion pictures have finally been introduced into Joseon, a country located in the Far East. At the beginning of October 1897, motion pictures were screened for the public in Jingogae, Bukchon, in a shabby barrack that was borrowed from its Chinese owner for three days. The works screened included short films and actuality films produced by France&#x27;s Pathe Pictures&quot;. There are reports of another showing of a film to the public in 1898 near Namdaemun in Seoul. However, these claims have been refuted by researcher Brian Yecies, who says that he was unable to locate such an issue of &quot;The Times&quot;, or any similar article, and considers the 1897 introduction date a myth.

American traveler and lecturer Burton Holmes was the first to film in Korea as part of his travelogue programs. In addition to displaying his films abroad, he showed them to the Korean royal family in 1899. An announcement in the contemporary newspaper, &quot;Hwangseong sinmun&quot; (&quot;The Imperial&quot;), names another early public screening on June 23, 1903. Advertised by the Dongdaemun Electric Company, the price for admission to the viewing of scenic photography was 10 &quot;jeon&quot; (coin).

Korea&#x27;s first film studio, Dongdaemun Motion Picture Studio, was opened in 1903.

There are several competing claims for which is the first movie theater in the country. Dansungsa, which opened in Seoul in November 1907, is widely considered the first theater. However, a 2021 article in &quot;The Hankyoreh&quot; claims that the Incheon-based Ae Kwan Theater, which first opened as Hyŏmnyulsa () in 1895, is the first. Before the creation of a domestic film industry, films imported from Europe and the United States were shown in Korean theaters. Some of the imported films of the era most popular with Korean audiences were D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919) and &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920), Douglas Fairbanks in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1922), and Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Nibelungen&quot; films, &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Kriemhilds Rache&quot; (both 1924).

&quot;Righteous Revenge&quot;, an October 27, 1919 kino-drama (stageplay with a film backdrop) is widely considered the first Korean film, although this label is disputed. It premiered at Dansungsa, on the same day and just after the premiere of the companion documentary film &quot;Panoramic View of the Whole City of Gyeongseong&quot;. The anniversary of its release is now considered Korean Film Day in South Korea.

For the next few years, film production in Korea consisted of the kino dramas and documentaries. As with the first showing of a film in Korea, the first feature film produced in Korea also appears to be unclear. Some name a filming of &quot;Chunhyang-Jeon&quot; () in 1921 (released in 1922) as the first Korean feature film. The traditional story, &quot;Chunhyang&quot;, was to become Korea&#x27;s most-filmed story later. It was possibly the first Korean feature film, and was certainly the first Korean sound film, color film and widescreen film. Im Kwon-taek&#x27;s 2000 pansori version of Chunhyang brought the number of films based on &quot;Chunyang&quot; to 14. Other sources, however, name Yun Baek-nam&#x27;s &quot;Ulha ui Mengse&quot; (&quot;Plighted Love Under the Moon&quot;), released in April, 1923, as the first Korean feature film.

In 1925, the German priest Norbert Weber captured some of the most footage of Korea ever by a single person by that point. He did this in order to document Korean culture in case it was wiped out by the Japanese colonization. He then returned to Bavaria and edited the footage into a feature-length documentary, &quot;Im Lande der Morgenstille&quot; (lit. &quot;In the Land of the Morning Calm&quot;), as well as five other short films. The documentary aired until the 1930s in Germany and Austria, and was largely forgotten about until it was rediscovered in the late 1970s by South Korean researchers. The film has since been digitized and is now available for free online.

==The Golden Era of Silent Films (1926–1930)==
Korean film studios at this time were Japanese-operated. A hat-merchant known as Yodo Orajo established a film company called Choson Kinema Productions. After appearing in the Choson Kinema&#x27;s 1926 production &quot;Nongjungjo&quot;, the young actor Na Woon-gyu got the chance to write, direct and star in his own film. The release of Na&#x27;s film, &quot;Arirang&quot; (1926) is the start of the era of silent film in Korea.

Like the folksong &quot;Arirang&quot;, on which its title was based, Na Woon-gyu&#x27;s &quot;Arirang&quot; did not have an overtly political theme. However hidden or subtle messages could be magnified through the common use of a live narrator at the theater. A newspaper article of 1908 shows that this tradition of &quot;byeonsa&quot; (&quot;benshi&quot; in Japanese) appeared in Korea almost from the beginning of the showing of film in the country. As in Japan, this became an integral part to the showing of silent films, especially for imported films, where the &quot;byeonsa&quot; provided an economical and entertaining alternative to translating intertitles. In an interesting aspect of the &quot;byeonsa&quot; tradition in Korea, when Japanese authorities were not present the narrators could inject satire and criticism of the occupation into the film narrative, giving the film a political subtext invisible to Japanese government censors. The &quot;byeonsa&quot; operated as &quot;a narrator that introduces the characters and the setting, and explains the physical actions and psychological dilemmas during silent film screenings.&quot; The &quot;byeonsa&quot; also functioned &quot;as a cultural intermediary during the Korean audience&#x27;s film-viewing experience, and utilized his narration to complement censorship or technological limitations during the silent film period.&quot; Some of the more popular &quot;byeonsa&quot; were better-paid than the film actors.

The success of &quot;Arirang&quot; inspired a burst of activity in the Korean film industry in the late 1920s, causing this period to become known as &quot;The Golden Era of Silent Films&quot;. More than seventy films were produced at this time, and the quality of film improved as well as the quantity.

Na Un-gyu followed &quot;Arirang&quot; with popular and critically respected films like &quot;Punguna&quot; (or &quot;Person of Destiny&quot;; 1926) and &quot;Deuljwi&quot; (or &quot;Vole&quot;; 1927). He formed Na Un-gyu Productions with Bak Seong-pil for the purpose of producing films by Koreans for Koreans. Though this company was short-lived, it produced important films like &quot;Jalitgeola&quot; (or &quot;Good bye&quot;; 1927), &quot;Beongeoli Sam-ryong&quot; (or &quot;Mute Samryong&quot;)&quot;;&quot; 1929), and &quot;Salangeul chajaseo&quot; (&quot;Finding Love&quot;; 1929).

Another important director of this period, Shim Hun, directed only one film, &quot;Mondongi Tultte&quot; (먼동이 틀 때; &quot;At Daybreak&quot;). Though the reviews for this film were as strong as those for &quot;Arirang,&quot; Shim died at the age of 35 while directing his second film, based on his own novel, &quot;Sangroksu&quot; (상록수; &quot;The Evergreens&quot;). The novel was later filmed by director Shin Sang-ok in 1961 and by Im Kwon-taek in 1978.

== The later silent era (1930–1935) ==
The first half of the 1930s saw a decline in the domestic film industry in Korea. Censorship and oppression on the part of the occupying authorities played a part in reducing the number of films produced at this time to only two or three per year, and some filmmakers fled Korea for the more robust film-industry in Shanghai at this time.

Imported films largely replaced domestic films, although with Korean General Law No. 40 of 1933, the Japanese mandated that all foreign films distributed in Korea should be imported through Japan. &quot;Although some of them were very popular with Korean audiences, the supply was limited overall, and some of those coming from Japan were so worn-out that the facial expressions of the actors were blurred. Narrators could nevertheless make even worn-out movies interesting and make up for a cinema&#x27;s poor offer.&quot;

Perhaps the most important film of this era was &quot;Imjaeobtneun naleutbae&quot; (&quot;Ferryboat with no Ferryman&quot;) (1932), directed by Lee Gyu-hwan (1904–1981), starred Na Woon-gyu. Increasing governmental censorship meant that commentators have called this the last pre-liberation film to present a significant nationalistic message.

== Early sound era (1935–1945) ==
Korea&#x27;s first sound film was Lee Myeong-woo&#x27;s 1935 &quot;Chunhyang-jeon&quot;. The sound technique was reportedly poor, but Korean audiences appreciated hearing their own language in the cinema.

The number of films produced increased during the latter part of the decade. Na Woon-gyu began making a larger number of films again with significant works like &quot;Kanggeonneo maeul&quot; (1935), and &quot;Oh Mong-nyeo&quot; (1937), before his premature death in 1937.

Korea was one of Japan&#x27;s first and most important centers of colonial film production. Japanese-sponsored shorts, newsreels, and feature films heavily promoted cultural assimilation to colonized Korean audiences. To this end the Korean Colonial Cinema Unit (朝鮮総督府キネマ) was established to produce and distribute a mixture of films that promoted Japanese culture and customs as well as the benefits of modernization under the Japanese.

Coming as they did during the mid- to late-1930s, sound films in Korea faced much harsher censorship from the Japanese government-General than did the silent films before them. Also, the loss of the &quot;byeonsa&quot; narrators with the coming of sound film meant that anti-authority messages could no longer be sneaked around the censors in this way. On such example occurred with the importation of the American silent film &quot;Ben Hur&quot; (1927) into Korea. While Japanese colonial censors failed to find anything possibly inflammatory about the film, the &quot;byeonsa&quot; immediately recognized and alerted audiences to the obvious parallels between the conditions of the Jews onscreen with those of the Koreans under Japanese colonial rule resulting in the film setting off a near riot.

Japanese film censors replaced American and European films with Japanese films as part of the larger colonial project to culturally colonize Korea. Japanese films set in Korea appealed to audiences in Japan as a form of exotica. &quot;Suicide Troops of the Watchtower&quot; (望楼の決死隊, 1943), for instance, was one of several propaganda features that promoted the Japanese occupation notion of &quot;naisen ittai&quot; or &quot;Japan and Korea as one body.&quot; Although Japanese film production in Korea began in the early 1930s, total mobilization and consolidation of the Korean film industry under the Japanese would not begin until after Japan&#x27;s full-scale invasion of China in 1937. Film was an important way by which the Japanese maintained colonial control in Korea through the promotion of assimilationist policies. For example, in 1941 Japan&#x27;s Shochiku Studios together with the Japanese-sponsored Korean Military Information Division co-produced the film &quot;You and I&quot; (君と僕). The film was directed by a Korean Hae Yeong who had worked extensively in the Japanese film industry using the name &quot;Hinatsu Eitaro&quot;. &quot;You and I&quot; promoted the &quot;volunteer&quot; enlistment of Koreans into the imperial Japanese Army and carried as a subplot the interracial marriage between a Japanese woman and a Korean man. After the film was completed, Hae went to Java in Indonesia where he continued to make documentaries for the Japanese. After the war, he changed his name to Dr. Huyung, married an Indonesian woman with whom he had two sons, and produced three important Indonesian films. Before his death in 1952, he told a close friend, &quot;If I returned to Japan now there wouldn&#x27;t be any jobs for me and if I returned to Korea, I&#x27;d most likely be branded a Japanese collaborator.&quot; Although the Japanese Colonial Administration officially banned the Korean language, the Japanese film studios operating in Korea continued to make films with characters who spoke it until the end of the war.

== After Liberation (1945–1954) ==
Most of the movies in 1946 and 1947 right after Korea&#x27;s liberation from Japan&#x27;s colonial rule were films that expressed the thrill of Korea&#x27;s liberation. In 1946, Choi In-kyu founded the Goryeo Film Company and released &quot;Free Manse&quot; (), which was a huge success in the box office, followed by Lee Gu-young&#x27;s &quot;Records of Ahn Jung-geun&quot; (), Yoon Bong-chun&#x27;s &quot;Matyr Yunbong Gil&quot; (), Jeon Chang-geun&#x27;s &quot;My liberated Hometown&quot; (), and Lee Kyu-hwan&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Ddol-ddol&quot; (). Then in 1947, Yun Bong-chun&#x27;s &quot;Yu Gwan-sun&quot; () and Shin Kyung-kyun&#x27;s &quot;The New Oath&quot; () were released. The following year, in 1948, Choi In-kyu&#x27;s &quot;Innocent Prisoner&quot; (), Lee Kyu-hwan&#x27;s &quot;Seagulls&quot; (), and Han Hyung-mo&#x27;s &quot;Break the Wall&quot; () were produced.

During the Korean War in 1950, the filmmakers were once again in a time of hardship, but in 1952 a number of films were produced, including Jeon Chang-geun&#x27;s &quot;Nakdong River&quot; (), Lee Man-heung&#x27;s &quot;Affectionate Mountains&quot; (), Shin Sang-ok&#x27;s &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; (), and Jeong Chang-hwa&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; (). Returning to the capital in 1954, the filmmakers made the film persistently despite the new challenge of flooding foreign films. In 1954, Kim Seong-min&#x27;s &quot;41 degrees north latitude&quot; (), Yun Bong-chun&#x27;s &quot;Song of the hometown&quot; (), Hong Sung-ki&#x27;s &quot;Sortie&quot; (), and Shin Sang-ok&#x27;s &quot;Korea&quot; () were produced. In May 1955, tax exemption measures were implemented for Korean films, which later served as a major occasion for Korean films to enjoy the heyday. Lee Kyu-hwan&#x27;s &quot;Chunhyangjeon&quot; () was released in 1955 and caused the renaissance of Korean films.

== Heyday (1955–1979) ==
In a comparison of the number of films produced in Korea, there were 166 films produced in the early period from 1919 to 1945, 86 films produced in the period from 1946 to 1953 and 2,021 films produced in the period from 1954 to 1970. The tax exemption measures, the introduction of the latest film making machine and increase of movie goers greatly encouraged filmmakers. New genres such as teen movies and literary films emerged from the early to the mid-1960s. Kim Ki-young&#x27;s &quot;The Housemaid&quot; was released in 1960. Shin Seong-il earned stardom through films such as &quot;The Barefooted Youth&quot; (), &quot;Youth Classroom&quot; () and &quot;Rye&quot; () around this time. In 1961, Shin Sang-ok&#x27;s &quot;The Houseguest and My Mother&quot; () and Yu Hyun-mok&#x27;s &quot;Aimless Bullet&quot; (Obaltan, 오발탄) were produced. Lee Man-hee&#x27;s &quot;Late Autumn&quot; () in 1966 and Choi Ha-won&#x27;s &quot;The Old Pottery Maker&quot; () in 1969 improved the quality of Korean films. Jung So-young&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Once Again&quot; () earned a huge success in the box office.

In the 1970s, however, the Korean film industry again faced a recession and began to look for breakthroughs with Lee Jang-ho&#x27;s &quot;Heavenly Homecoming of Stars&quot; () in 1974 and Kim Ho-sun&#x27;s &quot;Winter Woman&quot; () in 1977. The emergence of Lee Jang-ho, Kim Ho-seon and Ha Gil-jong in the 70s was part of a generational shift in directors and a prediction of the young directors with new senses. In 1974, director Lee Jang-ho&#x27;s &quot;Heavenly homecoming of Stars&quot; attracted as many as 470,000 viewers alone at Kuk-do theater in Seoul and marked sixth place in the box office among all films released in the 70s. In 1975, director Kim Ho-seon&#x27;s &quot;Yeong-ja&#x27;s Heydays&quot; () was also a huge box office hit, attracting 360,000 viewers. &quot;March of the Fools&quot; () directed by Ha Gil-jong was highly acclaimed for its sensuous portrayal of the romance and wandering of youth with college students in 1975.

The introduction of the import quota system for foreign films and the consequent import regulations under the 1970s prompted fierce competition to win the right to import foreign films rather than the development of Korean films, and the fall of Korean films began slowly in the mid-70s.

== Post Modern Era (1980&#x27;s-2000&#x27;s) ==
During the 1980s a popular director was Lee Jang-Ho. Lee Jang-Ho was popular for his social or critical realism, and he gained traction from producing accurate depictions of the brutal living conditions Koreans were subjected to. Writer Nam Lee says, “Film historian Yi Hyo-In points out that the term social realism or critical realism was used to describe the Korean New Wave films of the 1980’s and 1990’s because ‘they revealed the absurdities of Korean society or portrayed its inhumane conditions in critical fashion’ (2001: 310)”(Lee 2013). It seems much inspiration can be attributed to the historical baggage that the country carries with in. In which there is a lot of, considering the country had split into Northern and Southern halves in 1945, there was a large independence war within the country itself. However, even before the now two halves had their separation, there was another independence war that Korea fought for to separate themselves from Japan when Japan invaded the country during the early 1900’s. Essentially, the moral of the story is that the Korean people of the Northern and the Southern halves have both faced endless amounts of hardships. The people were oppressed, had large quantities of poverty, a struggling economy, unfair inhumane treatment of citizens, multiple tyrannical rulers. It stands to reason these films from the 80’s and 90’s gained traction due to the realism shining through the cinemas.

Even in more recent times the factor that remains the same is the backbone of Korean film making. South Korean film making always hid factoids and subliminal messages about the culture and history of the country. From each era previously mentioned, the inspiration behind the most popular or most impactful films made in Korea was the thick cultural and historical bones. One example of cultural and historical influence comes from the South Korean film “Chwihwaseon (2002)” made by Im Kwon-taek was created, &quot;In an effort to engage with a notion of postcolonial film historiography at work in Taiwan and South Korea, respectively. The above-mentioned difference is also manifested in postcolonial trajectories of representing historical trauma” (Kim 2022). The film mentioned juxtaposed historical trauma in a modern form.

In conclusion, Korean film making from each era mentioned is heavily influenced by historical and cultural aesthetics even up till the early 2000s. To go further beyond the 2000s, in 2019 a South Korean film called “Parasite” Directed by Hong Joon-ho held a message behind the plot which showed how the people were struggle with capitalism, poverty, and the existing social order in present-day Korea. This shows that from the 1960s to this day, the films being created in the present have been influenced by whatever is going on in Korea socially, economically, politically, or culturally at the time.

<doc id="506682" wikidata="Q1640293" url="?curid=506682" title="Fluid power">
<text>Fluid power is the use of fluids under pressure to generate, control, and transmit power. Fluid power is conventionally subdivided into hydraulics (using a liquid such as mineral oil or water) and pneumatics (using a gas such as compressed air or other gases). Although steam is also a fluid, steam power is usually classified separately from fluid power (implying hydraulics or pneumatics). Compressed-air and water-pressure systems were once used to transmit power from a central source to industrial users over extended geographic areas; fluid power systems today are usually within a single building or mobile machine.

Fluid power systems perform work by a pressurized fluid bearing directly on a piston in a cylinder or in a fluid motor. A fluid cylinder produces a force resulting in linear motion, whereas a fluid motor produces torque resulting in rotary motion. Within a fluid power system, cylinders and motors (also called actuators) do the desired work. Control components such as valves regulate the system.

==Elements==

A fluid power system has a pump driven by a prime mover (such as an electric motor or internal combustion engine) that converts mechanical energy into fluid energy, Pressurized fluid is controlled and directed by valves into an actuator device such as a hydraulic cylinder or pneumatic cylinder, to provide linear motion, or a hydraulic motor or pneumatic motor, to provide rotary motion or torque. Rotary motion may be continuous or confined to less than one revolution.

==Hydraulic pumps==
Dynamic (non positive displacement) pumps

This type is generally used for low-pressure, high volume flow applications. Since they are not capable of withstanding high pressures, there is little use in the fluid power field. Their maximum pressure is limited to 250-300 psi (1.7 - 2.0 MPa). This type of pump is primarily used for transporting fluids from one location to another. Centrifugal and axial flow propeller pumps are the two most common types of dynamic pumps.

Positive displacement pumps

This type is universally used for fluid power systems. With this pump, a fixed amount of fluid is ejected into the hydraulic system per revolution of pump shaft rotation. These pumps are capable of overcoming the pressure resulting from the mechanical loads on the system as well as the resistance to flow due to friction. These two features are highly desirable in fluid power pumps. These pumps also have the following advantages over non positive displacement pumps:
*High-pressure capability (up to 12,000 psi, ca. 80 MPa)
*Small compact size
*High volumetric efficiency
*Small changes in efficiency throughout the design pressure range

==Characteristics ==
Fluid power systems can produce high power and high forces in small volumes, compared with electrically-driven systems. The forces that are exerted can be easily monitored within a system by gauges and meters. In comparison to systems that provide force through electricity or fuel, fluid power systems are known to have long service lives if maintained properly. The working fluid passing through a fluid motor inherently provides cooling of the motor, which must be separately arranged for an electric motor. Fluid motors normally produce no sparks, which are a source of ignition or explosions in hazardous areas containing flammable gases or vapors.

Fluid power systems are susceptible to pressure and flow losses within pipes and control devices. Fluid power systems are equipped with filters and other measures to preserve the cleanliness of the working fluid. Any dirt in the system can cause wear of seals and leakage, or can obstruct control valves and cause erratic operation. The hydraulic fluid itself is sensitive to temperature and pressure along with being somewhat compressible. These can cause systems to not run properly. If not run properly, cavitation and aeration can occur.

==Application==
Mobile applications of fluid power are widespread. Nearly every self-propelled wheeled vehicle has either hydraulically-operated or pneumatically-operated brakes. Earthmoving equipment such as bulldozers, backhoes and others use powerful hydraulic systems for digging and also for propulsion. A very compact fluid power system is the automatic transmission found in many vehicles, which includes a hydraulic torque converter.

Fluid power is also used in automated systems, where tools or work pieces are moved or held using fluid power. Variable-flow control valves and position sensors may be included in a servomechanism system for precision machine tools. Below is a more detailed list of applications and categories that fluid power is used for:

* Industrial (also known as fixed)
** metalworking
** injection molding
** controllers
** material handling
* Aerospace
** landing gears
** brakes

==Pneumatic and hydraulic systems compared==
; Cost: Pneumatics are less expensive to build and operate. Air is used as the compressed medium, so there is no requirement to drain or recover fluid. Hydraulic systems use larger working pressures, and require larger parts than pneumatics.
; Precision: Unlike liquids, gases change volume significantly when pressurized making it difficult to achieve precision.

==Common hydraulic circuit application==

===Synchronizing ===

This circuit works off of synchronization. As a cylinder reaches a certain point another will be activated, either by a hydraulic limit switch valve or by the build-up of pressure in the cylinder. These circuits are used in manufacturing. An example of this would be on an assembly line. As a hydraulic arm is activated to grab an object. It then will reach a point of extension or retraction, where the other cylinder is activated to screw a cap or top onto the object. Hence the term &quot;synchronizing&quot;.

===Regenerative ===

In a regenerative circuit, a double acting cylinder is used. This cylinder has a pump that has a fixed output. The use of a regenerative circuit permits use of a smaller size pump for any given application. This works by re-routing the fluid to the cap instead of back to the tank. For example, in a drilling process a regenerative circuit will allow drilling at a consistent speed, and retraction at a much faster speed. This gives the operator faster and more precise production.

==Electrical control==
Combinations of electrical control of fluid power elements are widespread in automated systems. A wide variety of measuring, sensing, or control elements are available in electrical form. These can be used to operate solenoid valves or servo valves that control the fluid power element. Electrical control may be used to allow, for example, remote control of a fluid power system without running long control lines to a remotely located manual control valve.

<doc id="506685" wikidata="Q1150106" url="?curid=506685" title="Hellboy">
<text>Hellboy is a superhero created by Mike Mignola and appearing in comic books published by Dark Horse Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;San Diego Comic-Con Comics&quot; #2 (August 1993), and has since appeared in various miniseries, one-shots, and intercompany crossovers. The character has been adapted into four live-action films: &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004) and its sequel &quot;The Golden Army&quot; (2008), a 2019 reboot film, and &quot;&quot; (2024). The character also appeared in two straight-to-DVD animated films and three video games – &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot; (2004) and &quot;Web of Wyrd&quot; (2023).

A well-meaning Cambion (or half-Demon) whose true name is Anung Un Rama (&quot;and upon his brow is set a crown of flame&quot;), Hellboy was summoned from Hell to Earth as a baby by Nazi occultists (spawning his hatred for the Third Reich). He appeared in the ruins of an old church in the Outer Hebrides in front of a team assembled by the Allied Forces, among them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, muscular, red-skinned ape/monkey-like man with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead that resemble goggles), cloven hooves, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the &quot;Right Hand of Doom&quot;). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted peanuts. Although a bit gruff, he shows none of the malevolence thought to be intrinsic to classical demons and has an ironic sense of humor. This is said to be because of his upbringing under Professor Bruttenholm, who raised him as a normal boy.

Hellboy works for the B.P.R.D., an international non-governmental agency, and for himself, against dark forces including Nazis and witches, in a series of tales that have their roots in folklore, pulp magazines, vintage adventure, Lovecraftian horror, and horror fiction. In earlier stories, he is identified as the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Paranormal Investigator&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Hellboy, or &quot;anung un Rama 
&quot; as he was called, was conceived on October 5, 1574, the day his birth-mother, Sarah Hughes, a human woman, was on her deathbed. In life, Sarah was a witch who gained her powers from being a consort of the archdemon Azzael, an Archduke of Hell and Hellboy&#x27;s &quot;biological&quot; father. Taking Sarah&#x27;s body to hell when she attempted to repent on her deathbed within a church in East Bromwich, England, Azzael burned her away so their child would be born, and chopped off the newborn&#x27;s right hand to replace it with the &quot;Right Hand of Doom&quot;, a relic with the power to free the Ogdru Jahad (a destructive, seven headed dragon imprisoned in deep space) and awaken the armies of Hell to wage war against Heaven. When the other princes of Hell learned of his actions, Azzael sent his half-demon child away while he was stripped of his powers and imprisoned in ice (like Lucifer in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;).

The child is eventually summoned to Earth in the final months of World War II by the &quot;Mad Monk&quot; Grigori Rasputin on Tarmagant Island, off the coast of Scotland, having been commissioned by the Nazis to change the tide of a losing war (&quot;Project Ragnarok&quot;). As a direct result of this rite, the child appears on Earth in a fireball at what remains of the ruined Bromwich Church on December 23, 1944, likely guided there by the ghosts of his mother&#x27;s other children. Proving not to be a devil in the traditional sense, but a devil-like creature, the child was dubbed &quot;Hellboy&quot; by Professor Trevor &quot;Broom&quot; Bruttenholm.

Taken by the United States Armed Forces to an Air Force base in New Mexico, Hellboy is raised by Professor Bruttenholm in a normal Catholic home environment, and the United States Army where he is introduced to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), a private organization dedicated to combating occult threats. Due to the success of his first mission in 1952, Hellboy is granted &quot;honorary human&quot; status by the United Nations and becomes a member of the BPRD as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest paranormal investigator&quot;. As such, Hellboy interacts regularly with humans, primarily law enforcement officials, the military, Catholic clergy, and various &quot;scholars of the weird&quot;, most of whom are not presented as overtly reacting to his strange appearance. During one of his early missions he rescued a young girl named Alice Monaghan, who had been replaced by fairies with a changeling named Gruagach. He also went to Russia and shot out the eye of the witch Baba Yaga. Gruagach and Baba Yaga both held lifelong grudges against Hellboy over these incidents. 

As an adult, having matured physically within the years yet aging slowly mentally with a teenage mind, Hellboy becomes the primary agent for the BPRD, alongside other human and quasi-human agents that include Kate Corrigan, a professor of folklore at New York University; Abe Sapien, an amphibian humanoid (&quot;Ichthyo sapiens&quot;); and Liz Sherman, a young pyrokinetic. Things change dramatically for Hellboy during the events of &quot;&quot; when he searches for Professor Bruttenholm after he disappears during an expedition in the Arctic. He finds his adopted father only to witness his death at the hands of a Lovecraftian frog monster. The search takes Hellboy, Abe, and Liz to the Cavendish Hall mansion, which is a trap established by Rasputin to lure Hellboy into an embrace of his own &quot;destiny&quot;, with the assistance of Sadu-Hem, one of the 369 spawn of the Ogdru Jahad. Controlled by the spirit of one of the ancestral Cavendish men, Abe impales Rasputin. Liz&#x27;s firestorm then incinerates Rasputin&#x27;s body alongside Sadu-Hem&#x27;s and destroys Cavendish Hall. Soon after, during a visit to Bromwich Church, Hellboy gets a glimpse of his conception 300+ years ago and learns he has two human half-siblings, a nun and a priest whose spirits haunt the church after their deaths, attempting to stop Azzael from claiming Sarah.

During the events of &quot;&quot;, Hellboy, ostensibly content to return to his life of ignorance, is set back on his journey of self-discovery when a mission for the B.P.R.D leads him to Romania to investigate the theft of an ancient box containing the corpse of Vladimir Giurescu, a Napoleonic officer who was, in fact, a vampire before he was &quot;killed&quot; on the order of a fearful Adolf Hitler. The culprit of the theft is revealed to be Ilsa Haupstein, one of the surviving members of Project Ragna Rok, who was revived from suspended animation and then aided in Giurescu&#x27;s resurrection. Finding Castle Giurescu after splitting up with the other search groups, Hellboy learns that the source of Giurescu&#x27;s rebirth is the ancient goddess Hecate. Though Hellboy destroys Hecate&#x27;s original body by forcing her into the sunlight, he faces her again after Rasputin unintentionally provides her with Ilsa&#x27;s iron maiden-encased body. Hecate swallows Hellboy and reveals to him his ultimate purpose as destroyer of worlds, but he returns to his own reality after he denounces his supposed destiny. 

Hellboy later learns that Liz is dying after losing her powers when she accidentally revived a homunculus while searching another location for Giurescu, finding Roger in the events of &quot;&quot; as he convinces the homunculus to save Liz&#x27;s life. Following the events of &quot;&quot;, gaining insight about his stone hand and being referred to as a harbinger of the Apocalypse, Hellboy is accompanied by Abe to hunt down the warlock Igor Bromhead in &quot;Box Full of Evil&quot;. But it turned out to be a trap conducted by Bromhead and the demon Ualac to capture Hellboy, using his True Name, Anung Un Rama, to restrain him, so that the latter can claim Hellboy&#x27;s normally invisible Crown of the Apocalypse to increase their power. But this act, however, proves to be counterproductive, as it allows Hellboy to no longer be controlled by his true name, Anung Un Rama (as one of the translations of this name is, lit. &quot;and upon his brow is set a crown of flame&quot;; with the theft of his crown, the name is no longer accurate), and he kills Ualac&#x27;s mortal body before the demon and the crown are taken to Hell by the archdemon Astaroth, who is later revealed to be Hellboy&#x27;s paternal uncle.

In the events of &quot;&quot;, Hellboy is assisted by the ghost of Lobster Johnson, and Roger the Homunculus in preventing an alien entity called the Conqueror Worm from arriving on Earth through the continued machinations of the surviving members of Ragna Rok. Over the course of the story, Hellboy learns that the B.P.R.D has implanted a bomb in Roger as a failsafe in case he should turn on them. Disillusioned by this knowledge and finally ready to look deeper into his origins, Hellboy quits the BPRD. 

After some time with a witch doctor in Africa, Hellboy is captured by a trio of mermaid sisters and brought underwater to a witch known as the Bog Roosh. In exchange for Hellboy, the Bog Roosh grants each sister a wish. The first two sisters are tricked by the Bog Roosh and killed by their wishes, but the third sister is clever and gets her wish, a missing piece of her father&#x27;s grave. While the third sister returns to her father&#x27;s grave, the Bog Roosh explains her plan to completely destroy Hellboy, thereby preventing the apocalypse. At the grave, the third sister is told by her father&#x27;s ghost that the only way to honor him is to save Hellboy. She does, and when the Bog Roosh realizes she cannot prevent the apocalypse, she allows herself to be killed by Hellboy in the ensuing battle. The third sister becomes the new Bog Roosh, releasing the souls of drowned sailors from which the previous Bog Roosh drew her power. She then releases Hellboy, leaving him lost at sea. 

In &quot;&quot;, after several years adrift at sea and spent drinking with the ghosts of sailors, Hellboy arrives on a mysterious island. He encounters Hecate, who once again insists that they are bound together and must unite in the destruction of the world, but Hellboy, true to his values and somewhat drunk, brushes her off. He travels deeper into the island, and is attacked by a long slumbering Sadu Hem. The fight with the creature takes him into a temple at the center of the island, where the creature stabs him through the chest, seemingly killing him. While dead, Hellboy has another conversation with the Witch Doctor, who somehow resurrects him. Hellboy awakens to find his spilled blood absorbed by the corpse of a long dead mystic who was killed in the temple. Hellboy&#x27;s blood resurrects him and transforms him into a more demonic looking version of Hellboy himself. The Mystic reveals to Hellboy the true nature of his Right Hand of Doom, which is actually the severed hand of one of the Angels involved in the creation of the Ogdru Jahad, and is therefore the only power in the universe capable of fully returning the Ogdru Jahad to Earth. The Mystic threatens to force all of mankind to worship the Sadu Hem, and Hellboy fights to stop him. Hellboy is ultimately able to win the fight. Rattled, Hellboy sets sail for England, much to the chagrin of Gruagach and the council of fairies who have been watching over him. 

Six years later, as &quot;&quot; opens, Hellboy&#x27;s search takes him to England where he finds himself in the middle of a power vacuum caused by Bromhead incapacitating Hecate in Italy. Refusing to serve the witches as their king, Hellboy ends up in the dimension of the witch Baba Yaga. Managing to defeat Baba Yaga&#x27;s champion Koshchei the Deathless, Hellboy returns to his reality and is led to Bromhead after he became monstrous and in agony from his attempt to take Hecate&#x27;s powers for his own. Hellboy gives Bromhead a merciful death before returning to England. 

&quot;&quot; opens with Hellboy receiving an invitation by the Osiris Club to join them in hunting Giants. Hellboy joins, but is betrayed by the Club and left to die. He survives, and, despite being given a means to escape, decides to engage the Giants in battle. He grows more bloodthirsty and demonic over the course of the fight, only returning to his senses when all the Giants are dead. He is found by Alice Monaghan, who, since being rescued by Hellboy in her youth, has become a close consort to the faeries of England. She takes Hellboy to meet Mab, Queen of the Faeries, who hints that his mother&#x27;s ancestry entitles him to a crown. After this, Alice and Hellboy are led into a trap where Alice in nearly fatally poisoned. The two are the taken to the castle of Morgana Le Fay to save Alice. 

To enter the castle, Hellboy must fight Eligos, a high-ranking demon from Hell. Hellboy is able to defeat Eligos with the help of one of his slaves, in exchange for Hellboy remembering the slave when he becomes ruler of Hell. Once inside, Morgana reveals to Hellboy that, on his mother&#x27;s side, he is a descendant of Mordred, and subsequently the rightful ruler of England. She also tells him about Nimue, a long-imprisoned witch who has been freed by Grugach and wants to conquer England. She takes Hellboy to the sword Excalibur, but he does not take it. Alice tries to convince him that he should, but is unsuccessful. Soon afterwards, he is visited again by Astaroth, who reveals to him that he is destined to kill Satan and become the ruler of Hell. Hellboy fights against a demonic illusion of himself, exploding into a fireball that destroys part of the castle and seemingly kills Alice. Convinced that Alice was right, Hellboy takes up Excalibur and suddenly finds himself atop a hill, with Alice, alive and well, standing beside him. 

As &quot;&quot; opens, Hellboy and Alice have begun travelling throughout England, amassing an army from the noble dead of England. Soon, they are attacked by one of Nimue&#x27;s soldiers. Hellboy is able to defeat the soldier, but while dying the soldier warns Hellboy that Nimue is transforming into something else. The two stop at a pub, where Hellboy decides that he no longer wants the sword, suggesting to Alice that she leave it in a lake. They share a kiss, and Hellboy asks Alice to move to America with him after he has defeated Nimue. On the way to Nimue&#x27;s fortress, Hellboy has another confrontation with Astartoth, rebuking him again. He then runs into Baba Yaga, who tells him that he will only be able to reach the fortress with her magical help. In exchange, Hellboy finally sacrifices his eye to Baba Yaga. Reaching Nimue, Hellboy sees she has been completely possessed by the Ogdru Jahad and now seeks to destroy the world. The two engage in battle as storms rage across England, and Hellboy is able to defeat her using a sword given to him by the ghost of Vasilisa. As the Dragon collapses, Nimue&#x27;s ghost emerges and plucks out Hellboy&#x27;s heart, damning him to Hell. 

&quot;Hellboy in Hell&quot; begins with Hellboy stuck in the Abyss, the outermost part of Hell, and being attacked by Eligos. He is saved by Edward Grey, a british paranormal investigator who wound up trapped in Hell and has been watching over Hellboy for many years. Soon after, Hellboy is visited by three spirits. The first takes him to see his birth in Hell and his father&#x27;s imprisonment. Then he is shown Satan, who he murders as prophesied, but does not remember doing so. Finally, he is shown the sleeping army of Hell that his Right Hand has the power to awaken. After this, he is attacked by his fully demonic half brothers Lusk and Gammon who are being manipulated by Astaroth. All three are killed, and Hellboy falls again into the Abyss. He is saved again by Grey, who convinces him to commit to his new life in Hell. In between helping out lost souls, Hellboy learns gradually that the aristocracy of Hell have all gone into hiding or been killed by their slaves since his arrival, as they panicked over the thought that he might kill them all. He is poisoned by powerful spirits called the Furies, who were set on him by his half sister Gamori. The furies turn on her, dooming her to destroy the remains of Pandemonium, the capital city of Hell. Eventually, Hellboy, in fully demonic form, hunts down the last remaining rulers of Hell and destroys them all with the help of their slaves. After this, he returns to a home on the beach where he is met by three glowing shapes. 

Hellboy returns, resurrected, in &quot;B.P.R.D: The Devil You Know&quot;, the final arc of the narrative. He fights alongside his original companions, Liz Sherman and Abe Sapien, against the rising Sadu Hem and a small group of demons seeking to conquer Earth. The team defeats the demon Yomyael, who is possessing a young girl named Varvara. Once free, however, Varvara reveals herself to be the daughter of their old foe Rasputin, and resurrects him. Hellboy and Rasputin battle one last time, both dying. As a ghost, Hellboy is shown the remaining path to the end of the world by Edward Grey. Agents of the B.P.R.D. are able to save a small portion of humanity, guiding them to shelter underground. On the surface, the Sadu Hem reign for a short time before the Osiris Club use Hellboy&#x27;s severed Right Hand of Doom to summon the Ogdru Jahad to Earth and kill it. Once this is done, Hellboy takes back the Hand, killing the Osiris Club in the process. Finally, he sees Liz Sherman, somehow still alive, and instructs her to unleash the full brunt of her pyrokinetic abilities, burning down the world. The world gone, Hecate appears before Hellboy, once again in her Iron Maiden form. She assures him that there is nothing he could have done to prevent any of this. He tries to fight her, but realizes how tired he is of violence. He steps inside her Iron Maiden form, and his blood revives the world.

==Powers and abilities==
Afforded by his demonic heritage as well as extensive physical training and bodybuilding, Hellboy possesses superhuman strength that exceeds the 1-ton base limit, endurance, a degree of resistance to injury, and a healing factor that allows him to heal quickly from virtually all bodily injuries as well as renders him immune to all diseases. He also has the innate ability to comprehend ancient and magical languages. The extent of his strength is unclear, but he has torn down a large tree and hurled it at an opponent and has lifted massive stones. He has also picked up and thrown opponents weighing at least four to five hundred pounds. Hellboy has a high degree of resilience to injury. He can withstand powerful blows that would severely injure or kill a human. He survived being shot many times in the chest with an MG 42 machine gun before destroying it. He has survived being impaled through the chest with a sword, severe werewolf mauling, being beaten unconscious with heavy iron tongs, falling from extreme heights, being crushed by boulders, and more. In the film version, it is stated that Hellboy is immune to all forms of fire and burns, including Liz Sherman&#x27;s flames, and electrocution. Despite his ability to quickly recover from seemingly mortal wounds, he is far from invulnerable and can be injured or bloodied by conventional weapons. Curiously in certain instances, the spilling of Hellboy&#x27;s blood causes lilies to sprout - a supernatural indicator of his true good nature. This unique property comes into play even at the culmination of Ragnarok, where Hecate spills Hellboy&#x27;s blood onto the incinerated Earth to breathe life back into it. It is revealed to Baba Yaga by the dead Russian nobility that Hellboy may not be slain even through supernatural means and that he appears to be as deathless as her warrior, Koschei the Deathless. In the films, Hellboy has shown skill in necromancy, animating a man&#x27;s dead body so that it could give him directions. This also happened in the 2019 reboot, where Hellboy is able to raise an entire army of the dead after embracing his power as Anung Un Rama.

Hellboy ages quite differently from human beings. In the story &quot;Pancakes&quot; he is now two-years old but appears to be somewhere between 6 and 10 in human years old. In &quot;Nature of the Beast&quot;, set in 1954, the ten-year-old Hellboy appears fully grown. His rapid physical maturation is in contrast to his actual rate of aging, however, which seems to be much slower than humans. Throughout the sixty-year span of time depicted in the comics, he does not age beyond the plateau of physical maturity. This mystical aging process is similar to the other demons and supernatural beings that populate Hellboy&#x27;s world. The lifespan of a demon (or half-demon, as Hellboy&#x27;s mother was human) is left undefined within the comics and seems to range from decades to many thousands of years. In the films, Hellboy&#x27;s aging process is described by BRPD as &quot;reverse dog years&quot;.

In addition to his natural physical abilities, Hellboy keeps a variety of items in his utility belt and jacket that can be used against various supernatural forces. He has been known to carry holy relics, horseshoes, various herbs, and hand grenades. He frequently carries an oversized revolver, which in the Guillermo del Toro films was named the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot;, and whose construction incorporates iron that had been used to forge a church bell. However, Hellboy freely admits to having extremely poor aim with the weapon, and often favors fighting hand-to-hand, preferring to use short-ranged physical weapons like swords, spears, and his massive stone fist over firearms. Hellboy&#x27;s lack of formal combat training and education is compensated for by his decades of experience as a paranormal investigator, though encounters with unfamiliar threats have often forced him to resort to improvisation and using his wits.

===Right Hand of Doom===
As revealed in &quot;Strange Places&quot;, Hellboy&#x27;s right hand was originally the right hand of Anum, one of the Watcher angels that watched over the burgeoning Earth and created the Ogdru Jahad. After sealing the Ogdru Jahad away, Anum was destroyed by his fellow spirits. Only his right hand remained intact as it was kept and preserved by the Hyperboreans, the first race of man. The Right Hand of Doom eventually ended up in the possession of Azzael before he grafted it onto the newborn Hellboy.

As the hand which created and bound the Ogdru Jahad, it is also the key that will &quot;loose and command&quot; them; in other words, it is a catalyst that will bring about Ragnarok. The comic books themselves never mention how the Right Hand of Doom would actually perform these tasks; they only explain this is the case and someone or something intends to do it, with or without Hellboy&#x27;s consent. The film shows it working as a key: being turned twice in a special obelisk secured by Rasputin would release the Ogdru Jahad. Astaroth and others also told of how the Hand contains the power to awaken the great Army of Hell, an army powerful enough to shatter the boundaries between Heaven, Hell and Earth for the wielder to rule all of Creation. This prophecy had never come to pass thanks to Hellboy&#x27;s consistent refusal to embrace his destiny. It is made clear it is not necessary for the arm to be attached to Hellboy to perform its duties. It has been suggested if Hellboy dies while the Hand is attached to him, it would become useless. He has, therefore, concluded the only way to prevent its falling into the wrong hands is to keep and protect it.

==Concept and creation==
Hellboy originated in 1991 with a drawing Mike Mignola did for a Great Salt Lake Comic-Con promotional pamphlet of a demon with the name &quot;Hell Boy&quot; written on his belt. Mignola had initially no intention of doing anything serious with the concept, but eventually decided he liked the name.

Later, Mignola became interested in doing a creator-owned comic, as he felt it made more sense to create his own characters for the stories he wanted to tell, rather than trying to shoehorn existing characters into these stories. Mignola elaborated, &quot;The kinds of stories I wanted to do I had in mind before I created Hellboy. It&#x27;s not like I created Hellboy and said, &#x27;Hey, now what does this guy do?&#x27; I knew the kinds of stories I wanted to do, but just needed a main guy.&quot; He initially created Hellboy as part of a team of five, but scrapped this idea when he realized he could not think of any team names that he liked.

Much like other American comic book superheroes, such as Batman, Wolverine, Iron Man, Daredevil, and Spawn, Hellboy is constantly tormented by the knowledge of his past. One example being in &quot;Wake the Devil&quot; where he describes his mindset since the aftermath of &quot;Seed of Destruction&quot; by saying, &quot;I &quot;like&quot; not knowing. I&#x27;ve gotten by for fifty-two years without knowing. I sleep good &quot;not knowing&quot;.&quot;

==Publication history==

Before &quot;Hellboy&quot; was published independently at Dark Horse Comics, the concept was initially pitched to a board of directors for DC Comics, who loved it, but did not like the idea of it involving &quot;Hell&quot;.

The early stories were conceived and drawn by Mignola with a script written by John Byrne and some later stories have been crafted by creators other than Mignola, including Christopher Golden, Guy Davis, Ryan Sook, and Duncan Fegredo. The increasing commitments from the &quot;Hellboy&quot; franchise meant that 2008 one-shot &quot;In the Chapel of Moloch&quot; was the first &quot;Hellboy&quot; comic Mignola had provided the script and art for since &quot;The Island&quot; in 2005.

===Other appearances===
Beyond the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comic and its associated spinoffs, Hellboy has made appearances in other publications:

====Great Salt Lake Comic-Con pamphlet====
The character name &quot;Hell Boy&quot; was included in a drawing by Mike Mignola of a demon character in a black and white illustration, with the later recognized name appearing on the demon&#x27;s belt buckle. This image, accompanied by a short biography of Mike Mignola and his latest creation, appeared in the pamphlet in 1991. It is the first published mention of the later recognized name. This image was reprinted in&quot; The Art of Hellboy&quot;. This image was also used to create the “First Hellboy” statue by Mondo Tees, in both black and white and full color.

====&quot;Dime Press&quot;====
A prototype incarnation of Hellboy appeared on the cover of &quot;Dime Press&quot; #4 (Glamour International Production, 1993), an obscure Italian fanzine, with &quot;Hellboy©Mignola 93&quot; written at the bottom of the cover. The cover, illustrated by Mignola and by the Italian artist Nicola Mari, shows Hellboy in the act of attacking a &quot;diabolic&quot; version of the Italian SF comic book character Nathan Never (with bat wings and pointed tail). Mari at the time was one of the artists that worked on Nathan Never, and the first two years of the life of this comic were the main topic of the fanzine. With the exception of the cover, there is no other mention of Hellboy within the fanzine. The character shown was still in a draft stage, and although close to the final design of Hellboy, it had gray skin and an outfit not common to the character.

====&quot;San Diego Comic-Con Comics&quot;====
&quot;Mike Mignola&#x27;s Hellboy&quot; by Mike Mignola and John Byrne featured the character&#x27;s first full appearance, and was a four-page black-and-white story that had an approximately 1,500 book print run. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in &quot;San Diego Comic-Con Comics&quot; #2 (August 1993) for distribution at San Diego Comic-Con. It was also reprinted in The Comic&#x27;s Buyers Guide #1069, along with an interview with creator Mike Mignola.

Hellboy travels to an American ghost town, where he encounters a mangy mutt that transforms into Anubis, the Ancient Egyptian god of mummification.

The story was collected in the trade paperback &quot;&quot;.

====&quot;Next Men&quot;====
Hellboy makes a guest appearance in John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Next Men&quot; #21 (Dark Horse Comics, December 1993); this is the first American appearance in a full-color cameo.

====&quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;====
&quot;Mike Mignola&#x27;s Hellboy: World&#x27;s Greatest Paranormal Investigator&quot; by Mike Mignola and John Byrne featured the character&#x27;s next solo appearance. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in a special four-page mini-comic for distribution in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; #1,070 (May 20, 1994).

In the story Hellboy battles with the disembodied head of Nazi scientist Herman von Klempt and his puppet henchman Brutus the Gorilla to rescue a captive girl from the doctor&#x27;s transference of nutrient fluids process.

The story was collected in the trade paperback &quot;&quot;.

====&quot;Celebrate Diversity&quot;====
&quot;Hi, My Name is Hellboy&quot; by Mike Mignola was a one-page panel ad that related the character&#x27;s fictional origins. It was published by Diamond Comic Distributors in catalog supplement &quot;Celebrate Diversity&quot; collector&#x27;s edition (October 1994). The ad was collected in the trade paperback &quot;The Art of Hellboy&quot;.

====&quot;The Dark Horse Book of...&quot;====
&quot;The Dark Horse Book of...&quot; was the banner title given to a series of four one-shot hardcover comic book horror anthologies produced annually by Dark Horse Comics between 2004 and 2007. Each issue contained a Hellboy story — “Dr. Carp’s Experiment” (2004), “The Troll Witch” (2005), “The Ghoul” (2006), and “The Hydra and The Lion” (2007). All four stories were collected into the trade paperback &quot;Hellboy: The Troll Witch and Others&quot; in 2007. &quot;The Dark Horse Book of...&quot; series itself was collected into &quot;The Dark Horse Book of Horror&quot; in 2017.

&quot;Hellboy: The First 20 Years&quot; was published on 1 April 2014.

==In other media==
===Live-action films===
====&quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004)====

The film was directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro and stars Ron Perlman as Hellboy (the favorite of both del Toro and Mignola for the role), Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, Rupert Evans as FBI Special Agent John Myers (a character created for the film), John Hurt as Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, Doug Jones as Abe Sapien (voiced by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce), Karel Roden as Grigori Rasputin, and Jeffrey Tambor as FBI Senior Special Agent Tom Manning. The film depicts Hellboy as living at the BPRD with a dozen cats and limited access to the outside world, and considered an urban legend by the general populace.

====&quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; (2008)====

A sequel, &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, was shot in Budapest by Guillermo del Toro and released in 2008, with Perlman and Blair returning. Jones also returned as Abe Sapien (undubbed this time), and also in two other roles, The Angel of Death and The Chamberlain. Revolution Studios had planned on making the film (which Columbia Pictures was to distribute), but the studio went out of business before filming. Universal Studios then picked it up. The plot is a shift to more folklore rather than action, with heavy European overtones. The character of Johann Kraus was added to the team, voiced by Seth MacFarlane. The character Roger the Homunculus was not, but he was written into the plot as a very prominent character in early drafts of the script. The character of Agent Myers from the first film does not return, his absence being explained by Liz remarking that Hellboy had him transferred to Antarctica out of jealousy. Hellboy also reveals himself to the outside world in this film, and Liz is revealed to be pregnant with his twin children. On November 11, 2008, &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; was released on DVD.

=====Canceled third film=====

A sequel for &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; was in development in 2009, entitled &quot;Hellboy III: Dark Worlds&quot;. Guillermo del Toro was slated to return as the film&#x27;s director and writer. Ron Perlman, Doug Jones, Seth MacFarlane, Selma Blair and Jeffrey Tambor were set to reprise their roles. In the sequel, Hellboy would live his normal life as a father for his two newborn twins with Liz Sherman, but also has to face an extremely powerful enemy who wishes to rule and bring the darkness upon Earth. In 2017, it was announced that the sequel was canceled due to the difficulty of funding the film, and a reboot would happen instead.

However, in July 2019, Perlman said that he would still love to finish the trilogy with del Toro, ignoring the reboot and that he thought it could happen if financing could be found.

====&quot;Hellboy&quot; (2019)====

In May 2017, Mignola announced Millennium Media&#x27;s plans for an R-rated reboot, at the time titled &quot;Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen&quot;, with David Harbour as the titular character and Neil Marshall directing from a script by Andrew Cosby, Christopher Golden and Mignola. The film draws inspiration from &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Hellboy in Mexico&quot;. The film, later retitled as &quot;Hellboy&quot;, was released on April 12, 2019 to negative reviews. It grossed $55.1 million against a $50 million production budget, with several media outlets declaring it a box office bomb. In 2022, Marshall decried the film, calling it the &quot;worst profession experience&quot; of his life due to creative control being taken from him by the producers and that the script was not salvageable, concluding that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing of me in that movie.&quot;

====&quot;Hellboy: The Crooked Man&quot; (2024)====

In February 2023, Millennium Media announced plans for another reboot titled &quot;Hellboy: The Crooked Man&quot;, the first in a potential series of films. Brian Taylor directed from a script by Mignola and Golden, based on , with Jack Kesy as Hellboy. The film was released direct-to-VOD in the United States on October 8, 2024.

===Animated films===

On November 9, 2005, IDT Entertainment issued a press release announcing that the company had licensed the rights to develop &quot;animated content for television and home entertainment&quot; based on the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comic. Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Selma Blair (Liz Sherman), Doug Jones (Abe Sapien) and John Hurt (Professor Trevor &quot;Broom&quot; Bruttenholm) have all voiced their respective characters. Actress Peri Gilpin joined the cast as Professor Kate Corrigan.

The first two 75-minute animated films, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, were aired on Cartoon Network before being released on DVD. The first one aired on October 28, 2006, and the second aired on March 17, 2007.

Both stories have much more in common with the comic book &quot;Hellboy&quot; rather than the film — Abe Sapien is not psychic, for example, and the artwork and color palette is derived more from Mignola&#x27;s original artwork. The DVD of &quot;Sword of Storms&quot; was released on February 6, 2007; it contains documentary material, commentary, and a &quot;Hellboy&quot; comic, &quot;Phantom Limbs&quot;. &quot;Blood and Iron&quot; similarly contains a comic called &quot;The Yearning&quot;.

After the initial release, some stores included exclusive giveaways with copies of the &quot;Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron&quot; DVD:
* Best Buy: A 7&quot; Hellboy figure
* Walmart: An 80-page digest titled &quot;The Judgment Bell&quot;
* Transworld: A 64-page &quot;Hellboy Digest&quot;
* Infinity: A Lobster Johnson magnet
* Circuit City – A Hellboy &quot;Bust-Up&quot;

A &quot;Hellboy 2 Pak&quot; limited edition DVD set was released July 1, 2008, that contained both films and a 7&quot; figure.

A third animated Hellboy film, &quot;The Phantom Claw&quot;, has been put on hold. Tad Stones, director and writer of the direct-to-video films, says the film will star Lobster Johnson and will have some familiar characters, but Abe and Liz will not be in the film (at least not as main characters).

===Novels and anthologies===
Christopher Golden has written several novels about the character, the first two of which, &quot;The Lost Army&quot; and &quot;The Bones of Giants&quot;, are part of the official &quot;Hellboy&quot; story canon. The events of both these novels are listed in the comic&#x27;s official timeline featured in &quot;Hellboy: The Companion&quot;. In particular, the Golden-penned character of Anastasia Bransfield was also described in the companion, despite having never actually appeared in a comic.

<doc id="506692" wikidata="Q1665996" url="?curid=506692" title="Interesting number paradox">
<text>The interesting number paradox is a humorous paradox which arises from the attempt to classify every natural number as either &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;uninteresting&quot;. The paradox states that every natural number is interesting. The &quot;proof&quot; is by contradiction: if there exists a non-empty set of uninteresting natural numbers, there would be a smallest uninteresting number – but the smallest uninteresting number is itself interesting because it is the smallest uninteresting number, thus producing a contradiction.

&quot;Interestingness&quot; concerning numbers is not a formal concept in normal terms, but an innate notion of &quot;interestingness&quot; seems to run among some number theorists. Famously, in a discussion between the mathematicians G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan about interesting and uninteresting numbers, Hardy remarked that the number 1729 of the taxicab he had ridden seemed &quot;rather a dull one&quot;, and Ramanujan immediately answered that it is interesting, being the smallest number that is the sum of two cubes in two different ways.

==Paradoxical nature==
Attempting to classify all numbers this way leads to a paradox or an antinomy of definition. Any hypothetical partition of natural numbers into &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;uninteresting&quot; sets seems to fail. Since the definition of interesting is usually a subjective, intuitive notion, it should be understood as a semi-humorous application of self-reference in order to obtain a paradox.

The paradox is alleviated if &quot;interesting&quot; is instead defined objectively: for example, the smallest natural number that does not appear in an entry of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) was originally found to be 11630 on 12 June 2009. The number fitting this definition later became 12407 from November 2009 until at least November 2011, then 13794 as of April 2012, until it appeared in sequence as of 3 November 2012. Since November 2013, that number was 14228, at least until 14 April 2014. In May 2021, the number was 20067. (This definition of uninteresting is possible only because the OEIS lists only a finite number of terms for each entry. For instance, is the sequence of &quot;all&quot; natural numbers, and if continued indefinitely would contain all positive integers. As it is, the sequence is recorded in its entry only as far as 77.) Depending on the sources used for the list of interesting numbers, a variety of other numbers can be characterized as uninteresting in the same way. For instance, the mathematician and philosopher Alex Bellos suggested in 2014 that a candidate for the lowest uninteresting number would be 224 because it was, at the time, &quot;the lowest number not to have its own page on [the English-language version of] Wikipedia&quot;. As of August 2024, this number is 315.

However, as there are many significant results in mathematics that make use of self-reference (such as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems), the paradox illustrates some of the power of self-reference, and thus touches on serious issues in many fields of study. The paradox can be related directly to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems if one defines an &quot;interesting&quot; number as one that can be computed by a program that contains fewer bits than the number itself. Similarly, instead of trying to quantify the subjective feeling of interestingness, one can consider the length of a phrase needed to specify a number. For example, the phrase &quot;the least number not expressible in fewer than eleven words&quot; sounds like it should identify a unique number, but the phrase itself contains only ten words, and so the number identified by the phrase would have an expression in fewer than eleven words after all. This is known as the Berry paradox.

==History==
In 1945, Edwin F. Beckenbach published a short letter in &quot;The American Mathematical Monthly&quot; suggesting thatOne might conjecture that there is an interesting fact concerning each of the positive integers. Here is a &quot;proof by induction&quot; that such is the case. Certainly, 1, which is a factor of each positive integer, qualifies, as do 2, the smallest prime; 3, the smallest odd prime; 4, Bieberbach&#x27;s number; &quot;etc&quot;. Suppose the set &quot;S&quot; of positive integers concerning each of which there is no interesting fact is not vacuous, and let &quot;k&quot; be the smallest member of &quot;S&quot;. But this is a most interesting fact concerning &quot;k&quot;! Hence &quot;S&quot; has no smallest member and therefore is vacuous. Is the proof valid?

Constance Reid included the paradox in the 1955 first edition of her popular mathematics book &quot;From Zero to Infinity&quot;, but removed it from later editions. Martin Gardner presented the paradox as a &quot;fallacy&quot; in his &quot;Scientific American&quot; column in 1958, including it with six other &quot;astonishing assertions&quot; whose purported proofs were also subtly erroneous. A 1980 letter to &quot;The Mathematics Teacher&quot; mentions a jocular proof that &quot;all natural numbers are interesting&quot; having been discussed three decades earlier. In 1977, Greg Chaitin referred to Gardner&#x27;s statement of the paradox and pointed out its relation to an earlier paradox of Bertrand Russell on the existence of a smallest undefinable ordinal (despite the fact that all sets of ordinals have a smallest element and that &quot;the smallest undefinable ordinal&quot; would appear to be a definition).

In &quot;The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers&quot; (1987), David Wells commented that 39 &quot;appears to be the first uninteresting number&quot;, a fact that made it &quot;especially interesting&quot;, and thus 39 must be simultaneously interesting and dull.

<doc id="506701" wikidata="Q2047357" url="?curid=506701" title="Trustee">
<text>Trustee (or the holding of a trusteeship) is a legal term which, in its broadest sense, is a synonym for anyone in a position of trust and so can refer to any individual who holds property, authority, or a position of trust or responsibility for the benefit of another. A trustee can also be a person who is allowed to do certain tasks but not able to gain income. Although in the strictest sense of the term a trustee is the holder of property on behalf of a beneficiary, the more expansive sense encompasses persons who serve, for example, on the board of trustees of an institution that operates for a charity, for the benefit of the general public, or a person in the local government.

A trust can be set up either to benefit particular persons or for any charitable purposes (but not generally for non-charitable purposes): typical examples are a will trust for the testator&#x27;s children and family, a pension trust (to confer benefits on employees and their families) and a charitable trust. In all cases, the trustee may be a person or company, regardless of whether they are a prospective beneficiary.

==General duties of trustees==

Trustees have certain duties (some of which are fiduciary). These include the duty to:

* Carry out the expressed terms of the trust instrument. Trustees are bound to act in accordance with the terms of the trusts upon which the trustee holds trust property, and commit a breach of trust by departing from the terms of the trust. However, a trustee may act otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the trust if all beneficiaries, being &quot;sui juris&quot; and together absolutely entitled, direct the trustee to do so (or so consent). If any question arises as to the constriction of the provisions of the trust, the trustee must approach the court for determination of the question.
* Defend the trust
* Prudently invest trust assets (in New South Wales, this is mandated by the &quot;Trustee Act 1925&quot; (NSW)).
* Be impartial among beneficiaries: the trustee must act impartially between individual beneficiaries as well as between different classes of beneficiaries.
* Account for actions and keep beneficiaries informed: these include a duty to inform beneficiaries as to their entitlements under the trust and other matters concerning the trust. Trustees do not have priority right to trust documents; it is a personal right and cannot be assigned The right to seek disclosure of trust documents is an aspect of the court&#x27;s inherent jurisdiction to supervise the administration of trusts. As trustees as not under a duty to disclose their reasoning in applying a trust power (unless the trust instrument requires otherwise), there is no duty to disclose any documents dealing with the decision making promise. Protection of confidentiality has been described as &#x27;one of the most important limitations on the right to disclose of trust documents&#x27;. &#x27;Memoranda or letter of wishes&#x27; do not necessarily need to be disclosed to a beneficiary if they are of a number of potential beneficiaries.
* Be loyal
* Not delegate
* Not profit; however, may charge fees for services to the Trust 
* Not be in a conflict of interest position
* Administer in the best interest of the beneficiaries
The modern interpretation of fiduciary duty requires the consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors as these are long-term investment value drivers. When evaluating whether an institutional investor has delivered on its fiduciary duties, both the outcomes achieved and the process followed are of critical importance.

The terms of the instrument that creates the trust may narrow or expand these duties—but in most instances, they cannot be eliminated. Corporate trustees, typically trust departments at large banks, often have very narrow duties, limited to those the trust indenture explicitly defines.

A trustee carries the fiduciary responsibility and liability to use the trust assets according to the provisions of the trust instrument (and often regardless of their own or the beneficiaries&#x27; wishes). The trustee may find himself liable to claimants, prospective beneficiaries, or third parties. If a trustee incurs a liability (for example, in litigation, for taxes, or under the terms of a lease) in excess of the trust property they hold, then they may find themselves personally liable for the excess.

Trustees are generally held to a &quot;prudent person&quot; standard in regard to meeting their fiduciary responsibilities, though investment, legal, and other professionals can, in some jurisdictions, be held to a higher standard commensurate with their higher expertise.-Trustees can be paid for their time and trouble in performing their duties only if the trust specifically provides for payment. It is common for lawyers to draft will trusts so as to permit such payment, and to take office accordingly: this may be an unnecessary expense for small estates.

In an exception to the duties outlined above, sabbatical officers of students&#x27; unions who are also trustees of these organisations they work for do have the right to a salary (and hence profit from their being a trustee). This is an exception explicitly granted in the 1993 act

==Other uses==
The broadest sense of the term &quot;trustee&quot; applies to someone held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee proper. For example, the directors of a bank may be trustees for the depositors, directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders and a guardian is trustee of his ward&#x27;s property. Many corporations call their governing board a board of trustees, though in those cases they act as a board of directors.

===Charities in the United Kingdom===
In the case of UK charities, a &quot;trustee&quot; is a volunteer who undertakes fiduciary responsibilities on behalf of the charity, subject to the provisions of Charity Law, a branch of trust law, and the Charities Act 1993. For charity trustees, the Charity Commission of England and Wales, Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator of Scotland and Voluntary Activity Unit of Northern Ireland often has concurrent jurisdiction with the courts. Many UK charities are also limited liability companies registered with Companies House, in this case the trustees are also directors of the company and their liability is limited. This is the preferred model if the charity owns property or employs people.

The law on this in England changed considerably with the Charities Act of 2006. An account of the main changes can be found in &quot;Charities Act 2006: A guide to the new law&quot; by Michael King and Ann Phillips. One of the key changes made was that it introduced the Charitable Incorporated Organisation which is basically a limited liability charity. There are thus now two main aspects of corporate management of charities.

One is the traditional way in which a corporation is a corporate trustee of a given charity. The second is the new way, in which the charity itself is incorporated as a CIO. The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods is a complicated matter. According to King and Philips, many of the advantages of incorporating as a CIO are obtained if the trustees are not individuals but a corporate entity.

===Local government in the United States===
Depending on the state, a trustee is a member of the &quot;village board of trustees&quot;, which is a village&#x27;s elected legislative body as outlined by local or state law. It can be composed of the mayor and a set number of trustees and usually manages village property, finances, safety, health, comfort, and general welfare and leadership of the town (acting as a board of police or fire commissioners or a moderate income housing board, for example). &quot;Village board of trustees&quot; is comparable to but distinguished from city council or town council. Small villages have a trustee instead of a mayor, who is elected to manage village business in a similar function.

In some states, a civil township may be administered by a trustee or a group of trustees; see Indiana Township Trustee for an example.

==Bankruptcy trustee==
In the United States, when a consumer or business files for bankruptcy all property belonging to the filer becomes property of a newly created entity, the &quot;bankruptcy estate&quot;. (See 11 U.S.C. § 541.) For all bankruptcies (consumer or business) filed under Chapter 7, 12 or 13 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code), a trustee (the &quot;trustee in bankruptcy&quot; or TIB) is appointed by the United States Trustee, an officer of the Department of Justice that is charged with ensuring the integrity of the bankruptcy system and with representatives in each court, to manage the property of the bankruptcy estate, including bringing actions to avoid pre-bankruptcy transfers of property. In bankruptcies filed under Chapter 11, the debtor continues to manage the property of the bankruptcy estate, as &quot;debtor in possession&quot;, subject to replacement for cause with a trustee.

Chapter 7 trustees in bankruptcy are chosen by the United States Trustee from a panel, and are known as panel trustees. Every judicial district has a permanent Chapter 13 trustee, known as a &quot;standing trustee&quot;. As cases under Chapter 12 (for family farmers or fishermen) are filed fairly infrequently, the United States Trustee usually makes trustee appointments in such cases on an ad hoc basis.

<text>The Peelites were a breakaway political faction of the British Conservative Party from 1846 to 1859. Initially led by Robert Peel, the former Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in 1846, the Peelites supported free trade whilst the bulk of the Conservative Party remained protectionist. The Peelites later merged with the Whigs and Radicals to form the Liberal Party in 1859.

== Overview ==
The Peelites were characterised by commitment to free trade and a managerial, almost technocratic, approach to government. Though they sought to maintain the principles of the Conservative Party, Peelites disagreed with the major wing of that party (the landed interest) on issues of trade, in particular the issue of whether agricultural prices should be artificially kept high by tariffs. The Peelites were often called the Liberal Conservatives in contrast to Protectionist Conservatives led by Benjamin Disraeli and Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby.

Facing a serious famine in Ireland in 1845, the Peelites sought to lower food prices by repealing the Corn Laws. Peel was able to carry the repeal vote in the House of Commons, but only at the price of splitting the Conservative Party, a split which led to the fall of Peel&#x27;s government in June 1846 and its replacement by a Whig government led by John Russell, 1st Earl Russell.

The leading members of the Peelite faction that developed after the 1846 split of the Conservative Party were the following:
The Peelites numbered about a third of the old Conservative party in the House of Commons following the 1847 general election. Their main political positions at that time were closer to the Protectionist Conservatives than to the Whigs and Radicals in parliament, except on the issue of free trade. The split had been so bitter on a personal level, with attacks on Peel by Protectionist Conservatives such as Lord George Bentinck and Benjamin Disraeli, that the Conservative Party was unable to reconcile the Peelites even after the Conservatives officially abandoned protection in 1852. The Peelites also had their own newspaper &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; to highlight their political position.

After Peel&#x27;s death in 1850, the Peelite faction was led by Sir James Graham and Lord Aberdeen. In the 1852 general election, the number of Peelite MPs was estimated at 40. In that same year, George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen was invited by Queen Victoria to form a coalition government with the Whigs and the Radicals. This government fell in 1855 as a result of the unpopularity of its hesitant attitude during the Crimean War.

After the fall of the Aberdeen government, the Peelite faction took most of the blame for their management of the war in the Crimea. The group further lost cohesion with some members including William Ewart Gladstone, Sir James Graham and Sidney Herbert accepting cabinet posts in the new government led by Viscount Palmerston only to resign a few weeks later when the government agreed to hold a commission on the conduct of the recent war. Others stayed, including George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe after which the Peelites with now no agreed overall leader appeared to be a band of independents rather than a putative political party. In the 1857 general election, their numbers in the House of Commons further decreased to around 26, or maybe less than 20 as identifying who was and who was not a Peelite became increasingly difficult.

The Peelites finally disappeared as a distinctive political entity after the 1859 general election. On 6 June 1859 a meeting was held at the Willis&#x27;s Rooms, St James Street with most of the remaining Peelites agreed to combine with the Whigs, the Radicals and the Independent Irish Party members of the United Kingdom Parliament to bring down the Conservative government of Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby in a vote of no confidence. The vote was won by the opposition by 323 votes to 310 on 10 June.

The subsequent creation of Palmerston&#x27;s ministry out of this combination was the birth of the British Liberal Party. Several leading Peelites (including Gladstone, Herbert, Cardwell, and Newcastle, but notably not Graham, who was one of the driving forces behind the coalition) accepted cabinet posts in this ministry, though some Peelites became independents or returned to the Conservatives.

<text>Robert Caesar Childers (; 183825 July 1876) was a British Orientalist and the compiler of the first PaliEnglish dictionary to be published. He was the father of the Irish nationalist Erskine Childers and the paternal grandfather of the fourth president of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers.

==Life==
===Early years===
Childers was born in 1838 in Cantley, South Yorkshire, the son of Reverend Charles Childers, an English chaplain in Nice.

In 1857, at the age of nineteen, he was admitted to Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied Hebrew.

===Ceylon===
From 1860 to 1864, Childers was employed by the civil service in Ceylon, first as private secretary to the governor, Charles Justin MacCarthy, and then as office assistant to the government agent in Kandy.

During his time in Ceylon, he studied Sinhala and Pali with Ven. Yātrāmulle Śrī Dhammārāma Thera at Bentota Vanavāsa Vihāra, and established a firm friendship with Ven. Waskaḍuwe Śrī Subhūti.

His time there was brought to an end when ill health forced him to return to England.

===Pali dictionary===
Upon his return to England, Childers continued his study of Pali, influenced by Reinhold Rost and Viggo Fausböll.

In 1870, he published the text of the &quot;Khuddaka Pāṭha&quot; with an English translation and notes in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society&quot;. This was the first Pali text ever printed in England.

The first volume of his Pali dictionary was published in 1872. In the autumn of that year, he was appointed sub-librarian at the India Office under Reinhold Rost, and early in the following year became the first professor of Pali and Buddhist literature at University College, London.

The second and concluding volume was published in 1875. A few months later, the dictionary was awarded the Prix Volney for 1876 by the Institut de France.

===Family===
Childers was married to Anna Mary Henrietta Barton, who came from an Anglo-Irish family with an estate in Glendalough, County Wicklow. Childers and his wife had five children (two sons and three daughters).

===Death===
Childers died from tuberculosis on 25 July 1876, at the age of thirty-eight. Thomas William Rhys Davids states in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that Childers died in Weybridge, but the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; records his place of death as London.

<text>James Blades OBE (9 September 190119 May 1999) was an English percussionist.

He was one of the most distinguished percussionists in Western music, with a long and varied career. His book &quot;Percussion Instruments and their History&quot; (1971) is a standard reference work on the subject.

Blades was born in Peterborough in 1901. He was a long-time associate of Benjamin Britten, with whom he conceived many of the composer&#x27;s unusual percussion effects. In 1954, Blades was appointed Professor of Percussion at the Royal Academy of Music.

As a chamber musician he played with the Melos Ensemble and the English Chamber Orchestra.

Blades&#x27; pupils included the rock drummers Max Sedgley, Carl Palmer, and Richard James Burgess as well as percussionist Evelyn Glennie.

His most famous and widely heard performances were the sound of the drum playing &quot;V-for-Victory&quot; in Morse code, the introduction to the BBC broadcasts made to the European Resistance during World War II, and providing the sound of the gong seen at the start of films produced by the Rank Organisation. Blades played this sound on a tam-tam. On screen Blades&#x27;s sound was interpreted by an actor miming a character called the &quot;Gongman&quot;.

His autobiography &quot;Drum Roll: A Professional Adventure from the Circus to the Concert Hall&quot; was published by Faber &amp; Faber in 1977.

<text>In mathematics, spectral theory is an inclusive term for theories extending the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of a single square matrix to a much broader theory of the structure of operators in a variety of mathematical spaces. It is a result of studies of linear algebra and the solutions of systems of linear equations and their generalizations. The theory is connected to that of analytic functions because the spectral properties of an operator are related to analytic functions of the spectral parameter.

==Mathematical background==
The name &quot;spectral theory&quot; was introduced by David Hilbert in his original formulation of Hilbert space theory, which was cast in terms of quadratic forms in infinitely many variables. The original spectral theorem was therefore conceived as a version of the theorem on principal axes of an ellipsoid, in an infinite-dimensional setting. The later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous. Hilbert himself was surprised by the unexpected application of this theory, noting that &quot;I developed my theory of infinitely many variables from purely mathematical interests, and even called it &#x27;spectral analysis&#x27; without any presentiment that it would later find application to the actual spectrum of physics.&quot;

There have been three main ways to formulate spectral theory, each of which find use in different domains. After Hilbert&#x27;s initial formulation, the later development of abstract Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of single normal operators on them were well suited to the requirements of physics, exemplified by the work of von Neumann. The further theory built on this to address Banach algebras in general. This development leads to the Gelfand representation, which covers the commutative case, and further into non-commutative harmonic analysis.

The difference can be seen in making the connection with Fourier analysis. The Fourier transform on the real line is in one sense the spectral theory of differentiation as a differential operator. But for that to cover the phenomena one has already to deal with generalized eigenfunctions (for example, by means of a rigged Hilbert space). On the other hand, it is simple to construct a group algebra, the spectrum of which captures the Fourier transform&#x27;s basic properties, and this is carried out by means of Pontryagin duality.

One can also study the spectral properties of operators on Banach spaces. For example, compact operators on Banach spaces have many spectral properties similar to that of matrices.

==Physical background==
The background in the physics of vibrations has been explained in this way:

Such physical ideas have nothing to do with the mathematical theory on a technical level, but there are examples of indirect involvement (see for example Mark Kac&#x27;s question &quot;Can you hear the shape of a drum?&quot;). Hilbert&#x27;s adoption of the term &quot;spectrum&quot; has been attributed to an 1897 paper of Wilhelm Wirtinger on Hill differential equation (by Jean Dieudonné), and it was taken up by his students during the first decade of the twentieth century, among them Erhard Schmidt and Hermann Weyl. The conceptual basis for Hilbert space was developed from Hilbert&#x27;s ideas by Erhard Schmidt and Frigyes Riesz. It was almost twenty years later, when quantum mechanics was formulated in terms of the Schrödinger equation, that the connection was made to atomic spectra; a connection with the mathematical physics of vibration had been suspected before, as remarked by Henri Poincaré, but rejected for simple quantitative reasons, absent an explanation of the Balmer series. The later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous, rather than being an object of Hilbert&#x27;s spectral theory.

==A definition of spectrum==

Consider a bounded linear transformation &quot;T&quot; defined everywhere over a general Banach space. We form the transformation:
formula_1

Here &quot;I&quot; is the identity operator and ζ is a complex number. The &quot;inverse&quot; of an operator &quot;T&quot;, that is &quot;T&quot;−1, is defined by:
formula_2

If the inverse exists, &quot;T&quot; is called &quot;regular&quot;. If it does not exist, &quot;T&quot; is called &quot;singular&quot;.

With these definitions, the &quot;resolvent set&quot; of &quot;T&quot; is the set of all complex numbers ζ such that &quot;Rζ&quot; exists and is bounded. This set often is denoted as &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). The &quot;spectrum&quot; of &quot;T&quot; is the set of all complex numbers ζ such that &quot;Rζ&quot; fails to exist or is unbounded. Often the spectrum of &quot;T&quot; is denoted by &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). The function &quot;Rζ&quot; for all ζ in &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) (that is, wherever &quot;Rζ&quot; exists as a bounded operator) is called the resolvent of &quot;T&quot;. The &quot;spectrum&quot; of &quot;T&quot; is therefore the complement of the &quot;resolvent set&quot; of &quot;T&quot; in the complex plane. Every eigenvalue of &quot;T&quot; belongs to &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;), but &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) may contain non-eigenvalues.

This definition applies to a Banach space, but of course other types of space exist as well; for example, topological vector spaces include Banach spaces, but can be more general. On the other hand, Banach spaces include Hilbert spaces, and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results. With suitable restrictions, much can be said about the structure of the spectra of transformations in a Hilbert space. In particular, for self-adjoint operators, the spectrum lies on the real line and (in general) is a spectral combination of a point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum.

==Spectral theory briefly==
In functional analysis and linear algebra the spectral theorem establishes conditions under which an operator can be expressed in simple form as a sum of simpler operators. As a full rigorous presentation is not appropriate for this article, we take an approach that avoids much of the rigor and satisfaction of a formal treatment with the aim of being more comprehensible to a non-specialist.

This topic is easiest to describe by introducing the bra–ket notation of Dirac for operators. As an example, a very particular linear operator &quot;L&quot; might be written as a dyadic product:

:formula_3

in terms of the &quot;bra&quot; ⟨1| and the &quot;ket&quot; |1⟩. A function is described by a &quot;ket&quot; as | ⟩. The function defined on the coordinates formula_4 is denoted as
:formula_5
and the magnitude of &quot;f&quot; by
:formula_6
where the notation (*) denotes a complex conjugate. This inner product choice defines a very specific inner product space, restricting the generality of the arguments that follow.

The effect of &quot;L&quot; upon a function &quot;f&quot; is then described as:

:formula_7

expressing the result that the effect of &quot;L&quot; on &quot;f&quot; is to produce a new function formula_8 multiplied by the inner product represented by formula_9.
A more general linear operator &quot;L&quot; might be expressed as:

:formula_10

where the formula_11 are scalars and the formula_12 are a basis and the formula_13 a reciprocal basis for the space. The relation between the basis and the reciprocal basis is described, in part, by:

:formula_14

If such a formalism applies, the formula_11 are eigenvalues of &quot;L&quot; and the functions formula_12 are eigenfunctions of &quot;L&quot;. The eigenvalues are in the &quot;spectrum&quot; of &quot;L&quot;.

Some natural questions are: under what circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators &quot;L&quot; are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function &quot;f&quot; be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions (are they a Schauder basis) and under what circumstances does a point spectrum or a continuous spectrum arise? How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.

==Resolution of the identity==
This section continues in the rough and ready manner of the above section using the bra–ket notation, and glossing over the many important details of a rigorous treatment. A rigorous mathematical treatment may be found in various references. In particular, the dimension &quot;n&quot; of the space will be finite.

Using the bra–ket notation of the above section, the identity operator may be written as:

:formula_17

where it is supposed as above that formula_18 are a basis and the formula_19 a reciprocal basis for the space satisfying the relation:

:formula_20

This expression of the identity operation is called a &quot;representation&quot; or a &quot;resolution&quot; of the identity. This formal representation satisfies the basic property of the identity:
:formula_21
valid for every positive integer &quot;k&quot;.

Applying the resolution of the identity to any function in the space formula_22, one obtains:

:formula_23
which is the generalized Fourier expansion of ψ in terms of the basis functions { ei }.
Here formula_24.

Given some operator equation of the form:
:formula_25
with &quot;h&quot; in the space, this equation can be solved in the above basis through the formal manipulations:
:formula_26
:formula_27
which converts the operator equation to a matrix equation determining the unknown coefficients &quot;cj&quot; in terms of the generalized Fourier coefficients formula_28 of &quot;h&quot; and the matrix elements formula_29 of the operator &quot;O&quot;.

The role of spectral theory arises in establishing the nature and existence of the basis and the reciprocal basis. In particular, the basis might consist of the eigenfunctions of some linear operator &quot;L&quot;:

:formula_30

with the { &quot;λi&quot; } the eigenvalues of &quot;L&quot; from the spectrum of &quot;L&quot;. Then the resolution of the identity above provides the dyad expansion of &quot;L&quot;:

:formula_31

==Resolvent operator==
Using spectral theory, the resolvent operator &quot;R&quot;:

:formula_32

can be evaluated in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of &quot;L&quot;, and the Green&#x27;s function corresponding to &quot;L&quot; can be found.

Applying &quot;R&quot; to some arbitrary function in the space, say formula_33,

:formula_34

This function has poles in the complex &quot;λ&quot;-plane at each eigenvalue of &quot;L&quot;. Thus, using the calculus of residues:

:formula_35

where the line integral is over a contour &quot;C&quot; that includes all the eigenvalues of &quot;L&quot;.

Suppose our functions are defined over some coordinates {&quot;xj&quot;}, that is:

:formula_36

Introducing the notation

:formula_37

where &quot;δ(x − y)&quot; = &quot;δ(x1 − y1, x2 − y2, x3 − y3, ...)&quot; is the Dirac delta function,
we can write

:formula_38

Then:

:formula_39

The function &quot;G(x, y; λ)&quot; defined by:

:formula_40

is called the &quot;Green&#x27;s function&quot; for operator &quot;L&quot;, and satisfies:

:formula_41

==Operator equations==

Consider the operator equation:

:formula_42

in terms of coordinates:

:formula_43

A particular case is &quot;λ&quot; = 0.

The Green&#x27;s function of the previous section is:

:formula_44

and satisfies:

:formula_45

Using this Green&#x27;s function property:

:formula_46

Then, multiplying both sides of this equation by &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and integrating:

:formula_47

which suggests the solution is:

:formula_48

That is, the function &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) satisfying the operator equation is found if we can find the spectrum of &quot;O&quot;, and construct &quot;G&quot;, for example by using:

:formula_49

There are many other ways to find &quot;G&quot;, of course. See the articles on Green&#x27;s functions and on Fredholm integral equations. It must be kept in mind that the above mathematics is purely formal, and a rigorous treatment involves some pretty sophisticated mathematics, including a good background knowledge of functional analysis, Hilbert spaces, distributions and so forth. Consult these articles and the references for more detail.

==Spectral theorem and Rayleigh quotient==
Optimization problems may be the most useful examples about the combinatorial significance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in symmetric matrices, especially for the Rayleigh quotient with respect to a matrix M.

Theorem &quot;Let M be a symmetric matrix and let x be the non-zero vector that maximizes the Rayleigh quotient with respect to M. Then, x is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue equal to the Rayleigh quotient. Moreover, this eigenvalue is the largest eigenvalue of M. &quot;

Proof Assume the spectral theorem. Let the eigenvalues of M be formula_50. Since the formula_51 form an orthonormal basis, any vector x can be expressed in this basis as

: formula_52

The way to prove this formula is pretty easy. Namely,

: formula_53
evaluate the Rayleigh quotient with respect to &quot;x&quot;:

: formula_54
where we used Parseval&#x27;s identity in the last line. Finally we obtain that
:formula_55

so the Rayleigh quotient is always less than formula_56.

<text>Managing the news is the deliberate influencing of the presentation of information within the news media. The expression &quot;managing the news&quot; is often used in a negative sense. For example, people or organizations that wish to lessen the publicity concerning bad news may choose to release the information late on a Friday, giving journalists less time to pursue the story. Staying &quot;on message&quot; is a technique intended to limit questions and attention to a narrow scope favorable to the subject.

An example cited by the Communication, Cultural and Media Studies infobase regards a February 1996 Scott Report on arms sales to Iraq. In the United Kingdom, the report was given early to certain officials.

<doc id="506721" wikidata="Q16903198" url="?curid=506721" title="Whiteleaf Cross">
<text>Whiteleaf Cross is a cross-shaped chalk hill carving, with a triangular base, on Whiteleaf Hill in Whiteleaf near Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire.

It sits above the road to the east of the hamlet, whose name is first found in the form White Cliff in the eighteenth century, referring to the white chalk cliff. The cliff is probably a natural formation, older than the cross.

The date and origin of the cross are unknown. It was mentioned as an antiquity by Francis Wise in 1742, but no earlier reference has been found. The cross is not mentioned in any description of the area before 1700.

The Act for enclosing the common lands in the Parish, completed on 23 September 1839, specifically required that: in order to preserve within the parish of Monks Risborough the ancient memorial or landmark there called White Cliffe Cross and the Commissioners were to allot to the Lord of the Manor the cross itself and so much of the land immediately surrounding it as shall in the judgment of the Commissioners be necessary and sufficient for rendering the same conspicuous and that it should not be planted or enclosed and should for ever thereafter remain open. The Lord of the Manor was to be responsible to renew and repair it. In the event the Commissioners allotted of land for this purpose.

Various books published in and since the 18th century have speculated on the origin of the cross, but without any supporting evidence. Theories included a Saxon celebration of a victory over the Danes, a phallic symbol later Christianised, a direction sign for a (non-existent) medieval monastery, soldiers in the Civil War amusing themselves when they had nothing better to do, and a seventeenth-century alternative to a village cross.

It was depicted in paintings by Paul Nash. One, from 1922, is in the collection of the British Council, another, from 1931, is in the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester.

In addition to the cross, there is a neolithic barrow on Whiteleaf Hill, which is near the top of the cross but very unlikely to have any connection with it.

The cross is protected by the county as part of the 11-hectare (27 acre) Whiteleaf Hill Nature Reserve.

From 2012 to 2015 he starred in the sitcom &quot;Mr. Box Office&quot;. 

He played a baseball scout in the film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992) and acted in other films such as &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986), &quot;Big&quot; (1988), &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000), &quot;Rat Race&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Producers&quot; (2005).

He played Alan Dershowitz on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and George Santos on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Lovitz was born on July 21, 1957, in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles, to Harold and Barbara Lovitz. His family is Jewish and emigrated from Romania, Hungary, and Russia. His paternal grandfather Feivel Ianculovici left Romania around 1914 and Anglicized his name to Phillip Lovitz after arriving in the United States.

Lovitz is a friend of David Kudrow, brother of Lisa Kudrow, since childhood. While in college, Lovitz went on a backpacking trip across Europe and Israel with him in 1978. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama from UC Irvine in 1979, then studied acting with Tony Barr at the Film Actors Workshop. He became a member of the Groundlings comedy troupe, where he befriended his future &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Phil Hartman.

==Career==

===1985–1992: &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Lovitz″s first stint as a regular in a situation comedy was that of Mole, an investigator for a New York City district attorney″s office, in the short-lived 1985–86 series &quot;Foley Square&quot;, starring Margaret Colin. Lovitz was a cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1985 to 1990. He later said in an interview for the book &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live&quot; that his time on &quot;SNL&quot; was the most memorable in his career. He went from having no money to being offered a $500,000 film contract. He was nominated for an Emmy Award his first two years on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. One of his most notable &quot;SNL&quot; characters was &quot;Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar&quot; who used an old Humphrey Bogart line &quot;Yeah! That&#x27;s the ticket!&quot; as a catchphrase to punctuate painfully elaborated implausible lies. His other recurring characters and impersonations included Annoying Man, Master Thespian, Tonto, Mephistopheles, David Crosby, Harvey Fierstein, and Michael Dukakis. In a 1986 &quot;SNL&quot; episode, he portrayed a virgin Trekkie, who was scripted to hang his head when asked by William Shatner if he had ever kissed a girl.

Hanukkah Harry, one of Lovitz&#x27;s most memorable roles, cast him in 1989 as a Jewish contemporary of Santa Claus who lives on Mount Sinai and travels the globe with a cart flown by three donkeys to give bland gifts to Jewish boys and girls. He is asked to fill in when Santa falls ill on Christmas Eve.

On February 15, 2015, on the &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot;, he was named by Bill Murray as one of the many &quot;SNL&quot; cast members who had died over the years, with the camera cutting to show Lovitz&#x27;s reaction. Later, his image was seen in a montage of deceased &quot;SNL&quot; members, with the camera once again cutting to his now &quot;outraged&quot; reaction.

===1993–2008: Post-SNL, &quot;The Critic&quot; ===
From 1998 to 1999, he was cast to replace Phil Hartman on &quot;NewsRadio&quot; upon the latter&#x27;s death. Lovitz has lent his voice to several cartoons and films. In &quot;The Critic&quot;, he played the title character Jay Sherman (using his regular speaking voice). He has made several appearances on &quot;The Simpsons—&quot;as Marge&#x27;s prom date Artie Ziff in &quot;The Way We Was&quot;, the art teacher in &quot;Brush with Greatness&quot;, theater director Llewellyn Sinclair and his sister who owned a daycare center in &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, and numerous other appearances, including the character of Jay Sherman in the episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;, a crossover with &quot;The Critic&quot;. He was also the voice of Radio in the Hyperion-produced, Disney-distributed animated film &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot;, and that of T.R. Chula the tarantula in Amblimation&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;.

In the 1990s, Lovitz voiced the Red M&amp;M in commercials for M&amp;M&#x27;s. Between 1999 and 2000 Lovitz appeared in a $33 million advertising campaign that featured a series of television commercials promoting the Yellow Pages. The comic premise was to present Lovitz as the Yellow Pages&#x27; author. One of them featured Lovitz saying, &quot;The hardest thing to do is to come up with a simple idea that is also great. And I just thought, &#x27;Oh, the alphabet!&#x27;&quot;

Lovitz performed a duet with Robbie Williams on Williams&#x27; album &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; (2001), in the song &quot;Well, Did You Evah!&quot;. On October 10, 2001, Lovitz sang the song at the Royal Albert Hall. He also performed on the TV series &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; singing &quot;Save the Orphans&quot; and beating Charlie (Charlie Sheen) out of the award for best jingle writer. He has appeared on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, taking over the lead role from Henry Winkler. He sang at Carnegie Hall three times (including Great Performances&#x27; &quot;Ira Gershwin at 100: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall&quot;) and sang the national anthem at Dodger Stadium and the U.S. Open.

Lovitz began his stand-up career in 2003 at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. In 2006, he became the spokesman in an advertising campaign for the Subway restaurant chain.

===2009–present: Standup ===
In 2009, The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club location on Universal CityWalk in Universal Studios Hollywood opened. A comic short film starring Ken Davitian and featuring Lovitz was filmed there, directed by Brent Roske and written by Aaron Davitian. The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club in Universal Studios Hollywood was home to the first MMA Roasted standup comedy show in 2009. On May 29, 2011, the name was changed to the Jon Lovitz Comedy Club &amp; Podcast Theatre. A premiere event called &quot;Podammit&quot; was held, in which Kevin Smith hosted a variety of six podcasts, including &quot;Plus One 3D&quot; with his wife, Jennifer Schwalbach; &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot; with Ralph Garman; and &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old&quot; with Jason Mewes; as well as &quot;The ABCs of SNL&quot; with Lovitz himself, a six-episode &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;-style biographical interview about Lovitz&#x27;s life and career. The Club periodically hosted other podcasts such as Rob Paulsen&#x27;s &quot;Talkin&#x27; Toons&quot; (which subsequently left in October 2013). The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club &amp; Podcast Theater closed on November 5, 2014.

In 2020, Lovitz starred in commercials for Playology, a brand of toys for aging dogs. They featured him with disparaging puppies, asking for senior dogs to get their due. That same year he portrayed lawyer Alan Dershowitz on season 45 of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Adam Driver as the host playing Jeffrey Epstein. In 2023 he portrayed U.S. Congressman George Santos on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

== Comedic influences == 
In a 2011 interview, Lovitz described his comedic influences, &quot;When I was 13, I saw Woody Allen&#x27;s movie &quot;Take The Money and Run&quot;, and I wanted to be a comedian. Then when I was 16, I saw the movie &quot;Lenny&quot;, about Lenny Bruce, starring Dustin Hoffman. I thought the movie was so great, and I&#x27;d never heard of Lenny, so I went to the record store because I wanted to hear the real guy. Then I saw that Woody Allen had a record. I didn&#x27;t know he had been a standup. So, I bought &quot;Woody Allen: The Nightclub Years, &#x27;64-&#x27;68&quot;. I learned their routines and performed them at my college dorm. That was at U.C. Irvine. I was a drama major there. In imitating their routines, I learned a lot about writing. You learn how to write a joke. I was influenced by them a lot, the way I say something, the timing or whatever. Or Jack Benny, sometimes I&#x27;ll go, &#x27;Well...&#x27;&quot;

== Personal life ==
Lovitz resides in Beverly Hills, California. He is friends with Adam Sandler. He was also friends with Penny Marshall and Phil Hartman. He has described Hartman as &quot;the big brother I always wanted&quot;.

=== Charity ===
Lovitz was a contestant on &quot;The New Celebrity Apprentice&quot; (also known as Celebrity Apprentice 8), playing for the charity St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. He was the sixth contestant fired, finishing in 11th place and raising $50,000 for his charity.

=== Feud with Andy Dick ===
Lovitz was involved in an intense feud with former &quot;NewsRadio&quot; costar Andy Dick concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick gave Hartman&#x27;s wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartman&#x27;s house in 1997. Brynn, a recovering addict, began using drugs again, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of &quot;NewsRadio&quot; as Hartman&#x27;s replacement, he and Dick got into a heated argument in which Lovitz reportedly shouted &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be here if you hadn&#x27;t given Brynn coke in the first place.&quot; Lovitz later apologized to Dick for the remark.

In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said &quot;I put the Phil Hartman hex on you—you&#x27;re the next to die.&quot; On July 10, 2007, Lovitz got into a physical altercation with Dick at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman&#x27;s death. Lovitz then smashed Dick&#x27;s head into the bar.

=== Political beliefs ===
Politically, Lovitz is a supporter of the Democratic Party. However, he was an outspoken critic of former President Barack Obama. He called Obama a &quot;fucking asshole&quot; and criticized him for claiming the rich did not pay their share of taxes. Lovitz said: &quot;He had nothing … and the guy ends up being at Harvard. He&#x27;s the president of the United States. And now he&#x27;s like, &#x27;Fuck me and everyone who made it like me&#x27;.&quot;

In June 2021, Lovitz criticized cancel culture and compared it to McCarthyism. He opined that it makes comedians&#x27; jobs increasingly difficult, saying, &quot;If you don&#x27;t have the ability to laugh at yourself, don&#x27;t go to a comedy club,&quot; and &quot;If you&#x27;re watching TV and you don&#x27;t like the show, change the channel. It&#x27;s very simple.&quot;

<text>Wolfgang Drechsler (born June 6, 1963 in Marburg, West Germany) is a Public Administration and Management, Innovation Policy and Political Philosophy scholar. He is Professor of Governance, and one of the founders and directors of the Technology Governance program, at the Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia, where between 2010 and 2016 he also served as Vice Dean for International Relations at its Faculty of Social Sciences. Since 2019, he is also affiliated with University College London, where he is Honorary Professor at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP) and Principal Investigator of the John Templeton Foundation &quot;Islamic Public Value&quot; project, and since 2023, with Universitas Indonesia as an adjunct professor in the Faculty of Administrative Sciences.

Drechsler holds degrees from Bridgewater College, the University of Virginia, the University of Marburg, and the German Post-Graduate School of Public Administration Speyer. Between 1993 and 2006, he was Professor of Public Administration and Government at the University of Tartu. Before coming to Estonia, and during this time, he taught at Universities of Marburg, Giessen, and Frankfurt am Main, all Germany. He was Visiting Professor of Sociology in Lund, Sweden, in 1997, of Governance at the University of Erfurt, Germany, in 2007, of Public Management at the Collegium Civitas, Warsaw, Poland, in 2011, and at the University of Malaya, Malaysia in 2013, and during the same year, of Public Administration at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, China, as well as in 2015 at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, and at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2016 at the National Institute of Development Administration in Bangkok, Thailand, and in 2017 at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore. In 2012-2014, he served as the André Molitor Chair of Political, Administrative and International Reforms (as &quot;professeur invité&quot;) at the Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium. From 2017 to 2024, he was also affiliated with Harvard University, as a Davis Center Visiting Scholar, Center Associate, and for six years a member of the Advisory Board.

He has served as Advisor to the President of Estonia, as Executive Secretary with the German &quot;Wissenschaftsrat&quot; during German reunification, and, as an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow, a Senior Legislative Analyst in the United States Congress. He was the Vice Chairman of the executive board of Praxis, Estonia’s pre-eminent public policy think-tank, and a member of the Innovation Policy Council of the Estonian Ministry of Economics.

In Public Administration, Drechsler emphasizes the non-technocratic, non-managerial, &quot;state sciences&quot; approach that focuses on effectiveness rather than efficiency. He is also especially interested in Non-Western Public Administration (Confucian, Islamic, and Buddhist). In economics and public policy, he is a strong protagonist of the role of the state in economic growth and of innovation and industrial policy. Philosophically, Drechsler is a classical Hermeneutician, as one of the last students of the late Hans-Georg Gadamer.

Drechsler serves or has served as an advisor, especially in the areas of public management reform and innovation policy as well as e-governance, for national governments and international organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Council of Europe, SIGMA, World Bank, European Union (Lisbon Strategy), Inter-American Development Bank, and United Nations Development Program; he has worked, in different capacities, on the national development plans of, e.g., Estonia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Peru, Brazil, and Norway.

In 2000, Drechsler co-founded The Other Canon, a center and network for heterodox economics research, with - amongst others - main founder and executive chairman Erik Reinert.

Drechsler received the 1997 Estonian National Science Award, Social Science category, the 2001 Alena Brunovskà Award for Teaching Excellence in Public Administration, the 2002 Outstanding Alumnus Award from Bridgewater College, where he also delivered the annual W. Harold Row Endowed Lecture, in 2004, the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (Maarjamaa Rist), Estonia&#x27;s Order of Merit, and in 2005, the German one, the Bundesverdienstkreuz. In 2013, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Social Sciences by the Corvinus University Budapest, Hungary, and in 2017, the Senator Peter B. Boorsma Award from SECoPA, the Southeastern regional association of the American Society for Public Administration, for his merits in international public administration theory and practice. The Academy of Management’s (AOM) 2023 George R. Terry Award for “the book judged to have made the most outstanding contribution to the global advancement of management knowledge during the last two years” went to his book, with Rainer Kattel and Erkki Karo, &quot;How to Make an Entrepreneurial State: Why Innovation needs Bureaucracy&quot; (Yale University Press).

<text>The HP-65 is the first magnetic card-programmable handheld calculator. Introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1974 at an MSRP of $795 (), it featured nine storage registers and room for 100 keystroke instructions. It also included a magnetic card reader/writer to save and load programs. Like all Hewlett-Packard calculators of the era and most since, the HP-65 used Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and a four-level automatic operand stack.

Bill Hewlett&#x27;s design requirement was that the calculator should fit in his shirt pocket. That is one reason for the tapered depth of the calculator. The magnetic program cards are fed in at the thick end of the calculator under the LED display. The documentation for the programs in the calculator is very complete, including algorithms for hundreds of applications, including the solutions of differential equations, stock price estimation, statistics, and so forth.

==Features==
The HP-65 introduced the &quot;tall&quot;, trapezoid-shaped keys that would become iconic for many generations of HP calculators. Each of the keys had up to four functions. In addition to the &quot;normal function&quot; printed on the key&#x27;s face, a &quot;gold&quot; function printed on the case above the key and a &quot;blue&quot; function printed on the slanted front surface of the key were accessed by pushing the gold or blue prefix key, respectively. For example, followed by would access the sine function, or followed by would calculate formula_1. For some mathematical functions, a gold prefix key would access the inverse of the gold-printed functions, e.g. followed by would calculate the inverse sine (formula_2).

Functions included square root, inverse, trigonometric (sine, cosine, tangent and their inverses), exponentiation, logarithms and factorial. The HP-65 was one of the first calculators to include a base conversion function, although it only supported octal (base 8) conversion. It could also perform conversions between degrees/minutes/seconds (sexagesimal) and decimal degree (sexadecimal) values, as well as polar/cartesian coordinate conversion.

==Programming==
The HP-65 had a program memory for up to 100 instructions of six bits which included subroutine calls and conditional branching based on comparison of x and y registers. Some (but not all) commands entered as multiple keystrokes were stored in a single program memory cell. When displaying a program, the key codes were shown without line numbers.

A program could be saved to mylar-based magnetically coated cards measuring , which were fed through the reader by a small electric motor through a worm gear and rubber roller at a speed of . The recording area used only half of the width of the card. While reversing the card to store a second program was possible, it was officially discouraged (unlike in later models such as the HP-67) because the other half of the card was touched by the rubber wheel during transport, causing extra abrasion. When inserted into an extra slot between the display and the keyboard, the printing on top of the card would correspond to the top row of keys (A - E), which served as shortcuts to the corresponding program entry points.
Cards could be write-protected by diagonally clipping the top-left corner of the card. HP also sold a number of program collections for scientific and engineering applications on sets of prerecorded (and write-protected) cards.

The HP-65 had an issue/design flaw whereby storage register R9 was corrupted whenever the user (or program) executed trigonometric functions or performed comparison tests; this kind of issue was common in many early calculators, caused by a lack of memory due to cost, power, or size considerations. Since the limitation was intended from the beginning and documented in the manual, it is not, strictly speaking, a bug.

==Significant applications==

During the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the HP-65 became the first programmable handheld calculator in outer space. Two HP-65s were carried on board the Apollo spacecraft. Calculation of parameters for the several thrusting maneuvers needed to rendezvous with the Soyuz spacecraft was done on the HP-65 and compared with the results calculated by the onboard Apollo Guidance Computer. Another program for the HP-65 allowed the crew to compute pointing angles for the spacecraft antenna for aiming at the ATS-6 communications relay satellite. 

In the same year, Mitchell Feigenbaum, using the small HP-65 calculator he had been issued at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, discovered that the ratio of the difference between the values at which successive period-doubling bifurcations occur tends to a constant of around 4.6692... This &quot;ratio of convergence&quot; became known as the first Feigenbaum constant.

<text>The Garvellachs (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Na Garbh Eileacha&quot;) or Isles of the Sea form a small archipelago in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The islands include Garbh Eileach, Dùn Chonnuill and Eileach an Naoimh. Part of the Argyll and Bute council area, they lie in Firth of Lorne west of Lunga and northwest of Scarba and have been uninhabited since the 19th century. 

The islands are known for their early Christian connections to Brendan the Navigator and Columba and for their bedrock containing rare formations in relation to the global Sturtian glaciation. 

==Overview==

The waters surrounding the islands are extensively used for leisure sailing. Due to the array of separate tidal races produced by the underwater topography there are some treacherous stretches of water. These include the Grey Dog between Scarba and Lunga and the Gulf of Corryvreckan, between Scarba and Jura, in which is located the infamous Corryvreckan whirlpool, which is the third-largest whirlpool in the world.

The area is part of the Scarba, Lunga and the Garvellachs National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. The Scottish plant collector, Clara Winsome Muirhead surveyed the plant life of the islands and published &quot;The Flora of Easdale and the Garvellachs&quot; in 1962.

Garbh Eileach is the largest island in the group and extends to and reaches a maximum elevation of above sea level. The area of Eileach an Naoimh is and the maximum height . A&#x27; Chùli lies between the two and is in extent with Dùn Chonnuill, the northernmost isle, being roughly half this size.

==Etymology==
 is Gaelic for &quot;the rough rocks&quot; with the Anglicised version of the name giving rise to the archipelago&#x27;s name of the Garvellachs. Garbh Eileach itself then means the &quot;rough rock&quot; or &quot;rough rocky mound&quot;. Eileach an Naoimh is from and means either &quot;the rocky place of the saint&quot; or &quot;the holy rocks&quot;. A’ Chùli is from meaning &quot;Brendan&#x27;s retreat&quot; and Dùn Chonnuill means &quot;Conal&#x27;s castle&quot; and may be named after an Ulster chieftain of the first century CE.

==Geology==

The geology of the Garvellachs consists entirely of rocks of the Neoproterozoic Dalradian Supergroup apart from several basaltic dykes of Palaeogene age, associated with the nearby Mull Igneous Centre. The Dalradian rocks come from the uppermost part of the Appin Group and the lowermost part of the Argyll Group. The oldest preserved strata are exposed on the north of Garbh Eileach, a ~70 m thick sequence of carbonates, the Garbh Eileach Formation. The boundary between this and the overlying Port Askaig Tillite Formation is conformable. The Port Askaig Tillites are a sequence of sedimentary rocks that record a series of glacial, interglacial and periglacial episodes. This formation reaches it thickest development of 1,100 m in the area of Islay and the Garvellachs, thinning rapidly away from this region. The formation has been subdivided into five members, the lowest three of which are exceptionally well exposed on the Garvellachs. The sequence contains 48 diamictite beds, while 35–40 % of the formation is formed of sandstone of non-glacial origin, deposited in a deltaic to shallow marine sedimentary environment, interbedded with minor amounts of siltstones and dolomites.

There are two candidates within the Cryogenian period for the glacial interval represented by the Port Askaig Tillites, the older Sturtian glaciation (~717–660 million years ago} and the younger Marinoan glaciation (&lt;654–632 million years ago), both of which are regarded as examples of a Snowball Earth, where ice sheets extended to very low latitudes. Dating of the Port Askaig Tillites has been attempted using a wide variety of techniques, but these have produced contradictory results, with evidence found that supports both of the options. Samples from the sandstones (those from the Garbh Eileach Formation and three lower members of the Port Askaig Tillite were all taken from the Garvellachs) have been analysed using detrital zircon geochronology and the results provide the strongest support for the sequence being Sturtian, with &quot;youngest single grains&quot; throughout being consistent with the likely depositional ages.

The detrital zircon study suggests that the archipelago &quot;may be the only place on Earth to have a detailed record of how the Earth entered one of the most catastrophic periods in its history.&quot;
This research also found that the sandstones of the Port Askaig Tillite were sourced from Laurentia, rocks with ages ranging from 3700 to 660 Ma.

==History==

At least three of the four main islands of the Garvellachs were inhabited in the distant past. There is a ruined castle on the top of Dùn Chonnuill that may have been built by the Macleans of Duart in the early fifteenth century after the island was received by them as a gift from King Robert III. The fort consists of walling up to 2.0m high and generally of a similar width. The remains of ten buildings have been identified. Brendan is said to have been buried on A’ Chùli although no trace of his chapel there remains and a similar fate appears to have befallen two unroofed buildings, thought to be shielings, recorded in 1881 by the Ordnance Survey.

There is a small anchorage and landing place on Garbh Eileach where there are the remains of a burial ground and of a fort that measures about 14m by 11m. About northeast of this dun there are the ruins of a house and byre with a corn-drying kiln a short distance away, probably erected in the late 18th or 19th century. The island had a population of thirty-two adults in the late 17th century but only four houses were occupied by 1861, and from then on it is likely that only the shepherd&#x27;s cottage near the landing-place remained in use.

However, the most significant evidence of previous occupation is found on Eileach an Naoimh. About 542, Brendan the Navigator founded a monastery on &quot;Ailach&quot;, some years before Columba came to Iona. The ruins of the monastic buildings include two chapels, beehive huts, and a graveyard with three crosses and another circular grave. These ruins are amongst the best-preserved early Christian monasteries in Scotland and the site is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. 

Columba is also believed to have visited the island and it is one of the proposed locations of the Columban retreat isle of Hinba. Eileach an Naoimh may be the burial site of Columba&#x27;s mother Eithne. The monastery was destroyed by Viking raiders who were present in the area from about 800. Although there was a small permanent population in the 1700s the island&#x27;s intermittent occupation since the Norse settlement of Scotland has likely contributed to the survival of the structures.

A lease dated 1817 granted grazing for 60 cattle and 240 sheep on the archipelago as a whole.

==Natural history==
The outcrops of limestone on Eileach an Naoimh give rise to fertile soils and the slope of the land makes for &quot;verdant&quot; south-facing hillsides. A wide variety of flowering plants are found there including primrose, yellow flag, meadowsweet and honeysuckle. There are scattered birchwoods and a small herd of red deer on Garbh Eileach.

<text>The word bit is a colloquial expression referring to specific coins in various coinages throughout the world.

==United States==

In the US, the bit is equal to ¢, a designation which dates from the colonial period, when the most common unit of currency used was the Spanish dollar, also known as &quot;piece of eight&quot;, which was worth 8 Spanish silver reales. $ or 1 silver real was 1 &quot;bit&quot;.

With the adoption of the decimal U.S. currency in 1794, there was no longer a U.S. coin worth $, but &quot;two bits&quot; remained in the language with the meaning of $. Because there was no 1-bit coin, a dime (10¢) was sometimes called a &quot;short bit&quot; and 15¢ a &quot;long bit&quot;. (The picayune, which was originally &quot;real&quot; or bit (¢), was similarly transferred to the US nickel.)

In addition, Spanish coinage, like other foreign coins, continued to be widely used and allowed as legal tender by Chapter XXII of the Act of April 10, 1806 until the Coinage Act of 1857 discontinued the practice. 

Robert Louis Stevenson describes his experience with bits in &quot;Across the Plains&quot;, (1892) p.144:

&quot;Two bits&quot; or &quot;two bit&quot; continues in general use as a colloquial expression, for 25¢, or a quarter dollar as in song and catchphrase &quot;Shave and a Haircut, two bits.&quot; As an adjective, &quot;&quot; describes something cheap or unworthy.

Roger Miller&#x27;s song &quot;King of the Road&quot; features the lines: &quot;Ah, but two hours of pushin&#x27; broom buys an / Eight by twelve four-bit room&quot; referring to signs stating &quot;Rooms to let, 50¢.&quot;

In the early 1930s, Crown Records was a US record label which sold records for only 25¢. The company advertised on their sleeves, &quot;2 Hits for 2 Bits.&quot;

Another example of this use of &quot;bit&quot; can be found in the poem &quot;Six-Bits Blues&quot; by Langston Hughes, which includes the following couplet: &quot;Gimme six bits&#x27; worth o&#x27;ticket / On a train that runs somewhere.…&quot;

The expression also survives in the sports cheer &quot;Two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar … all for &quot;(player&#x27;s name)&quot;, stand up and holler!&quot;

The New York Stock Exchange continued to list stock prices in $ until June 24, 1997, at which time it started listing in $. It did not fully implement decimal listing until January 29, 2001.

==Danish West Indies==
From 1905 to 1917, the Danish West Indies used the bit as part of its currency system. In 1904, two new currency denominations were introduced: the &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;francs&quot; which were overlaid on the old &quot;cent&quot; and &quot;daler&quot; denominations. The four units were related as 5 bits = 1 cent, 100 bits = 20 cents = 1 franc, 100 cents = 5 francs = 1 daler. Coins were issued each denominated in two units, bits and cents, francs and cents, or francs and daler. Postage stamps were denominated in bits and francs; the lowest value was five bits.

==United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries and Ireland==
In Britain, Ireland and parts of the former British Empire, where before decimalisation a British-style currency of &quot;pounds, shillings and pence&quot; was in use, the word &quot;bit&quot; was applied colloquially to any of a range of low-denomination coins. Thus a threepence coin or &quot;threepenny piece&quot; was referred to as a &quot;threepenny bit&quot;, usually pronounced &quot;thrupny bit&quot;.

The term was used only for coins with a value of several named units (e.g., three pence), and never applied to a penny, shilling, or half crown coin.
Although earlier there had been other values in circulation such as the &quot;fourpenny bit&quot; or &quot;groat&quot;, the &quot;bit&quot; coins still in use in the United Kingdom up to decimalisation in 1971 were the two-shilling bit (or &quot;florin&quot;) (often &quot;two-bob bit&quot;), the sixpenny bit (or &quot;tanner&quot;), and the threepenny bit.

In the UK, use of the term &quot;bit&quot; had already disappeared with the exception of the &#x27;thruppeny bit&#x27;, by the time British currency moved to decimal coinage and the consequential loss of the coin denominations to which it had applied. Thus a ten pence piece is referred to merely as &quot;ten pence&quot;, or even &quot;ten pee&quot;, not as a &quot;tenpenny bit&quot;. The term &#x27;pee&#x27; refers to the change in abbreviation of the British penny from &#x27;d&#x27; to &#x27;p&#x27; which denoted the &#x27;New Penny&#x27;. 

The historic American adjective &quot;two-bit&quot; (to describe something worthless or insignificant) has a British equivalent in &quot;&quot; – literally, worth two and a half (old) pence.

<doc id="506827" wikidata="Q279501" url="?curid=506827" title="Aurvandill">
<text>Aurvandill (Old Norse) is a figure in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the god Thor tosses Aurvandill&#x27;s toe – which had frozen while the thunder god was carrying him in a basket across the Élivágar rivers – into the sky to form a star called &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Aurvandill&#x27;s toe&#x27;). In wider medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, he was known as in Old English, in Old High German, in Lombardic, and possibly as (auzandil) in Gothic. An Old Danish Latinized version, Horwendillus (Ørvendil), is also the name given to the father of &quot;Amlethus&quot; (Amleth) in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

Comparative studies of the various myths where the figure is involved have led scholars to reconstruct a Common Germanic mythical figure named &#x27;, meaning &#x27;light-beam&#x27; or &#x27;ray of light&#x27; (from&#x27;- &#x27;shiny [liquid]&#x27; attached to &quot;&quot; &#x27;[flexible] rod&#x27;). According to the Old English and Gothic sources, and to a lesser degree the Old Norse text (where a star is mentioned without additional details), this figure seems to have personified the &#x27;rising light&#x27; of the morning, possibly the Morning Star (Venus). However, the German and Old Danish evidence remain difficult to interpret in this model.

==Name and origin==
=== Etymology ===
The Old Norse name &#x27; stems from a Proto-Germanic form reconstructed as &#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27;. It is cognate with Old English &#x27;, Old High German &#x27; (≈ &#x27;), and Lombardic &#x27;. The Gothic word &quot;&quot;, which can be read in the &quot;Gothica Bononiensia&quot; according to the interpretation of several experts, may be another cognate.

==== Main interpretation ====
The original meaning of the Common Germanic name remains obscure. The most semantically plausible explanation is to interpret &#x27; as a compound meaning &#x27;light-beam&#x27; or &#x27;ray of light&#x27;, by deriving the prefix &#x27;- from Proto-Germanic &#x27; (&#x27;shiny [especially of liquids]&#x27;; cf. ON &#x27; &#x27;gold&#x27;, OE &#x27; &#x27;wave, sea&#x27;), and &#x27; from &#x27; (&#x27;rod, cane&#x27;; cf. Goth. &#x27;, ON &#x27;). The latter probably stems from the root &#x27; (&#x27;to turn, wind&#x27;), so that the etymological connotation is that of suppleness or flexibility.

In a wider Germanic context, this theory is encouraged by the Old English association of the idea of &#x27;rising light&#x27; with &quot;&quot;, whose name has been translated as &#x27;radiance, morning star&#x27;, or as &#x27;dawn, ray of light&#x27;. The Gothic word &quot;&quot;, translating the Koine Greek word &quot;heōsphóros&quot; (&#x27;dawnbringer&#x27;) from the Septuagint, which in Latin is rendered &quot;lucifer&quot; (&#x27;light-bringer, morning star&#x27;), may provide further evidence to this interpretation.

==== Alternative theories ====
Alternatively, the Old Norse prefix &#x27; has also been interpreted as coming from Proto-Germanic &#x27; (&#x27;mud, gravel, sediment&#x27;; cf. ON &#x27; &#x27;wet clay, mud&#x27;, OE &#x27; &#x27;earth&#x27;), with &quot;&quot; being rendered as &#x27;gravel-beam&#x27; or &#x27;swamp-wand&#x27;. According to philologist Christopher R. Fee, this may imply the idea a phallic figure related to fertility, the name of his spouse in the Old Norse myth, Gróa, literally meaning &#x27;Growth&#x27;.

In less frequent scholarly interpretations, the second element has also been derived by some researchers from &#x27; (&#x27;Vandal&#x27;; i.e. &#x27;the shining Vandal&#x27;), from a stem &#x27; (&#x27;beard&#x27;), or else compared to a Norse word for &quot;sword&quot;.

=== Origin ===

Commentators since at least the time of Jacob Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;, first published in 1835, have emphasized the great age of the tradition reflected in the mythological material surrounding this name, without being able to fully reconstruct the motifs of a Common Germanic myth. The task is complicated because the mythical stories of Orendel and Horwendillus appear to be unrelated to that of Ēarendel and Aurvandill. However, some scholars, including Georges Dumézil, have attempted to demonstrate that Saxo&#x27;s Horwendillus and Snorri&#x27;s Aurvandill are based on the same archetypal myth. Furthermore, the apparent discrepancies may be explained by the fact that derivatives of &#x27; were also used as personal names in the Lombardic and German traditions, as attested by historical figures who are named &#x27; and &quot;&quot; by the 8th century AD. Thus, the &quot;Orendel&quot; of the Middle High German myth may have been a different figure sharing the same name.

At any rate, scholars Rudolf Simek and John Lindow contend that the linguistic relation between the Old Norse and Old English names may suggest a Common Germanic origin of the myth despite the absence of Aurvandill from the Poetic Edda. They argue that Aurvandill was probably already connected with a star in the original myth, but that Snorri may have modelled the story of &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Auvandill&#x27;s Toe&#x27;) on the tale of the stars emerging from Þjazi&#x27;s eyes while Thor throws them into the sky.

The Old Norse &quot;&quot; is mentioned once in Norse mythology, in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, a book of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s 13th-century &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, where he is described as the husband of the witch Gróa:

Thor went home to Thrúdvangar, and the hone remained sticking in his head. Then came the wise woman who was called Gróa, wife of Aurvandill the Valiant: she sang her spells over Thor until the hone was loosened. But when Thor knew that, and thought that there was hope that the hone might be removed, he desired to reward Gróa for her leech-craft and make her glad, and told her these things: that he had waded from the north over Icy Stream and had borne Aurvandill in a basket on his back from the north out of Jötunheim. And he added for a token, that one of Aurvandill&#x27;s toes had stuck out of the basket, and became frozen; wherefore Thor broke it off and cast it up into the heavens, and made thereof the star called Aurvandill&#x27;s Toe. Thor said that it would not be long ere Aurvandill came home: but Gróa was so rejoiced that she forgot her incantations, and the hone was not loosened, and stands yet in Thor&#x27;s head. Therefore it is forbidden to cast a hone across the floor, for then the hone is stirred in Thor&#x27;s head.

This passage seems to be part of a larger story where Aurvandill is abducted by the jǫtnar; the thunder-god Thor confronts one of them (Hrungnir in Snorri&#x27;s version) and eventually liberates Aurvandill, but leaves the scene with the weapon of the jǫtunn stuck in his head.

At the end of the story, Aurvandill&#x27;s frost-bitten toe is made into a new star by Thor. However, it is not clear what celestial object is indicated in this passage. Guesses as to the identity of this star have included Sirius, the planet Venus, or the blue-white star Rigel, which could be viewed as forming the foot of the constellation Orion.

=== &quot;Gothica Bononiensia&quot; ===

The oldest attestation of this name may occur in the &quot;Gothica Bononiensia&quot;, a sermon from Ostrogothic Italy written in the Gothic language not later than the first half of the 6th century, and discovered in 2009. On folio 2 recto, in the context of a quotation from Isaiah 14:12, linguist P. A. Kerkhof suggested to see the word (&quot;&quot;) in a difficult-to-read part of the palimpsest. This reading, which has been accepted by various experts such as Carla Falluomini and Roland Schuhmann, translates the Koine Greek word (&quot;heōsphóros&quot;, &#x27;dawnbringer&#x27;) from the Septuagint, which in Latin is rendered &quot;lucifer&quot; (&#x27;light-bringer, morning star&#x27;):

&quot;... ...&quot;... how Lucifer did fall from heaven, he who emerges in the morning ... 

=== Old English ===

The term &#x27; (≈ &#x27;, &#x27;) appears seven times in the Old English corpus, where it is used in certain contexts to interpret the Latin &#x27; (&#x27;rising sun&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;light-bringer&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;dawn&#x27;) or &#x27; (&#x27;radiance&#x27;). According to scholar J. E. Cross, textual evidence indicate that it originally meant &#x27;coming or rising light, beginning of light, bringer of light&#x27;, and that later innovations led to an extended meaning of &#x27;radiance, light&#x27;. Philologist Tiffany Beechy writes that &quot;the evidence from the early glossary tradition shows &quot;earendel&quot; to be a rare alternative for common words for the dawn/rising sun.&quot; According to her, the &quot;Anglo-Saxons appear to have known &#x27; as a quasi-mythological figure who personified a natural phenomenon (sunrise) and an astrological/astronomical object (the morning star).&quot;

==== &quot;Crist I&quot; ====

The lines 104–108 of the Old English poem &quot;Crist I&quot; (&quot;Christ I&quot;) describe the coming of Ēarendel to the earth:
The impetus of the poem comes from the Latin Advent Antiphon: &#x27; (&quot;O Orient/Rising One, splendour of eternal light and sun of justice: come and illuminate one sitting in darkness and the shadow of death&quot;). Scholars agree that &#x27; was chosen in &quot;Crist I&quot; as an equivalent of the Latin &quot;&quot;, understood in a religious-poetic context as the &#x27;source of true light&#x27;, &#x27;the fount of light&#x27;, and the &#x27;light (which) rises from the Orient&#x27;.

Traditionally, Ēarendel in &quot;Crist I&quot; is taken to personify either John the Baptist or Christ himself, depicted as the rising sun, the morning star, or the dawn. In the poem, he is described as the &quot;true(st) light of the sun&quot; (&#x27;) and as the &quot;brightest of angels [≈ messengers]&quot; (&#x27;). This portrayal suggests the idea of a heavenly or divine radiance sent both physically and metaphorically over the earth for the benefit of mankind. The lines 107b–8 (&quot;&quot;), translated as &quot;all spans of time you, of yourself, enlighten always&quot;, or as &quot;you constantly enlighten all seasons by your presence&quot;, may also imply that Ēarendel exists in the poem as an eternal figure existing outside of time, and as the very force that makes time and its perception possible.

Beechy argues that the expression &#x27; (&#x27;O &#x27;) could be an Old English poetic stock formula, as it finds &quot;phonetic-associative echoes&quot; in the expressions &#x27; and &quot;&quot; from the Durham Hymnal Gloss.

==== &quot;Blickling Homilies&quot; ====

 also appears in the &quot;Blickling Homilies&quot; (10th century AD), where he is explicitly identified with John the Baptist:

The passage is based on a Latin sermon by the 5th-century Archbishop of Ravenna Petrus Chrysologus: &#x27; (&quot;But since he is about to appear, now let John spring forth, because the birth of Christ follows closely; let the new Lucifer arise, because now the light of the true Sun is breaking forth&quot;). Since the Old English version is close to the original Latin, &#x27; can be clearly identified in the &quot;Blickling Homilies&quot; with &quot;lucifer&quot;, meaning in liturgical language the &#x27;light bearer, the planet Venus as morning star, the sign auguring the birth of Christ&#x27;. In this context, &quot;&quot; is to be understood as the morning star, the light whose rising signifies Christ’s birth, and whose appearance comes in the poem before the &quot;gleam of the true Sun, God himself&quot;.

==== Glosses ====

In the Durham Hymnal Gloss (early 11th century AD), the term &#x27; is used in specific contexts to gloss the Latin &quot;aurora&quot; (&#x27;dawn; east, orient&#x27;) instead of the more commonly used equivalent &quot;dægrima&quot; (&#x27;dawn&#x27;). Hymns 15.8 and 30.1 imply that &#x27; appears &quot;with the dawn&quot;, as the light that &quot;quite suffuses the sky&quot;, rather than being the &quot;dawn itself&quot; (&quot;the dawn comes up in its course, steps fully forth&quot;).
The Épinal Glossary, written in England in the 8th century, associates &#x27; with the Latin &#x27; (&#x27;brightness, radiance&#x27; [especially of heavenly bodies]) as an alternative to the more frequent equivalent &#x27; (Old English: &#x27;ray of light, gleam&#x27;). Two copies of the Épinal Glossary were produced in the late 8th or early 9th century: the Épinal-Erfurt Glossary, which gives the equation &#x27; (≈ &quot;&quot;), and the Corpus Glossary, which was redacted from an archetype of the Épinal-Erfurt exemplar.

=== German ===

The forms &#x27; (≈ &#x27;, &#x27;), dating from the 8th century, and &#x27; (≈ &#x27;), dating from the 9th–10th century, were used in Old High German as personal names. A Bavarian count named &#x27; is recorded in 843.

The Middle High German epic poem &quot;Orendel&quot;, written in the late 12th century, presents a fictional story of how the Holy Mantle of Christ arrived in the city of Trier. This narrative was likely inspired by the actual transfer of the Mantle to the main altar of Trier Cathedral in 1196. The poem&#x27;s style, characterized by its &quot;paratactic organization of episodes and the repetition of poetic formulas&quot;, suggests it may be rooted in an older oral tradition.

The eponymous hero of the tale, Orendel, son of King Ougel, sets sail with a formidable fleet to reach the Holy Land and seek the hand of Bride, Queen of Jerusalem. After enduring a shipwreck, Orendel is rescued by a fisherman and eventually retrieves the lost Mantle from the belly of a whale.The coat grants him protection, enabling him to win Bride&#x27;s hand in marriage. Together, they rule Jerusalem for a time and embark on numerous adventures. In the end, Orendel disposes of the Holy Coat after bringing it to Trier.

The appendix to the &quot;Strassburger Heldenbuch&quot; (15th c.) names King Orendel (≈ &quot;) of Trier as the first of the heroes that were ever born.

The name also gave way to various toponyms found in present-day Germany, including &#x27; (in Grabfeld), &#x27; (now part of Zweiflingen), and &quot; (in Öhringen).

=== Lombardic ===

The Lombardic form &quot;&quot; appears as a personal name in the 8th century.

=== Danish ===

A Latinized version of the Old Danish name, &quot;Horwendillus&quot; (Ørvendil), appears in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (ca. 1200) as the father of &quot;Amlethus&quot; (Amlet):

Now Ørvendil, after controlling the [Jutland] province for three years, had devoted himself to piracy and reaped such superlative renown that Koller, the king of Norway, wishing to rival his eminent deeds and widespread reputation, judged it would suit him very well if he could transcend him in warfare and cast a shadow over the brilliance of this world-famed sea-rover. He cruised about, combing various parts of the seas, until he lit upon Ørvendil&#x27;s fleet. Each of the pirates had gained an island in the midst of the ocean and they had moored their ships on different sides. (...)

Both gave and accepted their word of honour on this point and fell to battle. They were not deterred from assailing each other with their blades by the novelty of their meeting or the springtime charm of that spot, for they took no heed of these things. Ørvendil&#x27;s emotional fervour made him more eager to set upon his foe than to defend himself; consequently he disregarded the protection of his shield and laid both hands to his sword. This daring had its results. His rain of blows deprived Koller of his shield by cutting it to pieces; finally he carved off the other’s foot and made him fall lifeless. He honoured their agreement by giving him a majestic funeral, constructing an ornate tomb, and providing a ceremony of great magnificence. After this he hounded down and slew Koller&#x27;s sister Sæla, a warring amazon and accomplished pirate herself and skilled in the trade of fighting.

Three years were passed in gallant military enterprises, in which he marked the richest and choicest of the plunder for Rørik, to bring himself into closer intimacy with the king. On the strength of their friendship Ørvendil wooed and obtained Rørik&#x27;s daughter Gerutha for his bride, who bore him a son, Amleth.

In view of Saxo&#x27;s tendency to euhemerise and reinterpret traditional Scandinavian myths, philologist Georges Dumézil has proposed that his story was based on the same archetype as Snorri&#x27;s Aurvandill. In what could be a literary inversion of the original myth, Horwendillus is portrayed as a warrior who injures and vanquishes his adversary, whereas Aurvandill was taken as a hostage by the jǫtnar and wounded during his deliverance. Dumézil also notes that, although the event does not take a cosmological turn in Saxo&#x27;s version, Aurvandill&#x27;s toe was broken off by Thor, while Collerus&#x27; (Koller&#x27;s) entire foot is slashed off by Horwendillus.
==In popular culture==

The English writer J. R. R. Tolkien discovered the lines 104–105 of Cynewulf&#x27;s &quot;Crist&quot; in 1913. According to him, the &quot;great beauty&quot; of the name Ēarendel, and the myth he seems to be associated with, inspired the character of Eärendil depicted in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. In 1914, Tolkien published a poem originally entitled &quot;The Voyage of Earendel the Evening Star&quot; as an account of Ēarendel&#x27;s celestial course as the bright Morning-star. In a personal letter from 1967, Tolkien wrote:

When first studying A[nglo]-S[axon] professionally (1913) ... I was struck by the great beauty of this word (or name), entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not &#x27;delectable&#x27; language ... it at least seems certain that it belonged to astronomical-myth, and was the name of a star or star-group. Before 1914, I wrote a &#x27;poem&#x27; upon Earendel who launched his ship like a bright spark from the havens of the Sun. I adopted him into my mythology in which he became a prime figure as a mariner, and eventually as a herald star, and a sign of hope to men. &quot;Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima&quot; (II 329) &#x27;hail Earendil brightest of Stars&#x27; is derived at long remove from &quot;Éala Éarendel engla beorhtast&quot;.

Tolkien interpreted Ēarendel as a messenger, probably inspired by his association with the word (&#x27;angel, messenger&#x27;) in both &quot;Crist I&quot; and the &quot;Blickling Homilies&quot; , and his identification with John the Baptist in the latter text. Tolkien&#x27;s depiction of Eärendil as a herald also has echoes in the interpretation of the Old English Ēarendel as the Morning-star physically heralding the rising of the sun, which finds a figurative parallel in the &quot;Blickling Homilies&quot;, where Ēarendel heralds the coming of the &quot;true Sun&quot;, Christ. Another pervasive aspect of Tolkien&#x27;s Eärendil is his depiction as a mariner. Carl F. Hostetter notes that, although &quot;the association of Eärendil with the sea was for Tolkien a deeply personal one&quot;, the Danish Horvandillus and the German Orendel are both portrayed as mariners themselves.

In 2022, a group of scientists led by astronomer Brian Welch named star WHL0137-LS &quot;Earendel&quot; from the Old English meaning.

In the 2022 revenge-thriller film &quot;The Northman&quot;, written and directed by Robert Eggers, Aurvandill is portrayed by Ethan Hawke. In the film Aurvandill is mentioned as the Raven King, who is the father of Amleth, the protagonist of the film, portrayed by the Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård. The film is based primarily on the medieval Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which is the direct inspiration behind the character Hamlet from William Shakespeare&#x27;s 16th century tragedy of the same name.

<text>Chester College of New England was a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting college that provided a foundation in the liberal arts and the fine arts, complemented by majors in the professional arts. It opened in 1965 as White Pines College and closed at the end of the 2011–12 academic year for financial reasons. The campus was sold in 2015 and now operates as Busche Academy with summer programs for elementary and middle-school aged students from China.

Located in Chester, New Hampshire, the college offered degree programs in creative writing, professional writing, photography and media arts, graphic design, computer science, fine arts, communication arts and interdisciplinary arts. Chester College also offered minor programs in creative writing, illustration, photojournalism, and writing. The college featured a student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1, artist-in-residence programs, and a program of guest lectures, exhibitions, art and photography exhibits, internships, and relationships with professional associations.

In April 2012, the college disclosed an operating deficit. Despite fundraising efforts, in May 2012, the college&#x27;s board of trustees announced that they had voted to close the college.

==History==
The college was founded in 1965 as White Pines College by Faith Preston, Ed.D. The first class was admitted in 1967.

The name of the school was changed in 2002, under Dr. William Nevious, third president of the college. Around this time, the college expanded from a 2-year program to a 4-year college with an emphasis on the arts. Nevious was credited with growth and transformation of the college during his presidency. &quot;Dr. Nevious took this college, which was literally on its death bed, and revived it,&quot; said Fred Kocher, a member of the college&#x27;s board of trustees.

On June 30, 2007, Nevious stepped down as the college&#x27;s president after six years. Former Manchester mayor Robert Baines was named interim president. Baines served as president of the college until he and the board of trustees decided to close the school in 2012. Prior to the closure of the school the faculty and staff of the college arranged a vote of no confidence against Baines. Baines remained as president until the official closing.

New England College and the New Hampshire Institute of Art (NHIA) each offered to accept Chester students as transfers after the college&#x27;s closure. Over 80% of the students chose to transfer to NHIA, as did several faculty members.

The campus was sold in 2015 to Jiahui Education, which inaugurated a summer program in 2016 as Busche Academy for elementary and middle-school aged students from China.

In 2022 the Dining Program at Busche Academy was taken over by renowned chef Ralph Notenboom.

==Visiting Artists and Writers Series==
The college&#x27;s Visiting Artists and Writers Series welcomed artists and authors to lecture, sit in on classes, and host readings and gallery exhibits. Notable authors included Steve Almond, Nicholson Baker, Mary Gaitskill, Jennifer Haigh, Sharon Olds, George Saunders, and Michelle Tea. Notable visual artists included Henry Horenstein and Pipo Nguyen-duy.

<text>The Turkish War of Independence (19 May 1919 – 24 July 1923) was a series of military campaigns and a revolution waged by the Turkish National Movement, after the Ottoman Empire was occupied and partitioned following its defeat in World War I. The conflict was between the Turkish Nationalists against Allied and separatist forces over the application of Wilsonian principles, especially self-determination, in post-World War I Anatolia and eastern Thrace. The revolution concluded the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the Eastern question, ending the Ottoman sultanate and the Ottoman caliphate, and establishing the Republic of Turkey. This resulted in the transfer of sovereignty from the sultan-caliph to the nation, setting the stage for nationalist revolutionary reform in Republican Turkey.

While World War I ended for the Ottomans with the Armistice of Mudros, the Allies continued occupying land per the Sykes–Picot Agreement, and to facilitate the prosecution of former members of the Committee of Union and Progress and those involved in the Armenian genocide. Ottoman commanders therefore refused orders from the Allies and Ottoman government to disband their forces. In an atmosphere of turmoil, Sultan Mehmed VI dispatched well-respected general Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk), to restore order; however, he became an enabler and leader of Turkish Nationalist resistance. In an attempt to establish control over the power vacuum in Anatolia, the Allies agreed to launch a Greek peacekeeping force and occupy Smyrna (İzmir), inflaming sectarian tensions and beginning the Turkish War of Independence. A nationalist counter government led by Mustafa Kemal was established in Ankara when it became clear the Ottoman government was appeasing the Allies. The Allies pressured the Ottoman &quot;Istanbul government&quot; to suspend the Constitution, Parliament, and sign the Treaty of Sèvres, a treaty unfavorable to Turkish interests that the &quot;Ankara government&quot; declared illegal.

Turkish and Syrian forces defeated the French in the south, and remobilized army units went on to partition Armenia with the Bolsheviks, resulting in the Treaty of Kars (1921). The Western Front is known as the Greco-Turkish War. İsmet Pasha (İnönü)&#x27;s organization of militia into a regular army paid off when Ankara forces fought the Greeks in the First and Second Battle of İnönü. The Greeks emerged victorious in the Battle of Kütahya-Eskişehir and drove on Ankara. The Turks checked their advance in the Battle of Sakarya and counter-attacked in the Great Offensive, which expelled Greek forces. The war ended with the recapture of İzmir, the Chanak Crisis and another armistice in Mudanya.

The Grand National Assembly in Ankara was recognized as the legitimate Turkish government, which signed the Treaty of Lausanne, a treaty more favorable to Turkey than Sèvres. The Allies evacuated Anatolia and eastern Thrace, the Ottoman government was overthrown, the monarchy abolished, and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey declared the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. With the war, a population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, and the abolition of the sultanate, the Ottoman era came to an end, and with Atatürk&#x27;s reforms, the Turks created the secular nation of Turkey. Turkey&#x27;s demographics were significantly impacted by the Armenian genocide and deportations of Greek-speaking, Orthodox Christian Rum people. The Turkish Nationalist Movement carried out massacres and deportations to eliminate native Christian populations—a continuation of the Armenian genocide and other ethnic cleansing during World War I. The historic Christian presence in Anatolia was largely destroyed; Muslims went from 80% to 98% of the population.

== Background ==
Following the chaotic politics of the Second Constitutional Era, the Ottoman Empire came under the control of the Committee of Union and Progress in a coup in 1913, and then further consolidated its control after the assassination of Mahmud Shevket Pasha. Founded as a radical revolutionary group seeking to prevent a collapse of the Ottoman Empire, by the eve of World War I it decided that the solution was to implement nationalist and centralizing policies. The CUP reacted to the losses of land and the expulsion of Muslims from the Balkan Wars by turning even more nationalistic. Part of its effort to consolidate power was to proscribe and exile opposition politicians from the Freedom and Accord Party to remote Sinop.

The Unionists brought the Ottoman Empire into World War I on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary, during which a genocidal campaign was waged against Ottoman Christians, namely Armenians, Pontic Greeks, and Assyrians. It was based on an alleged conspiracy that the three groups would rebel on the side of the Allies, so collective punishment was applied. A similar suspicion and suppression from the Turkish nationalist government was directed towards the Arab and Kurdish populations, leading to localized rebellions. The Entente powers reacted to these developments by charging the CUP leaders, commonly known as the Three Pashas, with &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; and threatened accountability. They also had imperialist ambitions on Ottoman territory, with correspondence over a post-war settlement in the Ottoman Empire being leaked to the press as the Sykes–Picot Agreement. Russia&#x27;s exit from World War I and descent into civil war was driven in part by the Ottoman closure of the Turkish straits to goods bound for Russia. A new imperative was given to the Entente powers to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war and restart the Eastern Front.

World War I would be the nail in the coffin of Ottomanism, an imperialist and multicultural nationalism. Mistreatment of non-Turk groups after 1913, and the general context of great socio-political upheaval that occurred in the aftermath of World War I, meant many minorities now wished to divorce their future from imperialism to form futures of their own by separating into (often republican) nation-states. Due to the Turkish nationalist policies pursued by the CUP against Ottoman Christians by 1918 the Ottoman Empire held control over a mostly homogeneous land of Muslims from eastern Thrace to the Persian border. These included mostly Turks, as well as Kurds, Circassians, and Muhacir groups from Rumeli. Most Muslim Arabs were now outside of the Ottoman Empire and under Allied occupation, with some &quot;imperialists&quot; still loyal to the Ottoman Sultanate-Caliphate, and others wishing for independence or Allied protection under a League of Nations mandate. Sizable Greek and Armenian minorities remained within its borders, and most of these communities no longer wished to remain under the Empire.

=== Conclusion of World War I ===
In the summer months of 1918, the leaders of the Central Powers realized that the Great War was lost, including the Ottomans&#x27;. Almost simultaneously the Palestinian Front and then the Macedonian Front collapsed. The sudden decision by Bulgaria to sign an armistice cut communications from Constantinople (İstanbul) to Vienna and Berlin, and opened the undefended Ottoman capital to Entente attack. With the major fronts crumbling, Unionist Grand Vizier Talât Pasha intended to sign an armistice, and resigned on 8 October 1918 so that a new government would receive less harsh armistice terms. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, ending World War I for the Ottoman Empire. Three days later, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP)—which governed the Ottoman Empire as a one-party state since 1913—held its last congress, where it was decided the party would be dissolved. Talât, Enver Pasha, Cemal Pasha, Doctor Nâzım, Bahaeddin Şakir, and three other high-ranking members of the CUP escaped the Ottoman Empire on a German torpedo boat later that night, plunging the country into a power vacuum.
With the fall of the CUP: the following factions hoped to take advantage of the power vacuum in the Ottoman Empire:

* The Palace: With Sultan Mehmed V&#x27;s death earlier in the summer of 1918, Mehmed VI was girded with the sword of Osman. Unlike his half-brother, the new Sultan wished to reassert the monarchy as a center of power in the Ottoman Empire. In the following conflict, his singular goal was to safe guard the interests of the royal family.

* The Liberals: The Freedom and Accord Party would be reestablished, and attempt to salvage the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s diplomatic position by cooperating with Allied demands, though their detractors accused them of appeasement. Like it&#x27;s first period of operation from 1911–1913, Freedom and Accord Party again fell into infigting, and would be defunct by the summer of 1919. One of its old leaders, Damat Ferid Pasha, would form a strong alliance with the Sultan, though he did not rejoin his party.

* The Allies: Britain and France had several goals. Both countries hoped to carve up the Ottoman Empire with mandates and spheres of influence. Britain specifically focused on facilitating war crimes trials to try Ottoman war criminals. Their immediate short term goal was to secure supply lines to assist the Whites in the Russian Civil War. Right after the armistice a &quot;de facto&quot; Allied occupation began in Constantinople. Some Ottoman intelligentsia hoped the Empire could become a mandate under the United States, an upstart and trustworthy power that recently proclaimed the Fourteen Points.
* Ethnic minorities: Ottoman Greeks hoped to join Greece and Armenians hoped join the new Armenian Republic. Pontic Greeks hoped to establish their own state. In April 1919 they renounced their allegience to the Ottoman state through their patriarchs. Some Kurds hoped to establish an autonomous Kurdish state, but their claims overlapped with Assyrian nationalists.

* Unionists: Though their leaders had escaped the country and the CUP as a whole was discredited and dissolved as an organization, ex-Unionists still controlled parliament, the army, police, post and telegraph, bureaucracy, and more. They were the target of purges which started by 1919, but the Allies and the Liberals did not have the resources or manpower to go after all of them. They would eventually coalesce around Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk).

== Prelude: October 1918 – May 1919 ==

=== Armistice of Mudros and occupation ===
On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies of World War I, bringing hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I to an end. The Ottoman Army was to demobilize, its navy and air force handed to the Allies, and occupied territory in the Caucasus and Persia to be evacuated. Critically, Article VII granted the Allies the right to occupy forts controlling the Turkish Straits and the vague right to occupy &quot;in case of disorder&quot; any territory if there were a threat to security. The clause relating to the occupation of the straits was meant to secure a Southern Russian intervention force, while the rest of the article was used to allow for Allied controlled peace-keeping forces. There was also a hope to follow through punishing local actors that carried out exterminatory orders from the CUP government against Armenian Ottomans. For now, the House of Osman escaped the fates of the Hohenzollerns, Habsburgs, and Romanovs to continue ruling their empire, though at the cost of its remaining sovereignty.

The armistice was signed because the Ottoman Empire had been defeated in important fronts, but the military was intact and retreated in good order. Unlike other Central Powers, the Allies did not mandate an abdication of the imperial family as a condition for peace, nor did they request the Ottoman Army to dissolve its general staff. Though the army suffered from mass desertion throughout the war which led to banditry, there was no threat of mutiny or revolutions like in Germany, Austria-Hungary, or Russia. This is despite famine and economic collapse that was brought on by the extreme levels of mobilization, destruction from the war, disease, and mass murder since 1914.

On 13 November 1918, a French brigade entered Constantinople to begin a &quot;de facto&quot; occupation of the Ottoman capital and its immediate dependencies. This was followed by a fleet consisting of British, French, Italian and Greek ships deploying soldiers on the ground the next day, totaling 50,000 troops in Constantinople. The Allied Powers stated that the occupation was temporary and its purpose was to protect the monarchy, the caliphate and the minorities. Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe—the British signatory of the Mudros Armistice—stated the Triple Entente&#x27;s public position that they had no intention to dismantle the Ottoman government or place it under military occupation by &quot;occupying Constantinople&quot;. However, dismantling the government and partitioning the Ottoman Empire among the Allied nations had been an objective of the Entente since the start of WWI.

A wave of seizures took place in the rest of the country in the following months. Questionably citing Article VII, the British occupied Mosul, claiming that Christian civilians in Mosul and Zakho were killed en masse by the Turkish troops. In the Caucasus, Britain established a presence in Menshevik Georgia and the Lori and Aras valleys as peace-keepers. On 14 November, joint Franco-Greek occupation was established in the town of Uzunköprü in eastern Thrace as well as the railway axis until the train station of Hadımköy on the outskirts of Constantinople. On 1 December, British troops based in Syria occupied Kilis, Marash, Urfa and Birecik. Beginning in December, French troops began successive seizures of the province of Adana, including the towns of Antioch, Mersin, Tarsus, Ceyhan, Adana, Osmaniye, and İslâhiye, incorporating the area into the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration North while French forces embarked by gunboats and sent troops to the Black Sea ports of Zonguldak and Karadeniz Ereğli commanding Turkey&#x27;s coal mining region. These continued seizures of land prompted Ottoman commanders to refuse demobilization and prepare for the resumption of war.

=== Prelude to resistance ===
The British similarly asked Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk) to turn over the port of Alexandretta (İskenderun), which he reluctantly did, following which he was recalled to Constantinople. He made sure to distribute weapons to the population to prevent them from falling into the hands of Allied forces. Some of these weapons were smuggled to the east by members of Karakol, a successor to the CUP&#x27;s Special Organization, to be used in case resistance was necessary in Anatolia. Many Ottoman officials participated in efforts to conceal from the occupying authorities details of the burgeoning independence movement spreading throughout Anatolia.

Other commanders began refusing orders from the Ottoman government and the Allied powers. After Mustafa Kemal Pasha returned to Constantinople, Ali Fuat Pasha (Cebesoy) brought XX Corps under his command. He marched first to Konya and then to Ankara to organise resistance groups, such as the Circassian çetes he assembled with guerilla leader Çerkes Ethem. Meanwhile, Kâzım Karabekir Pasha refused to surrender his intact and powerful XV Corps in Erzurum. Evacuating from the Caucusus, puppet republics and Muslim militia groups were established in the army&#x27;s wake to hamper the consolidation of the new Armenian state. Elsewhere in the country, regional nationalist resistance organizations known as &quot;Şûrâs&quot; –meaning &quot;councils&quot;, not unlike &quot;soviets&quot; in revolutionary Russia– were founded, most incorporating themselves into the Defence of National Rights movement which protested continued Allied occupation and appeasement by the Sublime Porte.

== The Armistice era ==
=== Politics of de-Ittihadification ===
Following the occupation of Constantinople, Mehmed VI Vahdettin dissolved the Chamber of Deputies which was dominated by Unionists elected back in 1914, promising elections for the next year. Vahdettin just ascended to the throne only months earlier with the death of Mehmed V Reşâd. He was disgusted with the policies of the CUP, and wished to be a more assertive sovereign than his diseased half brother. Greek and Armenian Ottomans declared the termination of their relationship with the Ottoman Empire through their respective patriarchates, and refused to partake in any future election. With the collapse of the CUP and its censorship regime, an outpouring of condemnation against the party came from all parts of Ottoman media.

A general amnesty was soon issued, allowing the exiled and imprisoned dissidents persecuted by the CUP to return to Constantinople. Sultan Vahdettin invited the pro-Palace politician Damat Ferid Pasha to form a government, whose members quickly set out to purge the Unionists from the Ottoman government. Ferid Pasha hoped that his Anglophilia and an attitude of appeasement would induce less harsh peace terms from the Allied powers. However, his appointment was problematic for the Unionists, many being members of the liquidated committee that were surely to face trial. Years of corruption, unconstitutional acts, war profiteering, and enrichment from ethnic cleansing and genocide by the Unionists soon became basis of war crimes trials and courts martial trials held in Constantinople. While many leading Unionists were sentenced lengthy prison sentences, many made sure to escape the country before Allied occupation or to regions that the government now had minimal control over; thus most were sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot;. The Allies encouragement of the proceedings and the use of British Malta as their holding ground made the trials unpopular. The partisan nature of the trials was not lost on observers either. The hanging of the Kaymakam of Boğazlıyan district Mehmed Kemal resulted in a demonstration against the courts martials trials.

With all the chaotic politics in the capital and uncertainty of the severity of the incoming peace treaty, many Ottomans looked to Washington with the hope that the application of Wilsonian principles would mean Constantinople would stay Turkish, as Muslims outnumbered Christians 2:1. The United States never declared war on the Ottoman Empire, so many imperial elite believed Washington could be a neutral arbiter that could fix the empire&#x27;s problems. Halide Edip (Adıvar) and her Wilsonian Principles Society led the movement that advocated for the empire to be governed by an American League of Nations Mandate (see United States during the Turkish War of Independence). American diplomats attempted to ascertain a role they could play in the area with the Harbord and King–Crane Commissions. However, with the collapse of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s health, the United States diplomatically withdrew from the Middle East to focus on Europe, leaving the Entente powers to construct a post-Ottoman order.

=== Banditry and the refugee crisis ===

The Entente would have arrived at Constantinople to discover an administration attempting to deal with decades of accumulated refugee crisis. The new government issued a proclamation allowing for deportees to return to their homes, but many Greeks and Armenians found their old homes occupied by desperate Rumelian and Caucasian Muslim refugees which were settled in their properties during the First World War. Ethnic conflict restarted in Anatolia; government officials responsible for resettling Christian refugees often assisted Muslim refugees in these disputes, prompting European powers to continue bringing Ottoman territory under their control. Of the 800,000 Ottoman Christian refugees, approximately over half returned to their homes by 1920. Meanwhile 1.4 million refugees from the Russian Civil War would pass through the Turkish straits and Anatolia, with 150,000 White émigrés choosing to settle in Istanbul for short or long term (see Evacuation of the Crimea). Many provinces were simply depopulated from years of fighting, conscription, and ethnic cleansing (see Ottoman casualties of World War I). The province of Yozgat lost 50% of its Muslim population from conscription, while according to the governor of Van, almost 95% of its prewar residents were dead or internally displaced.

Administration in much of the Anatolian and Thracian countryside would soon all but collapse by 1919. Army deserters who turned to banditry essentially controlled fiefdoms with tacit approval from bureaucrats and local elites. An amnesty issued in late 1918 saw these bandits strengthen their positions and fight amongst each other instead of returning to civilian life. Albanian and Circassian muhacirs resettled by the government in northwestern Anatolia and Kurds in southeastern Anatolia were engaged in blood feuds that intensified during the war and were hesitant to pledge allegiance to the Defence of Rights movement, and only would if officials could facilitate truces. Various Muhacir groups were suspicious of the continued Unionist ideology in the Defence of Rights movement, and the potential for themselves to meet fates &#x27;like the Armenians&#x27; especially as warlords hailing from those communities assisted the deportations of the Christians even though as many commanders in the Nationalist movement also had Caucasian and Balkan Muslim ancestry.

=== Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s mission ===

With Anatolia in practical anarchy and the Ottoman army being questionably loyal in reaction to Allied land seizures, Mehmed VI established the military inspectorate system to reestablish authority over the remaining empire. Encouraged by Karabekir and Edmund Allenby, he assigned Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk) as the inspector of the Ninth Army Troops Inspectorate –based in Erzurum– to restore order to Ottoman military units and to improve internal security on 30 April 1919, with his first assignment to suppress a rebellion by Greek rebels around the city of Samsun.

Mustafa Kemal was a well known, well respected, and well connected army commander, with much prestige coming from his status as the &quot;Hero of Anafartalar&quot;—for his role in the Gallipoli Campaign—and his title of &quot;Honorary Aide-de-camp to His Majesty Sultan&quot; gained in the last months of WWI. This choice would seem curious, as he was a nationalist and a fierce critic of the government&#x27;s accommodating policy to the Entente powers. He was also an early member of the CUP. However Kemal Pasha did not associate himself with the fanatical faction of the CUP, many knew that he frequently clashed with the radicals of the Central Committee like Enver. He was therefore sidelined to the periphery of power throughout the Great War; after the CUP&#x27;s dissolution he vocally aligned himself with moderates that formed the Liberal People&#x27;s Party instead of the rump Renewal Party (both parties would be banned in May 1919 for being successors of the CUP). All these reasons allowed him to be the most legitimate nationalist for the sultan to placate. In this new political climate, Kemal, his friends, and soon to be sympathizers benefited from the purges, elevating to ever higher profile positions. He sought to capitalize on his war exploits to attain a better job, indeed several times he unsuccessfully lobbied for his inclusion in cabinet as War Minister. His new assignment gave him effective plenipotentiary powers over all of Anatolia which was meant to accommodate him and other nationalists to keep them loyal to the government.

Mustafa Kemal had earlier declined to become the leader of the Sixth Army headquartered in Nusaybin. But according to Lord Kinross, through manipulation and the help of friends and sympathizers, he became the inspector of virtually all of the Ottoman forces in Anatolia, tasked with overseeing the disbanding process of remaining Ottoman forces while at the same time suppressing a Greek uprising nearby Samsun. Kemal had an abundance of connections and personal friends concentrated in the post-armistice War Ministry, a powerful tool that would help him accomplish his secret goal: to lead a nationalist movement to safeguard Turkish interests against the Allied powers and a collaborative Ottoman government.

The day before his departure to Samsun on the remote Black Sea coast, Kemal had one last audience with Sultan Vahdettin, where he affirmed his loyalty to the sultan-caliph. It was in this meeting that they were informed of the botched occupation ceremony of Smyrna (İzmir) by the Greeks. He and his carefully selected staff left Constantinople aboard the old steamer on the evening of 16 May 1919.

=== Negotiations for Ottoman partition ===
On 19 January 1919, the Paris Peace Conference was first held, at which Allied nations set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers, including the Ottoman Empire. As a special body of the Paris Conference, &quot;The Inter-Allied Commission on Mandates in Turkey&quot;, was established to pursue the secret treaties they had signed between 1915 and 1917. Italy sought control over the southern part of Anatolia under the Agreement of St.-Jean-de-Maurienne. France expected to exercise control over Hatay, Lebanon, Syria, and a portion of southeastern Anatolia based on the Sykes–Picot Agreement.

Greece justified their territorial claims of Ottoman land not least from Greece&#x27;s entrance to WWI on the Allied side but also through the Megali Idea as well as international sympathy from the suffering of Ottoman Greeks in 1914 and 1917–1918. Privately, Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos had British prime minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s backing because of his Philhellenism, and from his charisma and charming personality. Greece&#x27;s participation in the Allies&#x27; Southern Russian intervention also earned it favors in Paris. Venizelos&#x27; demands included parts of eastern Thrace, the islands of Imbros (Gökçeada), Tenedos (Bozcaada), and parts of Western Anatolia around the city of Smyrna (İzmir), all of which had large Greek populations. Venizelos also advocated a large Armenian state to check a post-war Ottoman Empire. Greece wanted to incorporate Constantinople, but Entente powers did not give permission. Damat Ferid Pasha went to Paris on behalf of the Ottoman Empire hoping to minimize territorial losses using Fourteen Points rhetoric, wishing for a return to &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, on the basis that every province of the Empire holds Muslim majorities. This plea was met with ridicule.

At the Paris Peace Conference, competing claims over Western Anatolia by Greek and Italian delegations led Greece to land the flagship of the Greek Navy at Smyrna, resulting in the Italian delegation walking out of the peace talks. On 30 April, Italy responded to the possible idea of Greek incorporation of Western Anatolia by sending a warship to Smyrna as a show of force against the Greek campaign. A large Italian force also landed in Antalya. Faced with Italian annexation of parts of Asia Minor with a significant ethnic Greek population, Venizelos secured Allied permission for Greek troops to land in Smyrna per Article VII, ostensibly as a peacekeeping force to keep stability in the region. Venizelos&#x27;s rhetoric was more directed against the CUP regime than the Turks as a whole, an attitude not always shared in the Greek military: &quot;Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Unionist] Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to the expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.&quot; It was decided by the Triple Entente that Greece would control a zone around Smyrna and Ayvalık in western Asia Minor.

== Organizational phase: May 1919 – March 1920 ==
=== Greek landing at Smyrna ===
Most historians mark the Greek landing at Smyrna on 15 May 1919 as the start date of the Turkish War of Independence as well as the start of the &quot;Kuva-yi Milliye Phase&quot;. The occupation ceremony from the outset was tense from nationalist fervor, with Ottoman Greeks greeting the soldiers with an ecstatic welcome, and Ottoman Muslims protesting the landing. A miscommunication in Greek high command led to an Evzone column marching by the municipal Turkish barracks. The nationalist journalist Hasan Tahsin fired the &quot;first bullet&quot; at the Greek standard bearer at the head of the troops, turning the city into a warzone. Süleyman Fethi Bey was murdered by bayonet for refusing to shout &quot;Zito Venizelos&quot; (meaning &quot;long live Venizelos&quot;), and 300–400 unarmed Turkish soldiers and civilians and 100 Greek soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded.

Greek troops moved from Smyrna outwards to towns on the Karaburun peninsula; to Selçuk, situated a hundred kilometres south of the city at a key location that commands the fertile Küçük Menderes River valley; and to Menemen towards the north. Guerilla warfare commenced in the countryside, as Turks began to organize themselves into irregular guerilla groups known as Kuva-yi Milliye (national forces), which were soon joined by Ottoman soldiers, bandits, and disaffected farmers. Most Kuva-yi Milliye bands were led by rogue military commanders and members of the Special Organization. The Greek troops based in cosmopolitan Smyrna soon found themselves conducting counterinsurgency operations in a hostile, dominantly Muslim hinterland. Groups of Ottoman Greeks also formed contingents that cooperated with the Greek Army to combat Kuva-yi Milliye within the zone of control. A massacre of Turks at Menemen was followed up with a battle for the town of Aydın, which saw intense intercommunal violence and the razing of the city. What was supposed to be a peacekeeping mission of Western Anatolia instead inflamed ethnic tensions and became a counterinsurgency.

The reaction of Greek landing at Smyrna and continued Allied seizures of land served to destabilize Turkish civil society. Damat Ferid Pasha resigned as Grand Vizier, but the sultan reappointed him anyways. With the Chamber of Deputies dissolved, and the environment not looking conducive for an election, Sultan Mehmed VI called for a Sultanate Council (&quot;Şûrâ-yı Saltanat&quot;), so the government could be consulted by representatives of civil society how the Ottoman Empire should deal with its present predicaments. On 26 May 1919, 131 representatives of Ottoman civil society gathered in the capital as a faux parliament. Discussion focused on a new election for the Chamber of Deputies or to become a British or American mandate. By and large, the assembly was unsuccessful in its goals, and the Ottoman government did not develop a strategy to navigate the crises the empire was engulfed in.

Ottoman bureaucrats, military, and bourgeoisie trusted the Allies to bring peace, and thought the terms offered at Mudros were considerably more lenient than they actually were. Pushback was potent in the capital, with 23 May 1919 being largest of the Sultanahmet Square demonstrations organized by the Turkish Hearths against the Greek occupation of Smyrna, the largest act of civil disobedience in Turkish history at that point. The Ottoman government condemned the landing, but could do little about it.

=== Organizing resistance ===
Mustafa Kemal Pasha and his colleagues stepped ashore in Samsun on 19 May and set up their first quarters in the Mıntıka Palace Hotel. British troops were present in Samsun, and he initially maintained cordial contact. He had assured Damat Ferid about the army&#x27;s loyalty towards the new government in Constantinople. However, behind the government&#x27;s back, Kemal made the people of Samsun aware of the Greek and Italian landings, staged discreet mass meetings, made fast connections via telegraph with the army units in Anatolia, and began to form links with various Nationalist groups. He sent telegrams of protest to foreign embassies and the War Ministry about British reinforcements in the area and about British aid to Greek brigand gangs. After a week in Samsun, Kemal and his staff moved to Havza. It was there that he first showed the flag of the resistance.

Mustafa Kemal wrote in his memoir that he needed nationwide support to justify armed resistance against the Allied occupation. His credentials and the importance of his position were not enough to inspire everyone. While officially occupied with the disarming of the army, he met with various contacts in order to build his movement&#x27;s momentum. He met with Rauf Pasha, Karabekir Pasha, Ali Fuat Pasha, and Refet Pasha and issued the Amasya Circular (22 June 1919). Ottoman provincial authorities were notified via telegraph that the unity and independence of the nation was at risk, and that the government in Constantinople was compromised. To remedy this, a congress was to take place in Erzurum between delegates of the Six Vilayets to decide on a response, and another congress would take place in Sivas where every Vilayet should send delegates. Sympathy and a lack of coordination from the capital gave Mustafa Kemal freedom of movement and telegraph use despite his implied anti-government tone.

On 23 June, High Commissioner Admiral Calthorpe, realising the significance of Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s discreet activities in Anatolia, sent a report about the Pasha to the Foreign Office. His remarks were downplayed by George Kidson of the Eastern Department. Captain Hurst of the British occupation force in Samsun warned Admiral Calthorpe one more time, but Hurst&#x27;s units were replaced with the Brigade of Gurkhas. When the British landed in Alexandretta, Admiral Calthorpe resigned on the basis that this was against the armistice that he had signed and was assigned to another position on 5 August 1919. The movement of British units alarmed the population of the region and convinced them that Mustafa Kemal was right.

=== Consolidation through congresses ===
By early July, Mustafa Kemal Pasha received telegrams from the sultan and Calthorpe, asking him and Refet to cease his activities in Anatolia and return to the capital. Kemal was in Erzincan and did not want to return to Constantinople, concerned that the foreign authorities might have designs for him beyond the sultan&#x27;s plans. Before resigning from his position, he dispatched a circular to all nationalist organizations and military commanders to not disband or surrender unless for the latter if they could be replaced by cooperative nationalist commanders. Now only a civilian stripped of his command, Mustafa Kemal was at the mercy of the new inspector of Third Army (renamed from Ninth Army) Karabekir Pasha, indeed the War Ministry ordered him to arrest Kemal, an order which Karabekir refused.

The Erzurum Congress was a meeting of delegates and governors from the six Eastern Vilayets. They drafted the National Pact (&quot;Misak-ı Millî)&quot;, which envisioned new borders for the Ottoman Empire by applying principles of national self-determination per Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points and the abolition of the capitulations. The Erzurum Congress concluded with a circular that was effectively a declaration of independence: All regions within Ottoman borders upon the signing of the Mudros Armistice were indivisible from the Ottoman state –Greek and Armenian claims on Thrace and Anatolia were moot– and assistance from any country not coveting Ottoman territory was welcome. If the government in Constantinople was not able to attain this after electing a new parliament, they insisted a provisional government should be promulgated to defend Turkish sovereignty. The Committee of Representation was established as a provisional executive body based in Anatolia, with Mustafa Kemal Pasha as its chairman.Following the congress, the Committee of Representation relocated to Sivas. As announced in the Amasya Circular, a new congress was held there in September with delegates from all Anatolian and Thracian provinces. The Sivas Congress repeated the points of the National Pact agreed to in Erzurum, and united the various regional Defence of National Rights Associations organizations, into a united political organisation: Anatolia and Rumeli Defence of Rights Association (A-RMHC), with Mustafa Kemal as its chairman. In an effort show his movement was in fact a new and unifying movement, the delegates had to swear an oath to discontinue their relations with the CUP and to never revive the party (despite most present in Sivas being previous members). It was also decided there that the Ottoman Empire should not be a League of Nations mandate under the United States, especially after the U.S Senate failed to ratify American membership in the League.

Momentum was now on the Nationalists&#x27; side. A plot by a loyalist Ottoman governor and a British intelligence officer to arrest Kemal before the Sivas Congress led to the cutting of all ties with the Ottoman government until a new election would be held in the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. In October 1919, the last Ottoman governor loyal to Constantinople fled his province. Fearing the outbreak of hostilities, all British troops stationed in the Black Sea coast and Kütahya were evacuated. Damat Ferid Pasha resigned, and the sultan replaced him with a general with nationalist credentials: Ali Rıza Pasha. On 16 October 1919, Ali Rıza and the Nationalists held negotiations in Amasya. They agreed in the Amasya Protocol that an election would be called for the Ottoman Parliament to establish national unity by upholding the resolutions made in the Sivas Congress, including the National Pact.

By October 1919, the Ottoman government only held &quot;de facto&quot; control over Constantinople; the rest of the Ottoman Empire was loyal to Kemal&#x27;s movement to resist a partition of Anatolia and Thrace. Within a few months Mustafa Kemal went from General Inspector of the Ninth Army to a renegade military commander discharged for insubordination to leading a homegrown anti-Entente movement that overthrew a government and driven it into resistance.

=== Last Ottoman parliament ===
In December 1919, an election was held for the Ottoman parliament, with polls only open in unoccupied Anatolia and Thrace. It was boycotted by Ottoman Greeks, Ottoman Armenians and the Freedom and Accord Party, resulting in groups associated with the Turkish Nationalist Movement winning, including the A-RMHC. The Nationalists&#x27; obvious links to the CUP made the election especially polarizing and voter intimidation and ballot box stuffing in favor of the Kemalists were regular occurrences in rural provinces. This controversy led to many of the nationalist MPs organizing the National Salvation Group separate from Kemal&#x27;s movement, which risked the nationalist movement splitting in two.

Mustafa Kemal was elected an MP from Erzurum, but he expected the Allies neither to accept the Harbord report nor to respect his parliamentary immunity if he went to the Ottoman capital, hence he remained in Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal and the Committee of Representation moved from Sivas to Ankara so that he could keep in touch with as many deputies as possible as they traveled to Constantinople to attend the parliament.

Though Ali Rıza Pasha called the election as per the Amasya Protocol to keep unity between the &quot;Istanbul government&quot; and &quot;Ankara government&quot;, he was wrong to think the election could bring him any legitimacy. The Ottoman parliament was under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the British battalion stationed at Constantinople and any decisions by the parliament had to have the signatures of both Ali Rıza Pasha and the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer. The only laws that passed were those acceptable to, or specifically ordered by the British.

On 12 January 1920, the last session of the Chamber of Deputies met in the capital. First the sultan&#x27;s speech was presented, and then a telegram from Mustafa Kemal, manifesting the claim that the rightful government of Turkey was in Ankara in the name of the Committee of Representation. On 28 January the MPs from both sides of the isle secretly met to endorse the National Pact as a peace settlement. They added to the points passed in Sivas, calling for plebiscites to be held in West Thrace; Batum, Kars, and Ardahan, and Arab lands on whether to stay in the Empire or not. Proposals were also made to elect Kemal president of the Chamber; however, this was deferred in the certain knowledge that the British would prorogue the Chamber. The Chamber of Deputies would be forcefully dissolved for passing the National Pact anyway. The National Pact solidified Nationalist interests, which were in conflict with the Allied plans.

From February to April, leaders of Britain, France, and Italy met in London to discuss the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire and the crisis in Anatolia. The British began to sense that the elected Ottoman government was under Kemalist influence and if left unchecked, the Entente could once again find themselves at war with the Empire. The Ottoman government was not doing all that it could to suppress the Nationalists.

Mustafa Kemal manufactured a crisis to pressure the Istanbul government to pick a side by deploying Kuva-yi Milliye towards İzmit. The British, concerned about the security of the Bosporus Strait, demanded Ali Rıza Pasha to reassert control over the area, to which he responded with his resignation to the sultan.

== Jurisdictional conflict: March 1920 – January 1921 ==
=== Decapitation of the Istanbul government ===

As they were negotiating the partition of the Ottoman Empire, the Allies were growing increasingly concerned about the Turkish National Movement. To this end, the Allied occupational authorities in Istanbul began to plan a raid to arrest nationalist politicians and journalists along with occupying military and police installations and government buildings. On 16 March 1920, the coup was carried out; several Royal Navy warships were anchored in the Galata Bridge to support British forces, including the Indian Army, while they carried out the arrests and occupied several government buildings in the early hours of the morning.

An Indian Army operation, the Şehzadebaşı raid, resulted in 5 Ottoman soldiers from the 10th Infantry Division being killed when troops raided their barracks. Among those arrested were the senior leadership of the Turkish National Movement and former members of the CUP. 150 arrested Turkish politicians accused of war crimes were interned in Malta and became known as the Malta exiles.

Mustafa Kemal was ready for this move. He warned all the Nationalist organisations that there would be misleading declarations from the capital. He warned that the only way to counter Allied movements was to organise protests. He declared &quot;Today the Turkish nation is called to defend its capacity for civilization, its right to life and independenceits entire future&quot;.

On 18 March, the Chamber of Deputies declared that it was unacceptable to arrest five of its members, and dissolved itself. Mehmed VI confirmed this and declared the end of Constitutional Monarchy and a return to absolutism. University students were forbidden from joining political associations inside and outside the classroom. With the lower elected Chamber of Deputies shuttered, the Constitution terminated, and the capital occupied; Sultan Vahdettin, his cabinet, and the appointed Senate were all that remained of the Ottoman government, and were basically a puppet regime of the Allied powers. Grand Vizier Salih Hulusi Pasha declared Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s struggle legitimate, and resigned after less than a month in office. In his place, Damat Ferid Pasha returned to the premiership. The Sublime Porte&#x27;s decapitation by the Entente allowed Mustafa Kemal to consolidate his position as the sole leader of Turkish resistance against the Allies, and to that end made him the legitimate representative of the Turkish people.

=== Promulgation of the Grand National Assembly ===


The strong measures taken against the Nationalists by the Allies in March 1920 began a distinct new phase of the conflict. Mustafa Kemal sent a note to the governors and force commanders, asking them to conduct elections to provide delegates for a new parliament to represent the Ottoman (Turkish) people, which would convene in Ankara. With the proclamation of the counter-government, Kemal would then ask the sultan to accept its authority. Mustafa Kemal appealed to the Islamic world, asking for help to make sure that everyone knew he was still fighting in the name of the sultan who was also the caliph. He stated he wanted to free the caliph from the Allies. He found an ally in the Khilafat movement of British India, where Indians protested Britain&#x27;s planned dismemberment of Turkey. A committee was also started for sending funds to help the soon to be proclaimed Ankara government of Mustafa Kemal.
A flood of supporters moved to Ankara just ahead of the Allied dragnets. Included among them were Halide Edip and Abdülhak Adnan (Adıvar), Mustafa İsmet Pasha (İnönü), Mustafa Fevzi Pasha (Çakmak), many of Kemal&#x27;s allies in the Ministry of War, and Celalettin Arif, the president of the now shuttered Chamber of Deputies. Celaleddin Arif&#x27;s desertion of the capital was of great significance, as he declared that the Ottoman Parliament had been dissolved illegally.

Some 100 members of the Chamber of Deputies were able to escape the Allied roundup and joined 190 deputies elected. In March 1920, Turkish revolutionaries announced the establishment of a new parliament in Ankara known as the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (GNA) that was dominated by the A-RMHC. The parliament included Turks, Circassians, Kurds, and one Jew. They met in a building that used to serve as the provincial headquarters of the local CUP chapter. The inclusion of &quot;Turkey&quot; in its name reflected an increasing trend of new ways Ottoman citizens thought of their country, and was the first time it was formally used as the name of the country. On 23 April, the assembly, assuming full governmental powers, gathered for the first time, electing Mustafa Kemal its first Speaker and Prime Minister.

Hoping to undermine the Nationalist Movement, Mehmed VI issued a fatwa to qualify the Turkish revolutionaries as infidels, calling for the death of its leaders. The fatwa stated that true believers should not go along with the Nationalist Movement as they committed apostasy. The mufti of Ankara Rifat Börekçi issued a simultaneous fatwa, declaring that the caliphate was under the control of the Entente and the Ferid Pasha government. In this text, the Nationalist Movement&#x27;s goal was stated as freeing the sultanate and the caliphate from its enemies. In reaction to the desertion of several prominent figures to the Nationalist Movement, Ferid Pasha ordered Halide Edip, Ali Fuat and Mustafa Kemal to be sentenced to death in absentia for treason.

=== Clashes in İzmit ===


The Istanbul government finally found an ally outside of the city walls in Ahmet Anzavur. Throughout late 1919 and early 1920 the warlord recruited fellow Circassian bandits, decrying Kemal&#x27;s nationalists as &#x27;wicked Unionists and freemasons&#x27;.

On 28 April the sultan raised 4,000 soldiers known as the Kuva-yi İnzibatiye (Caliphate Army) to combat the Nationalists. Then using money from the Allies, another force about 2,000 strong from non-Muslim inhabitants were initially deployed in İznik. The sultan&#x27;s government sent the forces under the name of the Caliphate Army to the revolutionaries to arouse counterrevolutionary sympathy. The British, being skeptical of how formidable these insurgents were, decided to use irregular power to counteract the revolutionaries. The Nationalist forces were distributed all around Turkey, so many smaller units were dispatched to face them. In İzmit there were two battalions of the British army. These units were to be used to rout the partisans under the command of Ali Fuat and Refet Pasha.
Anatolia had many competing forces on its soil: British troops, Nationalist militia (Kuva-yi Milliye), the sultan&#x27;s army (Kuva-yi İnzibatiye), and Anzavur&#x27;s bands. On 13 April 1920, an uprising supported by Anzavur against the GNA occurred at Düzce as a direct consequence of the fatwa. Within days the rebellion spread to Bolu and Gerede. The movement engulfed northwestern Anatolia for about a month. On 14 June, Nationalist militia fought a pitched battle near İzmit against the Kuva-yi İnzibatiye, Anzavur&#x27;s bands, and British units. Yet under heavy attack some of the Kuva-yi İnzibatiye deserted and joined the Nationalist militia. Anzavur was not so lucky, as the Nationalists tasked Ethem the Circassian with crushing Anzavur&#x27;s revolt. This revealed the sultan did not have the unwavering support of his own men and allies. Meanwhile, the rest of these forces withdrew behind the British lines which held their position. For now, Istanbul was out of Ankara&#x27;s grasp.

The clash outside İzmit brought serious consequences. British forces conducted combat operations on the Nationalists and the Royal Air Force carried out aerial bombardments against the positions, which forced Nationalist forces to temporarily retreat to more secure missions. The British commander in Turkey, General George Milne—, asked for reinforcements. This led to a study to determine what would be required to defeat the Turkish Nationalists. The report, signed by French Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch, concluded that 27 divisions were necessary, but the British army did not have 27 divisions to spare. Also, a deployment of this size could have disastrous political consequences back home. World War I had just ended, and the British public would not support another lengthy and costly expedition.

The British accepted the fact that a nationalist movement could not be defeated without deployment of consistent and well-trained forces. On 25 June, the forces originating from Kuva-i İnzibatiye were dismantled under British supervision. The British realised that the best option to overcome these Turkish Nationalists was to use a force that was battle-tested and fierce enough to fight the Turks on their own soil. The British had to look no further than Turkey&#x27;s neighbor already occupying its territory: Greece.

=== Treaty of Sèvres ===


Eleftherios Venizelos, pessimistic of the rapidly deteriorating situation in Anatolia, requested to the Allies that a peace treaty be drawn up with the hope that fighting would stop.

The subsequent Treaty of Sèvres in August 1920 confirmed the Arab provinces of the empire would be reorganized into new nations given to Britain and France in the form of Mandates by the League of Nations, while the rest of the Empire would be partitioned between Greece, Italy, France (via Syrian mandate), Britain (via Iraqi mandate), Armenia (potentially under an American mandate), and Georgia. Smyrna would hold a plebiscite on whether to stay with Greece or Turkey, and the Kurdistan region would hold one on the question of independence. British, French, and Italian spheres of influence would also extend into Anatolia beyond the land concessions. The old capital of Constantinople as well as the Dardanelles would be under international League of Nations control.

However, the treaty could never come into effect. The treaty was extremely unpopular, with protests against the final document held even before its release in Sultanahmet square. Though Mehmed VI and Ferid Pasha loathed the treaty, they did not want Istanbul to join Ankara in nationalist struggle. The Ottoman government and Greece never ratified it. Though Ferid Pasha signed the treaty, the Ottoman Senate, the upper house with seats appointed by the sultan, refused to ratify the treaty. Greece disagreed on the borders drawn. The other allies began to fracture their support of the settlement immediately. Italy started openly supporting the Nationalists with arms by the end of 1920, and the French signed another separate peace treaty with Ankara only months later.

Kemal&#x27;s GNA Government responded to the Treaty of Sèvres by promulgating a new constitution in January 1921. The resulting constitution consecrated the principle of popular sovereignty; authority not deriving from the unelected sultan, but from the Turkish people who elect governments representative of their interests. This document became the legal basis for the war of independence by the GNA, as the sultan&#x27;s signature of the Treaty of Sèvres would be unconstitutional as his position was not elected. While the constitution did not specify a future role of the sultan, the document gave Kemal ever more legitimacy in the eyes of Turks for justified resistance against Istanbul.

==Fighting==
=== Southern Front ===

In contrast to the Eastern and Western fronts, it was mostly unorganized Kuva-yi Milliye which were fighting in the Southern Front against France. They had help from the Syrians, who were fighting their own war with the French.

The British troops which occupied coastal Syria by the end of World War I were replaced by French troops over 1919, with the Syrian interior going to Faisal bin Al-Hussein&#x27;s self-proclaimed Arab Kingdom of Syria. France which wanted to take control of all of Syria and Cilicia. There was also a desire facilitate the return of Armenian refugees in the region to their homes, and the occupation force consisted of the French Armenian Legion as well as various Armenian militia groups. 150,000 Armenians were repatriated to their homes within months of French occupation. On 21 January 1920, a Turkish Nationalist uprising and siege occurred against the French garrison in Marash. The French position untenable they retreated to Islahiye, resulting in a massacre of many Armenians by Turkish militia. A grueling siege followed in Antep which featured intense sectarian violence between Turks and Armenians. After a failed uprising by the Nationalists in Adana, by 1921, the French and Turks signed an armistice and eventually a treaty was brokered demarcating the border between the Ankara government and French controlled Syria. In the end, there was a mass exodus of Cilician Armenians to French controlled Syria, Previous Armenian survivors of deportation found themselves again as refugees and families which avoided the worst of the six years violence were forced from their homes, ending thousands of years of Christian presence in Southern Anatolia. With France being the first Allied power to recognize and negotiate with the Ankara government only months after signing the Treaty of Sèvres, it was the first to break from the coordinated Allied approach to the Eastern question. In 1923 the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon under French authority would be proclaimed in former Ottoman territory.

Some efforts to coordinate between Turkish Nationalists and the Syrian rebels persisted from 1920 to 1921, with the Nationalists supporting the Faisal&#x27;s kingdom through Ibrahim Hanunu and Alawite groups which were also fighting the French. While the French conquered Syria, Cilicia had to be abandoned.

=== Al-Jazira Front ===
Kuva-yi Milliye also engaged with British forces in the &quot;Al-Jazira Front,&quot; primarily in Mosul. Ali İhsan Pasha (Sabis) and his forces defending Mosul would surrender to the British in October 1918, but the British ignored the armistice and seized the city, following which the pasha also ignored the armistice and distributed weapons to the locals. Even before Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s movement was fully organized, rogue commanders found allies in Kurdish tribes. The Kurds detested the taxes and centralization the British demanded, including Shaykh Mahmud of the Barzani family. Having previously supported the British invasion of Mesopotamia to become the governor of South Kurdistan, Mahmud revolted but was apprehended by 1919. Without legitimacy to govern the region, he was released from captivity to Sulaymaniyah, where he again declared an uprising against the British as the King of Kurdistan. Though an alliance existed with the Turks, little material support came to him from Ankara, and by 1923 there was a desire to cease hostilities between the Turks and British at Barzanji&#x27;s expense. Mahmud was overthrown in 1924, and after a 1926 plebiscite, Mosul was awarded to British-controlled Iraq.

=== Eastern Front ===

Since 1917, the Caucasus was in a chaotic state. The border of newly independent Armenia and the Ottoman Empire was defined in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) after the Bolshevik revolution, and later by the Treaty of Batum (4 June 1918). To the east, Armenia was at war with the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic after the breakup of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, and received support from Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Russian Army. It was obvious that after the Armistice of Mudros (30 October 1918) the eastern border was not going to stay as it was drawn, which mandated the evacuation of the Ottoman army back to its 1914 borders. Right after the Armistice of Mudros was signed, pro-Ottoman provisional republics were proclaimed in Kars and Aras which were subsequently invaded by Armenia. Ottoman soldiers were convinced not to demobilize lest the area become a &#x27;second Macedonia&#x27;. Both sides of the new borders had massive refugee populations and famine, which were compounded by the renewed and more symmetric sectarian violence (See Massacres of Azerbaijanis in Armenia (1917–1921) and Muslim uprisings in Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan). There were talks going on with the Armenian Diaspora and Allied Powers on reshaping the border. Woodrow Wilson agreed to transfer territories to Armenia based on the principles of national self-determination. The results of these talks were to be reflected on the Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920).

Kâzım Karabekir Pasha, commander of the XV corps, encountered Muslim refugees fleeing from the Armenian army, but did not have the authority to cross the border. Karabekir&#x27;s two reports (30 May and 4 June 1920) outlined the situation in the region. He recommended redrawing the eastern borders, especially around Erzurum. The Russian government was receptive to this and demanded that Van and Bitlis be transferred to Armenia. This was unacceptable to the Turkish revolutionaries. However, Soviet support was absolutely vital for the Turkish Nationalist movement, as Turkey was underdeveloped and had no domestic armaments industry. Bakir Sami (Kunduh) was assigned to negotiate with the Bolsheviks.

On 24 September 1920, Karabekir&#x27;s XV corps and Kurdish militia advance on Kars, blowing through Armenian opposition, and then Alexandropol. With an advance on Yerevan imminent, on 28 November 1920, the 11th Red Army under the command of Anatoliy Gekker crossed over into Armenia from Soviet Azerbaijan, and the Armenian government surrendered to Bolshevik forces, ending the conflict.

The Treaty of Alexandropol (2—3 December 1920) was the first treaty (although illegitimate) signed by the Turkish revolutionaries. The 10th article in the Treaty of Alexandropol stated that Armenia renounced the Treaty of Sèvres and its allotted partition of Anatolia. The agreement was signed with representatives of the former government of Armenia, which by that time had no &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; power in Armenia, since Soviet rule was already established in the country. On 16 March 1921, the Bolsheviks and Turkey signed a more comprehensive agreement, the Treaty of Kars, which involved representatives of Soviet Armenia, Soviet Azerbaijan, and Soviet Georgia.

=== Revolts ===


=== Western Front ===

The Greco-Turkish War—referred to as the &quot;Western Front&quot; by the Turks and the &quot;Asia Minor Campaign&quot; by the Greeks—started when Greek forces landed in Smyrna (now İzmir), on 15 May 1919. A perimeter around the city known as the Milne Line was established in which low-intensity guerilla war commenced.

The conflict escalated when Greece and Britain performed a joint offensive over the summer of 1920, which Istanbul condemned, that took control over the Marmara coast and provided strategic depth to the İzmir occupation zone. The cities of İzmit, Manisa, Balıkesir, Aydın, and Bursa were taken with little Turkish resistance.

A second Greek offensive in autumn was launched with the goal to pressure Istanbul and Ankara to sign the Sèvres Treaty. This peace process was temporarily halted with the fall of Venizelos when the pro-Entente King Alexander died from sepsis after being bitten by a monkey. Much to Allied chagrin he was replaced by his anti-Entente father King Constantine. Greece ceased to receive much Allied support after the change in power. The Army of Asia Minor was purged of Venizelist officers, their replacements being less competent.

When the offensive resumed, the Turks received their first victory when the Greeks encountered stiff resistance in the battles of First and Second İnönü, due to İsmet Pasha&#x27;s organization of an irregular militia into a regular army. The two victories led to Allied proposals to amend the Treaty of Sèvres where both Ankara and Istanbul were represented, but Greece refused. With the conclusion of the Southern and Eastern fronts, Ankara was able to concentrate more forces on the West against the Greeks. They also began to receive support from Soviet Union, as well as France and Italy, who sought to check British influence in the Near East.

June–July 1921 saw heavy fighting in the Battle of Kütahya-Eskişehir. While it was an eventual Greek victory, the Turkish army withdrew in good order to the Sakarya river, their last line of defence. Mustafa Kemal Pasha replaced İsmet Pasha after the defeat as commander-in-chief as well as his political duties. The decision was made in the Greek military command to march on the Nationalist capital of Ankara to force Mustafa Kemal to the negotiating table. For 21 days, the Turks and Greeks fought a pitched battle at the Sakarya river, which ended in Greek withdrawal. Almost of year of stalemate without much fighting followed, during which Greek morale and discipline faltered while Turkish strength increased. French and Italian forces evacuated Anatolia. The Allies offered an armistice to the Turks, which Mustafa Kemal refused.

==== Peace negotiations and the Great Offensive (1921–1922) ====

In salvaging the Treaty of Sèvres, The Triple Entente forced the Turkish revolutionaries to agree with the terms through a series of conferences in London. The conference of London gave the Triple Entente an opportunity to reverse some of its policies. In October, parties to the conference received a report from Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol. He organised a commission to analyse the situation, and inquire into the bloodshed during the Occupation of İzmir and the following activities in the region. The commission reported that if annexation would not follow, Greece should not be the only occupation force in this area. Admiral Bristol was not so sure how to explain this annexation to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson as he insisted on &quot;respect for nationalities&quot; in the Fourteen Points. He believed that the sentiments of the Turks &quot;will never accept this annexation&quot;.

Neither the Conference of London nor Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol&#x27;s report changed British prime minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s position. On 12 February 1921, he went with the annexation of the Aegean coast which was followed by the Greek offensive. David Lloyd George acted with his sentiments, which were developed during Battle of Gallipoli, as opposed to General Milne, who was his officer on the ground.

First negotiations between the sides failed during the Conference of London. The stage for peace was set after the Triple Entente&#x27;s decision to make an arrangement with the Turkish revolutionaries. Before the talks with the Entente, the Nationalists partially settled their eastern borders with the Democratic Republic of Armenia, signing the Treaty of Alexandropol, but changes in the Caucasus—especially the establishment of the Armenian SSR—required one more round of talks. The outcome was the Treaty of Kars, a successor treaty to the earlier Treaty of Moscow of March 1921. It was signed in Kars with the Russian SFSR on 13 October 1921 and ratified in Yerevan on 11 September 1922.

With the borders secured with treaties and agreements at east and south, Mustafa Kemal was now in a commanding position. On August 26, 1922, in the Battle of Dumlupınar, the Turks routed the Greek positions and launched the Great Offensive. The Nationalists demanded that the Greek army evacuate East Thrace, Imbros, and Tenedos as well as Asia Minor. Mustafa Kemal sent a telegram to his commanders: &quot;Armies! Your first goal is the Mediterranean, onwards!&quot; The Turks recaptured all of Greece&#x27;s gains in the span of three weeks, and resulted in the recapture of Smyrna by Turkish forces right after which occurred the great fire of Smyrna. Greece&#x27;s retreat from Anatolia saw its army committing scorched earth tactics and the depopulation of Muslim villages.

The British were prepared to defend the neutral zone of Constantinople and the Straits and the French asked Kemal to respect it, to which he agreed on 28 September. However, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, and the British Dominions objected to a new war. France, Italy and Britain called on Mustafa Kemal to enter into cease-fire negotiations. In return, on 29 September Kemal asked for the negotiations to be started at Mudanya. This was agreed on 11 October, two hours before the British intended to engage Nationalist forces at Çanak, and signed the next day. The Greeks initially refused to agree but did so on 13 October. Factors persuading Turkey to sign may have included the arrival of British reinforcements. With the British government and public firmly anti-war, the Chanak Crisis led to the collapse of David Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government.

==== Armistice of Mudanya ====

The Marmara sea resort town of Mudanya hosted the conference to arrange the armistice on 3 October 1922. İsmet Pasha—commander of the western armies—was in front of the Allies. The scene was unlike Mudros as the British and the Greeks were on the defence. Greece was represented by the Allies.

The British still expected the GNA to make concessions. From the first speech, the British were startled as Ankara demanded fulfillment of the National Pact. During the conference, the British troops in Constantinople were preparing for a Kemalist attack. There was never any fighting in Thrace, as Greek units withdrew before the Turks crossed the straits from Asia Minor. The only concession that İsmet made to the British was an agreement that his troops would not advance any farther toward the Dardanelles, which gave a safe haven for the British troops as long as the conference continued. The conference dragged on far beyond the original expectations. In the end, it was the British who yielded to Ankara&#x27;s advances.

The Armistice of Mudanya was signed on 11 October. By its terms, the Greek army would move west of the Maritsa, clearing eastern Thrace to the Allies. The famous American author Ernest Hemingway was in Thrace at the time, and he covered the evacuation of eastern Thrace of its Greek population. He has several short stories written about Thrace and Smyrna, which appear in his book &quot;In Our Time&quot;. The agreement came into force starting 15 October. Allied forces would stay in eastern Thrace for a month to assure law and order. In return, Ankara would recognise continued British occupation of Constantinople and the Straits zones until the final treaty was signed.

Refet Bele was assigned to seize control of eastern Thrace from the Allies. He was the first representative to reach the old capital. The British did not allow the hundred gendarmes who came with him. That resistance lasted until the next day.

== Outcome ==
=== Abolition of the sultanate ===
Kemal had long ago made up his mind to abolish the sultanate when the moment was ripe. After facing opposition from some members of the assembly, using his influence as a war hero, he managed to prepare a draft law for the abolition of the sultanate, which was then submitted to the National Assembly for voting. In that article, it was stated that the form of the government in Constantinople, resting on the sovereignty of an individual, had already ceased to exist when the British forces occupied the city after World War I. Furthermore, it was argued that although the caliphate had belonged to the Ottoman Empire, it rested on the Turkish state by its dissolution and Turkish National Assembly would have right to choose a member of the Ottoman family in the office of caliph. On 1 November, The Turkish Grand National Assembly voted to abolish the sultanate. Mehmed VI fled Turkey on 17 November 1922 on HMS Malaya; so ended the over 600 year-old monarchy. Ahmed Tevfik Pasha also resigned as Grand Vizier (Prime Minister) a couple days later, without a replacement.

=== Treaty of Lausanne ===
The Conference of Lausanne began on 21 November 1922 in Lausanne, Switzerland and lasted into 1923. Its purpose was the negotiation of a treaty to replace the Treaty of Sèvres, which, under the new government of the Grand National Assembly, was no longer recognised by Turkey. İsmet Pasha was the leading Turkish negotiator. İsmet maintained the basic position of the Ankara government that it had to be treated as an independent and sovereign state, equal with all other states attending the conference. In accordance with the directives of Mustafa Kemal, while discussing matters regarding the control of Turkish finances and justice, the Capitulations, the Turkish Straits and the like, he refused any proposal that would compromise Turkish sovereignty. Finally, after long debates, on 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed. Ten weeks after the signature the Allied forces left Istanbul.

The conference opened with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Turkey. It heard speeches from Benito Mussolini of Italy and Raymond Poincaré of France. At its conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the &quot;freedom of the straits&quot;, which was Britain&#x27;s main concern. The matter of the status of Mosul was deferred, since Curzon refused to be budged on the British position that the area was part of Iraq. The British Iraq Mandate&#x27;s possession of Mosul was confirmed by a League of Nations brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain in 1926. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of their goals and on 30 January 1923 issued a statement that they did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a &quot;basis of discussion&quot;. The Turks therefore refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to İsmet Pasha to sign, and when he refused the Foreign Secretary broke off negotiations and left that night on the Orient Express.

The Treaty of Lausanne, finally signed in July 1923, led to international recognition of the Grand National Assembly as the legitimate government of Turkey and sovereignty of the Republic of Turkey as the successor state to the defunct Ottoman Empire. Most goals on the condition of sovereignty were granted to Turkey. In addition to Turkey&#x27;s more favourable land borders compared with Treaty of Sèvres (as can be seen in the picture to the right), capitulations were abolished, the issue of Mosul would be decided by a League of Nations plebiscite in 1926, while the border with Greece and Bulgaria would become demilitarised. The Turkish Straits would be under an international commission which gave Turkey more of a voice (this arrangement would be replaced by the Montreux Convention in 1936). The Maritsa (Meriç) River would again become the western border of Turkey, as it was before 1914.

=== Establishment of the Republic ===

Turkey was proclaimed a Republic on 29 October 1923, with Mustafa Kemal Pasha was elected as the first President. In forming his government, he placed Mustafa Fevzi (Çakmak), Köprülü Kâzım (Özalp), and İsmet (İnönü) in important positions. They helped him to establish his subsequent political and social reforms in Turkey, transforming the country into a modern and secular nation state.

== Historiography ==

The orthodox Turkish perspective on the war is based primarily on the speeches (see Nutuk) and narratives of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a high-ranking officer in World War I and the leader of the Nationalist Movement. Kemal was characterized as the founder and sole leader of the Nationalist Movement. Potentially negative facts were omitted in the orthodox historiography. This interpretation had a tremendous impact on the perception of Turkish history, even by foreign researchers. The more recent historiography has come to understand the Kemalist version as a nationalist framing of events and movements leading to the republic&#x27;s founding. This was accomplished by sidelining unwanted elements which had links to the detested and genocidal CUP, and thus elevating Kemal and his policies.In the orthodox Turkish version of events, the Nationalist Movement broke with its defective past and took its strength from popular support led by Kemal, consequently giving him the surname &quot;Atatürk&quot;, meaning &quot;Father of Turks&quot;. According to historians such as Donald Bloxham, E.J. Zürcher, and Taner Akçam, this was not the case in reality, and a nationalist movement emerged through the backing of leaders of CUP, of whom many were war criminals, people who became wealthy with confiscated equities and they were not on trial for their crimes owing to the accelerating support for the National Movement. Kemalist figures, including many old members of the CUP, ended up writing the majority of the history of the war. The modern understanding in Turkey is greatly influenced by this nationalist and politically motivated history.

The claim that the Nationalist Movement emerged as a continuation of the CUP is based on the fact Nationalist leaders such as: Kâzım Karabekir and Fethi Okyar had been former members of the committee. However, their conduct during and after the war shows that various movements were competing with each other. Kazım Karabekir had Halil Kut (Enver Pasha&#x27;s uncle) deported from Anatolia during the war. Suspecting that he may reorganize the CUP through Enver Pasha&#x27;s directives, Mustafa Kemal appointed Ali Fuat Cebesoy as a representative to Moscow after learning Enver Pasha was lobbying in the RSFSR as he made promises to return Anatolia during Baku Congress. In July 1921 Enver Pasha organized a congress in Batumi for former CUP members who were now Grand National Assembly deputies. They intended to seize power and expected the Kemalists would lose the Battle of the Sakarya. Due to Enver&#x27;s leadership of the Basmachi movement and Djemal&#x27;s visit to Afghanistan, Fahri Pasha was appointed ambassador to Afghanistan to minimize their efforts; Turkey and Afghanistan signed a friendship treaty. After the war former high-ranking CUP members were semi-active in politics until they were purged following an alleged assassination attempt on Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s life. Former Finance minister Mehmed Cavid and Politician Ziya Hurşit were found guilty and executed and former members like Kâzım Karabekir were put on trial but acquitted 

According to Mesut Uyar, the Turkish War of Independence was also a civil war which took place in Southern Marmara, Western and Eastern Black Sea, and Central Anatolia regions. He states that its aspect as a civil war is pushed into the background in official and academic books as &#x27;revolts&#x27;. The losers of civil war who neither supported sultan nor Ankara Government, which they considered a continuation of CUP, did not consider themselves rebels. He further emphasizes that casualties and financial losses that occurred in the civil war is at least as catastrophic as the war that was fought against the enemies in other fronts. Thus, he concludes that the war was similar to the Russian Revolution.
Preference of the term &quot;Kurtuluş Savaşı&quot; (lit. Liberation War) has been criticized by Corry Guttstadt as it causes Turkey to be portrayed as &quot;a victim of imperialist forces&quot;. In this version of events, minority groups are depicted as a pawn used by these forces. Turkish Islamists, right-wing faction and also leftists regard this historical narrative to be legitimate. In fact, Ottoman Empire had joined the First World War with expansionist goals. The CUP government intended to expand the Empire into Central Asia. When they were defeated, however, they depicted themselves as the victims, even though war brought dire consequences for non-Muslim minorities. Guttstadt states that Turkish War of Independence, which was conducted against Armenian and Greek minorities, was an Islamist campaign as National Defense Committees were organizations founded with Islamist characteristics. On the other hand, the embrace of the Turkish War of Independence by Islamists is not common. During the war, Islamists such as Ottoman Shaykh al-Islām Mustafa Sabri accused the Ankara-based Nationalist Movement of being a rebellion against the caliphate and the monarchy. After the war, Islamists, disturbed by Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s secularist reforms in Republican Turkey, put forward various conspiracy theories to try to discredit both the war and Kemal, the commander-in-chief of the Turkish side.

However, from the Turkish perspective, the term &quot;Kurtuluş Savaşı&quot; is widely defended, as the overwhelming majority of Turks view the event as a liberation from a foreign occupation. A speech delivered by Mustafa Kemal on 24 April 1920, to the newly established Ankara government, summed up the Turkish perspective of the situation: &quot;It is known to all that the seat of the Caliphate and the Government is under temporary occupation by foreign forces and that our independence is greatly restricted. Submitting to these conditions would mean national acceptance of a slavery proposed to us by foreign powers.&quot; The Treaty of Sèvres further promoted the Turkish narrative of the need to &quot;liberate&quot; the country. Should no action be taken, the Turkish state would be reduced to rump state in central Anatolia under heavy foreign influence.

Armenian historian Richard G. Hovannisian writes that the Italians were &quot;currying favor&quot; with Turkish Nationalist forces by allowing &quot;clandestine sale and shipment of arms&quot; to them.

== Impact ==
=== Ethnic cleansing ===

Historian Erik Sjöberg concludes that &quot;It seems, in the end, unlikely that the Turkish Nationalist leaders, though secular in name, ever had any intention of allowing any sizeable non-Muslim minority to remain.&quot; According to Rıza Nur, one of the Turkish delegates at Lausanne, wrote that &quot;disposing of people of different races, languages and religions in our country is the most ... vital issue&quot;. Many Greek men were conscripted into unarmed labor battalions where the death rate sometimes exceeded 90 percent. Raymond Kévorkian states that &quot;removing non-Turks from the sanctuary of Anatolia continued to be one of&quot; the Turkish Nationalists&#x27; main activities after World War I. Preventing Armenians and other Christians from returning home, and therefore allowing their properties to be retained by those who had stolen them during the war, was a key factor in securing popular support for the Turkish Nationalist Movement. Christian civilians were subjected to forced deportation to expel them from the country, a policy that continued after the war. These deportations were similar to those employed during the Armenian Genocide and caused many deaths. Over 1 million Greeks were expelled as were all remaining Armenians in the areas of Diyarbekir, Mardin, Urfa, Harput, and Malatia—forced across the border into French-mandate Syria.

Vahagn Avedian argues that the Turkish War of Independence was not directed against the Allied Powers, but that its main objective was to get rid of non-Turkish minority groups. The Nationalist movement maintained the aggressive policy of the CUP against Christians. It was stated in a secret telegram from Foreign Minister Ahmet Muhtar (Mollaoğlu) to Kazım Karabekir in mid-1921 &quot;the most important thing is to eliminate Armenia, both politically and materially&quot;. Avedian holds that the existence of the Armenian Republic was considered as the &quot;greatest threat&quot; for the continuation of Turkish state, and that for this reason, they &quot;fulfilled the genocidal policy of its CUP predecessor&quot;. After the Christian population was destroyed, the focus shifted to the Kurdish population. Ethnic cleansing was also carried against Pontic Greeks with the collaboration with Ankara and Istanbul governments.

=== Turkey ===

The Grand National Assembly transitioned from a provisional counsel to being Turkey&#x27;s primary legislative body. In 1923, A-RMHC changed its name to the People&#x27;s Party. A couple years later, the name would be changed again by Mustafa Kemal to the Republican People&#x27;s Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi, CHP), one of Turkey&#x27;s major political parties as well as its oldest. CHP went on to rule Turkey as a one party state until the 1946 general election.

=== Aftermath of the Chanak Crisis ===
In addition to toppling the British government, the Chanak Crisis would have far reaching consequences on British dominion policy. As the Dominion of Canada did not see itself committed to support a potential British war with Kemal&#x27;s GNA, dominion foreign policy would become less committed for security for the British Empire. This attitude of no commitment to the Empire would be a defining moment in Canada&#x27;s gradual movement towards independence as well as the decline of the British Empire.

=== Influence on other nations ===

The media in Weimar Germany covered the events in Anatolia extensively. Ihrig argues that Turkish War of Independence had a more definite impact on the Beer Hall Putsch than Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome. Germans, including Adolf Hitler, wanted to abolish the Treaty of Versailles just like the Treaty of Sèvres was abolished. After the failed putsch media coverage on the war ceased.

<text>Higher education in Pakistan is the systematic process of students continuing their education beyond secondary school, learned societies and two-year colleges. The governance of higher education is maintained under the Higher Education Commission (Pakistan) (HEC) which oversees the financial funding, research outputs and teaching quality in the country. In Pakistan, the higher education system includes the public, private and military universities accredited by the HEC. Since independence, new universities have expanded throughout the country with support provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which had been an autonomous institution of recognizing universities until 2002 when it was preceded by the Higher Education Commission. Pakistan produces about 445,000 university graduates and 10,000 computer science graduates annually. Following public and private higher education institutions are active in the country:

<doc id="506889" wikidata="Q3624294" url="?curid=506889" title="Ed Clark">
<text>Edward E. Clark (born May 4, 1930) is an American lawyer and politician who ran for governor of California in 1978, and for president of the United States as the nominee of the Libertarian Party in the 1980 presidential election.

==Background==
Clark was born in Middleborough, Massachusetts, in 1930. He is an honors graduate of Tabor Academy, Dartmouth College, and received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School. He was in active service in the United States Navy from 1952 to 1954, as a lieutenant (junior grade), and was a reservist until 1965.

Clark worked as a corporate lawyer with ARCO, first in New York City and then in Los Angeles. Once a liberal Republican, he joined the Libertarian Party following President Richard Nixon&#x27;s imposition of wage and price controls in 1971. In 1972, he was the first chairman of the Libertarian Party of New York, and chaired the Libertarian Party of California from 1973 to 1974.

In 1970, Clark married Alicia Garcia, a Mexican-born textiles executive. She chaired the Libertarian National Committee from 1981 to 1983. The couple are longtime supporters of the Los Angeles Opera.

==1978 California gubernatorial campaign==
In 1978, Clark received some 377,960 votes, 5.5% of the popular vote, in a race for governor of California. Although a member of the Libertarian Party, he appeared on the California ballot as an independent candidate, due to ballot access laws.

Another factor leading to the unprecedented (for California) 5.5% vote total for Clark was his libertarian campaign occurring the same year as the successful Proposition 13 which limited property taxes, and the unsuccessful anti-gay Briggs Initiative (Proposition 6). Clark and the California Libertarian Party campaigned in support for Proposition 13 and in opposition to Proposition 6 both of which turned out people to the polls who might be more inclined to favor a libertarian candidate.

Clark lost the race to Jerry Brown, who was re-elected with 56.0% of the vote. Republican nominee Evelle J. Younger had 36.5% of the vote.

==1980 presidential campaign==
In 1979 Clark won the Libertarian Party presidential nomination at the party&#x27;s convention in Los Angeles, California. He published a book on his programs, &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, with an introduction by Eugene McCarthy. During the campaign, Clark positioned himself as a peace candidate and emphasized both large budget and tax cuts, as well as outreach to liberals and progressives unhappy with the resumption of Selective Service registration and the arms race with the Soviet Union. Clark was endorsed by the &quot;Peoria Journal Star&quot; of Peoria, Illinois.

When asked in a television interview to summarize libertarianism, Clark used the phrase &quot;low-tax liberalism,&quot; causing some consternation among traditional libertarian theorists, most notably Murray Rothbard. Clark&#x27;s running to the center marked the start of a split within the Libertarian Party between a moderate faction led by Ed Crane and a radical faction led by Rothbard that eventually came to a head in 1983, with the moderate faction walking out of the party convention after the nomination for the 1984 presidential race went to David Bergland.

Ed Clark&#x27;s running mate in 1980 was David H. Koch of Koch Industries, who pledged part of his personal fortune to the campaign for the vice-presidential nomination, enabling the Clark/Koch ticket to largely self-fund and run national television advertising.

Clark received 921,128 votes (1.1% of the total nationwide); the highest number and percentage of popular votes a Libertarian Party candidate had ever received in a presidential race up to that point. His strongest support was in Alaska, where he came in third place with 11.7% of the vote, finishing ahead of independent candidate John Anderson and receiving almost half as many votes as Jimmy Carter. Clark&#x27;s record for most votes won by a Libertarian presidential candidate stood for 32 years until it was broken by Gary Johnson in 2012. His Libertarian vote percentage of 1.1% ranks 3rd behind Johnson&#x27;s 3.3% showing in 2016 and Jo Jorgensen&#x27;s 1.2% performance in 2020.

<doc id="506902" wikidata="Q884687" url="?curid=506902" title="Blockade runner">
<text>A blockade runner is a merchant vessel used for evading a naval blockade of a port or strait. It is usually light and fast, using stealth and speed rather than confronting the blockaders in order to break the blockade. Blockade runners usually transport cargo, for example bringing food or arms to a blockaded city. They have also carried mail in an attempt to communicate with the outside world.

Blockade runners are often the fastest ships available, and come lightly armed and armored. Their operations are quite risky since blockading fleets would not hesitate to fire on them. However, the potential profits (economically or militarily) from a successful blockade run are tremendous, so blockade-runners typically had excellent crews. Although having &quot;modus operandi&quot; similar to that of smugglers, blockade-runners are often operated by states&#x27; navies as part of the regular fleet; states having operated them include the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and Germany during the World Wars.

== In history ==

=== Ancient Greece, Peloponnesian War ===

There were numerous blockades and attempts at blockade running during the Peloponnesian War. With his fleet blockaded, Leon of Salamis dispatched blockade runners to seek reinforcements from Athens.

=== Ancient Rome, Punic Wars ===
During the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian Empire attempted to evade Roman navy blockades of its ports and strongholds. At one point, blockade runners brought in the only food reaching the city of Carthage.

=== Middle age ===

During the 14th century, while Queen Margaret I of Denmark&#x27;s forces were besieging Stockholm, the blockade runners who came to be known as the Victual Brotherhood engaged in war at sea and shipped provisions to keep the city supplied.

=== American Revolutionary War ===
Blockade runners in the American Revolution eluded the British naval blockades in order to supply resources to the army. French naval aid was vital.

=== American Civil War ===

During the American Civil War, blockade running became a major enterprise for the Confederacy due to the Union blockade as part of the Anaconda Plan to cut off the Confederacy&#x27;s overseas trade. Twelve major ports and approximately 3,500 miles of coastline along the Confederacy were patrolled by roughly 500 Union Navy ships.

The United Kingdom played a major role in Confederate blockade running. British merchants had conducted significant amounts of trade with the South prior to the war, and were suffering from the Lancashire Cotton Famine. The British Empire also controlled many of the neutral ports in the Caribbean, most notably the Bahamas and Bermuda. In concert with Confederate interests, British investors ordered the construction of steamships that were longer, narrower and considerably faster than most of the conventional steamers guarding the American coastline, thus enabling them to outmaneuver and outrun blockaders. Among the more notable was the CSS Advance that completed more than 20 successful runs through the Union blockade before being captured. 

These vessels brought badly needed supplies, especially firearms, and Confederate mail. The blockade played a major role in the Union&#x27;s victory over the Confederate states, though historians have estimated the supplies brought by blockade runners to the Confederacy lengthened the duration of the war by up to two years. By the end of the American Civil War, Union warships had captured more than 1,100 blockade runners and had destroyed or run aground another 355.

=== Cretan Revolt (1866–1869) ===

Greek blockade runners supplied the Christians during the Cretan revolt (1866–1869). Names of the ships include: &quot;Arkadion&quot; (named after the Arkadi Monastery, sunk by the Ottoman sloop-of-war &quot;Izzedin&quot; in August 1867); &quot;Hydra&quot;; &quot;Panhellenion&quot;; and &quot;Enosis&quot; (Unification), which was detained in Syros by Hobart Pasha in December 1868, just about the time the rebellion collapsed.

=== Prohibition era ===
=== World War I ===

During World War I the Central Powers, most notably Germany, were blockaded by the Entente Powers. In particular the North Sea blockade made it nearly impossible for surface ships to leave Germany for the then neutral United States and other locations.

The blockade was run with cargo submarines, also called merchant submarines, &quot;Deutschland&quot; and &quot;Bremen&quot;, which reached the then neutral United States.

The &quot;Marie&quot; successfully ran the British North Sea blockade and docked, heavily damaged, in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now called Jakarta) on May 13, 1916.

In 1917 Germany tried unsuccessfully to supply their forces in Africa by sending Zeppelin LZ104.

=== World War II ===

==== Axis blockade runners ====
On the outbreak of war, the Royal Navy imposed a naval blockade of Germany. The fall of France provided the German occupying forces with access to the French Atlantic coast and between 1940 and 1942, many blockade running trips succeeded in delivering cargoes of critical war supplies - especially crude rubber - through the port of Bordeaux; a trade that increased with the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941. Allied attempts to disrupt these operations initially had only a limited effect; as in Operation Frankton. From 1943 improved Allied air superiority over the Bay of Biscay rendered blockade running by surface ships effectively impossible. By some counts, during the war Germans sent 32 (surface) blockade runners to Japan, only 16 of them reaching their destination. Later in the war, most of the trade between Germany and Japan was by cargo submarine.

Italian ships, interned in Spain after Italy entered the war in June 1940, crossed the Bay of Biscay to Bordeaux and some of them, such as &quot;Fidelitas&quot; and &quot;Eugenio C&quot;, dashed through the English Channel bound for Germany and Norway.

To transfer technology to Imperial Japan, on 25 March 1945 Nazi Germany dispatched a submarine, , to sail to Japan. Germany surrendered before it arrived. The Japanese submarine &quot;I-8&quot; completed a similar mission.

The German ship &quot;Ramses&quot; was in China when the war started. On Nov. 23, 1942, she attempted to sail from Batavia (now Jakarta), to Bordeaux with a cargo of rubber. The hope was that maintaining a sharp 24-hour lookout they could evade the Allied blockade. HMAS &quot;Adelaide&quot; (1918) caught and sank her.

A small number of planes succeeded in flying between the Axis-controlled Europe and the Japanese-controlled parts of Asia. The first known flight was by an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 &quot;Marsupiale&quot;, which flew in July 1942, according to various sources, either from Zaporozhye to Baotou or from Rhodes Island to Rangoon. Later, German Junkers Ju 290-A aircraft prepared for (or, according to some sources, completed) similar flights.

==== Allied blockade runners ====

During World War II, trade between Sweden (which remained neutral throughout the war) and Britain was severely curtailed by the German blockade of the Skagerrak straits between Norway and the northern tip of Denmark. In order to import vital &quot;materiel&quot; from Sweden, such as ball bearings for the British aircraft industry, five Motor Gun Boats, such as the &quot;Gay Viking&quot;, were converted into blockade runners, using winter darkness and high speed to penetrate the German maritime blockade. Larger Norwegian ships succeeded in escaping through the blockade to Britain in Operation Rubble but later attempts failed.

=== Modern era ===

In modern times, tracking equipment such as radar, sonar, and reconnaissance satellites make evading a total blockade by a world power nearly impossible. Drug smugglers and groups like the Tamil Tigers are able to run blockades due to the partial nature of the blockade, or because the navy imposing the blockade is weak and under-equipped. Reminiscent of earlier German attempts, drug smugglers have used semi-submersibles (narco-submarines) in their smuggling operations.

<text>Pierre Eugene du Simitiere (born Pierre-Eugène Ducimetière, ; 18 September 1737, Geneva – October 1784, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was a Genevan American member of the American Philosophical Society, naturalist, American patriot, and portrait painter.

Du Simitiere served as the artistic consultant for the committees that designed the Great Seal of the United States, and submitted the first proposed design to include the Eye of Providence and suggested the adoption of the U.S. motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (&quot;Out of Many, One&quot;).

==Biography==
Born in Geneva, du Simitiere&#x27;s original name was Pierre-Eugène Ducimetière or Pierre-Eugène du Cimetière. After leaving the Republic of Geneva, he spent more than a decade in the West Indies before moving to New York and then Philadelphia. He spelled his name Pierre-Eugène du Simitière, Pierre Eugene du Simitiere or du Symitiere after settling in Philadelphia. Elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1768, he further became one of its curators (1777–1781).

Du Simitiere served as the artistic consultant for the committees that designed the Great Seal of the United States, and in 1776 he submitted the first proposed design to include the Eye of Providence, which element was eventually adopted. Moreover, he suggested the adoption of the U.S. motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (&quot;Out of Many, One&quot;). He also designed the Seal of New Jersey, of Delaware, and of Georgia. In 1779, du Simitiere painted the first known portrait of George Washington, later used for the 1791 one-cent coin. In 1781, he was conferred an honorary degree from Princeton University (which was still called College of New Jersey until 1896). Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Martha took drawing lessons with du Simitiere.

Du Simitiere was the translator into French for the Letters to the inhabitants of Canada from the Continental Congress designed to draw the new British subjects of Quebec into the American Revolutionary War.

&quot;His early interest in natural history had expanded to embrace geography, geology, mineralogy, archeology, numismatics, and every aspect of American history, including aboriginal, general, local, political, social, and cultural history. He collected books in English and other languages and was a bibliographer of skill and breadth. He accumulated pamphlets, newspapers, handbills, and every other kind of political publication. He strove to record the history of the Colonies, including their differences with England and their eventual struggle for independence. Perhaps oddly for a collector, he was generous in lending books and other materials from his collections. In 1781 the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) granted him an honorary degree of Master of Arts.

&quot;All the while he continued to practice his profession of artist and painter, from which he earned a precarious living. He drew designs for a variety of state, local, and institutional seals. He drew maps, frontispieces, and technical illustrations for publications. He did pencil, chalk, and water-color portraits for a fee — though he seems not to have worked in oil. He seized every opportunity to sketch from life the notables, both American and British, who came to Philadelphia; and more often than not his sketches went into his own collection.

&quot;His great personal vision embraced the founding of an American museum and the compiling of a history of the Colonies. In his efforts to achieve his objectives, he fought a constant battle with poverty and with the lack of interest of persons who might have helped him gather materials. In a measure he realized his vision briefly in his &#x27;American Museum,&#x27; located in a house in Arch Street above 4th, which he advertised as early as September 1782. But the history was never written; he died destitute, and his collections were sold to pay his debts. He is now regarded as the founder of the first history museum in the United States.&quot;

==Other events==
===First American museum of natural history===
He created the first American museum of natural history from his personal collections constituted during his travels and through his purchases. He opened it to the public in 1782, four years before Charles Willson Peale&#x27;s Philadelphia Museum, which is generally considered the first American public museum of natural history.

===First coin auction sale in America===
His coin collection was the first record in Early American history to serve as collateral on a loan granted to him by William Dilwyn. This collection later on was sold at public auction by Matthew Clarkson and Ebenezer Hazard, on March 19, 1785 at Philadelphia. Included in the sale as Lot #19 was &quot;A Mahogany cabinet containing ancient and modern Gold, Silver, and Copper Coins and Medals.&quot; This sale precedes all sales in Atinelli&#x27;s Numisgraphics by 43 years and is considered to be the first known coin auction sale in America. An advertisement for this sale reposes in the Archives of the Library Company of Philadelphia.

Du Simitiere has living descendants throughout Switzerland, France, and the US.

=== In a letter to his wife on August 14, 1776, John Adams wrote ===
&quot;This Mr. du Simitière is a very curious Man. He has begun a Collection of Materials for an History of this Revolution. He begins with the first Advices of the Tea Ships. He cuts out of the Newspapers, every Scrap of Intelligence, and every Piece of Speculation, and pastes it upon clean Paper, arranging them under the Head of the State to which they belong and intends to bind them up in Volumes. He has a List of every Speculation and Pamphlet concerning Independence, and another of those concerning Forms of Government.&quot;

<doc id="506906" wikidata="Q1511415" url="?curid=506906" title="Density of air">
<text>The density of air or atmospheric density, denoted &quot;ρ&quot;, is the mass per unit volume of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Air density, like air pressure, decreases with increasing altitude. It also changes with variations in atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity. At 101.325 kPa (abs) and 20 °C (68 °F), air has a density of approximately , according to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). At 101.325kPa (abs) and , air has a density of approximately , which is about that of water, according to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). Pure liquid water is .

Air density is a property used in many branches of science, engineering, and industry, including aeronautics; gravimetric analysis; the air-conditioning industry; atmospheric research and meteorology; agricultural engineering (modeling and tracking of Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) models); and the engineering community that deals with compressed air.

Depending on the measuring instruments used, different sets of equations for the calculation of the density of air can be applied. Air is a mixture of gases and the calculations always simplify, to a greater or lesser extent, the properties of the mixture.

==Temperature==
Other things being equal (most notably the pressure and humidity), hotter air is less dense than cooler air and will thus rise while cooler air tends to fall. This can be seen by using the ideal gas law as an approximation.

==Dry air==

The density of dry air can be calculated using the ideal gas law, expressed as a function of temperature and pressure:
formula_1

where:

*formula_2, air density (kg/m3)
*formula_3, absolute pressure (Pa)
*formula_4, absolute temperature (K)
*formula_5 is the gas constant, in J⋅K−1⋅mol−1 
*formula_6 is the molar mass of dry air, approximately in kg⋅mol−1.
*formula_7 is the Boltzmann constant, in J⋅K−1
*formula_8 is the molecular mass of dry air, approximately in kg.
*formula_9, the specific gas constant for dry air, which using the values presented above would be approximately in J⋅kg−1⋅K−1.

Therefore:
* At IUPAC standard temperature and pressure (0°C and 100kPa), dry air has a density of approximately 1.2754kg/m3.
* At 20°C and 101.325kPa, dry air has a density of 1.2041 kg/m3.
* At 70°F and 14.696psi, dry air has a density of 0.074887lb/ft3.

The following table illustrates the air density–temperature relationship at 1 atm or 101.325 kPa:
==Humid air==
The addition of water vapor to air (making the air humid) reduces the density of the air, which may at first appear counter-intuitive. This occurs because the molar mass of water vapor (18g/mol) is less than the molar mass of dry air (around 29g/mol). For any ideal gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules is constant for a particular volume (see Avogadro&#x27;s Law). So when water molecules (water vapor) are added to a given volume of air, the dry air molecules must decrease by the same number, to keep the pressure from increasing or temperature from decreasing. Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas (its density) decreases.

The density of humid air may be calculated by treating it as a mixture of ideal gases. In this case, the partial pressure of water vapor is known as the vapor pressure. Using this method, error in the density calculation is less than 0.2% in the range of −10 °C to 50 °C. The density of humid air is found by:
formula_10

where:
*formula_11, density of the humid air (kg/m3)
*formula_12, partial pressure of dry air (Pa)
*formula_13, specific gas constant for dry air, 287.058J/(kg·K)
*formula_4, temperature (K)
*formula_15, pressure of water vapor (Pa)
*formula_16, specific gas constant for water vapor, 461.495J/(kg·K)
*formula_17, molar mass of dry air, 0.0289652kg/mol
*formula_18, molar mass of water vapor, 0.018016kg/mol
*formula_5, universal gas constant, 8.31446J/(K·mol)

The vapor pressure of water may be calculated from the saturation vapor pressure and relative humidity. It is found by:
formula_20

where:
*formula_15, vapor pressure of water
*formula_22, relative humidity (0.0–1.0)
*formula_23, saturation vapor pressure

The saturation vapor pressure of water at any given temperature is the vapor pressure when relative humidity is 100%. One formula is Tetens&#x27; equation from used to find the saturation vapor pressure is:
formula_24
where:
*formula_23, saturation vapor pressure (kPa)
*formula_4, temperature (K)

See vapor pressure of water for other equations.

The partial pressure of dry air formula_12 is found considering partial pressure, resulting in:
formula_28
where formula_3 simply denotes the observed absolute pressure.

==Variation with altitude==

===Troposphere===
To calculate the density of air as a function of altitude, one requires additional parameters. For the troposphere, the lowest part (~10 km) of the atmosphere, they are listed below, along with their values according to the International Standard Atmosphere, using for calculation the universal gas constant instead of the air specific constant:

*formula_30, sea level standard atmospheric pressure, 101325Pa
*formula_31, sea level standard temperature, 288.15K
*formula_32, earth-surface gravitational acceleration, 9.80665m/s2
*formula_33, temperature lapse rate, 0.0065K/m
*formula_5, ideal (universal) gas constant, 8.31446J/(mol·K)
*formula_6, molar mass of dry air, 0.0289652kg/mol

Temperature at altitude formula_36 meters above sea level is approximated by the following formula (only valid inside the troposphere, no more than ~18km above Earth&#x27;s surface (and lower away from Equator)):
formula_37

The pressure at altitude formula_36 is given by:
formula_39

Density can then be calculated according to a molar form of the ideal gas law:
formula_40

where:
*formula_6, molar mass
*formula_5, ideal gas constant
*formula_4, absolute temperature
*formula_3, absolute pressure

Note that the density close to the ground is formula_45

It can be easily verified that the hydrostatic equation holds:
formula_46

====Exponential approximation====
As the temperature varies with height inside the troposphere by less than 25%, formula_47 and one may approximate:
formula_48

Thus:
formula_49

Which is identical to the isothermal solution, except that &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;, the height scale of the exponential fall for density (as well as for number density n), is not equal to &quot;RT&quot;0/&quot;gM&quot; as one would expect for an isothermal atmosphere, but rather:
formula_50

Which gives &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 10.4km.

Note that for different gasses, the value of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; differs, according to the molar mass &quot;M&quot;: It is 10.9 for nitrogen, 9.2 for oxygen and 6.3 for carbon dioxide. The theoretical value for water vapor is 19.6, but due to vapor condensation the water vapor density dependence is highly variable and is not well approximated by this formula.

The pressure can be approximated by another exponent:
formula_51

Which is identical to the isothermal solution, with the same height scale . Note that the hydrostatic equation no longer holds for the exponential approximation (unless &quot;L&quot; is neglected).

&quot;H&quot;&quot;p&quot; is 8.4km, but for different gasses (measuring their partial pressure), it is again different and depends upon molar mass, giving 8.7 for nitrogen, 7.6 for oxygen and 5.6 for carbon dioxide.

====Total content====
Further note that since &quot;g&quot;, Earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration, is approximately constant with altitude in the atmosphere, the pressure at height &quot;h&quot; is proportional to the integral of the density in the column above &quot;h&quot;, and therefore to the mass in the atmosphere above height &quot;h&quot;. Therefore, the mass fraction of the troposphere out of all the atmosphere is given using the approximated formula for &quot;p&quot;:
formula_52

For nitrogen, it is 75%, while for oxygen this is 79%, and for carbon dioxide, 88%.

===Tropopause===
Higher than the troposphere, at the tropopause, the temperature is approximately constant with altitude (up to ~20km) and is 220K. This means that at this layer and , so that the exponential drop is faster, with for air (6.5 for nitrogen, 5.7 for oxygen and 4.2 for carbon dioxide). Both the pressure and density obey this law, so, denoting the height of the border between the troposphere and the tropopause as &quot;U&quot;:

<text>An STR multiplex system is used to identify specific short tandem repeats (STRs). STR polymorphisms are genetic markers that may be used to identify a DNA sequence.

The FBI analyses 13 specific STR loci for their database. These may be used in many areas of genetics in addition to their forensic uses.

One can think of a STR multiplex system as a collection of specific STRs which are positionally conserved on a target genome. Hence these can be used as markers. A number of different STRs along with their loci in a particular genome can be used for genotyping. 

For example, the STR multiplex system AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus which analyses nine different STRs (3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820) plus Amelogenin for sex determination is used for human identification purposes.

<doc id="506916" wikidata="Q285268" url="?curid=506916" title="Eye of Providence">
<text>The Eye of Providence or All-Seeing Eye is a symbol depicting an eye, often enclosed in a triangle and surrounded by rays of light or a halo, intended to represent Providence, as the eye watches over the workers of mankind. A well-known example of the Eye of Providence appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, which is depicted on the United States one-dollar bill.

== Use by governments and confederations ==

=== United States ===
In 1782, the Eye of Providence was adopted as part of the symbolism featured on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States. It was first proposed as an element of the Great Seal by the first of three design committees in 1776, and it is thought to be the suggestion of the artistic consultant Pierre Eugene du Simitiere. At the time, it was a conventional symbol for God’s benevolent oversight.

In his original proposal to the committee, du Simitiere placed the Eye over shields so as to symbolize each of the original thirteen states of the Union. On the version of the seal that would eventually be approved, the Eye is positioned above an unfinished pyramid of thirteen steps (again symbolizing the original States, but also incorporating the nation&#x27;s potential for future growth). Such symbolism is explained through the motto that appears above the Eye, &quot;annuit cœptis&quot;, meaning &quot;He approves [our] undertakings&quot; (or &quot;has approved&quot;).

Perhaps due to its use in the design of the Great Seal, the Eye has made its way into other American seals and logos, such as, for example:

*The Seal of Colorado
* The city seal of Kenosha, Wisconsin
*DARPA&#x27;s Information Awareness Office

==== U.S. currency ====
The Eye of Providence has been used among various forms of currency throughout U.S. history, including:

*the United States one-dollar bill, as part of the Great Seal
* the Vermont Copper
*Nova Constellatio patterns of 1783
* Nova Constellatio coppers of 1783 and 1785
* some Immune Columbia issues

=== Lithuania ===
The Eye of Providence appears on several Lithuanian coats of arms, including those of:

* Alovė
* Baisogala
* Kalvarija
* Plungė (and its flag)
* Šiauliai (and its flag)

=== Other countries ===
The Eye of Providence appears on the coats of arms of Victoria, Canada; Brasłaŭ, Belarus; Neman, Russia; Radekhiv, Ukraine; and Radzymin and Wilamowice, Poland. The Eye was also part of the flag and coat of arms adopted by the Confederation of the Equator, a short-lived 1824 secessionist revolt in the northeastern provinces of Brazil. In the United Kingdom, the symbol was part of the Guards Division insignia, created in 1915.

In Estonia, the 50 krooni note shows the Eye as part of a depiction of the pipe organ of the Käina church. Likewise, the (old) 500 Ukrainian hryvnia note also depicts the Eye.

The Eye was included in the original publication of France&#x27;s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which also borrows iconography from the Ten Commandments. Similarly, the symbol is featured on the front page of the Constitution of Serbia from 1835.
In Nigeria, the eye symbol is part of the Nigeria Customs Service logo.

== Freemasonry ==

Commonly, the Eye of Providence is often associated with Freemasonry, first appearing as part of the standard Freemason iconography in 1797 with the publication of Thomas Smith Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Freemason&#x27;s Monitor&quot;. 

In this use, the Eye, representing the all-seeing eye of God, serves as a reminder that humanity&#x27;s thoughts and deeds are always observed by God—who is referred to in Masonry as the Great Architect of the Universe. Typically, the Masonic Eye of Providence has a semicircular glory below it, and is sometimes enclosed by a triangle.

Popular among conspiracy theorists is the claim that the Eye of Providence shown atop an unfinished pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States indicates the influence of Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. However, common Masonic use of the Eye dates to 14 years after the creation of the Great Seal. Furthermore, the only Mason among the members of the various design committees for the Great Seal was Benjamin Franklin, whose ideas for the seal were not adopted. Likewise, various Masonic organizations have explicitly denied any connection to the creation of the Seal.

== Use in religion ==

=== Christianity ===

The association of an eye with the concept of Divine Providence is found in Christianity. In late Renaissance European iconography, the Eye, surrounded by a triangle, was an explicit symbol of the Christian Holy Trinity. The Eye of Providence was later painted above an image of three faces in Pontormo&#x27;s 1525 &quot;Supper at Emmaus&quot;. Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or sunbursts. The Eye of God in a triangle is still used in church architecture and Christian art to symbolize the Trinity and God&#x27;s omnipresence and divine providence. 

The Eye of Providence is notably featured on the following buildings of the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:

*The Mannheim Jesuit Church in Mannheim, Germany
*The Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Russia
*The Shio-Mgvime Monastery in Mtskheta, Georgia
*The Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah

=== University/college insignia and logos of organisations ===
Several universities and college fraternities use the Eye of Providence in their coats of arms, seals, or badges, notably: 

* Delta Tau Delta based in Fishers, Indiana
* Phi Kappa Psi based in Indianapolis, Indiana 
* Phi Delta Theta based in Oxford, Ohio
* Delta Kappa Epsilon based in Ann Arbor, Michigan
* Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey
* The University of Chile in Santiago, Chile
* The University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi

<text>The 2003 United Kingdom local elections were held on Thursday 1 May 2003, the same day as the Scottish Parliamentary and the Welsh Assembly elections. There were local elections for all councils in Scotland and in most of England. There were no local elections in Wales, Northern Ireland or London.

The ruling Labour Party lost a considerable 833 seats, while both the main opposition parties, Conservative and Liberal Democrat, polled strongly, with the Conservatives enjoying the largest share of the vote. Labour had now been in government for six years and still had a triple-digit majority, and over the summer of 2003 some opinion polls showed the Conservatives level with Labour. However, these were to be the last of the two local council elections contested by the Conservatives under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith, who was ousted as leader later in the year and succeeded by Michael Howard due to his unpopularity as leader and doubts about his ability to win a general election.

Fifty-nine councils held electoral pilot schemes to try to boost turnout figures. Schemes included all postal voting, mobile polling stations, alterations to voting hours and various kinds of electronic voting. The most successful in raising turnout was all-postal voting which saw turnout rise to an average of 50%. In comparison, turnout across the whole of England was only 33%.

==Summary of results==
The Labour party lost a considerable 833 seats, losing control of councils such as Birmingham and Coventry, both of which the party had controlled for 20 years.

The Conservative party, who following the elections had the most councillors in the country (ahead of Labour by 601), extended its lead over the Labour party by 1,399 councillors. However, their celebrations were tempered by the resignation of Conservative front bencher Crispin Blunt, who described the party leader, Iain Duncan Smith as a &quot;handicap&quot; and called for him to be replaced.

==England==

===Metropolitan boroughs===
All 36 English Metropolitan borough councils had one third of their seats up for election.

===Unitary authorities===

====Whole council====
In 27 English Unitary authorities the whole council was up for election.
‡ New ward boundaries

====Third of council====
In 13 English Unitary authorities one third of the council was up for election.

===District councils===

====Whole council====
In 150 English district authorities the whole council was up for election.
‡ New ward boundaries

====Third of council====
In 82 English district authorities one third of the council was up for election.

==Scotland==
All 32 Scottish unitary authorities held elections. They were held at the same time as the 2003 Scottish Parliament election.

<doc id="506922" wikidata="Q437417" url="?curid=506922" title="Cunobeline">
<text>Cunobeline or Cunobelin (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Cunobelinos&quot;, &quot;Dog-Strong&quot;), also known by his name&#x27;s Latin form , was a king in pre-Roman Britain from about to about He is mentioned in passing by the classical historians Suetonius and Dio Cassius, and many coins bearing his inscription have been found. He controlled a substantial portion of southeastern Britain, including the territories of the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes, and he was called &quot;King of the Britons&quot; (&quot;Britannorum rex&quot;) by Suetonius. Cunobeline may have been a client king of Rome, based on the images and legends appearing on his coins. Cunobeline appears in British legend as Cynfelyn (Welsh), Kymbelinus (medieval Latin) or Cymbeline, as in the play by William Shakespeare.

==Etymology==
His name is a compound composed of the Common Brittonic &quot;*cuno-&quot; &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;*belino-&quot; &quot;strong&quot;, meaning &quot;Strong as a Dog,&quot; or &quot;Strong Dog.&quot;

==History==
From numismatic evidence, Cunobelinus appears to have taken power around AD 9 after the death of his father Tasciovanus, minting coins from both Camulodunum (Colchester, capital of the Trinovantes) and Verlamion (later the Roman town of Verulamium, now modern St Albans), capital of the Catuvellauni. Some Verulamium coins call him the son of Tasciovanus, a previous king of the Catuvellauni. Some Tasciovanus&#x27; coins bear the title , a derivative of the Brittonic root &quot;*rīgo-&quot; meaning &quot;king&quot;. Unlike his father&#x27;s, Cunobelinus&#x27; coins name no co-rulers. His earliest issues are, however, from Camulodunum, indicating that he took power there first, and some have a palm or laurel wreath design, a motif borrowed from the Romans indicating a military victory. It is possible that, following the Roman defeat in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in Germania in AD 9, he was emboldened to act against the Trinovantes. The Trinovantes were a Roman ally whose independence was protected by a treaty with Julius Caesar in 54 BC. Still, problems in Germania severely discouraged Augustus&#x27;s territorial ambitions and ability to defend allies in Britain.

Cunobelinus appears to have maintained quite good relations with the Roman Empire. He used the title (Latin &#x27;king&#x27;) and classical motifs on his coins, and his reign saw increased trade with the continent. Archaeology shows an increase in luxury goods imported from the continent, including Italian wine and drinking vessels, olive oil, and fish sauces from Hispania, glassware, jewellery, and Gallo-Belgic tableware, which from their distribution appear to have entered Britain via the port of Camulodunum. According to Strabo, he was probably one of the British kings who sent embassies to Augustus. Strabo reports Rome&#x27;s lucrative trade with Britain: the island&#x27;s exports included grain, gold, silver, iron, hides, slaves, and hunting dogs.

Cunobelinus had three sons, Adminius, Togodumnus and Caratacus, and a brother, Epaticcus, known to history. Epaticcus expanded his influence into the territory of the Atrebates in the early 20s, taking the Atrebatan capital Calleva (Silchester) by about 25. He continued to expand his territory until he died at about 35 when Caratacus took over from him and the Atrebates recovered some of their territories.

Adminius, judging by his coins, had control of Kent by this time. Suetonius tells us that in about 40, he was banished from Britain by his father and sought refuge with the emperor Caligula. Caligula treated this as if the entire island had submitted to him and prepared an invasion of Britain. He abandoned it, however, in farcical circumstances by ordering his soldiers to attack the waves and gather seashells as the spoils of victory.

Cunobelinus died about 40, probably within a year of that date. Indeed, he was dead by 43. The Lexden Tumulus on the outskirts of Colchester has been suggested as his tomb (although the earlier Trinovantian king Addedomarus is another candidate for its occupant). Caratacus completed the conquest of the Atrebates, and their king, Verica, fled to Rome, providing the new emperor, Claudius, with a pretext for the conquest of Britain. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the initial resistance to the invasion. Dio Cassius tells us that the &quot;Bodunni&quot;, a tribe who were tributary to the Catuvellauni, changed sides and supported the Romans. This is probably a misspelling of the Dobunni of Gloucestershire, indicating that Cunobelinus&#x27;s hegemony extended beyond the West Country.

Based on epigraphic evidence, it is possible that Sallustius Lucullus, the Roman governor of Britain in the late 1st century, was his grandson.

==Legend and literature==

Cunobelinus&#x27;s memory was preserved in British legend and beyond. In the early 9th century, in &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Cunobeline appears as &quot;Bellinus,&quot; son of &quot;Minocannus,&quot; and is described as a British king in the time of Julius Caesar. The names of Cunobeline and his son Adminius probably became corrupt due to a series of scribal errors in the transmission of the name from Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Life of Caligula&quot; to Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Historia adversus Paganos&quot;, the latter of which was a primary source for the author of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;:

# Suetonius, &quot;Caligula&quot;, Ch.44 (early 2nd century): &quot;Adminio, Cynobellini Brittannorum regis filio&quot;.
# Orosius, &quot;Historia adversus Paganos&quot;, vii.5.5 (early 5th century): &quot;Minocynobellinum Britannorum regis filium&quot;.
# &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, §19 (early 9th century): &quot;Bellinus, filius Minocanni&quot;.

In the Welsh Triads and medieval literature such as &quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot;, the &quot;Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot;, and &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;, the Historia Brittonum&#x27;s &quot;Bellinus son of Minocannus&quot; was transformed into Welsh as &quot;Beli Mawr&quot; (&quot;Beli the Great&quot;) son of &quot;Mynogan&quot; (also spelled &quot;Manogan&quot;). Beli, son of Mynogan/Managan, also appears in several medieval Welsh genealogies.

A mid-10th century genealogy preserved in the medieval Welsh manuscript &quot;Harleian 3859&quot; contains three generations which read &quot;Caratauc map Cinbelin map Teuhant&quot;. This is the equivalent of &quot;Caratacus, son of Cunobelinus, son of Tasciovanus,&quot; putting the three historical figures in the correct order. However, the wrong historical context and the degree of linguistic change suggest a long period of oral transmission. The remainder of the genealogy contains the names of a sequence of Roman emperors and two Welsh mythological figures, Guidgen (Gwydion) and Lou (Lleu).

In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (composed around 1136,) Cunobeline appears multiple times. Geoffrey borrowed the &quot;Historia Brittonum&#x27;s&quot; Bellinus and styles him as the general of Cassibelanus (i.e., Cassivellaunus) in his wars against Caesar (in the Welsh translations of Geoffrey&#x27;s Historia, the Brut y Brenhinedd, Bellinus becomes &quot;Beli&quot;, steward of &quot;Caswallawn&quot;). The next appearance in Geoffrey&#x27;s Historia is as Heli (son of Cligueillus), the father of the three brothers Cassibellanus, Lud, and Nennius, who reigned for forty years (in the Welsh translations, &quot;Beli Mawr&quot; is substituted for Geoffrey&#x27;s Heli.) He then appears as Kymbelinus, son of Tenvantius, a mighty warrior raised in the courts of Augustus. He was very friendly with the Roman court: his country was equipped with Roman weapons, and all tributes to Rome were paid out of respect, not requirement. He had two sons, Guiderius and Arvirargus. Guiderius succeeded him but died in the early stages of Claudius&#x27;s invasion, leaving Arvirargus to carry on the fight.

Geoffrey&#x27;s story was incorporated into Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; in 1577, where it was found by William Shakespeare and used as the basis of his romance, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Beyond the name, there is virtually nothing in common between Cymbeline&#x27;s figure and the historical Cunobelinus. The king, under the influence of his wicked second wife, forbids his daughter Imogen to marry Posthumus Leonatus, a low-born but worthy man, preferring that she marry his boorish stepson Cloten, leading to mistaken identity, jealousy caused by false accusations of infidelity and war with Rome provoked by the withholding of tribute, again at the instigation of the queen. In the end, peace between Britain and Rome is re-established, and Cymbeline is reunited with his two sons, Guiderius and Arviragus, who were abducted in childhood by Belarius, a wrongly banished nobleman. Imogen is reconciled with Posthumus. Cloten and his mother, the evil queen, get their just deserts.

<text>Jeffrey Alan Combs (born September 9, 1954) is an American actor. He is best known for starring as Herbert West in the &quot;Re-Animator&quot; film series (1985–2003) and portraying multiple characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, most notably the serially cloned character Weyoun and Brunt on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1994–1999), and Thy&#x27;lek Shran on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2001–2005).

Combs has been a prominent figure within the horror genre through most of his career, acting in eight films directed by &quot;Re-Animator&quot; director Stuart Gordon, such as &quot;From Beyond&quot; (1986), &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1991) and &quot;Castle Freak&quot; (1995). His other horror film appearances include &quot;Necronomicon&quot; (1993), Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996), &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1998), &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (1999) and &quot;Would You Rather&quot; (2012). As a voice actor, he is best known as the voice of Question on &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2004–2006) and Ratchet on &quot;&quot; (2010–2013).

==Early life==
Combs was born in Oxnard, California, the fifth of nine children born to Jean Owens (formerly Sullins; 1921–1986) and Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Combs (1922–1999), and raised in Lompoc. Both of his parents were from the Ozarks region of Arkansas. A graduate of Lompoc High School, as a senior, Combs played the lead role of Captain Fisby in a stage production of &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot;. Combs then attended Santa Maria&#x27;s Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, and later developed his acting skills in the Professional Actor&#x27;s Training Program at the University of Washington.

In 1980, after several years performing in playhouses on the West Coast, Combs moved to Los Angeles. He landed his first role in the film &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot; (1981), playing an unnamed drive-in teller. His first horror film role came two years later in &quot;Frightmare&quot; (1983).

==Career==
Combs&#x27;s best-known horror role is Herbert West, the main character in the film &quot;Re-Animator&quot; (1985), and its two sequels. He portrayed author H. P. Lovecraft (creator of the Herbert West character) in the film &quot;Necronomicon: Book of the Dead&quot; (1993) and has starred in eight adaptations of Lovecraft&#x27;s works. Other film credits include &quot;The Attic Expeditions&quot; (2001), &quot;FeardotCom&quot; (2002), &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996).

Combs has had roles in many science fiction television series. He starred as the telepath Harriman Gray in first-season episode &quot;Eyes&quot; (1994) of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. In 2001, he played the sinister Dr. Ek in &quot;The Attic Expeditions&quot;. In August 2005, he appeared for the first time on the science fiction series &quot;The 4400&quot; as Dr. Kevin Burkhoff which had become a recurring role by 2006. In early 2007, he played a highly fictionalized Edgar Allan Poe in &quot;The Black Cat&quot; episode of &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;. In the 2012 miniseries &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot; (sometimes called &quot;The Witches of Oz&quot;), he had a small role as a highly fictionalized L. Frank Baum.

Combs has also worked as a voiceover artist. His voiceover roles include the Scarecrow in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, the Question in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, Ratchet in &quot;&quot;, the Leader in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;, the Rat King in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and Brainiac in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;. He also narrated the 25th anniversary of &quot;Re-Animator&quot; at the 2010 FanTasia.

In July 2009, Combs returned to his stage roots and reprised his role as Edgar Allan Poe in a one-man theatrical show, &quot;Nevermore...an Evening with Edgar Allan Poe,&quot; at The Steve Allen Theater in Hollywood, California. Although it was supposed to run for only a month, it enjoyed much success and sold-out crowds, and was extended four times, until closing in Los Angeles on December 19, 2009. The show had its East Coast debut on January 23 and 24, 2010 at Westminster Hall in Baltimore, MD, Poe&#x27;s final resting place. A tour of the Saturn Award-nominated &quot;Nevermore&quot; was subsequently planned.

Combs starred with Andrew Divoff in the 2012 Screen Media Films release &quot;Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation&quot;, a prequel to the 2006 film &quot;Night of the Living Dead 3D&quot; directed by Jeff Broadstreet. In 2012, he also played the sadistic Dr. Lambrick in another horror-thriller, &quot;Would You Rather&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
On television, Combs enjoyed popular success playing a number of alien characters on the various modern &quot;Star Trek&quot; incarnations, beginning with &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; in 1994, and continuing to &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in 2000, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; in 2021. He has played nine onscreen roles in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. His largest science-fiction role to date was his regular guest role on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as the Vorta clone Weyoun. Combs has said that Weyoun was his favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; role, and that he had considerable input in developing the character.

On the same series, Combs had a recurring role as the Ferengi character Brunt. During the &quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, he appeared as both Weyoun and Brunt, becoming one of the few &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors to play two characters in the same episode (others including Patrick Stewart and Brian Markinson). Combs wanted the characters to appear in the same scene, but the logistics and expense worked against it.

On &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Combs had a recurring role as Shran, an Andorian military officer. &quot;Enterprise&quot; producer Manny Coto once said in an interview that he had hoped to make Combs a regular on &quot;Enterprise&quot; had the series been renewed for a fifth season.

In addition to his recurring &quot;Star Trek&quot; roles, Combs had non-recurring roles as human police officer Kevin Mulkahey, alien Tiron on &quot;Deep Space Nine,&quot; alien Penk on &quot;Voyager,&quot; and Ferengi pirate Krem on &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Along with many other actors, writers and creators of the show, Combs also had a cameo appearance as a holographic patron in Vic&#x27;s Lounge in the final episode of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. He also voices the character of Romulan Commander Suldok for the &quot;Star Trek: Elite Force II&quot; video game. In 2021, he had a guest voice role as AGIMUS, an evil computer, in episode 7, season 2 of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;, which he reprised in seasons 3 and 4.

<doc id="506924" wikidata="Q272042" url="?curid=506924" title="Denise Levertov">
<text>Priscilla Denise Levertov (24 October 1923 – 20 December 1997) was a British-born naturalised American poet. She was heavily influenced by the Black Mountain poets and by the political context of the Vietnam War, which she explored in her poetry book &quot;The Freeing of the Dust&quot;. She was a recipient of the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry.

==Early life and influences==
Levertov was born and grew up in Ilford, Essex, England. Her mother, Beatrice Adelaide (née Spooner-Jones) Levertoff, came from a small mining village in North Wales. Her father, Paul Levertoff, had been a teacher at Leipzig University and as a Russian Hasidic Jew was held under house arrest during the First World War as an &quot;enemy alien&quot; by virtue of his ethnicity. He emigrated to the UK and became an Anglican priest after converting to Christianity. In the mistaken belief that he would want to preach in a Jewish neighbourhood, he was housed in Ilford, within reach of a parish in Shoreditch, in East London. His daughter wrote: &quot;My father&#x27;s Hasidic ancestry, his being steeped in Jewish and Christian scholarship and mysticism, his fervour and eloquence as a preacher, were factors built into my cells.&quot; Levertov, who was educated at home, showed an enthusiasm for writing from an early age and studied ballet, art, piano and French as well as standard subjects. She wrote about the strangeness she felt growing up part Jewish, German, Welsh and English, but not fully belonging to any of these identities. She notes that it lent her a sense of being special rather than excluded: &quot;[I knew] before I was ten that I was an artist-person and I had a destiny.&quot; She noted: &quot;Humanitarian politics came early into my life: seeing my father on a soapbox protesting Mussolini&#x27;s invasion of Abyssinia; my father and sister both on soap-boxes protesting Britain&#x27;s lack of support for Spain; my mother canvasing long before those events for the League of Nations Union; and all three of them working on behalf of the German and Austrian refugees from 1933 onwards… I used to sell the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; house-to-house in the working class streets of Ilford Lane&quot;.

When Levertov was five years old she declared she would be a writer. At the age of 12, she sent some of her poems to T. S. Eliot, who replied with a two-page letter of encouragement. In 1940, when she was 17, Levertov published her first poem. During the Blitz, Levertov served in London as a civilian nurse. Her first book, &quot;The Double Image&quot;, was published six years later. In 1947, she met and married American writer Mitchell Goodman and moved with him to the United States the following year. Although Levertov and Goodman would eventually divorce in 1975, they did have one son together, Nikolai, in 1949. They lived mainly in New York City, summering in Maine. In 1955, she became a naturalised American citizen.

Levertov&#x27;s first two books comprised poems written in traditional forms and language, but as she accepted the US as her new home and became more and more fascinated with the American idiom, she began to come under the influence of the Black Mountain poets and most importantly William Carlos Williams. Her first American book of poetry, &quot;Here and Now&quot;, shows the beginnings of this transition and transformation. Her poem &quot;With Eyes at the Back of Our Heads&quot; established her reputation.

==Later life and work==
During the 1960s and &#x27;70s, Levertov became much more politically active in her life and work. As poetry editor for &quot;The Nation&quot;, she was able to support and publish the work of feminist and other leftist activist poets. The Vietnam War was an especially important focus of her poetry, which often tried to weave together the personal and political, as in her poem &quot;The Sorrow Dance&quot;, which speaks of her sister&#x27;s death. Also in response to the Vietnam War, Levertov joined the War Resisters League, and in 1968 signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war. Levertov was a founding member of the anti-war collective RESIST along with Noam Chomsky, Mitchell Goodman, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald.

Much of the latter part of Levertov&#x27;s life was spent in education. After moving to Massachusetts, Levertov taught at Brandeis University, MIT, Tufts University, and the University of Massachusetts Boston. She also lived part-time in Palo Alto and taught at Stanford University, as professor of English (professor emeritus). There she befriended Robert McAfee Brown, a professor of religion at Stanford and pastor. Franciscan Murray Bodo also became a spiritual advisor to her. In 1984 she uncovered notebooks of her mother and father, resolving some personal and religious conflict. In 1989, she moved from Somerville, Massachusetts, to Seattle, Washington, and lived near Seward Park on Lake Washington, with a view of her beloved Mount Rainier. On the West Coast, she had a part-time teaching stint at the University of Washington and for 11 years (1982–1993) held a full professorship at Stanford University, where she taught in the Stegner Fellowship program. In 1984, she received a Litt. D. from Bates College. After retiring from teaching, she travelled for a year, doing poetry readings in the US and Britain. In 1990, she joined the Catholic Church at St. Edward’s Parish, Seattle; she became involved in protests of the US attack on Iraq. She retired from teaching at Stanford.

In 1994, Levertov was diagnosed with lymphoma, and also suffered pneumonia and acute laryngitis. Despite this she continued to lecture and participate at national conferences, many on spirituality and poetry. In February 1997, she experienced the death of Mitch Goodman. In December 1997, Levertov died at the age of 74 from complications due to lymphoma. She was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, Washington. Her papers are held at Stanford University. The first full biography appeared in October 2012 by Dana Greene: &quot;Denise Levertov: A Poet&#x27;s Life&quot; (Chicago: University of Illinois, 2012). Donna Krolik Hollenberg&#x27;s more substantial biography, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Revolution: The Life of Denise Levertov,&quot; was published by the University of California Press in April 2013.

==Political poetry==
Both politics and war are major themes in Levertov&#x27;s poetry. Levertov was published in the &quot;Black Mountain Review&quot; during the 1950s, but denied any formal relations with the group. She began to develop her own lyrical style of poetry through those influences. She felt it was part of a poet&#x27;s calling to point out the injustice of the Vietnam War, and she also actively participated in rallies, reading poetry at some. Some of her war poetry was published in her 1971 book &quot;To Stay Alive&quot;, a collection of anti-Vietnam War letters, newscasts, diary entries, and conversations. Complementary themes in the book involve the tension of the individual vs. the group (or government) and the development of personal voice in mass culture. In her poetry, she promotes community and group change through the imagination of the individual and emphasizes the power of individuals as advocates of change. She also links personal experience to justice and social reform.

Suffering is another major theme in Levertov&#x27;s war poetry. The poems &quot;Poetry, Prophecy, Survival&quot;, &quot;Paradox and Equilibrium&quot;, and &quot;Poetry and Peace: Some Broader Dimensions&quot; revolve around war, injustice, and prejudice. In her volume &quot;Life at War&quot;, Levertov uses imagery to express the disturbing violence of the Vietnam War. Throughout these poems, she addresses violence and savagery, yet tries to bring grace into the equation, mixing the beauty of language and the ugliness of the horrors of war. The themes of her poems, especially &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, focus on both the cost of war and the suffering of the Vietnamese. In her prose work, &quot;The Poet in the World&quot;, she writes that violence is an outlet. Levertov&#x27;s first successful Vietnam poetry was her book &quot;The Freeing of the Dust&quot;. Some of the themes of this book of poems are the experience of the North Vietnamese, and distrust of people. She attacks the United States pilots in her poems for dropping bombs. Overall, her war poems incorporate suffering to show that violence has become an everyday occurrence. After years of writing such poetry, Levertov eventually came to the conclusion that beauty and poetry and politics can&#x27;t go together. This opened the door wide for her religious-themed poetry in the later part of her life.

==Religious influences==
From a very young age Levertov was influenced by her religion, and when she began writing it was a major theme in her poetry. Through her father she was exposed to both Judaism and Christianity. Levertov always believed that her culture and her family roots had inherent value to herself and her writing. Furthermore, she believed that she and her sister had a destiny pertaining to this. When Levertov moved to the United States, she fell under the influence of the Black Mountain Poets, especially the mysticism of Charles Olson. She drew on the experimentation of Ezra Pound and the style of William Carlos Williams, but was also exposed to the Transcendentalism of Thoreau and Emerson. Although all these factors shaped her poetry, her conversion to Christianity in 1984 was the main influence on her religious writing. Sometime shortly after her move to Seattle in 1989, she became a Catholic. In 1997, she brought together 38 poems from seven of her earlier volumes in &quot;The Stream &amp; the Sapphire&quot;, a collection intended, as Levertov explains in the foreword to the collection, to &quot;trace my slow movement from agnosticism to Christian faith, a movement incorporating much doubt and questioning as well as affirmation.&quot; She corresponded with literary critic and Catholic sister M. Bernetta Quinn, who also reviewed her work.

===Religious themes===
Denise Levertov wrote many poems with religious themes throughout her career. These poems range from religious imagery to implied metaphors of religion. One particular theme was developed progressively throughout her poetry. This was the pilgrimage/spiritual journey of Levertov towards the deep spiritual understanding and truth in her last poems.

One of her earlier poems is &quot;A Tree Telling of Orpheus&quot; from her book &quot;Relearning the Alphabet&quot;. This poem uses the metaphor of a tree, which changes and grows when it hears the music of Orpheus. This is a metaphor of spiritual growth. The growth of the tree is like the growth of faith, and as the tree goes through life we also go through life on a spiritual journey. Much of Levertov&#x27;s religious poetry was concerned with respect for nature and life. Also among her themes were nothingness and absence.

In her earlier poems something is always lacking, searching, and empty. In &quot;Work that Enfaiths&quot; Levertov begins to confront this &quot;ample doubt&quot; and her lack of &quot;burning surety&quot; in her faith. The religious aspect of this is the doubt vs. light debate. Levertov cannot find a balance between faith and darkness. She goes back and forth between the glory of God and nature, but doubt constantly plagues her.

In her earlier religious poems Levertov searches for meaning in life. She explores God as he relates to nothing(ness) and everything. In her later poetry, a shift can be seen. &quot;A Door in the Hive&quot; and &quot;Evening Train&quot; are full of poems using images of cliffs, edges, and borders to push for change in life. Once again, Levertov packs her poetry with metaphors. She explores the idea that there can be peace in death. She also begins to suggest that nothing is a part of God. &quot;Nothingness&quot; and darkness are no longer just reasons to doubt and agonise over. &quot;St. Thomas Didymus&quot; and &quot;Mass&quot; show this growth, as they are poems that lack her former nagging wonder and worry.

In &quot;Evening Train&quot;, Levertov&#x27;s poetry is highly religious. She writes about experiencing God. These poems are breakthrough poems for her. She writes about a mountain, which becomes a metaphor for life and God. When clouds cover a mountain, it is still huge and massive and in existence. God is the same, she says. Even when He is clouded, we know He is there. Her poems tend to shift away from constantly questioning religion to accepting it simply. In &quot;The Tide&quot;, the final section of &quot;Evening Train&quot;, Levertov writes about accepting faith and realizing that not knowing answers is tolerable. This acceptance of the paradoxes of faith marks the end of her &quot;spiritual journey&quot;.

Levertov&#x27;s heavy religious writing began at her conversion to Christianity in 1984. She wrote a great deal of metaphysical poetry to express her religious views, and began to use Christianity to link culture and community together. In her poem &quot;Mass&quot; she writes about how the Creator is defined by His creation. She writes a lot about nature and individuals. In the works of her last phase, Levertov sees Christianity as a bridge between individuals and society, and explores how a hostile social environment can be changed by Christian values.

==Legacy==
Levertov wrote and published 24 books of poetry, as well as criticism and translations. She also edited several anthologies. Among her many awards and honours, she received the Shelley Memorial Award, the Robert Frost Medal, the Lenore Marshall Prize, the Lannan Award, a Catherine Luck Memorial Grant, a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Levertov&#x27;s &quot;What Were They Like?&quot; is currently included in the Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9–1) English Literature poetry anthology, and the Conflict cluster of the OCR GCSE (9-1) English Literature poetry anthology, &quot;Towards a World Unknown&quot; (2020).

:This is not to be confused with the 2002 US volume of the same title. From Neil Astley, of Bloodaxe Books:

:&quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1986) had no editor as such: the book was edited by Bloodaxe Books in consultation with Denise Levertov, with helpful suggestions made by Linda Anderson and Cynthia Fuller. It was originated by Bloodaxe Books for publication in the UK and there was no corresponding US edition. It had no introduction or preface.&quot;

*&quot;Selected Poems&quot; (NY: New Directions Publishing Corporation, 2002). Preface by Robert Creeley, edited with an afterword by Paul A. Lacey
*&quot;New Selected Poems&quot; (UK: Bloodaxe Books, 2003). Preface by Robert Creeley, edited with an afterword by Paul A. Lacey

:The latter two volumes are identical in contents. From Neil Astley, of Bloodaxe Books:

:&quot;&quot;New Selected Poems&quot; was first published in the US by New Directions in 2002 under the title &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, and published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK in 2003 under the title &quot;New Selected Poems&quot; to avoid confusion with the previous UK edition called &quot;Selected Poems&quot;.

<doc id="506931" wikidata="Q1376769" url="?curid=506931" title="European Law Students' Association">
<text>The European Law Students&#x27; Association (ELSA) is an international, independent, non-political, non-profit, non-governmental organisation run by and for law students. ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA.

==History==
Five law students from Austria, Hungary, Poland, and West Germany founded ELSA on 4 May 1981.

==Organization==
ELSA is organized into local member groups active at university level (Local Group), national member groups active on a national level (National Group), and ELSA International active on an international level.

Membership of ELSA for individual law students is possible through the Local Groups (for instance ELSA Leiden or ELSA Tilburg). The Local Groups are member of a National Group (for instance ELSA the Netherlands). The National Groups are part of the international ELSA network, which is managed by ELSA International with headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. ELSA International consists of the International Board, the ELSA International Team, and the Auditors of ELSA.

The International Board is the supreme executive body of the association. Its members are elected at an International Council Meeting (ICM) (which consists of all the National Groups) for a one-year period. The International Board&#x27;s responsibilities include the overall co-ordination of the organisation as a whole including the support of member groups both locally and nationally. The International Board also co-ordinates and develops ELSA&#x27;s collaboration with various international organisations and institutions, governments, law firms, and companies across Europe.

==Institutional relations==
ELSA has gained consultative status with several United Nations bodies. In 1994, ELSA was granted Consultative Status in Category C in UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), and in 1997 ELSA obtained Special Consultative Status with ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council). In addition UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) is inviting ELSA delegations to participate in their sessions providing ELSA members with valuable opportunities to observe and engage with developments in international trade law. These interactions strengthen ELSA’s commitment to bridging the gap between academic studies and professional legal practice.

One of ELSA’s most significant contributions to the global legal landscape was its participation in the 1998 Diplomatic Conference in Rome, where the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was adopted. Representing an observer NGO delegation, ELSA actively participated in this historic event, which laid the foundation for the establishment of the ICC—a vital institution in the promotion of international criminal justice and the rule of law.

ELSA was part of the Diplomatic Conference of 1998 in Rome where the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted to establish the International Criminal Court. ELSA participated with a delegation as an NGO represented by an observer.

In 2000, ELSA was granted Participatory Status with the Council of Europe. This cooperation was further widened with the signing of a Human Rights Partnership between Council of Europe and ELSA in 2008.

Furthermore, ELSA has a co-operation agreement with UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). In October 2005, ELSA obtained Observer Status with WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization).

Since 2002, ELSA organizes the John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition (formerly known as ELSA Moot Court Competition) with the support of the WTO. The final round is held at the WTO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Since 2012, it organizes the European Human Rights Moot Court Competition in cooperation with the Council of Europe; the final round is held onsite at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
==ELSA Network==
ELSA has members and observers in Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.

Furthermore, ELSA co-operates with other student organisations across the world, for instance the Asian Law Students&#x27; Association (ALSA) in Asia.

<doc id="506933" wikidata="Q7515" url="?curid=506933" title="Maud Menten">
<text>Maud Leonora Menten (March 20, 1879 – July 17, 1960) was a Canadian physician and chemist. As a bio-medical and medical researcher, she made significant contributions to enzyme kinetics and histochemistry, and invented a procedure that remains in use. She is primarily known for her work with Leonor Michaelis on enzyme kinetics in 1913. The paper has been translated from its written language of German into English.

Maud Menten was born in Port Lambton, Ontario and studied medicine at the University of Toronto (B.A. 1904, M.B. 1907, M.D. 1911). She was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate. 

Since women were not allowed to participate in research in Canada at the time, Menten looked elsewhere to continue her work. In 1912, she moved to Berlin where she worked with Leonor Michaelis and co-authored their paper in &quot;Biochemische Zeitschrift&quot;, demonstrating that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex. This relationship between reaction rate and enzyme–substrate concentration is known as the Michaelis–Menten equation.

After working with Michaelis in Germany she entered graduate school at the University of Chicago where she obtained her Ph.D. in 1916. Her dissertation was entitled &quot;The Alkalinity of the Blood in Malignancy and Other Pathological Conditions; Together with Observations on the Relation of the Alkalinity of the Blood to Barometric Pressure&quot;. 

Menten joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in 1923 and remained there until her retirement in 1950. She became an assistant professor and then an associate professor in the School of Medicine and was the head of pathology at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh. Her final promotion to full professor, in 1948, was at the age of 69 in the last year of her career. Her final academic post was as a research fellow at the British Columbia Medical Research Institute.

==Early life and work==

Menten was born in Port Lambton, Ontario, Canada. Her family moved to Harrison Mills, British Columbia, where her mother worked as a postmistress. After completing secondary school, Menten attended the University of Toronto where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1904 and a master&#x27;s degree in physiology in 1907. While earning her graduate degree, she worked as a demonstrator in the physiology laboratory at the university.

Menten wanted to further her medical research, but found that opportunities for women in Canada were scarce at the time. As a result, she accepted a fellowship at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and left Canada, arriving in New York City in 1907. There she studied the effect of radium bromide on cancerous tumors in rats. Menten and two other scientists published the results of their experiment, authoring the first monograph published by Rockefeller Institute. Menten worked as an intern at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. After a year at the Institute, Menten returned to Canada and began her studies at the University of Toronto where, in 1911, she became one of the first Canadian women to qualify as a medical doctor.

== The Michaelis-Menten Equation ==
In 1912, Menten returned to medical research, working with renowned surgeon George Crile, in whose honour the Crile crater on the Moon is named. Their work concentrated on the control of acid-base balance during anaesthesia. Around this time she became acquainted with Leonor Michaelis, who was one of the world&#x27;s leading experts in pH and buffers. Menten became attracted to early work of Michaelis in enzyme kinetics. Despite his modest laboratory establishment in Berlin, she made the difficult decision to cross the sea to work with Michaelis. 

Menten and Michaelis used an equation to express the relationship they were investigating:

::formula_1

for a steady-state rate formula_2 in terms of the substrate concentration formula_3 and constants formula_4 and formula_5 (written with modern symbols). A decade earlier, Victor Henri had included an equivalent equation in his doctoral thesis, but he did not appreciate the importance of the steady state nor the simplification that would result from considering the initial rate, and did not use it.

The equation shows not only that each enzyme is specific for its substrate, but also that the rate of reaction rate increases to saturation as the substrate concentration increases. The constant formula_5 used in expressing this rate is now called the Michaelis constant. The paper deriving the Michaelis–Menten equation is Menten&#x27;s most famous work.

== Other work ==
After her research in Berlin, Menten enrolled in University of Chicago, where in 1916, she obtained a Ph.D. in biochemistry. In 1923, she still could not find an academic position for a woman in Canada; she took a position as part of the faculty of the medical school at the University of Pittsburgh while serving as a clinical pathologist at Children&#x27;s Hospital in Pittsburgh. Despite the demands both jobs had, Menten found time to maintain an active research program, authoring or coauthoring more than 70 publications. Although her promotion from assistant to associate professor was timely, she was not made a full professor until she was 70 years old, within one year of her retirement.

As part of extensive work on alkaline phosphatase, Menten invented the azo-dye coupling reaction, which is still used in histochemistry. This was described in a major textbook of the 1950s
in the following terms:

She characterised bacterial toxins from &quot;B. paratyphosus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus scarlatina&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella ssp.&quot; that were used in a successful immunisation program against scarlet fever in Pittsburgh in the 1930s - 1940s. She also conducted the first electrophoretic separation of blood haemoglobin proteins in 1944. In this she anticipated the results of Linus Pauling and his collaborators by several years; however, he is usually credited with the discovery. 

Menten also worked on the properties of hemoglobin, regulation of blood sugar level, and kidney function.

She continued to work on cancer, especially in children, as well as other illnesses of children.

After her retirement from the University of Pittsburgh in 1950, she returned to Canada where she continued to do cancer research at the British Columbia Medical Research Institute (1951–1953).

Poor health forced Menten&#x27;s retirement in 1955, and she died July 17, 1960, at the age of 81, in Leamington, Ontario.

==Personal life==

Rebecca Skloot portrays Menten as a petite dynamo of a woman who wore &quot;Paris hats, blue dresses with stained-glass hues, and Buster Brown shoes&quot;. She drove a Model T Ford through the University of Pittsburgh area for some 32 years and enjoyed many adventurous and artistic hobbies. She played the clarinet, created paintings worthy of art exhibitions, climbed mountains, went on an Arctic expedition, and enjoyed astronomy. By the time of her death, she had mastered several languages, including Russian, French, German, Italian, and at least one First Nations language, Halkomelem.
Although Menten did most of her research in the United States, she retained her Canadian citizenship throughout her life.

==Honors==

Throughout her career Menten was affiliated with many scientific societies.

At Menten&#x27;s death, colleagues Aaron H. Stock and Anna-Mary Carpenter honored the Canadian biochemist in an obituary in &quot;Nature&quot;: &quot;Menten was untiring in her efforts on behalf of sick children. She was an inspiring teacher who stimulated medical students, resident physicians, and research associates to their best efforts. She will long be remembered by her associates for her keen mind, for a certain dignity of manner, for unobtrusive modesty, for her wit, and above all for her enthusiasm for research.&quot;

In 1998, she was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. She also was honored at the University of Toronto with a plaque. At the University of Pittsburgh she was honored with a named chair and memorial lectures. Port Lambton, Canada, where Menten was born, installed a commemorative bronze plaque about her in 2015.

<text>The 63rd Regiment of Foot was a British Army regiment raised in 1756. Under the Childers Reforms, it amalgamated with the 96th Regiment of Foot to form the Manchester Regiment in 1881.

==History==
===Formation and service in the Seven Years&#x27; War===
The formation of the regiment was prompted by the expansion of the army as a result of the commencement of the Seven Years&#x27; War. On 25 August 1756 it was ordered that a number of existing regiments should raise a second battalion; among those chosen was the 8th Regiment of Foot. The 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of Foot was formed on 10 December 1756 and renumbered as the 63rd Regiment of Foot on 21 April 1758. Later that year, the newly created 63rd, along with a number of other regiments and various other assets, set off for the West Indies. In January 1759 the regiment took part in the unsuccessful invasion of Martinique. Later that month the regiment took part in the invasion of Guadeloupe: after the Royal Navy bombarded Basse-Terre, the British troops landed on the west part of the island, near Fort Royal, a large citadel. By 24 January, British troops had entered the main town: the citadel there had been abandoned.

The regiment suffered a number of attacks while garrisoning the citadel, the rest of the force having moved to the more hospitable east of the island. During one attack, the regiment&#x27;s commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Desbrisay was killed. The regiment remained in the West Indies for a further five years.

===American War of Independence===

In 1764 the regiment reached Ireland. In 1775 the regiment arrived in America in response to a request for reinforcements due to the outbreak of the American War of Independence. The regiment took part in the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, with a third attack, which ended in a bayonet charge, finally breaking the Americans. The regiment remained in Boston after the battle, the town becoming increasingly more uneasy to be in. Finally, in March 1776 the regiment, along with the rest of the forces in Boston, departed, heading for Halifax in Canada. The regiment took part in the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, a devastating blow against the Americans, though astonishingly, the American leader General George Washington managed to reverse the blow that had been struck against much of the Continental Army&#x27;s morale in this battle soon after. Grenadier and Light companies of the regiment also took part in the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777 and the Battle of Germantown in October 1777. The main force of the regiment took part in the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery in October 1777. The regiment then moved to Philadelphia and took part in the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778.

In 1780 the regiment became involved in the campaign in the Carolinas taking part in the siege and subsequent capture of Charleston. That year the mounted company of the regiment, augmented by a detachment from Tarleton&#x27;s Legion under the command of the dashing, Banastre Tarleton, attacked and captured an American cavalry unit. The regiment also took part in number of battles as part of the forces commanded by Lord Cornwallis over the next two years, as well as taking part in another engagement near Camden in April 1781, as part of a force under the command of General Francis Rawdon. In 1782 the regiment was designated the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot.

===French Revolutionary War and Napoleonic Wars===

In 1794 the regiment joined British forces already taking part in the Flanders Campaign. The regiment was involved in a number of actions before the British forces withdrew from the Netherlands in 1795. That same year, the regiment were part of a force designed to take a number of Caribbean islands under Dutch and French control. However, their transport ship sank, with the loss of two companies from the regiment, en route to the islands. The regiment took part in a variety of operations on the islands in the Caribbean, including helping to put down Fédon&#x27;s rebellion in the Grenada in 1796. It remaining in the region until 1799, when they departed for home. In August 1799 the regiment took part in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, seeing action at the Battle of Alkmaar in October 1799. In November 1801 the regiment joined the garrison at Gibraltar and, in 1803, it was deployed to Ireland.

A second battalion was raised in 1804. In 1807 the 1st battalion was involved in an expedition to Madeira, a Portuguese-controlled territory, under the command of Major-General William Beresford. Once the expeditionary forces landed, the Portuguese Governor agreed to all demands made by the British forces. In February 1808 the 1st battalion was stationed in Barbados. It took part the expedition to Martinique, which the British force captured. On 9 April 1809, a detachment from the 1st battalion was serving on the Treasury store-ship &quot;Emma&quot;, and so shared in the prize money for the French brig &quot;Navigateur&quot; for which &quot;Emma&quot; was a joint captor with sundry other ships. The 1st battalion became the garrison for island, suffering heavily from diseases one would expect in such tropical weather at that time. In January 1810, part of the 1st battalion took part in the capture of Guadeloupe, a duty the regiment had participated in many years before. The 1st battalion returned to Martinique and finally departed the Caribbean in 1819.

Meanwhile, the 2nd battalion took part in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign in autumn 1809, suffering from terrible fever while assisting in the capture of a number of towns on the island.

===The Victorian era===

In 1820, the regiment were deployed to Ireland, a deployment that would last until 1826. The regiment was involved in an expedition to Portugal due to fears of impending insurrection in the country and landed there in January 1827. The rebel cause largely subsided, thanks largely in part due to the expedition made by the British forces.

In 1829, the regiment began providing escorts for convict ships traveling to New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania). The rest of the regiment became garrison troops in the latter colony. A detachment of the regiment was present at the foundation ceremony of Perth in 1829, and had arrived in Western Australia that same year, on the warship HMS &quot;Sulphur&quot;. The officer commanding the detachment of the regiment at the ceremony, Captain Frederick Chidley Irwin, would later twice serve as administrator of Western Australia. The regiment transferred from Australia to India in 1833. The regiment deployed to Mawlamyine in Burma in 1838, returned to India in 1842, and then embarked for England in 1847.

===The Crimean War===
The regiment landed in the Kalamita Bay in August 1854 as part of the 4th Division for service in the Crimean War. The regiment took part in the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and was engaged in extensive hand-to-hand fighting. At one point, both colour bearers fell: Ensign James Hulton Clutterbuck, carrying the Queen&#x27;s Colour, and Ensign Heneage Twysden, who was mortally wounded carrying the Regimental Colour. The regiment also took part in the Siege of Sevastopol and was part of a force created to assault a part of the great fortress of Sevastopol on 8 September 1855, during the last day of the long siege, known as Battle of the Great Redan.

===Amalgamation===
After leaving the Crimea, the regiment sailed for Nova Scotia in 1856. Upon their arrival at the dockyard in Halifax, a large crowd of many thousands came out to greet the regiment, as if they were a modern-day football team. The regiment returned home in 1865 and then departed for India in 1870.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 63rd was linked with the 96th Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 16 at Wellington Barracks in Ashton-under-Lyne. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 96th Regiment of Foot to form the Manchester Regiment.

A veteran of four space flights, STS-51-I in 1985, STS-26 in 1988, STS-38 in 1990, and STS-61 in 1993, Covey has logged over 646 hours in space. He was the last member of his astronaut class—the 1978 NASA Group 8—to make his first spaceflight.

Prior to the first flight of the Space Shuttle, he provided astronaut support in Orbiter engineering development and testing. He was a T-38 chase pilot for the second and third Shuttle flights and support crewman for the first operational Shuttle flight, STS-5. Covey also served as Mission Control spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for Shuttle missions STS-5, 6, 61-B, 61-C, and 51-L (it was his voice that said the now infamous words, &quot;, go at throttle up&quot; shortly before the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster). During 1989, he was Chairman of NASA&#x27;s Space Flight Safety Panel. He has held additional technical assignments within the NASA Astronaut Office, and has also served as Acting Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, and Acting Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations.

===Space flights===
On his first mission, Covey was on the five-man crew of STS-51-I, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 27, 1985. During this seven-day mission, crew members deployed three communications satellites: the Navy SYNCOM IV-4, the Australian AUSSAT, and American Satellite Corporation&#x27;s ASC-1. The crew also performed the successful on-orbit rendezvous and repair of the ailing 15,000 pound (6.8 t) SYNCOM IV-3 satellite. This repair activity involved the first manual grapple and manual deployment of a satellite by a spacewalking crew member. Mission duration was 170 hours. The completed 112 orbits before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1985.

He next served as pilot on STS-26, the first flight to be flown after the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;. The five-man crew launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988, aboard the &quot;Discovery&quot;. Mission duration was 97 hours during which crew members successfully deployed the TDRS-C satellite and operated eleven secondary payloads which included two student experiments. &quot;Discovery&quot; completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.

On STS-38 Covey was the spacecraft commander of a five-man crew that launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 15, 1990. During the five-day mission crew members conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, Covey piloted the to a landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990. This was the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985.

On his fourth flight, Covey commanded a crew of seven aboard the on the STS-61 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and repair mission. STS-61 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1993. During the 11-day flight, the HST was captured and restored to full capacity through a record five space walks by four astronauts. After having traveled in 163 orbits of the Earth, Covey landed the &quot;Endeavour&quot; at night on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on December 13, 1993.

==Post-NASA career==
On August 1, 1994, Covey retired from NASA and the Air Force. Covey is married and has two grown daughters. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in 2003, Covey, along with retired Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas Patten Stafford, headed the Stafford-Covey Commission in returning the Space Shuttle fleet to space, starting with the STS-114 mission. In 2005, Covey received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America—he became an Eagle Scout in 1960 when his father was stationed at an Air Force base in Florida. Covey was featured in a 2005 issue of &quot;Eagletter&quot;, a magazine for members of the National Eagle Scout Association. In January 2006, Covey was selected for the position of Chief Operating Officer of United Space Alliance. In September 2007, Covey succeeded fellow astronaut Michael J. McCulley as chief executive officer of United Space Alliance. Covey retired from United Space Alliance in March 2010. He served on the Board of Directors of Re/Max Holdings, LLC from 2005 until 2019.

Covey also appeared in an episode of the American TV show &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Series 3, Episode 24, titled &quot;Reality Bytes&quot;, aired May 18, 1994. The Hubble repair crew appeared on the fictional show-within-a-show &quot;Tool Time&quot;, where they showed some of the tools they used in space. During the closing credits, Covey also presented the cast and crew of Home Improvement with a frame containing a flag, crew patch and some photos. The flag and patch had flown around four million miles in space.

==Special honors==
Covey has been awarded 2 Defense Distinguished Service Medals, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, 5 Air Force Distinguished Flying Crosses, 16 Air Medals, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, 4 NASA Space Flight Medals, the NASA Public Service Medal, the Johnson Space Center Certificate of Commendation, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Haley Space Flight Award for 1988, and the American Astronautical Society (AAS) Flight Achievement Award for 1988. He is a Distinguished Graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, received the Liethen-Tittle Award as the Outstanding Graduate of U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Class 74B, and is a Distinguished Astronaut Engineering Alumnus of Purdue University. He has been inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame, the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame, and the Choctawhatchee High School Hall of Fame. Additionally, he is a Fellow of both the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. Covey and his crew of STS-61 received the National Space Club&#x27;s 1994 Goddard Trophy and the National Aeronautics Association&#x27;s Collier Trophy for 1993.

Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Covey into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1995.

<text>Lowell Palmer Weicker Jr. (; May 16, 1931 – June 28, 2023) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, and the 85th Governor of Connecticut.

Weicker unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 1980. One of the first Republican members of Congress to express concerns about President Richard Nixon&#x27;s role in the Watergate scandal, Weicker developed a reputation as a &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot;, eventually leading conservative activists to endorse his opponent Joe Lieberman, a New Democrat, in the 1988 Senate election which he subsequently lost. Weicker later left the Republican Party, and became one of the few third-party candidates to be elected to a state governorship in the United States at the time, doing so on the ticket of A Connecticut Party.

==Early life==
Weicker was born in Paris, the son of American parents Mary Hastings (née Bickford) and Lowell Palmer Weicker. His grandfather Theodore Weicker was a German immigrant who co-founded the E. R. Squibb corporation. Weicker graduated from the Lawrenceville School (class of 1949), Yale University (1953), and the University of Virginia School of Law (1958). He began his political career after serving in the United States Army between 1953 and 1955, reaching the rank of first lieutenant.

==Career in Congress==
Weicker served in the Connecticut State House of Representatives from 1963 to 1969 and as First Selectman of Greenwich, Connecticut, before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives, in 1968 as a Republican. Weicker only served one term in the House before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1970. Weicker benefited from a split in the Democratic Party in that election: two-term incumbent Thomas Dodd ran as an independent after losing the Democratic nomination to Joseph Duffey. Ultimately, Weicker won with 41.7 percent of the vote. Dodd finished third, with 266,500 votes—far exceeding Weicker&#x27;s 86,600-vote margin over Duffey.

Weicker served in the U.S. Senate for three terms, from 1971 to 1989. He gained national attention for his service on the Senate Watergate Committee, where he became the first Republican senator to call for Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation. He recalled: &quot;People in Connecticut were very much behind President Nixon, like the rest of the country. They thought he could do no wrong, and when I was in Connecticut, I would get flipped the bird all the time, whether it was on the streets or in the car, for the role that I was playing. After Watergate was over, then the needle goes all the way the other way, and I&#x27;ve got huge favorability ratings.&quot; Proving this, Weicker was convincingly reelected in 1976.

In 1980, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for president.

Weicker was a liberal voice in an increasingly conservative Republican Party. For instance Americans for Democratic Action consistently rated Weicker as having a liberal quotient of 60 to 90% throughout his senate career, and in 1987 and in 1988 gave him a higher rating than Connecticut&#x27;s other Senator, Democrat Chris Dodd. He was critical of the increasing influence of the Christian right on the party; he described the separation of church and state as &quot;this country&#x27;s greatest contribution to world civilization&quot;, and the party in 2012 as &quot;swung off so far to the right that no moderate could&#x27;ve survived a primary.&quot; Weicker voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Weicker voted against the nomination of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States, as well as the nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Weicker was a strong advocate for the rights of the disabled during his tenure in Congress, although he ultimately lost his seat before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 passed. In later interviews, Weicker identified his work on the Americans with Disabilities Act, funding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health, and funding research into AZT as his proudest achievements in the Senate.

Weicker&#x27;s rocky relations with establishment Republicans may have roots in receiving strong support from Nixon in his 1970 Senate bid, support repaid in the eyes of his critics by a vehement attack on the White House while serving on the Watergate Committee. Later, his relations with the Bush family also soured, and Prescott Bush Jr. (the brother of the then Vice President) made a short-lived bid against Weicker to gain the 1982 Republican Senate nomination. Weicker&#x27;s well-known Democratic sympathies increasingly alienated mainstream Republicans, particularly after Weicker’s effort to prevent the nomination of conservatives to state office, which resulted in a poor showing during the 1986 local elections, and he was defeated in the 1988 Senate election by Joe Lieberman. Lieberman benefited from the support of &quot;National Review&quot; founder William F. Buckley Jr., and his brother, former New York Senator James Buckley; William F. Buckley ran columns in support of Lieberman and circulated bumper stickers with the slogan, &quot;Does Lowell Weicker Make You Sick?&quot;

==Governor==
Weicker&#x27;s political career appeared to be over after his 1988 defeat, and he became a professor at the George Washington University Law School. However, he entered the 1990 gubernatorial election as the candidate of A Connecticut Party, running as a good government candidate and drew upon his coalition of liberal Republicans, moderate Democrats, and independent voters. The early 1990s recession had hit Connecticut hard, worsened by the fall in revenues from traditional sources such as sales tax and corporation tax. Connecticut politics had a tradition at the time of opposition to a state income tax—one had been implemented in 1971 but rescinded after six weeks under public pressure. Weicker initially campaigned on a platform of solving Connecticut&#x27;s fiscal crisis without implementing an income tax. He won in a three-way race with Republican John G. Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison, taking 40% of the vote against Rowland&#x27;s 37% and Morrison&#x27;s 21%. Weicker lost Fairfield and New Haven County counties to Rowland, but won eastern Connecticut, drawing especially strong support from the Hartford metro area, where he had been strongly endorsed by the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; and by many state employee labor unions. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that support from Democrats was credited for Weicker&#x27;s victory, reflected in Morrison&#x27;s third-place finish.

After taking office, with a projected $2.4 billion deficit, Weicker reversed himself and pushed for the adoption of an income tax, a move that was very unpopular. He stated, &quot;My policy when I came in was no income tax, but that fell apart on the rocks of fiscal fact.&quot; Weicker vetoed three budgets that did not contain an income tax, and forced a partial government shutdown, before the General Assembly narrowly passed it in 1991. The 1991 budget set the income tax rate at 6%, lowered the sales tax from 8% to 6% while expanding its base, reduced the corporate tax to 10.5% over two years, and eliminated taxes on capital gains, interest, and dividends. It also included $1.2 billion in line-by-line budget cuts, including the elimination of state aid to private and parochial schools, but held the line on social programs. His drastic measures provoked controversy. A huge protest rally in Hartford attracted some 40,000 participants, some of whom cursed at and spat at Governor Weicker.

Weicker earned lasting criticism for his implementation of the income tax; the conservative Yankee Institute claimed in August 2006 that after fifteen years the income tax had failed to achieve its stated goals. However, he earned national attention for his leadership on the issue, receiving the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation&#x27;s Profile in Courage Award for taking an unpopular stand, then holding firm. Within two years, the state&#x27;s budget was in surplus and he was well-regarded among voters. In retirement, he commented, &quot;You&#x27;ve had 19 years to repeal it, and all you&#x27;ve done is spend it.&quot;

Despite his increasing popularity, he did not seek re-election as governor in 1994, citing wanting to spend time with his children as the reason. His last year in office was marked by a controversy over the firing of the state commissioner of motor vehicles, Louis Goldberg. In 2000, he endorsed Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) for President. In 2004, Weicker supported former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean&#x27;s (D-VT) presidential bid. He expressed sympathy for the budget struggles of Governor Dannel Malloy, drawing a parallel with his own efforts to remedy a fiscal crisis.

In his book &quot;Independent Nation&quot; (2004), political analyst John Avlon describes Weicker as a radical centrist governor and thinker.

==Later career==
Weicker published a memoir entitled &quot;Maverick&quot; in 1995, co-written with Barry Sussman. The following year, he joined the board of directors for Compuware. In 1999, he became a member of the board of directors for the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE), and held this position until 2011. Despite the long professional relationship, Weicker did not support former WWE CEO Linda McMahon in either of her unsuccessful bids for the U.S. Senate in 2010 or 2012.

Weicker served from 2001 to 2011 as president of the board of directors of Trust for America&#x27;s Health, a Washington, DC–based non-profit, non-partisan health policy research organization and was formerly a member of the board of directors of United States Tobacco. From 2003 on Weicker served on the board of Medallion Financial Corp., a lender to purchasers of taxi medallions in leading cities across the U.S. He was named to the board through his personal and business relationship with Andrew M. Murstein, president of Medallion.

Weicker considered a rematch against Senator Joe Lieberman in 2006. He objected to Lieberman&#x27;s support for the Iraq War and told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2005, &quot;If he&#x27;s out there scot-free and nobody will do it [run against Senator Lieberman], I&#x27;d have to give serious thought to doing it myself, and I don&#x27;t want to do it.&quot; Weicker ultimately did not run, but he endorsed Ned Lamont, who defeated Lieberman in the Democratic primary, causing Lieberman to run as an independent. The Lieberman campaign released an ad that borrowed from one aired during the 1988 Senate race, which depicted Weicker as a hibernating bear ignoring his Senate duties except at election time. In the 2006 ad, Weicker reappeared as a wounded bear while Lieberman&#x27;s Democratic challenger, Lamont, was depicted as a bear cub sent and directed by Weicker. Lieberman ultimately defeated Lamont in November.

In 2015, despite criticizing Cuba for its lack of &quot;human rights and democratic elections&quot;, Weicker described the country&#x27;s free healthcare system as one of its most positive aspects.

During the 2016 Republican primaries, Weicker wrote an editorial in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; in which he criticized the repudiation of Rockefeller Republicans, the party&#x27;s alienation of various population groups, and its obstructionist stance in Congress. He stated that the selection of Donald Trump as their presidential candidate &quot;will complete their slow and steady descent into irrelevance.&quot;

In 2020, he filed an amicus brief on the side of Pennsylvania in the notable election case &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;. Pennsylvania won the case and Biden was sworn in shortly after. Weicker had served with Biden in the U.S. Senate for 16 years.

==Personal life and death==
Weicker lived in Old Lyme, Connecticut, in his later years. He was married three times and had five sons. His first marriage, to Marie Louise Godfrey, lasted from 1953 to their divorce in 1977. He then married Camille Butler, his secretary. Their six-year marriage was described by &quot;The Connecticut Mirror&quot; as &quot;tumultuous&quot;, and it ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Claudia Testa Ingram, lasted from 1984 until Weicker&#x27;s death, at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Connecticut, on June 28, 2023, at age 92. By the time of his death, he was the final former member of the Senate Watergate Committee.
