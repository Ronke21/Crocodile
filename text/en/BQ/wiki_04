<text>Netscape 6 is a discontinued Internet suite developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, and was the sixth major release of the Netscape series of browsers. It superseded Netscape Communicator (4.x), as the release of Netscape Communicator 5 was scrapped. Netscape 6 was the first browser of the Netscape line to be based on another source code: Mozilla Application Suite, an open-source software package from the Mozilla Foundation, which was created by Netscape in 1998.

Netscape 6 was first released on November 14, 2000. Version 6.2.3 was the last release in 2002, and it was succeeded by Netscape 7.

It consisted of the following major components:

* a web browser
* an e-mail and news client, &quot;Netscape Mail &amp; Newsgroups&quot;
* an address book
* an HTML editor, &quot;Netscape Composer&quot;
* an instant messaging client, &quot;AOL Instant Messenger&quot;

==History and development==
In March 1998, Netscape split off most of the Communicator code and put it under an open source license. The project was dubbed Mozilla. It was estimated that turning the gutted source code (all proprietary elements had to be removed) into a new browser release might take a year, and so it was decided that the next release of the corporate Netscape browser, version 5.0, would be based on it. Netscape assigned its browser development engineers to help with the project.

Later that year it was quite evident that development on Mozilla was not proceeding quickly, so Netscape reassigned some of its engineers to a new Communicator 4.5 release. This had the result of redirecting part of the browser effort into a dead-end branch while Internet Explorer 5.0 was still building momentum.

The version 5 of the browser was skipped, at the time when Internet Explorer 5.0 had been available for a year and a half. There were plans to release an almost-ready version 5.0 based on the 4.x codebase, but this idea was scrapped. The Mozilla engineers decided in late October 1998 to scrap the Communicator code and start over from scratch using the standards-compliant Gecko rendering engine. All resources were bound to work on the Netscape 6.0 release using Gecko, which some Netscape employees deem one of the bigger mistakes in the company&#x27;s history.

The first public builds of Mozilla two years later (2000) were rather disappointing, with many mid-level PCs of the time too slow to run the larger codebase, which used its own custom set of graphical user interface widgets and had a customizable UI built in a custom XML dialect known as XUL. With public beta versions released in April, August, and October, Netscape 6.0 shipped in November 2000. At release, the browser was deemed too unstable for production use.

Versions 6.1 and 6.2, released in 2001, addressed stability problems, and were more respected, but still had a relatively small number of users, and Netscape 6 was facing new competition from Internet Explorer 6.0, released in the summer of 2001.

==Historical documents==
===American Revolutionary War===

Detailed strategy for British invasion via Lake Champlain includes comment that it&#x27;s &quot;a mistaken Idea of Humanity&quot; not to employ Indigenous fighters

Garrisons, military stores, : Gen. Burgoyne on how invasion of eastern New York should be arranged in Canada (Note: &quot;savages&quot; used)

United States willing to conquer Britain&#x27;s possessions jointly with France, giving U.S. Canada and Atlantic colonies plus half of Newfoundland fishery

&quot;Aukwark (&quot;sic&quot;), ignorant, disinclined to the service, and spiritless&quot; - On arrival, Burgoyne finds some Canadian troops not ready for duty

Burgoyne&#x27;s orders to invasion army warn that enemy &quot;is well fitted by disposition and practice for the stratagems and enterprizes of little war&quot;

Burgoyne tells Indigenous allies on Boquet River that they must not shed blood after battle or harm prisoners or civilians or scalp any but corpses

Estimating size of Burgoyne&#x27;s army, Alexander Hamilton assumes troops guarding Canada are not Canadians, &quot;many of whom are notoriously disaffected&quot;

Oneidas and &quot;Caghnawagas from Canada&quot; tell Gen. Schuyler that &quot;Missesaques, Hurons &amp; Chippeways&quot; are with John Johnson (Note: &quot;savages&quot; used)

Failed Fort Stanwix siege and Oriskany battle report mentions allied &quot;chiefs Joseph and Bull,&quot; Indigenous impetuousness, and Mississaugas&#x27; &quot;slackness&quot;

Burgoyne blames his failure in part on &quot;the total defection of the Indians [and] the desertion or timidity of the Canadians and Provincials&quot;

===Canada===

Gov. Carleton reports &quot;turbulent Faction&quot; is behind independence movement, but &quot;Noblesse, Clergy, and [much] of the Bourgeoisie&quot; help restore order

All men 16 to 60 must serve in Quebec militia and can be penalized for refusal, absence, or disobedience; some over 60 must supply carts and sleighs

&quot;For the speedy administration of justice&quot; - Quebec governor and council set up civil and criminal courts

Quebec ordinance prohibits selling rum and other strong liquor to Indigenous people, buying their clothes and arms, and unlicenced trading with them

Proclamation prohibits export of livestock, grain, flour or &quot;bisquit[...]until it can be exactly ascertained whether [it] may be with safety permitted&quot;

Quebec City regulations require owners to clean street in front of their buildings weekly, and prohibit on-street slaughtering and other nuisances

In Quebec City, &quot;a Piece of Rock fell from the Ramparts over Sault-au-matelot Street, forced its Way through a Stable and killed two Horses therein&quot;

Alexander Simpson of lower town Quebec City seeks return of &quot;A Panese woman named Mary Ann&quot; and offers 40 shilling reward

&quot;M. Crofton has taken a House[...]where she proposes keeping a School for young Ladies, little Girls, and such little Boys as wear petticoats&quot;

£4 reward offered for &quot;a Negro man called Bruce[...]since absconded&quot; and suspected of break and enter and theft of &quot;a great quantity of Liquors&quot; etc.

Gazette printer William Brown offers $4 reward for capture of &quot;A Negro Lad named Joe, born in Africa, about twenty years of age&quot;

Call for contractors to supply firewood to these garrisons: Quebec City (4,000 cords annually), Montreal (2,000), Trois-Rivières (1,000), Chambly (600)

===Nova Scotia===

Benjamin Marston arrives in Halifax after months of detention in Boston, happy to see his Eliza and hoping &quot;to be able to provide for that dearest Girl&quot;

<text>The Irwindale Speedway &amp; Event Center (a.k.a. &quot;Irwindale Speedway&quot;, &quot;Irwindale Dragstrip&quot;, or &quot;The House of Drift&quot;) was a motorsports facility located in Irwindale, California, United States. It opened on March 27, 1999, under the official name Irwindale Speedway. Toyota purchased the naming rights to the facility in 2008, and from that time until 2011 it was also known as the Toyota Speedway at Irwindale.

The speedway featured banked, paved - and -mile oval tracks and a -mile drag strip. The property was primarily used for NASCAR races such as ARCA Menards Series West and Whelen All-American Series events. In late 2011, NASCAR announced it was dropping Toyota Speedway from its schedule. The company that managed the track, Irwindale Speedway LLC, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 13, 2012.

In January 2013, it was announced that the track would be re-opening as the Irwindale Event Center, and would operate as a Whelen All-American Series venue for the 2013 season. For the past decade, the Formula D Championship Series had featured sold out events at the venue.

In 2015, plans were made to demolish Irwindale Speedway and build an outlet mall on the site of the track. On August 9, 2017, it was officially announced that Jim Cohan, CEO of Team 211 Entertainment, who operated the track under the name of Irwindale Event Center, would cease operation. On December 29, 2017, it was announced that the track would not close in January 2018 as former Irwindale Late Model driver and track champion Tim Huddleston, along with K&amp;N West team owner Bob Bruncatti, took over management of the speedway to have it remain open.

On October 29, 2024, it was announced that the speedway and the drag-strip would officially close on December 21, 2024.

==History==
===1999–2012===
Construction began in March 1998 on Irwindale&#x27;s 6,500-seat grandstand and - and -mile ovals. Irwindale Speedway hoped to fill the void left in the Los Angeles Basin left by the closures of the famed Riverside International Raceway, Ontario Motor Speedway and Saugus Speedway. The $7-million project was completed March 1999 and held its inaugural races on March 27, 1999. However, during the first practice session for a sprint car race, driver Casey Diemert died of head and neck injuries after hitting the wall and flipping his car from turn 3 to turn 4.

From 2003 to 2010, the main -mile oval hosted the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown. In this event, the top 30 drivers in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series and the top 40 drivers in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series come from their respective regional tours to compete in a &quot;best-of-the-best&quot; race. The races were televised live on the Speed Channel. It was also the home of the Turkey Night Grand Prix race, a Thanksgiving midget car racing tradition in southern California since 1934, when the race debuted at Gilmore Stadium. Among the 2005 participants were Tony Stewart, Jason Leffler, and J. J. Yeley. It was also seen in an episode of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, titled &quot;Stock Car Races&quot;, also used in the opening scene of the pilot episode of &quot;Fastlane&quot; and in Episode 25 of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; Season 3.

In 2012, Irwindale Speedway LLC, the management group that ran the track, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on the same day track management canceled the 2012 racing season.

In the paperwork filed at the United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District, it shows that Irwindale Speedway LLC owed creditors $331,773.11. The largest amount is $150,000 owed on a personal-injury claim.

Irwindale Speedway LLC owed Nu-Way Industries Inc., the company that owns the property where the track and offices are built, $55,000 in rent.

Irwindale Speedway LLC has two more outstanding personal injury claims with unknown values. There is also a debt of $8,093.51 owed to the city of Irwindale Police Department, $16,379.58 owed to the Golden State Water Company and $1,437.50 owed to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune for advertising.

===2013–2017===

In late 2012, Jim Cohan, who ran the LA Driving Experience at the track was able to secure funding to re-open the speedway under his management. In September 2013, the property housing the Irwindale Event Center was purchased by Irwindale Outlet Partners, LLC for $22 million. The lease for the Irwindale Event Center continued on a year-by-year basis. In March 2015, plans were made to demolish Irwindale Speedway and replace it with Irwindale Outlet Center, an outlet mall, but the closure has been delayed. The track is currently running the 2017 season. On August 9, 2017, Cohan made an announcement in an e-mailed statement saying that the track was closing down officially in January 2018.

===2018–2024===
On December 29, 2017, it was announced that the track would not close in January 2018 as former Irwindale Late Model racer and track champion Tim Huddleston took over management of the speedway to have it remain open. In February 2020 Irwindale&#x27;s famous All-Star Showdown returned to the track following a ten-year hiatus. The track remained open without spectators during the COVID-19 pandemic founding its own streaming service IrwindaleSpeedway.tv operated by Low Budget TV. In June 2021 fans returned to the track. At the 2024 West Coast Stock Car Motorsports Hall of Fame 150, a post-race incident happened when Sean Hingorani was caught on the hot mic swearing at owner Tim Huddleston.

===Closing===
On October 29, 2024, Huddleston officially announced that the both speedway and the drag-strip track will permanently close on December 21, 2024.

==Drag strip==
The 1/8-mile drag racing strip opened on September 29, 2001. In 2003, in cooperation with local law enforcement, Irwindale Speedway opened its own dragstrip and hosts legal drag races for street-legal cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The dragstrip is proud to extinguish the &quot;nowhere else to go&quot; excuse used by illegal street racers, and local police often hand out flyers to offenders for free entry into drag races at the dragstrip to promote safe racing and has re-opened. The drag strip closed on December 21, 2024.

==The House of Drift==
The venue was also known for drifting events; when it hosted D1 Grand Prix&#x27;s first overseas event in , with a sell-out crowd attendance of 10,000, it had surpassed all other events Irwindale hosted in the past, the previous being 8,700. Since then, it had become the series regular opening round in February and a non championship event in December and has also hosted a round of the domestic series, Formula D. The venue had been expanded to accommodate 15,000 spectators. The circuit was regarded as one of the most popular courses for crowds and drivers despite the unforgiving concrete wall which drivers usually brush through with their rear bumpers. Because of its popularity, the circuit was nicknamed the &quot;House of Drift&quot;.

==Record==
The 2003 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; lists the fastest-ever top speed of a radio-controlled car as 111 mph (178.63 km/h) set by Cliff Lett of Associated Electrics. Lett, a Team Associated professional driver and one of the designers and developers of the aforementioned RC10, set the record with a heavily modified Associated RC10L3 touring car at Irwindale Speedway on January 13, 2001.

<doc id="487784" wikidata="Q224539" url="?curid=487784" title="Music Has the Right to Children">
<text>Music Has the Right to Children is the debut studio album by Scottish electronic music duo Boards of Canada, released on 20 April 1998 in the United Kingdom by Warp and Skam Records and in the United States by Matador. The album was produced at Hexagon Sun, the duo&#x27;s personal recording studio in Pentland Hills, and continued their distinctive style of electronica, featuring vintage synthesisers, degraded analogue production, found sounds and samples, and hip hop-inspired rhythms that had been featured on their first two EPs &quot;Twoism&quot; (1995) and &quot;Hi Scores&quot; (1996).

The album received widespread acclaim upon its release, and has since been acknowledged as a landmark work in electronic music, going on to inspire a variety of subsequent artists. It has been included on various best-ever lists by publications such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot;.

== Background ==
The members of Boards of Canada, brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin, had been creating music together as early as 1981, layering synths over cassette recordings of shortwave radio. Throughout the 1990s, the band were members of the Hexagon Sun artistic collective based in Pentland Hills, Scotland, and released self-produced cassettes produced in small quantities and given to friends and family members. According to Eoin, around 1987 or 1988, they started experimenting with tape demos they later destroyed. He called it the &quot;seed of the project&quot;. 

In 1996, the band completed their first wide release, the &quot;Hi Scores&quot; EP, and began sending it out for record labels to hear. Sean Booth of Autechre heard the EP, and suggested that the band get in touch with SKAM Records, whose first release had been Booth&#x27;s &quot;LEGO Feet&quot; album in 1991. SKAM released &quot;Hi Scores&quot;, and invited the band to produce a full-length follow-up. At the same time, the band established a relationship with Warp Records, who also wished to release an album by the band. As a compromise, the album would eventually be jointly released by both labels.

== Production and recording ==

The album was recorded in the duo&#x27;s studio in Pentland Hills, which had been described as a &quot;bunker&quot; by various media publications. The duo described this as &quot;just an exaggeration on the part of the record label&quot; in an interview around the time of the album&#x27;s release.

The album features the duo utilizing samplers, intentionally detuned vintage synthesizers, drum machines and reel to reel tape recorders. It also incorporates a wide variety of samples, including several from the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in tracks such as &quot;The Color of the Fire&quot; and &quot;Aquarius&quot;. The track &quot;Happy Cycling&quot; samples the sound of the red-legged seriema from Vangelis&#x27; score for the 1976 documentary &quot;La Fête sauvage&quot;.

During the production of the track &quot;Rue the Whirl&quot;, the studio&#x27;s window was left open, and the sound of birds was accidentally recorded into the track. The duo decided that the track was enhanced by the natural sounds, and left it in. &quot;Smokes Quantity&quot; first appeared on &quot;Twoism&quot; in 1995.

In interviews, the band has identified Devo, Wendy Carlos, DAF, TV and film soundtracks, Jeff Wayne, Julian Cope, My Bloody Valentine, 1980s pop music, and Seefeel as influences of the album&#x27;s sound. According to Eoin, the band was uninterested in the styles of electronic music that were popular at the time of the album&#x27;s creation, and that creating dance music was not a priority for them.

According to the band, the songs&#x27; titles contain &quot;cryptic references that the listener might understand or might not,&quot; many of them personal to the band. For example, the album&#x27;s title is a reference to the duo&#x27;s &quot;intention to affect the audience using sound&quot;. &quot;Pete Standing Alone&quot; shares its name with the main character of the documentary &quot;Circle of the Sun&quot; (1960) directed by Colin Low and released by the National Film Board of Canada. Pete is also the Great Uncle of Renowned Blackfoot artist Terrance Houle from Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

== Album art and packaging ==
The album cover is a modified version of a family photo taken at Banff Springs in Alberta, Canada.
The original CD was released in a traditional jewel case, while the 2004 re-release was packaged in digipak format. &quot;Happy Cycling&quot; was mistakenly left off 500 copies of the initial North American release of the album despite the artwork indicating that the song was included. The vinyl record was released in a gatefold sleeve with a sticker that wrote the band&#x27;s name in braille attached to it.

== Critical reception ==
The album received widespread acclaim upon release. In 2014, AllMusic called it &quot;a landmark for electronic listening music that was widely copied.&quot; &quot;Fact&quot; called it &quot;an adult meditation on childhood, concerned with play, naïveté and nostalgia, all tinted with rosy pastoralism,&quot; but &quot;also devilishly subtle, intricate and emotionally mature.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the album as &quot;nestled somewhere in between the warm hues of 1970s flocked wallpaper and the sleek electronic sheen of the future.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that the duo &quot;tapped into the collective unconscious of those who grew up in the English speaking West and were talented enough to transcribe the soundtrack.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==
Since its release, the album has been included in several lists of greatest albums of all time. &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; featured at number 26 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;The 150 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot; list, as well as number 2 on its &quot;50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot; list released in 2017. It was ranked number 91 in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Modern Classics&quot; list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

The album has been noted as a major influence on the electronic music genre. &quot;Fact&quot; magazine identified Lone, Gold Panda, Lapalux, Tim Hecker, Leyland Kirby, Bibio, Four Tet, and Ulrich Schnauss as musicians directly influenced by the album, calling it not &quot;just a classic album or many people&#x27;s personal favourite,&quot; but also &quot;an artifact in its own lifetime, a present-day relic that recalls an innocent time in more ways than one.&quot;

<text>The was a law enacted by the Diet of Japan that brought many of Japan&#x27;s private railway lines under national control. The 22nd Diet passed the bill on March 27, 1906 and Emperor Meiji signed on March 30, 1906. The promulgation of the act on the Official Gazette occurred the next day. The Act was repealed by Article 110 of the Act for Enforcement of Japanese National Railways Reform Act Etc. (Act No. 93 of 1986).

The original bill which passed the House of Representatives on March 16, 1906 listed 32 private railways to be nationalized, but the House of Peers amended the bill removing 15 companies from the list on March 27, 1906 and the House of Representatives accepted this amendment the same day.

<text>Events from the year 1783 in Canada.

==Incumbents==
==Events==
* January 20 – Preliminaries of peace are signed between Great Britain and the United States.
* September 3 – American independence is formally recognized at the Treaty of Paris.
** Treaty of Paris gives Americans fishing rights off Newfoundland.
** The success of the rebellious 13 American colonies leaves the British with the poorest remnants of their New World empire and the determination to prevent a second revolution. However, they have to accommodate the roughly 50,000 refugees from the American Revolution who settle in Nova Scotia and the upper St. Lawrence. These United Empire Loyalists soon begin to agitate for the political and property rights they had previously enjoyed in the thirteen colonies.
** British North America consists of the colonies and territories of the British Empire in continental North America after the end of the American Revolutionary War and the recognition of American independence.
* More than 5,000 Black People leave the United States to live in the Maritimes, Quebec and Ontario. Having sided with the British during the American War of Independence, they come to Canada as United Empire Loyalists, some as free men and some as slaves. Although promised land by the British, they receive only varying amounts of poor-quality land, and, in fact, some receive none at all.
* In Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, Rose Fortune becomes Canada&#x27;s first policewoman.
* The border between Canada and the U.S. is accepted from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake of the Woods.
* In the area around the mouth of the Saint John River, those who fled the thirteen American colonies by 1783 are called United Empire Loyalists. Those who arrived after 1783 were called Late Loyalists.
* Pennsylvania Germans begin moving into southwestern Ontario.
* The North West Company is formed.
* Vermont delays entering the Union, because Congress is partial to New York, and because of the General Government&#x27;s indebtedness, for which Vermont is not bound.

==Births==
*April 26 – Peter Boyle de Blaquière, political figure and first chancellor of the University of Toronto (d.1860)

==Death==
Paul Jackson

<text>Fo Guang Shan Hsi Lai Temple () is a mountain monastery in the northern Puente Hills, Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles County, California. The name &quot;Hsi Lai&quot; means &quot;coming west&quot;. 

Hsi Lai Temple is a branch of Fo Guang Shan, a Buddhist organization from Taiwan. It is the order&#x27;s first overseas branch temple and serves as the North American regional headquarters for Fo Guang Shan. Hsi Lai Temple was the site of the founding of Buddha&#x27;s Light International Association, established in 1991. The temple, like its mother temple in Taiwan, practices Humanistic Buddhism.

==History==

In 1976, Master Hsing Yun, the founder of the order, represented a Buddhist group from Taiwan to participate in America&#x27;s bicentennial celebration. Master Hsing Yun was asked by American friends to build a monastery in the United States. Therefore, Fo Guang Shan asked the Venerable Tzu Chuang (who, upon the inception of the temple, became the founding and first abbess of Hsi Lai Temple) and Yi Heng to plan and organize the construction of the temple in the Greater Los Angeles area. It was officially chartered in the state of California under the name of &quot;International Buddhist Progress Society.&quot; Until the temple was complete, Ven. Tzu Chuang bought an old church building, which was to be Hsi Lai&#x27;s temporary headquarters. The original temple, located in the city of Maywood, was called the &quot;Bai Ta&quot; (White Pagoda) Temple.

The planning and construction of the temple in the 1980s was met with suspicion and resistance from local communities, many of whom knew little about Buddhism and had unfounded fears of Buddhist practices. Many residents felt that the project was too big for a neighborhood of single-family homes and that the traditional Chinese architectural style would not fit in. The main reasons for resistance to the building of the temple were the impact of weekly services, heavy traffic, noise, and concern about environmental damage.

Originally, the organization had planned to build the temple in Gardena, California but was blocked from acquiring land. They also tried to acquire the historical Pyrenees Castle in Alhambra, California, but also met opposition from the community. The building of the temple at its current location survived six public hearings and more than 100 community meetings. In 1985, the temple was finally granted a building permit. The groundbreaking ceremony was held the following year, and the temple was completed on November 26, 1988.

Negative feelings about the building of Hsi Lai have since diminished, as the general level of awareness has been raised and as the temple and its residents have proven to be good neighbors. In addition, most of the original complainants of the temple project moved out of Hacienda Heights.

Immediately after its opening, Hsi Lai Temple was the venue of many major events. The 16th General Conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists and the 7th conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhist Youth were held from November 19 to 26, an international Triple Platform Full Ordination Ceremony for monastics was held for over a month, and a Land and Water Dharma Service was held prior to the temple&#x27;s opening.

In 2008, in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the opening of Hsi Lai Temple, another international Triple Platform Full Ordination Ceremony for monastics and a Land and Water Dharma Service were held.

In the summer of 2011, Hsi Lai Temple was the starting location for &quot;The Amazing Race 19&quot;.

On September 4, 2012, Hsi Lai Temple abbot Hsin Bau was elected to the post of head abbot of the Fo Guang Shan order, succeeding Hsin Pei.

==University of the West==

In 1990, following the completion of Hsi Lai Temple, Master Hsing Yun founded &quot;Hsi Lai University&quot;, one of sixteen Buddhist colleges and universities operated by Fo Guang Shan. The university relocated to Rosemead, California, in 1996. It is one of the first Buddhist colleges in the United States.

Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctorate in Buddhist studies, comparative religious studies, and a Master of Business Administration are available at the university.

In 2004, the university changed its name to the &quot;University of the West&quot; and appointed Dr. Lewis Lancaster, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and longtime member of Fo Guang Shan, as president. Dr. Roger Schmidt became Lancaster&#x27;s successor in 2006, and was replaced by Dr. Allen M. Huang a year later.

==Sites==
*The Bodhisattva Hall (五聖殿): The first shrine before entering the temple. It is a large hall that honors five Bodhisattvas: Samantabhadra, Ksitigarbha, Maitreya, Avalokitesvara, and Manjusri. Outside the shrine on each side are the temple guardians, Skanda and Sangharama (portrayed as Guan Yu).

== Retreats and education ==
The temple offers a wide variety of retreats and classes in English and Chinese to promote Humanistic Buddhism and has started an extended retreat program for those who want to experience monastic life for a longer period of time.

Hsi Lai Temple offers community service to a variety of people in need of hours. Jobs range from cleaning and sweeping around the temple to serving lunch in the dining room.

==1996 campaign finance controversy==

A campaign finance controversy centered on Hsi Lai Temple erupted during the 1996 United States presidential election. Then-incumbent Vice President Al Gore attended a luncheon at the temple, becoming the highest known government official to visit the temple. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Maria Hsia solicited $55,000 in donations for the Democratic National Committee the following day, which were later reimbursed with money donated by the temple. Non-profit groups such as Hsi Lai Temple are not allowed to make political contributions. Hsia was eventually convicted by a jury in March 2000 of making five false statements to the Federal Elections Commission and sentenced to 90 days home detention, a fine, and community service. The Democratic National Committee returned the money donated by the temple&#x27;s monks and nuns. Twelve nuns and employees of the temple, including then-abbess Venerable Yi Kung who would later resign from the abbotship because of the scandal, refused to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment when they were subpoenaed to testify before Congress in 1997.

Following Hsia&#x27;s conviction, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said, &quot;it&#x27;s time to get beyond the small fry and take on the major players (in the scandal) like Al Gore.&quot; No other players in the controversy were ever convicted.

<doc id="487794" wikidata="Q643562" url="?curid=487794" title="Zayed International Airport">
<text>Zayed International Airport (), also known as Abu Dhabi International Airport, is the primary international airport serving Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is the second busiest airport in the UAE after Dubai International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the Middle East and is the hub for Etihad Airways as well as an operating base for Wizz Air Abu Dhabi and Air Arabia Abu Dhabi.

The airport is located east of Abu Dhabi, and covers an area of . The airport is served by 24 airlines which fly to 128 destinations. The airport was renamed to Zayed International Airport on 9 February 2024 after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE&#x27;s founder.

==History==
===Early years===
The airport was first conceived in 1974 as part of the government&#x27;s modernization plans. At the time, Al Bateen Executive Airport (then called Abu Dhabi International Airport) was the main international airport (in addition to Abu Dhabi Airfield). Access was difficult as it was located on Abu Dhabi Island which was connected to the mainland by only one bridge. Also, the city was growing, making it harder for the airport to expand. During the late 1970s, a more accessible location was found. Construction started in 1979 and the airport was inaugurated on January 2, 1982. Gulf Air, then a quadri-national airline, chose the airport as one of its four hubs.

The new airport included a circular satellite terminal (with aerobridges) with a single connection to a semi-circular terminal. This design allowed more aircraft to park simultaneously. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, substantial work was carried out on the satellite terminal, to cater for the increase in passenger numbers, including widening the passenger waiting areas and creating extra parking spots. The main terminal also underwent some external changes, especially on the outer facade.

===Development since the 2000s===
In 2003, Etihad Airways was founded via a royal decree by UAE president Khalifa Al-Nahyan, and became the new airline based in the airport. The UAE government later ended its ownership of Gulf Air in 2005; previous Gulf Air CEO James Hogan was appointed as Etihad&#x27;s new CEO.

Terminal 2 was opened in September 2005 to ease pressure on the main terminal. Terminal 2 did not have aerobridges and utilised buses to move passengers between aircraft and the terminal building. A second runway (Runway 13L/31R) was opened in October 2008 to cater to increased traffic. Terminal 3 was opened in January 2009. It was primarily used by Etihad Airways. The new Terminal 3, a AED 1 billion (US$270 million) interim facility, was designed to allow for the airport&#x27;s passenger growth before the planned opening of the new Midfield Terminal in December 2017 (which was eventually opened in November 2023). Used predominantly by Etihad Airways, the terminal boosted the airport&#x27;s seven million passenger per year capacity to 12 million. It also added 10 new gates, two of which are Airbus A380 compatible.

During the airport&#x27;s early years of operation, there was no way of getting to the airport except for private vehicle or taxis. With the creation of Abu Dhabi&#x27;s bus network in the late 2000s and 2010s, city-to-airport bus services were introduced.

In December 2011, the government of Abu Dhabi signed a letter of intent to build a United States border preclearance facility similar to pre-clearance customs facilities in Canada, Aruba, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Ireland. Etihad operated its first flight to the U.S. from the facility on January 25, 2014. In 2011, the airport was recognised as the second Best Airport in Middle East at the Airport Service Quality Awards by Airports Council International. The airport celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2012.

Rotana Jet was another airline based at the airport; however, it suspended all flights indefinitely in 2017.

==Terminals==
Since late 2023, all flights at Abu Dhabi International Airport operate out of Terminal A, while the former terminals have been closed.

===Terminal A===


After several delays, development work started on a new passenger terminal, which was to be situated between the two runways and then known as the &quot;Midfield Terminal&quot;. The Midfield Terminal has increased the airport&#x27;s passenger capacity to more than 45 million per year, with options for this to double in capacity to 60 million. An additional facility is under consideration that would take the capacity to 80 million. The new facility covers a floor area of over , making it one of the largest airport terminal buildings in the world. It is capable of handling 79 Airbus A380-type aircraft and 11,000 passengers at peak hours. Equipped with modern and advanced facilities, it also has biometric technology to enable the screening and boarding processes to proceed faster. It has 35,000 square metres of retail and commercial space and 163 outlets. The general exterior of the terminal was designed by international architecture firm, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.

The new terminal was due to open on 7 July 2017, then pushed back to early 2019 in time for the 2019 Special Olympics, then delayed again until the final quarter of 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening date was pushed back to sometime in mid-to-late 2021; then, on 5 July 2021, a major construction contract was cancelled. The contract was with a consortium which comprises United Arab Emirates-based Arabtec, Turkey&#x27;s TAV Insaat and Athens-based Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC), with Abu Dhabi-headquartered Trojan, had been awarded the contract to finish the terminal&#x27;s construction instead.

In early 2023, it was reported that the Midfield Terminal would open by the end of 2023. On August 31, 2023, Abu Dhabi Airports announced that the new terminal, now named Terminal A, would open in &#x27;early November&#x27; the same year. It was also reported that Etihad Airways, the main carrier based in the airport, would move its operations to the new terminal once opened, alongside other airlines based in Abu Dhabi, including Air Arabia Abu Dhabi and Wizz Air Abu Dhabi.

A scene in the film &quot;&quot; was filmed at the terminal before it officially opened.

On 31 October 2023, the terminal was officially opened. All operating airlines shifted their operations gradually to the new terminal from the former three terminals. Etihad operated the first flight from the terminal on 31 October. Wizz Air Abu Dhabi and 15 other international airlines started to operate to and from the new terminal on 1 November. From 9 November, Etihad Airways operated 16 daily flights before completing its transition to this terminal on 14 November, together with Air Arabia Abu Dhabi and ten other airlines. From 14 November onwards, all airlines began operating from Terminal A.

As part of the construction of the new terminal various biometric systems were installed. In July 2024 the airport inaugurated the &quot;Smart Travel&quot; project, which uses biometric data collected on arrival to the UAE to validate the identities of passengers at the stations, circumventing the need to check tickets and travel documents. It was first launched on some flights, mainly those operated by Ethiad, and it is planned to be extended across the airport by 2025.

===Former terminals===


The airport formerly consisted of three terminals from different periods which had been significantly expanded over time. They were replaced by the new Terminal A in early 2024.
;Terminal 1

This was the oldest facility, featuring a bi-level arrivals and departures area. The nine main gates (3–11) were equipped with jetbridges and located in a circular gate area while the check-in and arrivals facilities were located in a separate main building. There were also several bus boarding gates (gates 14–22), and passengers whose planes arrive at a remote stand were bused here.

;Terminal 2
Terminal 2 was a newer facility to the east of Terminal 1 and was not connected to it. It featured 19 check-in counters, 3 bus-boarding gates (gates 24–26) and two baggage claim belts and was mostly used by low-cost carriers to/from south Asia.

;Terminal 3
Terminal 3 was the newest addition of the old terminal area and was a direct expansion to the western side of Terminal 1. It is a brick-shaped, bi-level facility featuring a duty-free and food court area as well as departure gates 32–35 and 58–61, and bus gates 28–31 and 36–57. The majority of passengers were bused to their airplanes as only 8 of its 34 gates are equipped with jetbridges. Terminal 3 was capable of handling the Airbus A380s, and was used almost entirely by Etihad Airways.

;City terminals
Until 2019, a check-in facility was operated in downtown Abu Dhabi, for travelers who wanted to check in at the downtown city centre before they travelled to the airport. This facility, known as the City Terminal, resembled an airport terminal building with lounge and transport facilities. After having checked in at the City Terminal, travellers could arrive at the airport just one hour before the departure of their flight. A further check-in facility was operated by Etihad Airways at the Etihad Travel Mall on the outskirts of Dubai near Noor Bank metro station.

==Facilities==
===US border preclearance===
Zayed International Airport has had United States border preclearance facilities since 26 January 2014, the only airport in the Middle East to have such a facility. Passengers on select flights to the United States are processed for entry before they board their flight so that when they arrive in the U.S. they are treated as domestic arrivals. Since October 31, 2024, preclearence is available on all Etihad flights to the United States in the new US Preclearance Facility in Terminal A. This facility is similar to those in selected Canadian, Caribbean and Irish airports.

===Runways===
Abu Dhabi International Airport has two-parallel runways in use: runway 13R/31L, , runway 13L/31R, . Both the runways can cater to all types of aircraft including Code-F aircraft like Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 and both are equipped with CAT IIIB ILS. The runways also feature an associated parallel taxiway and two cross-field taxiways on the east linking the new runway to the existing north runway and the aprons at Terminal A.

===Expansion===
The expansion master plan projects include a third parallel runway, from the existing runways, a new tower between the two runways with the new air traffic control centre, enhanced cargo and maintenance facilities, and other commercial developments on the land immediately adjacent to and north of the airport. Having a total of of vast land area, the ambitious project will provide a home base for the UAE&#x27;s national carrier, Etihad Airways, which will be a major user of new cargo facilities with an ultimate handling capacity of around two million tonnes of freight a year. Close to the new cargo facilities, land has been allocated for commercial activities, business parks, and property developments. Aircraft maintenance facilities will continue to be concentrated on the south side of the existing airport. The plan sets aside land for the growth of other operators such as Royal Jet and Abu Dhabi Aviation. Among other aspects of the project, when completed, are the design of remote aircraft stands complete with airfield ground lighting and hydrant fuel.

The Abu Dhabi Department of Transport does provide overall seven bus routes from the airport throughout Abu Dhabi and its surroundings, including lines &quot;A1&quot; and &quot;A2&quot; which lead to the city center and run 24 hours per day. Etihad Airways additionally provides a coach service for its passengers from Zayed International Airport to Al Ain and Downtown Dubai.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 25 October 1977, Saif Ghubash was shot dead at the airport by a Palestinian gunman who lived in Syria, in an attempt to assassinate Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam.
* On 23 September 1983, Gulf Air Flight 771 crashed while on approach to Zayed International Airport. All 112 passengers and crew on board were killed. A bomb going off in the baggage hold of the aircraft was the cause of the accident.
* In May 1997, a Gulf Air plane from Bombay airport crashed at the airport. No deaths were reported.
* On 26 July 2018, Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed to have launched a drone attack at the airport. The UAE denied there was any drone attack but stated earlier that there was an &quot;incident&quot; involving a truck which did not disrupt flights or cause any delays. Two other alleged claims on a drone attack on the airport were reported by the Houthis, as well as two attacks on Dubai International Airport, all which were denied and unverified. An investigation by Bellingcat concluded that it was highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. According to Reuters, the UAE has an advanced air defense system which utilizes Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), designed to destroy short and intermediary range missiles. In 2019, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a Houthi drone had exploded at the airport. In May 2019, the Houthi-run Almasirah TV channel broadcast alleged footage of the July 2018 attack.
* On January 17, 2022, a drone strike claimed by Yemen&#x27;s Iran-aligned Houthi group caused three fuel trucks to catch fire at an oil tanker facility in Abu Dhabi, and at the same time a fire was separately ignited at an extension of the airport, causing minor flight delays.

<text>Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park is a man-made recreational area in San Dimas, California, United States, in Los Angeles County. It is near the Orange Freeway (State Route 57), the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) and the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10). It is named after former LA County Supervisor Frank G. Bonelli.

The park contains a lake called Puddingstone Reservoir, which provides a place for fishing, swimming, sailing, wind surfing, boating, and jet skiing, along with a waterfall.

Other recreation in the park includes kayak rentals (by Wheel Fun), RV campgrounds adjacent to the park (separate facility), six playgrounds, barbecues, hiking, biking, family picnic areas, and private picnic areas for company picnics, company parties, church picnics and other group events or gatherings. The private areas are run exclusively by James Events, which has a contract with Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation. However, families and small groups may contact the park directly to reserve other areas of the park.

The park is adjacent to one of the area&#x27;s largest water parks, Raging Waters.

The park will host mountain biking at the 2028 Summer Olympics.

<text>Events from the year 1791 in Canada.

==Incumbents==
*Monarch: George III

===Federal government===
*Parliament of Lower Canada — 1st
*Parliament of Upper Canada — 1st

===Governors===
*Governor of the Canadas: Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester
*Governor of New Brunswick: Thomas Carleton
*Governor of Nova Scotia: John Parr
*Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland: John Elliot
*Governor of St. John&#x27;s Island: Edmund Fanning

==Events==
* 1791–95 – British Captain George Vancouver explores Northwest Coast exhaustively with two ships, but finds no Northwest Passage.
* Edmund Burke supports the proposed constitution for Canada, saying that: &quot;To attempt to amalgamate two populations, composed of races of men diverse in language, laws and habitudes, is a complete absurdity. Let the proposed constitution be founded on man&#x27;s nature, the only solid basis for an enduring government.&quot;
* Charles James Fox declares that &quot;Canada ought to remain attached to Great Britain through the good-will of the Canadians alone.&quot;
* Lord Grenville, denying that Canadian attachment to French jurisprudence is due to prejudice, says it is founded &quot;on the noblest sentiments of the human breast.&quot;
* George Vancouver leaves England to explore the west coast; Alejandro Malaspina also explores the northwest coast for Spain.
* In response to Loyalist demands, the Constitutional Act 1791 divides Quebec into Lower Canada (mostly French) and Upper Canada (mostly English who recently migrated from America). In so doing, the Crown hopes to create a stable society that is distinctly non-American. Although French-Canadians retain the privileges granted by the Quebec Act, the Anglican church receives preferred status, including the clergy reserves.
An Anglo-French colonial aristocracy of rich merchants, leading officials, and landholders is expected to work with the royal governors to ensure proper order. Legislative assemblies, although elected by propertied voters, have little real power.
* Population of Lower Canada is 160,000. Population of Upper Canada is 14,000.

==Births==
*January 5 – John Bethune, Anglican clergyman (d. 1872)
*February 6 – Charles Richard Ogden, Joint Premier of the Province of Canada (d. 1866)
*July 26 – Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto, lawyer, judge and political figure (d. 1863)
*November 28 – John Cook, politician Ontarian (d. 1877)

<doc id="487815" wikidata="Q116896031" url="?curid=487815" title="Railway Construction Act">
<text>The was promulgated by the Diet of Japan on June 21, 1892, and designated government support for a network of thirty-three railway lines covering most of Japan, with the exception of Hokkaidō. On April 11, 1922, the Diet amended the law to add an additional network of regional and local routes. Today, these lines form the backbone of the national railway network, JR (although JR has relinquished control of some of the more minor ones).

<text>Heirisson Island is an artificially created island in the Swan River in Western Australia at the eastern end of Perth Water, within the suburb of East Perth. It occupies an area of , and is connected to the two foreshores by the Causeway and the Boorloo Bridge. The next upstream island is Kuljak Island, then Ron Courtney Island, with no islands in the Swan River downstream between Heirisson Island and the Indian Ocean other than the artificial islet in Elizabeth Quay. 

Before development, there were several small islands, surrounded by mudflats. Over the years, dredging and reclamation has created a single island, which is now a landscaped nature reserve, with a walking path. The Noongar name for the area is (meaning &#x27;leg deep&#x27;), which has been retained for the single island after reclamation.

Heirisson Island is listed on the Western Australia Department of Aboriginal Affairs&#x27; Register of Aboriginal Sites, as ID 3589.

==History==

Heirisson Island originally consisted of six separate smaller islands surrounded by mudflats. By the 1940s, land reclamation and dredging of the Swan River to create two navigable channels saw the islands coalesce into one large island.

The area around Heirisson Island is traditionally associated with the Beeloo people, a subgroup of the Whadjuk Noongar, who knew the small islands and mudflats as , referring to the river as being &quot;one leg deep&quot;. The island located on either side of the current causeway bridge was known as . The mudflats were the first major crossing point upriver from the river&#x27;s mouth (at Fremantle) and were an important seasonal access way over which the Beeloo gave other groups right of passage across the river.

The first European to visit the Heirisson Island area was the Flemish explorer Willem de Vlamingh in January 1697. He was exploring the Swan River in longboats but only got as far as the Heirisson Island(s) because the mudflats impeded any further progress. Heirisson Island was subsequently named after French midshipman who was on the French ship &quot;Le Naturaliste&quot; on a scientific expedition led by Nicolas Baudin between 1801 and 1804. The expedition made several journeys up the river from Fremantle in longboats and made the first maps of the Swan River. The islands were named in June 1801. Captain James Stirling later investigated the area in 1827 just before the Swan River Colony was settled in 1829.

Before becoming a reserve the islands had been host to a shanty town and animals were seen grazing on the islands as late as the 1920s. In the late-1940s plans were drawn for the development of an extensive sporting complex on the now singular island which was envisioned to feature an athletics stadium, an Olympic swimming pool, and 18 tennis courts; however the venture was dropped following a potential cost blowout. Other proposals for the island throughout the years include those for a motel, a golf course, a caravan park, and a cultural centre with museums and concert halls. In 1966, it was proposed to develop Heirisson Island into an aerodrome for VTOL aircraft. There were also plans to fill in the western channel of the Swan River and join the island to East Perth.
In September 1984 the Government of Western Australia erected a statue of Aboriginal warrior Yagan on the island. In 1997 the statue&#x27;s head was twice removed by vandals.

In 1998, five female western grey kangaroos were introduced onto the island, followed by a female with a male joey in 2000.

In 2008 a new master plan for Heirisson Island was adopted by the City of Perth which proposed establishing an international quality sculpture park on the island as well as constructing an amphitheatre and a footbridge that would link Point Fraser to Heirisson Island. The plan faced opposition from Aboriginal elders, and as of December 2022 the sculpture park and amphitheatre have yet to be established.

In December 2022, the construction of the Boorloo Bridge was approved to connect Point Fraser and McCallum Park in Victoria Park via Heirisson Island. The $100 million pedestrian and cycling bridge project began construction in November 2023, and opened on 22 December 2024.

==Aboriginal protests==

Heirisson Island has been the site of a number of protests by Australian Aboriginal activists.

===Tent embassy===
In 2012, the island was the site of a tent embassy, set up in February by Noongar people to raise community awareness about problems with a government plan to extinguish most of the native title land in the southwest of Western Australia that was recognised in 2006 by Justice Murray Wilcox of the Federal Court of Australia. The Noongar Tent Embassy was intended to be a peaceful affirmation of native title to Noongar country and legitimate use of a state-registered Aboriginal heritage site, and was inspired by the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra. However, there were many claims made of rocks being thrown at passing boats. The tent embassy was removed by police in March 2012.

===Refugee camp===

In early March 2015, a group of Aboriginal activists set up what they referred to as a refugee camp after the state government announced plans to close some remote Western Australian Aboriginal communities. The camp was removed ten days later by City of Perth rangers, with police support, but gradually reassembled and was occupied by about 100 people when it was dismantled again by police and City of Perth rangers in late April 2015.

In January 2016 a group of about 60 peopleincluding some non-indigenous homeless peoplewere camping on the island again. By April 2016, the camp had grown to over 100 and it was again removed by police and rangers.

<text>Libéral Bruant (; c. 1635 – 22 November 1697) was a French architect best known as the designer of the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris. Bruant was the most notable member in a family that produced a long series of architects active from the 16th to the 18th century.

== Biography ==
In 1660, Bruant was the architect chosen for rehabilitations to Louis XIII&#x27;s old arsenal (the &quot;Salpêtrière&quot;), which was being converted into what would become the world&#x27;s largest hospice. It is now the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.

He designed the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, which is now dominated by the dome erected by Jules Hardouin Mansart, his collaborator in earlier stages of the construction.

In the Marais district of Paris, the &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; Bruant built for himself in 1685, at 1 rue de la Perle now houses the Bricard Lock Museum (Musée de la Serrure). Its Baroque façade of golden limestone is enlivened by windows set into blind arches that march across its front and busts in oval reserves, all under a richly-sculptured pediment that is pierced by an oval window.

In 1671, he became one of the first eight members of the Académie royale d&#x27;architecture, created by Louis XIV.

Bruant died on 22 November 1697, in Paris.

== Architectural style ==
A comparison of Bruant&#x27;s central entrance to the Invalides, under an arched cornice packed with military trophies with Mansart&#x27;s &quot;Église du Dome&quot;, gives a clear idea of the difference between Bruant&#x27;s High Baroque and Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s restrained and somewhat academic Late Baroque.

<doc id="487841" wikidata="Q75855" url="?curid=487841" title="Cerebrum">
<text>The cerebrum (: cerebra), telencephalon or endbrain is the largest part of the brain, containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres) as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In the human brain, the cerebrum is the uppermost region of the central nervous system. The cerebrum develops prenatally from the forebrain (prosencephalon). In mammals, the dorsal telencephalon, or pallium, develops into the cerebral cortex, and the ventral telencephalon, or subpallium, becomes the basal ganglia. The cerebrum is also divided into approximately symmetric left and right cerebral hemispheres.

With the assistance of the cerebellum, the cerebrum controls all voluntary actions in the human body.

== Structure ==

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. Depending upon the position of the animal, it lies either in front or on top of the brainstem. In humans, the cerebrum is the largest and best-developed of the five major divisions of the brain.

The cerebrum is made up of the two cerebral hemispheres and their cerebral cortices (the outer layers of grey matter), and the underlying regions of white matter. Its subcortical structures include the hippocampus, basal ganglia and olfactory bulb. The cerebrum consists of two C-shaped cerebral hemispheres, separated from each other by a deep fissure called the longitudinal fissure.

===Cerebral cortex===

The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of grey matter of the cerebrum, is found only in mammals. In larger mammals, including humans, the surface of the cerebral cortex folds to create gyri (ridges) and sulci (furrows) which increase the surface area.

The cerebral cortex is generally classified into four lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. The lobes are classified based on their overlying neurocranial bones. A smaller lobe is the insular lobe, a part of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus that separates the temporal lobe from the parietal and frontal lobes, is located within each hemisphere of the mammalian brain.

===Cerebral hemispheres===
The cerebrum is divided by the medial longitudinal fissure into two cerebral hemispheres, the right and the left. The cerebrum is contralaterally organized, i.e., the right hemisphere controls and processes signals (predominantly) from the left side of the body, while the left hemisphere controls and processes signals (predominantly) from the right side of the body. According to current knowledge, this is due to an axial twist that occurs in the early embryo. There is a strong but not complete bilateral symmetry between the hemispheres, while lateralization tends to increase with increasing brain size. The lateralization of brain function looks at the known and possible differences between the two.

==Development==
In the developing vertebrate embryo, the neural tube is subdivided into four unseparated sections which then develop further into distinct regions of the central nervous system; these are the prosencephalon (forebrain), the mesencephalon (midbrain) the rhombencephalon (hindbrain) and the spinal cord. The prosencephalon develops further into the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The dorsal telencephalon gives rise to the pallium (cerebral cortex in mammals and reptiles) and the ventral telencephalon generates the basal ganglia. The diencephalon develops into the thalamus and hypothalamus, including the optic vesicles (future retina). The dorsal telencephalon then forms two lateral telencephalic vesicles, separated by the midline, which develop into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Birds and fish have a dorsal telencephalon, like all vertebrates, but it is generally unlayered and therefore not considered a cerebral cortex. Only a layered cytoarchitecture can be considered a cortex.

== Functions ==
Note: As the cerebrum is a gross division with many subdivisions and sub-regions, it is important to state that this section lists only functions that the cerebrum &quot;as a whole&quot; serves. (See main articles on cerebral cortex and basal ganglia for more information.) The cerebrum is a major part of the brain, controlling emotions, hearing, vision, personality and much more. It controls all precision of voluntary actions, and it functions as the center of sensory perception, memory, thoughts and judgement; the cerebrum also functions as the center of voluntary motor activities.
===Motor functions===
Upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex send their axons to the brainstem and spinal cord to synapse on the lower motor neurons, which innervate the muscles. Damage to motor areas of the cortex can lead to certain types of motor neuron disease. This kind of damage results in loss of muscular power and precision rather than total paralysis.

===Sensory processing===
The primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex receive and process visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory information. Together with association cortical areas, these brain regions synthesize sensory information into our perceptions of the world.

=== Olfaction ===

The olfactory bulb, responsible for the sense of smell, takes up a large area of the cerebrum in most vertebrates. However, in humans, this part of the brain is much smaller and lies underneath the frontal lobe. The olfactory sensory system is unique since the neurons in the olfactory bulb send their axons directly to the olfactory cortex, rather than to the thalamus first. Olfaction is also the only sense that is represented by the ipsilateral side of the brain. Damage to the olfactory bulb results in a loss of olfaction (the sense of smell).

=== Language and communication ===

Speech and language are mainly attributed to parts of the cerebral cortex. Motor portions of language are attributed to Broca&#x27;s area within the frontal lobe. Speech comprehension is attributed to Wernicke&#x27;s area, at the temporal-parietal lobe junction. These two regions are interconnected by a large white matter tract, the arcuate fasciculus. Damage to the Broca&#x27;s area results in expressive aphasia (non-fluent aphasia) while damage to Wernicke&#x27;s area results in receptive aphasia (also called fluent aphasia).

=== Learning and memory ===

Explicit or declarative (factual) memory formation is attributed to the hippocampus and associated regions of the medial temporal lobe. This association was originally described after a patient known as HM had both his left and right hippocampus surgically removed to treat chronic [temporal lobe epilepsy]. After surgery, HM had anterograde amnesia, or the inability to form new memories.

Implicit or procedural memory, such as complex motor behaviors, involves the basal ganglia.

Short-term or working memory involves association areas of the cortex, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the hippocampus.

==Other animals==
In the most primitive vertebrates, the hagfishes and lampreys, the cerebrum is a relatively simple structure receiving nerve impulses from the olfactory bulb. In cartilaginous and lobe-finned fishes and also in amphibians, a more complex structure is present, with the cerebrum being divided into three distinct regions. The lowermost (or ventral) region forms the basal nuclei, and contains fibres connecting the rest of the cerebrum to the thalamus. Above this, and forming the lateral part of the cerebrum, is the &quot;paleopallium&quot;, while the uppermost (or dorsal) part is referred to as the &quot;archipallium&quot;. The cerebrum remains largely devoted to olfactory sensation in these animals, in contrast to its much wider range of functions in amniotes.

In ray-finned fishes, the structure is somewhat different. The inner surfaces of the lateral and ventral regions of the cerebrum bulge up into the ventricles; these include both the basal nuclei and the various parts of the pallium and may be complex in structure, especially in teleosts. The dorsal surface of the cerebrum is membranous, and does not contain any nervous tissue.

In the amniotes, the cerebrum becomes increasingly large and complex. In reptiles, the paleopallium is much larger than in amphibians and its growth has pushed the basal nuclei into the central regions of the cerebrum. As in the lower vertebrates, the grey matter is generally located beneath the white matter, but in some reptiles, it spreads out to the surface to form a primitive cortex, especially in the anterior part of the brain.

In mammals, this development proceeds further, so that the cortex covers almost the whole of the cerebral hemispheres, especially in more developed species, such as the primates. The paleopallium is pushed to the ventral surface of the brain, where it becomes the olfactory lobes, while the archipallium becomes rolled over at the medial dorsal edge to form the hippocampus. In placental mammals, a corpus callosum also develops, further connecting the two hemispheres. The complex convolutions of the cerebral surface (see gyrus, gyrification) are also found only in higher mammals. Although some large mammals (such as elephants) have particularly large cerebra, dolphins are the only species (other than humans) to have cerebra accounting for as much as 2 percent of their body weight.

The cerebra of birds are similarly enlarged to those of mammals, by comparison with reptiles. The increased size of bird brains was classically attributed to enlarged basal ganglia, with the other areas remaining primitive, but this view has been largely abandoned. Birds appear to have undergone an alternate process of encephalization, as they diverged from the other archosaurs, with few clear parallels to that experienced by mammals and their therapsid ancestors.

<text>Trinity is a fictional character in the &quot;Matrix&quot; franchise. She is portrayed by Carrie-Anne Moss in the films. In the gameplay segments of &quot;Path of Neo&quot;, she is voiced by Jennifer Hale. Trinity first appears in the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

==Character overview==
Like the series&#x27; other main characters, Trinity is a computer programmer and a hacker who has escaped from the Matrix, a sophisticated computer program where most humans are imprisoned. Though few specifics are revealed about her previous life inside the Matrix, it is told that she cracked a database so secure that she is famous among hackers, and that Morpheus, one of a number of real-world hovercraft commanders, initially identified her and helped her escape from the program. At the beginning of the series, she is first mate on Morpheus&#x27; &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; and serves mainly as a go-between for him and the individuals he wishes to free from the Matrix. As the series progresses, her primary importance as a character becomes her close relationship with John. She is skilled with computers, at operating vehicles both inside and outside the Matrix, and in martial arts.

==Role in the films==
===&quot;The Matrix&quot;===
Trinity is first introduced at the beginning of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, in a phone conversation with Cypher, which is heard offscreen. This cuts to a dingy hotel room fight scene between Trinity and a group of police officers. Also on hand are Agents, sentient programs that police the Matrix to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them.

Trinity is next seen communicating with Neo for Morpheus in several encounters. Eventually, she and the rest of the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;&#x27;s crew unplug Neo from the Matrix and begin his training as a new recruit in the war against the machines. She participates in several missions into the Matrix, including taking Neo to The Oracle, a sentient program inside the Matrix who seems, almost paradoxically, to possess greatly enhanced powers of intuition and foresight.

Throughout the film, it is apparent that Trinity has been in love with Neo from afar for some time, although she continues to conceal her feelings for him. Near the end of the first film, after he is killed by Agent Smith inside the Matrix, she speaks to his interfaced physical body and reveals that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with The One, a prophesied individual capable of manipulating the Matrix to an unprecedented degree. She then kisses him, whereupon he miraculously returns to life both in the real world and within the Matrix. The resurrected Neo easily defeats the three Agents and returns to his body back on the ship. The first film ends with Neo returning to the Matrix to show people still unknowingly trapped there what they, too, might achieve someday. This marks the beginning of a romantic relationship between Neo and Trinity which proves decisive in the outcome of the series.

===&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;===
In &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, the second film in the series, Trinity aids in the rescue of the Keymaker from the Merovingian and in the subsequent escape. Later, when the crews of the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; and two other ships team up to destroy an electric power station so that Neo can reach the Source (the machine mainframe), Trinity stays out of the Matrix at Neo&#x27;s request. However, she later enters the Matrix after the mission goes wrong and is mortally wounded by an Agent&#x27;s gunshot. At the same time, Neo is given a choice by the Architect between reaching the Source and preserving humanity, or returning to the Matrix to save Trinity. He chooses to save Trinity, interfacing with the computer code of her virtual self to extract the bullet and restart her heart.

===&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;===
In &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Matrix&quot; series, Trinity helps rescue Neo from a cut-off segment of the Matrix, where he is being held by a program in the employ of the Merovingian. In the real world, Trinity goes with Neo to the Machine City in an attempt to negotiate with the Machines. While attempting to evade Machine pursuers, their hovercraft crashes, and Trinity is fatally impaled by a piece of rebar. She dies in Neo&#x27;s arms, and he negotiates a truce with the Machines to enter the Matrix and wipe out the Agent Smith infection. Afterward, the Architect meets with the Oracle and promises that any humans wishing to leave the Matrix will be freed.

===&quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;===

In the fourth film &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, during the 60 year time period after Trinity&#x27;s death in the Machine City, and the subsequent end of the Machine War, her body was recovered by the machines and is revived, only appearing to age twenty years due to the machine&#x27;s modifications. Trinity was reinserted into the Matrix, where she was given the name &quot;Tiffany&quot; and became a married mother of three. She kept her penchant for motorcycles, working in a motorcycle workshop. She comes into contact with Neo at Simulatte, as his original identity of Thomas Anderson and she begins to feel that something is not right with her life.

After Neo is reawakened, he sees Trinity still-plugged-in body in a pod across from him before he is retrieved by machines allied to the humans. Neo enacts a plan to rescue her, but is interrupted by the Analyst; who enters Bullet Time to stop Neo and Trinity from reaching each other. The Analyst reveals that as a machine he had rebuilt Neo and Trinity in the real world by discovering that by keeping Neo and Trinity close but not too close to each other they generated a new form of energy that could give more power to the machines when channeled through the Matrix. Then he built a new matrix with that in mind, posing as its new Architect. In order to keep them subdued, the Analyst suppressed all memories of their life before reinsertion and invented a family for Tiffany in order to dissuade Neo from attempting to form a romantic relationship with her, while himself posing as a therapist for Neo. He also created an illusion that covered their real faces.

After Sati contacts Niobe, Neo enacts a new plan to rescue Trinity, agreeing to the Analyst&#x27;s terms that if Trinity chooses to remain Tiffany, then he will surrender. Tiffany arrives at Simulatte and she appears to reject Neo. However, before her husband can take her from Simulatte, Trinity wakes up and rejects the life created by the Analyst. The Analyst enters Bullet Time again to try and kill Trinity, but is killed by Smith; who can also enter Bullet Time, with a purging gun. Trinity and Neo fight the Analyst&#x27;s and suites forces and escape into a skyscraper, where they are pursued by helicopters. Neo destroys the helicopters, but they are surrounded by police. Neo and Trinity jump from the building, and Trinity is revealed to have developed the ability to fly on her own and they do not die as she saw in her nightmare.

After Trinity is released from the Matrix, she embraces Neo. They re-enter the Matrix to tell the (apparently) alive Analyst that they plan on redesigning the Matrix as they see fit and to warn him to stay out of their way and the Analyst mentions that the leaders of machines, &quot;the suits&quot;, did not purge him. The two then fly off together, circling each other while holding hands.

==Other appearances==
In the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, Trinity appears in a scene where she faces off against Ghost in a practice spar, the two subsequently discussing their shared belief that Neo can defeat the Machines. Over the course of the game, it is heavily implied, although never expressly stated, that Ghost is in love with Trinity, but that she regards him as a brother for their having been freed from the Matrix at or near the same time.

Her role in &quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot; is relatively similar to her appearances with Neo in the films; she has a spar with him during his sword-fighting training, accompanies him during the raid on the military building to rescue Morpheus (subsequently helping him to defeat an Agent on the rooftop), and is later rescued by him from some attacking Agents after the last meeting with the assorted ship captains.

Trinity also appears in &quot;The Animatrix&quot; and The Matrix Comics.

In 2025, the character appeared in a Lay&#x27;s commercial alongside Keegan-Michael Key as Morpheus. It was directed by Taika Waititi.

===&quot;The Matrix Online&quot;===
Despite having &quot;died&quot; during the course of the third film, Trinity made a return to the series in the official continuation, &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;. Taking on a major role in the game&#x27;s final chapters it is revealed both she and Neo are actually the culmination of decades of Machine research into translating human DNA perfectly into Machine code, allowing them to interface directly with technology without the need for simulated interfaces. Originally developed by The Oracle, this program is called The Biological Interface Program and is strongly sought after by the Oligarchy as a means to transfer their digital minds to physical bodies instead of the mechanical androids they had developed.

Without a physical form, Trinity takes the appearance of a floating figure made of golden code when within The Matrix. Initially distraught with her condition, she eventually finds solace in the fact her existence is the key to finally rebooting the Matrix and erasing Oligarch override control once and for all.

She ultimately meets her end in the &quot;Source of The Matrix&quot;, merging with a human inside the core of the Machine code base itself, combining the three core groups; Man, Machine and Program. This initializes the final reboot sequence, removing the Oligarch control and allowing the Machines to finally exist without fear of cruel masters.

==Casting choices==

A certain number of actresses were considered for the role of Trinity. They include: Jennifer Connelly, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Janet Jackson, Marisa Tomei, Demi Moore, Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lopez, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Drew Barrymore, Gabrielle Union, Kate Hudson, Uma Thurman, Jennifer Beals, Mariska Hargitay, Lucy Liu, Courteney Cox, Angie Harmon, Ming-Na Wen, Elizabeth Hurley, Sandra Bullock, Gillian Anderson, Heather Graham, Rosie Perez, Winona Ryder as well as Madonna who has revealed that she had turned the role down and has admitted regretting that decision.

==Name==
The name &quot;Trinity&quot; is heavily associated with Christian theology, which involves the Trinity: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. When she cracks the IRS database before her release from the Matrix, she chooses the hacker handle &quot;Trinity&quot; to imply that she is as enigmatic as the concept of a &quot;Three-In-One Being&quot;. Trinity is the force who guides Neo to his &quot;salvation,&quot; as well as commanding Neo to rise up from his apparent death in the first film, implying a further parallel between her character and God.

The name Trinity increased in popularity as a given name for female babies born after the release of &quot;The Matrix&quot; in 1999. In the United States, the name had been increasing in popularity throughout the 1990s, and was the 523rd most popular by 1998. In 1999 it was 209th, and in 2000 it was 74th. It peaked as 48th most popular in 2004 and 2005, and remained in the top 100 female baby names until 2012.

==Skills and abilities==

Throughout the &quot;Matrix&quot; franchise, Trinity is shown to have many skills both inside and outside the Matrix, including martial arts, computer hacking, the use of firearms and other weapons, and operating a range of vehicles. Some of these skills can be downloaded from outside the Matrix as needed, such as when Trinity flies a helicopter during the first film. Other skills are trained or inherent.

Trinity is seen to be especially skilled at the use of cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles, even in comparison to other hackers. In the first film, she pilots a Bell 212 helicopter to help rescue Morpheus; even after its hydraulic system is damaged, she maintains control long enough to get Neo and Morpheus to safety, then jumps out before it crashes. In &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, she drives a Cadillac sedan with ease while being chased by the Merovingian&#x27;s twins, agents of the Matrix, and the police; even able to drive while helping Morpheus protect the Keymaker from one of the twins. She also carries the Keymaker to safety on a Ducati 996 motorcycle in a harrowing chase through oncoming traffic.

Trinity also excels in combat, both armed and unarmed. At several times during the three films, she is able to defeat large numbers of well-armed opponents, either by herself or with help from other characters.

In &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, Trinity develops the same reality warping powers as Neo after being reawakened to her true identity. By touching hands, Neo and Trinity can let out a powerful telekinetic shockwave and she is later able to manipulate the appearance of the Analyst with just snaps of her fingers. Trinity also develops Neo&#x27;s ability to fly after they jump off of a roof and he can&#x27;t fly himself. At the end of the movie, Trinity and Neo fly off together, playfully circling around each other.

<text>The Black Ships (in , Edo period term) were the names given to both Portuguese merchant ships and American warships arriving in Japan in the 16th and 19th centuries respectively.

In 1543, Portuguese initiated the first contacts, establishing a trade route linking Goa to Nagasaki. The large carracks engaged in this trade had the hull painted black with pitch, and the term came to represent all Western vessels. In 1639, after suppressing a rebellion blamed on the influence of Christian thought, the ruling Tokugawa shogunate retreated into an isolationist policy, the Sakoku. During this &quot;locked state&quot;, contact with Japan by Westerners was restricted to Dutch traders on Dejima island at Nagasaki.

In 1844, William II of the Netherlands urged Japan to also open the mainland to trade, but was rejected. On July 8, 1853, the U.S. Navy sent four warships into the bay at Edo and threatened to attack if Japan did not begin trade with the West. The ships were &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Plymouth&quot;, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, and &quot;Susquehanna&quot; of the Expedition for the opening of Japan, under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry. The expedition arrived on July 14, 1853 at Uraga Harbor (present-day Yokosuka) in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Though their hulls were not black, their coal-fired steam engines belched black smoke.

Their arrival marked the reopening of the country to political dialogue after more than two hundred years of self-imposed isolation. Trade with Western nations followed five years later with the Treaty of Amity and Commerce. After this, the &quot;kurofune&quot; became a symbol of the end of isolation.

==First Kurofune ships: Nau do Trato==

In 1543 Portuguese traders arrived in Japan initiating the first contacts with the West. Soon they established a trade route linking their headquarters in Goa, via Malacca to Nagasaki. Large carracks engaged in the flourishing &quot;Nanban trade&quot;, introducing modern inventions from the European traders, such as refined sugar, optics, and firearms; it was the firearms, arquebuses, which became a major innovation of the Sengoku period—a time of intense internal warfare—when the matchlocks were replicated. Later, they engaged in triangular trade, exchanging silver from Japan with silk from China via Macau.

Carracks of 1200 to 1600 tons, named &quot;nau do trato&quot; (&#x27;treaty ship&#x27;) or &quot;nau da China&quot; by the Portuguese, engaged in this trade had the hull painted black with pitch, and the term came to apply for all western vessels. The name was inscribed in the Nippo Jisho, the first western Japanese dictionary compiled in 1603.

In 1549 Spanish missionary Francis Xavier started a Jesuit mission in Japan. Christianity spread, mingled with the new trade, making 300,000 converts among peasants and some daimyō (warlords). In 1637 the Shimabara Rebellion blamed on the Christian influence was suppressed. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries faced progressively tighter restrictions, and were confined to the island of Dejima before being expelled in 1639.

The Tokugawa shogunate retreated back into a policy of isolationism identified as , forbidding contact with most outside countries. Only a limited-scale trade and diplomatic relations with China, Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Dutch was maintained. The Sakoku policy remained in effect until 1853 with the arrival of Commodore Perry and the &quot;opening&quot; of Japan.

==Gunboat diplomacy==
Commodore Perry&#x27;s show of military force was the principal factor in negotiating a treaty allowing American trade with Japan, thus effectively ending the Sakoku period of more than 200 years in which trading with Japan had been permitted to the Dutch, Koreans, Chinese, and Ainu exclusively.

The sight of the four ships entering Edo Bay, belching black smoke and able to move with no need of wind, deeply frightened the Japanese. Perry ignored the official requests that he move to Nagasaki—the licensed port for external trade—and threatened to attack Edo and burn it to the ground if he was not allowed to land. It was eventually agreed that he should land nearby at Kurihama, whereupon he delivered his letter and left.

The following year, at the Convention of Kanagawa, Perry returned with a fleet of eight of the fearsome Black Ships, to demonstrate the power of the United States navy, and to lend weight to his announcement that he would not leave again, until he had a treaty. In the interim, after a debate by officials the Japanese government had decided to avoid war and agree to a treaty with the United States. 

After roughly a month of negotiations, the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s officials presented Perry with the Treaty of Peace and Amity. Perry refused certain conditions of the treaty but agreed to defer their resolution to a later time, and finally establishing formal diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. The fleet departed, leaving behind a consul, Townsend Harris, at Shimoda to negotiate a more permanent agreement. The Harris Treaty was signed with the United States on July 29, 1858, and within five years of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Amity, Japan had moved to sign treaties with other Western countries.

== In Japanese culture ==
The surprise and fear inspired by the first visit of the Black Ships are described in this famous &quot;kyōka&quot; (a humorous poem in 31-syllable waka form):

This poem is a complex set of puns (in Japanese, &quot;kakekotoba&quot; or &quot;pivot words&quot;). means &#x27;tranquil&#x27;; is the name of a costly brand of very strong green tea; and means &#x27;four cups&#x27;, so a literal translation of the poem is:
There is an alternative translation, based on the pivot words. &quot;Taihei&quot; can refer to the ; &quot;jōkisen&quot; also means &#x27;steam-powered ships&#x27; ; and &quot;shihai&quot; also means &#x27;four vessels&#x27;. The poem, therefore, has a hidden meaning:
&quot;Kurofune&quot; (&quot;The Black Ships&quot;) is also the title of the first Japanese opera, composed by Kosaku Yamada and premiering in 1940, &quot;based on the story of Tojin Okichi, a geisha caught up in the turmoil that swept Japan in the waning years of the Tokugawa shogunate&quot;.

<text>The , abbreviated JNR or , was the business entity that operated Japan&#x27;s national railway network from 1949 to 1987.

==Network==
=== Railways ===
As of June 1, 1949, the date of establishment of JNR, it operated of narrow gauge () railways in all 46 prefectures of Japan. This figure expanded to in 1981 (excluding Shinkansen), but later reduced to as of March 31, 1987, the last day of JNR.

JNR operated both passenger and freight services.

==== Shinkansen ====
Shinkansen, the world&#x27;s first high-speed railway was debuted by JNR in 1964. By the end of JNR in 1987, four lines had been constructed:
; Tōkaidō Shinkansen: , completed in 1964
; Sanyō Shinkansen: , completed in 1975
; Tōhoku Shinkansen: , as of 1987
; Jōetsu Shinkansen: , completed in 1982

===Buses===

JNR operated bus lines as feeders, supplements or substitutions of railways. Unlike railway operation, JNR Bus was not superior to other local bus operators. The JR Bus companies are the successors of the bus operation of JNR.

===Ships===
JNR operated ferries to connect railway networks separated by sea or to meet other local demands:
;Kanmon Ferry (discontinued in 1964): Shimonoseki Station (Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi) – Mojikō Station (Kitakyūshū, Fukuoka)
;Miyajima Ferry: Miyajimaguchi Station (Ōno, Hiroshima) – Miyajima Station (Miyajima, Hiroshima)
;Nihori Ferry (discontinued in 1982): Nigata Station (Kure, Hiroshima) – Horie Station (Matsuyama, Ehime)

;Ōshima Ferry (discontinued in 1976): Ōbatake Station (Yanai, Yamaguchi) – Komatsukō Station (Suō-Ōshima, Yamaguchi)
;Seikan Ferry: Aomori Station (Aomori, Aomori) – Hakodate Station (Hakodate, Hokkaidō)
;Ukō Ferry: Uno Station (Tamano, Okayama) – Takamatsu Station (Takamatsu, Kagawa)

Out of three routes assigned to JR companies in 1987, only the Miyajima Ferry remains active as of 2023.

==Unions==
A number of unions represented workers at JNR, including the National Railway Workers&#x27; Union (Kokuro), the National Railway Locomotive Engineers&#x27; Union (Doro), and Doro-Chiba, a break-away group from Doro.

==History==

The term &quot;Kokuyū Tetsudō&quot; &quot;state-owned railway&quot; originally referred to a network of railway lines operated by 17 private companies that were nationalized following the Railway Nationalization Act of 1906 and placed under the control of the Railway Institute. Later, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications took over control of the network. The ministries used the name Japanese Government Railways (JGR) to refer their network in English. During World War II, many JGR lines were dismantled to supply steel for the war effort.

On June 1, 1949, by a directive of the U.S. General HQ in Tokyo, JGR was reorganized into Japanese National Railways, a state-owned public corporation. JNR enjoyed many successes, including the inauguration of high-speed Shinkansen service along the Tōkaidō Shinkansen line on October 1, 1964. However, JNR was not a state-run corporation; its accounting was independent from the national budget. Rural sections without enough passengers began to press its management, pulling it further and further into debt. In 1983, JNR started to close its unprofitable 83 local lines (the closure continued three years after the privatization).

By 1987, JNR&#x27;s debt was over ¥27 trillion ($442 billion at 2021 exchange rates) and the company was spending ¥147 for every ¥100 earned. 
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, an avowed advocate of privatization, strongly supported breaking up JNR and in August 1982 launched the JNR Reform Commission to officially begin the process. By an act of the Diet of Japan, on April 1, 1987, JNR was privatized and divided into seven railway companies, six passenger and one freight, collectively called the Japan Railways Group or JR Group. Long-term liabilities of JNR were taken over by the Japanese National Railway Settlement Corporation. That corporation was subsequently disbanded on October 22, 1998, and its remaining debts were transferred to the national budget&#x27;s general accounting. By this time the debt has risen to ¥30 trillion ($491 billion in 2021 dollars).

===JNR dismissal lawsuit===
Many lawsuits and labor commission cases were filed over the decades from the privatization in 1987. Kokuro and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers&#x27; Union (Zendoro), both prominent Japanese railway unions, represented a number of the JNR workers.

Lists of workers to be employed by the new organizations were drawn up by JNR and given to the JR companies. There was substantial pressure on union members to leave their unions, and within a year, the membership of the National Railway Workers&#x27; Union (Kokuro) fell from 200,000 to 44,000. Workers who had supported the privatization, or those who left Kokuro, were hired at substantially higher rates than Kokuro members.

There was a government pledge that no one would be &quot;thrown out onto the street&quot;, and so unhired workers were classified as &quot;needing to be employed&quot; and were transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, where they could be assigned for up to three years. Around 7,600 workers were transferred in this way, and around 2,000 of them were hired by JR firms, and 3,000 found work elsewhere. Mitomu Yamaguchi, a former JNR employee from Tosu in Saga prefecture who had been transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, later stated that their help in finding work consisted of giving him photocopies of recruitment ads from newspapers. This period ended in April 1990, and 1,047 were dismissed. This included 64 Zendoro members and 966 Kokuro members.

Twenty-three years after the original privatization, on June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court settled the dispute between the workers and the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency, the successor body to the JNR Settlement Corporation. The agency said it would pay 20 billion yen, approximately 22 million yen per worker, to 904 plaintiffs. However, as the workers were not reinstated, it was not a full settlement.

===Baseball team===
Between 1950 and 1965, JNR indirectly owned a professional baseball team named . Swallow was a symbol of JNR as it is the English equivalent of the Japanese &quot;Tsubame&quot;, the name of a deluxe train operated by JNR in the 1950s. JNR sold the team to the Sankei Shinbun in 1965, and called the Atoms from 1966 to 1973; the team is now the Tokyo Yakult Swallows and has been owned by the Yakult company since 1970.

==Accidents and criminal incidents==

===Accidents===
JNR as a public corporation (from 1949 to 1987) experienced five major accidents (including two shipwrecks of railway ferries) with casualties more than 100: 
; &quot;Sakuragichō&quot; train fire: A train fire at Sakuragichō Station in Yokohama on April 24, 1951, killed 106.
; &quot;Tōya Maru&quot; disaster: A Seikan ferryboat sank off Hakodate killing 1,155 in a typhoon storm on September 26, 1954.
; &quot;Shiun Maru&quot; disaster: An Ukō ferryboat collided with a fellow boat in a dense fog and sank killing 168 on May 11, 1955.
; &quot;Mikawashima&quot; train crash: A three-train collision near Mikawashima Station in Tokyo on May 3, 1962, killed 160.
; &quot;Tsurumi&quot; rail accident: A three-train collision near Tsurumi Station in Yokohama on November 9, 1963, killed 161.

===Criminal incidents===
In its very early days as a public corporation, JNR experienced a series of mysterious incidents as follows. Although the police at that time treated them as terrorism by the communists, doubts have been raised as to the validity of this conclusion.

; &quot;Shimoyama&quot; incident : The dismembered body of JNR President Sadanori Shimoyama was found on a railway track on July 5, 1949. The possibility of non-criminal suicide has not been ruled out.
; &quot;Mitaka&quot; incident : A train running without crew crashed into passengers and killed six people on July 15, 1949.
; &quot;Matsukawa&quot; derailment : A train was derailed because of destroyed track and three crew were killed on August 17, 1949.

In later years, JNR was a target of radical leftists. On October 21, 1968, groups of extremist students celebrating &quot;International Antiwar Day&quot; occupied and vandalized Shinjuku Station in Tokyo. They criticized JNR&#x27;s collaboration in the Vietnam War by operating freight trains carrying jet fuel for U.S. military use. On November 29, 1985, militants supporting a radical sect of JNR&#x27;s labor union objecting to the privatization of JNR damaged signal cables at 33 points around Tokyo and Osaka to halt thousands of commuter trains and then set fire to Asakusabashi Station in Tokyo.

As such, relationships with labor unions were always a difficult problem for JNR. Since public workers were prohibited to strike, they carried out &quot;work-to-rule protests&quot; that caused trains to be delayed. On March 13, 1973, train delays caused by such protests resulted in a riot of angered passengers at Ageo Station in Saitama Prefecture. From November 26, 1975, to December 3, 1975, major labor unions of JNR conducted an eight-day-long illegal &quot;strike for the right to strike&quot;, which resulted in a total defeat of the unions.

<doc id="487859" wikidata="Q383851" url="?curid=487859" title="Directional derivative">
<text>In multivariable calculus, the directional derivative measures the rate at which a function changes in a particular direction at a given point.

The directional derivative of a multivariable differentiable (scalar) function along a given vector v at a given point x intuitively represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function, moving through x with a direction specified by v. 

The directional derivative of a scalar function &quot;f&quot; with respect to a vector v at a point (e.g., position) x may be denoted by any of the following:
formula_1

It therefore generalizes the notion of a partial derivative, in which the rate of change is taken along one of the curvilinear coordinate curves, all other coordinates being constant.
The directional derivative is a special case of the Gateaux derivative.

== Definition ==
The &quot;directional derivative&quot; of a scalar function 
formula_2
along a vector
formula_3
is the function formula_4 defined by the limit
formula_5

This definition is valid in a broad range of contexts, for example where the norm of a vector (and hence a unit vector) is undefined.

=== For differentiable functions ===

If the function &quot;f&quot; is differentiable at x, then the directional derivative exists along any unit vector v at x, and one has

formula_6

where the formula_7 on the right denotes the &quot;gradient&quot;, formula_8 is the dot product and v is a unit vector. This follows from defining a path formula_9 and using the definition of the derivative as a limit which can be calculated along this path to get:
formula_10

Intuitively, the directional derivative of &quot;f&quot; at a point x represents the rate of change of &quot;f&quot;, in the direction of v.

=== Using only direction of vector ===

In a Euclidean space, some authors define the directional derivative to be with respect to an arbitrary nonzero vector v after normalization, thus being independent of its magnitude and depending only on its direction.

This definition gives the rate of increase of per unit of distance moved in the direction given by . In this case, one has
formula_11
or in case &quot;f&quot; is differentiable at x,
formula_12

=== Restriction to a unit vector ===

In the context of a function on a Euclidean space, some texts restrict the vector v to being a unit vector. With this restriction, both the above definitions are equivalent.

== Properties ==
Many of the familiar properties of the ordinary derivative hold for the directional derivative. These include, for any functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; defined in a neighborhood of, and differentiable at, p: 

# sum rule: formula_13
# constant factor rule: For any constant &quot;c&quot;, formula_14
# product rule (or Leibniz&#x27;s rule): formula_15
# chain rule: If &quot;g&quot; is differentiable at p and &quot;h&quot; is differentiable at &quot;g&quot;(p), then formula_16

== In differential geometry ==
Let be a differentiable manifold and a point of . Suppose that is a function defined in a neighborhood of , and differentiable at . If is a tangent vector to at , then the directional derivative of along , denoted variously as (see Exterior derivative), formula_17 (see Covariant derivative), formula_18 (see Lie derivative), or formula_19 (see ), can be defined as follows. Let be a differentiable curve with and . Then the directional derivative is defined by
formula_20
This definition can be proven independent of the choice of , provided is selected in the prescribed manner so that and .

===The Lie derivative===
The Lie derivative of a vector field formula_21 along a vector field formula_22 is given by the difference of two directional derivatives (with vanishing torsion):
formula_23
In particular, for a scalar field formula_24, the Lie derivative reduces to the standard directional derivative:
formula_25

===The Riemann tensor===
Directional derivatives are often used in introductory derivations of the Riemann curvature tensor. Consider a curved rectangle with an infinitesimal vector formula_26 along one edge and formula_27 along the other. We translate a covector formula_28 along formula_26 then formula_27 and then subtract the translation along formula_27 and then formula_26. Instead of building the directional derivative using partial derivatives, we use the covariant derivative. The translation operator for formula_26 is thus
formula_34
and for formula_27,
formula_36
The difference between the two paths is then
formula_37
It can be argued that the noncommutativity of the covariant derivatives measures the curvature of the manifold:
formula_38
where formula_39 is the Riemann curvature tensor and the sign depends on the sign convention of the author.

== In group theory ==

===Translations===
In the Poincaré algebra, we can define an infinitesimal translation operator P as
formula_40
(the &quot;i&quot; ensures that P is a self-adjoint operator) For a finite displacement λ, the unitary Hilbert space representation for translations is 
formula_41
By using the above definition of the infinitesimal translation operator, we see that the finite translation operator is an exponentiated directional derivative:
formula_42
This is a translation operator in the sense that it acts on multivariable functions &quot;f&quot;(x) as

===Rotations===
The rotation operator also contains a directional derivative. The rotation operator for an angle θ, i.e. by an amount &quot;θ&quot; = |θ| about an axis parallel to formula_44 is
formula_45
Here L is the vector operator that generates SO(3):
formula_46
It may be shown geometrically that an infinitesimal right-handed rotation changes the position vector x by
formula_47
So we would expect under infinitesimal rotation:
formula_48
It follows that 
formula_49
Following the same exponentiation procedure as above, we arrive at the rotation operator in the position basis, which is an exponentiated directional derivative:

== Normal derivative ==

A normal derivative is a directional derivative taken in the direction normal (that is, orthogonal) to some surface in space, or more generally along a normal vector field orthogonal to some hypersurface. See for example Neumann boundary condition. If the normal direction is denoted by formula_51, then the normal derivative of a function &quot;f&quot; is sometimes denoted as formula_52. In other notations,
formula_53

== In the continuum mechanics of solids ==

Several important results in continuum mechanics require the derivatives of vectors with respect to vectors and of tensors with respect to vectors and tensors. The directional directive provides a systematic way of finding these derivatives.

<doc id="487860" wikidata="Q1914924" url="?curid=487860" title="Mbaqanga">
<text>Mbaqanga () is a style of South African music with rural Zulu and Sotho-tshwana roots that continues to influence musicians worldwide today. The style originated in the early 1960s, and blends traditional South African vocal styles and melodies with European and American popular music.

==History==

In Zulu, the term &quot;mbaqanga&quot; means an everyday cornmeal porridge. &quot;Mbaqanga&quot; aficionados were mostly plebeian, metropolitan African jazz enthusiasts. Many of them were not permitted to establish themselves in the city, but they were unable to sustain themselves in the rural country. &quot;Mbaqanga&quot; gave them a staple form of musical and spiritual sustenance; it was their &quot;musical daily bread.&quot;

Mbaqanga musicians received little money. For example, Simon &quot;Mahlathini&quot; Nkabinde, one of the most well-known mbaqanga singers (and arguably the most famous mbaqanga &quot;groaner&quot;, nicknamed the &quot;lion of Soweto&quot;), died a poor man. This was partly due to the exploitation of black South African musicians at home and abroad as Mahlathini pointed out. Mbaqanga groups of the 1960s also found it difficult to get air time on local radio stations, and had to perform outside record stores to attract audiences.

Mbaqanga developed in the South African shebeens during the 1960s. Its use of western instruments allowed mbaqanga to develop into a South African version of jazz. Musically, the sound indicated a mix between western instrumentation and South African vocal style. Many mbaqanga scholars consider it to be the result of a coalition between marabi and kwela. A South African tourist website sponsored by the government describes mbaqanga as &quot;the cyclic structure of marabi . . . with a heavy dollop of American big band swing thrown on top.&quot; Mbaqanga also provided a very early forum for black and white interaction in a segregated country. As a result, the &quot;white Nationalist government brought this vital era to an end&quot; by razing the townships that supported mbaqanga such as Sophiatown.

The genre gained popularity as a result of radio play by stations under the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Early artists included Miriam Makeba, Dolly Rathebe and Letta Mbulu. Mbaqanga maintained its popularity until the 1980s when it was replaced by South African pop music known as bubblegum. Bubblegum is a genre highly influenced by mbaqanga. One of the few remaining mbaqanga bands is The Cool Crooners. This band consists of a coalition between two rival bands that eventually merged: The Cool Four and The Golden Delicious Rhythm Crooners.

===Formation===
By the middle of the 1950s, the evolving indigenous South African music exploded in popularity given its increased reach to a massively growing urban population. A typical area was the township of Sophiatown, near Johannesburg, which had since the 1930s offered a black urban lifestyle. Sophiatown and Alexandra were rare &quot;freehold&quot; areas where blacks could own property. Its proximity to Johannesburg&#x27;s downtown area made Sophiatown attractive to performers eager to explore new avenues of music. The area became an important seed-bed for the rapidly developing black musical culture. But when Sophiatown&#x27;s residents were forcibly removed to newly formed townships such as Soweto, outside Johannesburg, this era came to an end.

One of the earliest innovators of mbaqanga was the Makgona Tsohle Band, a group comprising five domestic workers from Pretoria – Marks Mankwane (lead guitar), Joseph Makwela (bass guitar), Vivian Ngubane (rhythm guitar), Lucky Monama (drums) and West Nkosi (saxophone). Mbaqanga, a Zulu word for steamed cornbread, fused marabi and kwela influences. The cyclic structure of marabi melded with traditional dance styles such as the Zulu indlamu, combined with big band swing. The indlamu input developed into the &quot;African stomp&quot; style, giving a notably African rhythmic impulse to the music and making it quite irresistible to its new audiences.

Rupert Bopape, enticed by the successful Gallo Record Company to be their African production manager, brought together the musicians of the Makgona Tsohle Band with Mahlathini and a new female chorus, the Mahotella Queens. This was when mbaqanga really took off – or more specifically, &quot;vocal mbaqanga&quot; (later nicknamed simanje-manje or mgqashiyo). In addition to Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, singing stars such as Miriam Makeba, Dolly Rathebe and Letta Mbulu (who had all begun as marabi stars during the &#x27;50s) created a large base of fans, as did the Dark City Sisters and The Soul Brothers. Other mbaqanga musicians included Simon Baba Mokoena and West Nkosi, who broke away from the Makgona Tsohle Band in 1990 for a successful solo career until his death in 1998.

===International popularity===

Mbaqanga&#x27;s popularity faded during the 1970s because of the influence of Western pop, soul and disco into South Africa. Public performances declined because labour migrants no longer wanted to be in the spotlight. Additionally, audiences sought more urbanised language, vocal, and instrumental styles. However, it was revived between 1983 and 1986. The reversal of fortunes was in part due to Paul Simon&#x27;s incorporation of South African music into his &quot;Graceland&quot; album (1986) and subsequent tour. Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens&#x27; appearances at festivals in France and at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 70th birthday concert in Wembley Stadium, London in 1988 (featuring &quot;white Zulu&quot; Johnny Clegg) signalled its return. White South African musicians influenced by this style include singer songwriter Robin Auld. Veteran Afrikaans piano accordion player Nico Carstens produced a &quot;boereqanga&quot; hit with &quot;Viva Madiba&quot;.

Mbaqanga was fully replaced as the dominant music genre in the 1980s by a new urban genre called &#x27;bubblegum.&#x27; An Afro-dance pop, Bubblegum was mainly influenced by mbaqanga and other popular African styles. With the introduction of television in 1976, this musical genre was promoted as music across all ethnic groups. Characterized as a representation of a move towards music that was more urban than traditional, the Bubblegum genre had many successful musicians, including Chico Twala, Yvonne Chaka Chaka and Brenda Fassie. The derivation of mbaqanga into bubblegum contributed enormously towards the development of kwaito.

Several mbaqanga acts are still recording and performing today, including the Mahotella Queens and the Soul Brothers. Mbaqanga also continues to influence musicians worldwide. For example, the Norwegian group Real Ones included a tribute track, &quot;All the Way Back (Shades of Mbaqanga)&quot;, on their 2003 album &quot;This is Camping&quot;.

<text>Azem Shpend Hajdari (, March 11, 1963 – September 12, 1998) was the leader of the student movement in 1990–1991 that led to the fall of communism in Albania. He then became a politician of the Democratic Party of Albania (DP). He symbolizes the start of the democratic era in Albania. He was a member of the Albanian parliament and the Chairman of the Defence Parliamentary Commission. He was shot to death in Tirana on September 12, 1998 at age 35.

==Early life==

Hajdari came from a working family. He finished elementary school and high school in Bajram Curri. Hajdari studied philosophy at the University of Tirana, and was married to Fatmira Hajdari, with whom he had three children: Kirardi, Rudina, and Azem Junior (who was born four months after Hajdari&#x27;s assassination). He was one of the main leaders of student demonstrations that brought the collapse of the Party of Labour of Albania in December 1990. He was also, briefly, the first leader of the Democratic Party of Albania (DP). He remained in that position until he was replaced in early 1991 by Sali Berisha, who later became Prime Minister of Albania. Hajdari was a close associate of Berisha, and came from the same district of Tropojë.

==Education==
In 1993 Hajdari graduated on Philosophy Branch at the University of Tirana. In 1995 he graduated Jurisprudence again at the University of Tirana. On 1993 until 1994: Studied English language and philosophy in the United States and at 1996 he studied defense and security policy in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany.
Political activities in his youth included serving as a leader of the students&#x27; movement which overthrew communism in Albania. From December 1990 to February 1991, he was Chairman of the Leading Commission of the Democratic Party (the first opposition party after 50 years of totalitarian regime). From February 1991 to September 1993 he was Deputy-Chairman of the Democratic Party and a member of its steering committee.

==Public service==
In the four free elections after the collapse of communism, Hajdari has been elected a Member of Parliament.
*March 31, 1991 MP of Shkodër
*March 22, 1992 MP of Shijak
*May 26, 1996 MP of Bulqizë
*June 29, 1997 MP of Tropojë
Hajdari served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on the Public Order and the National Intelligence Service from 1992–1996. In 1996 he was the Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on the Public Order and the National Intelligence Service, and is November 1996 became President of the United Independent Albanian Trade Unions. In June 1997 he became the Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission of Defense.

From 1995 to 1998, Hajdari was the President of the KS Vllaznia Shkodër, the first sport club in Albania. He also served as the President of the Albanian Federation of Martial arts.

==Assassination attempts==
Hajdari began receiving death threats from the beginning of his involvement in the student protests. On March 22, 1991, he received a package containing a severed rooster head and a letter written in blood: &quot;Azem Hajdari, you are sentenced to death.&quot;

===Tropojë attack===
On June 4, 1998, at about 22:30, Hajdari and other members of the DP (including Jozefina Topalli and Vili Minarolli) were ambushed by gunmen. Bardhyl Pollo, former General Director of Albanian Radio and TV, was seriously wounded.

===Shot in Parliament===
On September 18, 1997, Hajdari fought with Gafur Mazreku, a Member of Parliament of the Prime Minister Fatos Nano&#x27;s governing Socialist Party, in a dispute over a proposed increase in the added value tax. Mazreku shot Hajdari five times with a pistol and ran from the hall. Hajdari was taken to a military hospital in grave condition.

Mazreku ran to the nearby Albanian telegraph agency building, where he surrendered to police.

Mazreku was sentenced to eight years imprisonment by parliament.

On December 17, the court located in Tirana sentenced Mazreku to eleven years in prison for attempted murder. The prosecutor had demanded a 16-year sentence. Mazreku argued that he fired the shots in an act of revenge after Hajdari verbally assaulted and punched him. Hajdari, however, claimed the attack was politically motivated.

==Assassination==
On September 12, 1998, Hajdari was shot and killed as he stepped out of the Democratic Party&#x27;s office in Tirana with his two bodyguards, Besim Çera, who was killed, and Zenel Neza, who was seriously injured but survived. The three men were shot by Fatmir Haklaj who had been waiting in a car parked nearby. Hajdari was taken to the hospital by Besnik Docaj, a fellow Democrat. Cangu was seriously injured, and later died in hospital.

Hajdari died of severe shock from trauma and hemorrhaging due to numerous wounds to the chest and stomach. He was posthumously awarded a &quot;Martyr of Democracy&quot; award. Neza asked for asylum in the United States.

=== Reactions ===
The murder triggered two days of violent protests. During Hajdari&#x27;s funeral procession on September 14, 1998, armed DP supporters ransacked government offices, and for a brief period, held the PM&#x27;s office, the parliament building, and the Albanian State television and radio building. Estimates of casualties during the protests and riots ranged between 3 and 7 deaths and 14 and 76 injuries. After 72 hours, the government restored order and reclaimed tanks and armored personnel carriers seized by DP supporters. Parliament subsequently lifted Berisha&#x27;s immunity due to his alleged role in what the government described as a coup d&#x27;état, but no charges were laid. Berisha blamed the Socialist Party of Albania and its leaders for the murder. Twelve people were arrested for their alleged involvement in the violence. In February 2002, five people, including Jaho Mulosmani, were sentenced for the murder by a Tirana district court.

== Legacy ==
A monument honoring Hajdari and his bodyguard Besim Çera was placed on the crime scene where both were killed ().

The entrance road towards Valbona Valley National Park in northern Albania bears his name.

==Awards==
On October 2, 1998, Hajdari was posthumously awarded honorary citizenship of Tirana, and in 2007 he was decorated with the Skanderbeg&#x27;s Order by president Bamir Topi.

<doc id="487864" wikidata="Q1392116" url="?curid=487864" title="Pingali Venkayya">
<text>Pingali Venkayya (2 August 1876/8 – 4 July 1963) was an Indian freedom fighter, known for designing the initial version of the Indian National Flag. Apart from his role in the independence movement, Venkayya was a lecturer, author, geologist, educationalist, agriculturist, and a polyglot.

Venkayya joined the British Indian Army at age 19 and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). During his service, he recognized the need for a national flag for India as Indian soldiers were required to salute the Union Jack, the British flag. Inspired by his experience and later by attending the 1906 AICC session in Calcutta, he developed a vision for a flag representing Indians, opposing the practice of hoisting the British flag at Congress meetings.

Venkayya presented his design for an Indian national flag to Mahatma Gandhi in 1921 during Gandhi&#x27;s visit to Vijayawada. The flag initially consisted of red and green stripes representing Hindus and Muslims, respectively, and, on Gandhi&#x27;s suggestion, a white stripe was added to represent other communities in India. This flag design was used informally at Congress meetings from 1921 and served as the foundation for the Indian national flag, which was officially adopted in its final form by the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947.

Venkayya was an agriculturist, as well as an educationist who set up an educational institution in Machilipatnam. Despite his contributions, he died in poverty in 1963 and remained largely unrecognized in his later years. In 2009, the Indian government issued a postage stamp in his honour, and in 2012, his name was recommended for a posthumous Bharat Ratna, though no formal response was received from the central government.

== Early life ==
Pingali Venkayya was born on 2 August 1876 or 1878 at Bhatlapenumarru, near Machilipatnam, in what is now the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. His parents were Hanumantha Rayudu and Venkata Ratnam. He studied at the Hindu High School in Machilipatnam, but also spent his childhood in various places in the Krishna district like Yarlagadda and Pedakallepalli. He married Rukminamma, the daughter of the Karanam of Pamarru village.

At the age of 19, he enrolled in the British Indian Army and was deployed to South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), where he met Gandhi for the first time. It was during the war when the soldiers had to salute the Union Jack, the national flag of Britain, that Venkayya realised the need for having a flag for Indians.

== Career ==
Venkayya earned a diploma in Geology from the Madras Presidency College. From 19111944, he worked as a lecturer at the Andhra National College in Machilipatnam. From 1924 to 1944, he researched mica in Nellore. He also authored a book titled &#x27;Thalli Raayi&#x27; on geology.

Venkayya was also popularly nicknamed &#x27;Diamond Venkayya&#x27;, as he was an expert in diamond mining. He was also called &#x27;Patti Venkayya&#x27; (Cotton Venkayya), because he dedicated most of his time to researching staple varieties of cotton and did a detailed study on a variety called Cambodia Cotton. He was a polyglot who was proficient in many languages including Japanese and Urdu. He delivered a full-length speech in Japanese at a school in Bapatla in 1913. From then, he also came to be referred to as &#x27;Japan Venkayya&#x27;.

== Design of National Flag ==
When Venkayya attended the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session in 1906 in Calcutta under the leadership of Dadabhai Naoroji, he was inspired to design a flag for the Indian National Congress as he opposed the idea of hoisting the British flag at Congress meetings. Venkayya worked on potential designs that could be used as flags for the newly coined Swaraj movement to signify independence. There were over 25 drafts of the flags with different significance and relations with Indian culture, heritage and history. In 1916, he published a book titled &quot;Bharatha Desaniki Oka Jatiya Patakam&quot; () with 30 potential designs for a flag. From 1918 to 1921, he proposed various ideas to the Congress leadership while also working at the Andhra National College in Machilipatnam.

In 1921, the AICC held its two-day crucial session in Bezawada (now Vijayawada) on March 31 and April 1. When Gandhi asked Venkayya to submit a design for the flag at the session, he did it within three hours. Venkayya had shown Gandhi a rudimentary design of a flag on a Khadi bunting. This first flag was coloured red and green — the red representing Hindus and the green representing Muslims in the country. On Gandhi&#x27;s suggestion, Venkayya added a white stripe to represent all the other denominations and religions present in the country. While the flag was not officially adopted by the AICC, which reordered the stripes and changed the red to orange in 1931, it came to be used across the country. Since 1921, Venkayya&#x27;s flag has been used informally at all Congress meetings. The flag was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947, twenty days before India&#x27;s Independence.

== Death and legacy ==

Venkayya lived humbly according to Gandhian ideologies and died in 1963. Venkayya&#x27;s daughter Ghantasala Seetha Mahalakshmi passed away on 21 July 2022 at the age of 100.

A postage stamp to commemorate Venkayya and the first flag was issued in 2009. The Vijayawada station of All India Radio was named after him in 2014. In 2012, his name was proposed for a posthumous Bharat Ratna though there has been no response from the central government on the proposal.

In 1995, then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. T. Rama Rao commissioned a statue of Venkayya – one among the 31 state icons – at Tank Bund Road in Hyderabad. In January 2015, a statue of him was unveiled by the then Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu, in the forelawns of the All India Radio building in Vijayawada. Several statues of Venkayya have been built all over Andhra Pradesh.

<doc id="487865" wikidata="Q2127647" url="?curid=487865" title="Rail shooter">
<text>Rail shooter, also known as on-rails shooter, is a subgenre of shoot &#x27;em up video game. Beginning with arcade games such as the 1985 &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, the gameplay locks the player character into a set path, only allowing for limited or no divergence from it, in a manner similar to a theme park dark ride, which is typically on train tracks. While moving on this path, players must aim and shoot enemies while dodging projectiles and avoiding damage. 

Many rail shooters feature a flying protagonist or ship. Some take place while walking, running or driving. While rail shooters saw a resurgence on the Wii due to its Wii Remote control scheme, new games in the genre are considered a rarity in the modern day, although many games of other genres contain rail shooter segments.

== History ==
The rail shooter genre stemmed from arcade games, with seminal games being &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985) and &quot;After Burner&quot; (1987), both developed by Sega. The original &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993) further popularized rail shooters, adding 3D graphics. By the mid-1990s, first-person rail shooters became popular in arcades, notably light gun shooters such as &quot;Time Crisis&quot; (1995) and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; (1996). &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; (1995) and &quot;Panzer Dragoon II Zwei&quot; (1996) were two well-regarded rail shooters released around this time.

&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; was released in 1997 and gained wide renown for its graphics, level design and non-linearity. It was the last primarily rail shooter &quot;Star Fox&quot; game, with Nintendo switching to a fully 3D range of movement going forwards. Bucking the trend of combat-oriented games, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; (1999) was one of the first nonviolent rail shooters, and popularized the photography game genre.

Starting in the late 1990s, the genre started to become unpopular, with on-rails gameplay becoming a &quot;dark mark&quot; due to a stigma of being overly shallow. While games such as &quot;Rez&quot; (2001) and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Orta&quot; (2002) were still released during this time, the lull lasted until the advent of motion control on home consoles, leading to a &quot;rebirth&quot; of the genre with major third-party releases in order to capitalize on the light gun-style gameplay. These included &quot;The House of the Dead: Overkill&quot; (2009), a grindhouse-style prequel to the original, and &quot;Dead Space: Extraction&quot; (2009), a spin-off of the survival horror &quot;Dead Space&quot; franchise. The developers, facing controversy over its differences from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, used the term &quot;guided experience&quot; to describe its gameplay. &quot;Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles&quot; (2009) featured shakycam movement. &quot;Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor&quot; (2009) was praised for its impressive graphics. The Kinect saw its own games, such as &quot;Child of Eden&quot; (2011), although other developers avoided making their games rail shooters, fearing negative reception.

Following this motion control &quot;boom&quot;, the genre dried up yet again, with releases like &quot;Crimson Dragon&quot; (2013) being sporadic and low-quality. While many modern games limit the player to linear levels, they still allow for free movement within those levels. In the modern day, the genre has become largely relegated to indie games, such as &quot;Ex-Zodiac&quot;, a retro-styled game heavily inspired by the now-defunct &quot;Star Fox&quot; series.

<doc id="487866" wikidata="Q551362" url="?curid=487866" title="Louis McLane">
<text>Louis McLane (May 28, 1786 – October 7, 1857) was an American lawyer and politician from Wilmington, in New Castle County, Delaware, and Baltimore, Maryland. He was a veteran of the War of 1812, a member of the Federalist Party and later the Democratic Party. He served as the U.S. representative from Delaware, U.S. senator from Delaware, the tenth U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, the twelfth U.S. Secretary of State, ambassador (Minister Plenipotentiary) to Great Britain, and president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

As a member of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Cabinet, McLane was a prominent figure during the Bank War. McLane pursued a more moderate approach towards the Second Bank of the United States than the President, but agreed with Jackson&#x27;s decision in 1832 to veto a Congressional bill renewing the Bank&#x27;s charter. He also helped draft the Force Bill in 1833. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1831.

==Early life and family==
Louis McLane was born in Smyrna, Delaware, on May 28, 1786, to Allan McLane and Rebecca Wells McLane.

McLane&#x27;s father, was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, appointed by George Washington in 1797 to the lucrative federal position of Customs collector for the Port of Wilmington. As a well-known and fervently loyal Federalist, he received the strong backing of James A. Bayard, enabling him to keep his appointment despite the election of a political opponent, Thomas Jefferson. Allan McLane retained the position for over 30 years, under presidents of both parties, until his death during the administration of Andrew Jackson. Much of his income came from the seizure of contraband. Louis McLane inherited much of this wealth, along with legal issues that lasted well beyond the death of his father.

Louis married Catherine Mary (Kitty) Milligan in 1812. Their 13 children included Robert Milligan McLane (1815–1898), a governor of Maryland and U.S. ambassador; Louis McLane (1819–1905), who became a president of Wells Fargo &amp; Co.; and Lydia Milligan Sims McLane (1822–1887), wife of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston.

==Education and early career==
Louis McLane attended private schools and served as a midshipman on the for one year before he turned 18. He then attended Newark College, later the University of Delaware.

He studied law under James A. Bayard, and was admitted to the bar in 1807. He began a practice in Wilmington, Delaware.

During the War of 1812, McLane joined the Wilmington Artillery Company, formed for the purpose of defending Wilmington. When Baltimore was threatened, they marched to its defense, but were sent back due to lack of provisions for them in Baltimore. Ultimately, they saw no action, and McLane left the unit with the rank of first lieutenant.

==Congressional service==
Following the War of 1812, Delaware was unique in continuing to have a viable Federalist Party. Never tainted by the secessionist activities of the New England Federalists and adaptive enough to institute modern electioneering practices, they held the loyalty of the majority Anglican/Methodist downstate population against the seemingly more radical Presbyterians and Irish immigrants in New Castle County. They remained the dominant political force in the state well into the 1820s, when the party finally disappeared, split between an allegiances to Andrew Jackson or to John Quincy Adams and the &quot;American system&quot; of Henry Clay and the Whigs. New Castle County manufacturers joined most of the old Federalist Party leadership in making the Whigs the new majority in the state. This included McLane&#x27;s mentor, James A. Bayard and various members of the Clayton family, especially Thomas Clayton and his cousin, John M. Clayton.

McLane was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives by defeating Thomas Clayton for the Federalist nomination, as Clayton was politically damaged by having voted for a Congressional pay raise in the previous session. From then on the Clayton cousins became McLane&#x27;s principal political opponents in Delaware. Nevertheless, McLane was elected six times as a Federalist to the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1816 through 1826. He had a most distinguished career in the U.S. House, serving five full terms from March 4, 1817, to March 3, 1827. In spite being a Federalist, he was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and it was only his Federalist affiliation that prevented him from being elected Speaker.

During these sessions the Federalist Party was so small and weak that partisan divisions mattered much less than the personal relationships that developed among the members. McLane quickly became a friend and admirer of William H. Crawford and Martin Van Buren, and at the same time became an opponent of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. These friendships were based more on personality than policy agreement, and were so important that McLane was one of Crawford&#x27;s strongest proponents in the presidential election of 1824. Once Crawford returned to Georgia, McLane, Van Buren, and the other Crawford supporters fell into the party of Andrew Jackson. This was all the easier for him given his existing friendship with Martin Van Buren, who became his mentor and advocate.

McLane moved to the U.S. Senate and served there from March 4, 1827, until his resignation in 1829, in expectation that President Jackson would appoint him to a federal office. During the period leading up to Andrew Jackson&#x27;s victory in the presidential election of 1828, Senator McLane had worked very hard in an unsuccessful effort to win Delaware&#x27;s electoral votes for Jackson.

==Service in the Jackson administration==

Having failed to win an appointment to Jackson&#x27;s initial cabinet, as he had hoped, McLane nevertheless resigned from the Senate on April 29, 1829. In doing so, he completely cut his ties to the Claytons and the dominant political faction in the state. With little hope of reelection to the U.S. Senate or any future in Delaware politics, McLane counted on the new president to reward all of his considerable hopes with a prestigious position. However, a former Federalist from an inconsequential opposition state would have to wait until Jackson met other obligations. In October 1829, McLane reluctantly accepted an appointment as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom, which had been arranged by his friend Martin Van Buren, now U.S. Secretary of State.

McLane was instructed to inform the English that his appointment signaled a break from the John Quincy Adams administration, and that issues of dispute under the Adams Administration would no longer be issues in a Jackson administration. His main assignment was to open up trade between the United States and the British West Indies. In this effort he was well received by Lord Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary, and successfully accomplished his mission. During his tenure, his personal secretary was Washington Irving, who was thereafter a close and loyal family friend.
Two years later, McLane finally received the cabinet appointment he had so longed for. When Jackson decided he needed to purge his cabinet of supporters of U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun, Van Buren was able to convince the president to appoint McLane to be the Secretary of the Treasury. McLane returned from England and served as Treasury Secretary from August 8, 1831, to May 28, 1833. The major issues confronting McLane in this new role were the tariff rates and the status of the Second Bank of the United States.

When McLane entered Jackson&#x27;s cabinet, he immediately assumed a position of leadership. Articulate, persuasive and energetic, he had mastered the issues under debate and was confident he could lead the others in the administration, including the President. Recognizing there was a difference of opinion with Jackson over the Bank, he sought to work out a plan with the bank president, Nicholas Biddle, to provide for the upcoming renewal of the bank&#x27;s charter in return for the accomplishment of a key objective of the President, the retirement of the national debt. On December 7, 1831, he proposed a sweeping plan to accomplish that and more. Acclaimed for its Hamiltonian creativity, McLane had taken the initiative on the administration&#x27;s agenda, and was acting very much in the role of a Prime Minister. With enough time he was certain Jackson would soften his position and consent to the approach.

Events conspired to frustrate the plan, however. First of all, Attorney General Roger B. Taney sought to convince Jackson that McLane&#x27;s plan was really a new packaging of the old Federalist program and in contradiction with Jackson&#x27;s own past positions. At the time Jackson was somewhat flexible on the issue, and McLane wanted to postpone the decision until after the presidential election of 1832. But Henry Clay decided that renewal of the bank charter was an issue he could use to defeat Jackson and convinced bank president Biddle to press for an immediate re-charter. By itself, this crystallized Jackson&#x27;s opposition to re-chartering, which he vetoed when passed by the Congress. This caused him to view his eventual victory in the presidential election as a popular endorsement of his bank policy.

Liking McLane personally and unwilling to make more controversial Cabinet changes so quickly, Jackson removed the bank issue from McLane&#x27;s purview. However, when McLane refused to remove the governments deposits from the Second Bank of the United States, Jackson had to replace him with someone that would, and offered McLane the prestigious U. S. Secretary of State instead. As his replacement, Jackson settled on William J. Duane, a man as unwilling as McLane to withdraw the deposits. The appointment was a great embarrassment to Jackson, and many blamed McLane for urging it.

While all this was going on, McLane negotiated what seemed to be a satisfactory tariff bill, but when South Carolina continued to object and triggered the Nullification Crisis, McLane prepared the important Force Bill of 1833 to provide for the tariff&#x27;s enforcement.

By shuffling his cabinet, Jackson hoped to keep the talented McLane in his service by removing from him the obligation to implement his planned permanent destruction of the Second Bank of the United States. Appointed U.S. Secretary of State in a recess appointment, McLane served from May 29, 1833, until June 30, 1834. He quickly managed the first major reorganization of the department, by establishing seven new bureaus. He also managed a dispute with France, over what were known as the &quot;Spoliation Claims&quot;. In 1832 France had agreed to reimburse the United States for certain shipping losses incurred during the Napoleonic Wars. However, successive French governments had failed to appropriate the funds required, all the while maintaining their desire to do so. Jackson was impatient to resolve the issue and worked with McLane to develop a hard line policy, confronting the French. Martin Van Buren was now Vice President and felt otherwise. Without consulting McLane, he intervened directly and convinced Jackson to give the French more time. McLane was furious with his old mentor for this intervention, and resigned his position, recognizing his apparent lack of authority in a direct area of responsibility. The incident also ended his friendship with Van Buren, and they never spoke again.

==Canal and railroad businesses==
Although he had some inherited wealth from his father, with 13 children McLane always needed to provide additional earned income in his own right. With his managerial talents, resume and connections, he was quickly sought out. The first to find him was the Morris Canal and Banking Company. A New Jersey corporation, largely based in New York City, it operated a canal from Phillipsburg to Newark, New Jersey, primarily to carry coal from Pennsylvania to New York City. It was also a bank and had a charter that provided banking opportunities. McLane was president for one year, implemented many improvements, and produced one of the few profitable years the company had. But his beloved family was in Wilmington and at their second home, &quot;Bohemia,&quot; was in Cecil County, Maryland. New York City was too far away.

Therefore, when an offer to assume the Presidency of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was made, it was quickly accepted. This company operated a railroad between Baltimore and Washington, but its ambition was built a route to the Ohio River, and move commerce from the west through the City of Baltimore. In 1837 the western tracks went only as far as Harpers Ferry, Virginia and McLane&#x27;s great accomplishment was seeing to the extension of the &quot;main line&quot; as far as Cumberland, Maryland. This brought the route into proximity with enough coalfields to provide a regular profit. The profits were not substantial, however, and McLane was consumed with financing rearrangements and negotiations with Pennsylvania and Virginia over possible routes west. Ultimately Wheeling and an all Virginia route was decided upon, but it was left to McLane&#x27;s immediate successor to see the goal realized. McLane never seemed to appreciate the value of this work and ultimately retired on September 13, 1848.

==Further diplomatic service and the Oregon cession==
In spite of his political setbacks McLane never lost his ambition for high political office. One of his last remaining political friends from the congressional days was James K. Polk, who was now President of the United States. While he dreamed of something much greater, McLane took a leave of absence from the railroad in 1845 and 1846 to return to England as Minister Plenipotentiary, primarily for the purpose of coordinating negotiations over the Oregon boundary. McLane was remembered fondly from his previous service, and renewed his old friendships. The basis of the settlement was easily established, but the hard line public position of Polk was shaken only by outbreak of the Mexican–American War. McLane succeeded in keeping the British agreeable to the eventual settlement until the administration came to the same conclusion, even if he risked suggesting the president was posturing when he insisted on &quot;54-40 or Fight.&quot; McLane never received the higher appointment desired and reluctantly returned to the railroad.

==Death and legacy==

The son of a Scots-Irish adventurer and politician from Delaware, McLane had married into the Eastern shore gentry of Maryland and ever longed for the idyllic plantation life seemingly promised. Acquiring &quot;Milligan Hall&quot; from his wife&#x27;s family gave him a beautiful seat on the Bohemia River that became his favorite home. Called &quot;Bohemia,&quot; by the McLane family, it was always their gathering place and favorite retreat. Further, with his adherence to the party of Andrew Jackson and resignation from the United States Senate in 1829, McLane effectively admitted his political career in Delaware was over. So it was only natural for McLane to move his primary residence to Baltimore when he joined the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He remained there after his retirement and entered the political life of his new home. Most notably he was an active participant in the Maryland constitutional convention of 1850.

McLane died in Baltimore, Maryland and is buried in Green Mount Cemetery.

McLane&#x27;s biographer, Professor John A. Munroe, described him as follows: 

He owned the Zachariah Ferris House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. His own house, the Louis McLane House, was listed in 1973.

<text>The 17th (Northern) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army formation raised during the Great War.

==Formation history==
The 17th (Northern) Division was created under Northern Command in September 1914, just a month after the British entry into the Great War, from men volunteering for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies. Most of the volunteers had had little prior military experience. Worsening the situation was an acute lack of experienced officers and NCO&#x27;s to train the new men as, due to the huge expansion of the British Army, experienced soldiers were needed everywhere. Furthermore, weapons and equipment, along with billets, were scarce.

The division, commanded by Major General Walter Kenyon-Slaney, part of Kitchener&#x27;s Second New Army (K2), concentrated throughout Dorset for training, moving to Hampshire in late May 1915. In early July the division sent advance parties to France in preparation for a move overseas, the rest of the division following a week later, moving to Saint-Omer for concentration. The division was to remain on the Western Front for the rest of the war, with most of the rest of 1915 being spent in the southern sector of the Ypres Salient, being instructed in trench warfare.

The division&#x27;s first major engagement was in July 1916, where the division, as part of V Corps, fought in the battles of Albert and Delville Wood, both part of the larger Battle of the Somme. On the first day on the Somme, on 1 July 1916, the 50th Brigade, in particular the 10th (Service) Battalion, West Yorkshires, suffered very heavy casualties, the highest sustained by any British unit on that day. On 13 July Major General Thomas Pilcher, who had been in command since January 1915, was sacked by his superiors, who were not impressed with him. He was replaced by Major General Philip Robertson, who was to remain in command for the rest of the war.

In April 1917 the division, now part of VI Corps, fought in the first and second battles of the Scarpe, both part of the Battle of Arras, where heavy casualties were sustained. The division later fought in the First and Second Battles of Passchendaele, part of the much longer Third Battle of Ypres.

Early 1918 saw the division resting after the battles of the previous year, again as part of V Corps. The division fought in the German Army&#x27;s Spring Offensives, followed by the Battle of Epehy and the Battle of Cambrai, both part of the attempt to smash the German Hindenburg Line during the Hundred Days Offensive which saw the end of the trench warfare and brought the war to an end on 11 November 1918.

During the Great War the 17th (Northern) Division had, from 1915, when it departed for the Western Front, until 1918, when the war ended, sustained 40,258 casualties.

<text>ACES (Spanish acronym: &quot;Aerolíneas Centrales de Colombia&quot;) was an airline with its headquarters in the Torre del Café in Medellín, Colombia and founded on August 30, 1971, by a group of 13 Colombian entrepreneurs, amongst them, most notably Orlando Botero Escobar and German Peñaloza Arias from Manizales and Luis H. Coulson, Jorge Coulson R., Alberto Jaramillo and Hernán Zuluaga from Medellín.

==History==

Mr. Botero and Mr. Peñaloza, who were considered pioneers in the early days of Colombian commercial aviation, had tried several times to establish a commuter service between Manizales and Bogotá. They managed to operate a small commuter airline by the name TARCA (acronym of &quot;Taxi Aéreo de Caldas&quot;), which was forced to shut down due to financial difficulties. With the support and capital of the new partners from Medellín, they embarked on the successful enterprise that would be ACES. The airline began service on February 22, 1972, with Saunders ST-27 aircraft for the routes Medellín-Bogotá and Manizales-Bogotá, and soon became a major player in the Colombian market. By 1976, the airline had expanded its network to smaller regional destinations, for which it purchased DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft.

In 1981, ACES acquired its first Boeing 727-100 jet. In 1986, an expansion began with the acquisition of more 727-100 and the arrival of Fairchild FH-227 aircraft built under license by Fairchild in the United States and with slight modifications. The 727s had a capacity of 129 passengers and the Fairchilds of 44. At this time the first international charter flights also began to Havana, Varadero, Nassau, Freeport, Montego Bay, Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, St. Kitts, St. Maarten, Porlamar and Cancun.

In 1991, ACES completely replaced its Fairchild F-27 fleet with ATR 42 turbo-prop aircraft for its short-haul regional routes, and its Boeing 727-100 with the Boeing 727-200 Advanced variant. In 1992, ACES expanded its service internationally, operating flights from Medellín and Bogotá to Miami. Soon after, Juan Emilio Posada was appointed CEO and would serve until the airline&#x27;s demise in 2003. In late 1997, ACES modernized its fleet acquiring brand-new Airbus A320-200 aircraft that replaced its Boeing 727s. It expanded its routes to Fort Lauderdale, Quito, Caracas, Cancún (served by charters), Santo Domingo, Punta Cana and San Juan, Puerto Rico; as well as additional domestic flights within Colombia.

ACES created a corporate culture of service and punctuality that would earn it the recognition and loyalty of its customers, resulting in consistent increases in its market share and revenues in the domestic market, which was dominated for decades by Avianca. It was named the &quot;Best airline in Colombia&quot; by several industry and consumer publications.

On May 20, 2002, ACES merged with major competitor Avianca and SAM to form the &quot;Alianza Summa&quot;, a strategic alliance aimed at joining forces to counteract the adverse circumstances that faced the airline industry in Colombia and the world after the September 11 attacks. ACES&#x27; operations were halted on August 20, 2003, after the board decided to liquidate the airline. By November 2003, Alianza Summa was dissolved and Avianca took over ACES&#x27; routes.

ACES had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On December 18, 1981, a DHC-6 Twin Otter (registered HK-2216) crashed in the municipality of San Antero, during the approach to the Coveñas Airport. In this incident 13 people perished, including the crew composed of Captain Guillermo Alberto García and co-pilot Andrés Rafael Londoño.
*On November 29, 1982, a DHC-6 Twin Otter (registered HK-2536) crashed in the foothills of the Eastern Cordillera against Cerro Pan de Azúcar in the township of San Juanito, Meta. The flight came on a regular flight from San José del Guaviare and was heading to Bogotá under the command of Captain Marino Jiménez and co-pilot Edison Santacoloma, who along with 20 passengers lost their lives.
*On August 1, 1988, a DHC-6 Twin Otter (registered HK-2445) was hijacked and demanded the pilot to land at an abandoned airstrip in Colombia. The passengers were reportedly robbed and the hijackers escaped, which six of them were later captured.
*On November 30, 1996, a DHC-6 Twin Otter, operating flight 148, (registered HK-2602) crashed into Cerro El Barcino a few minutes after takeoff from Olaya Herrera Airport. The flight was operating the route between Medellin, Bahía Solano and Quibdó. 14 people died in the impact and subsequent fire, including the crew commanded by Captain Juan Carlos Bermúdez López; one passenger survived with serious injuries.
*On October 11, 2000, an ATR 42-500 (registered VP-BOF) and a Boeing 727-200 (registered HK-3998X) collided on the El Dorado International Airport apron during the towing process. The ATR 42-500 was declared a total loss after the incident. There were no injuries or fatalities in this event.

<doc id="487886" wikidata="Q16933804" url="?curid=487886" title="Military tribunals in the United States">
<text>Military tribunals in the United States are military courts designed to judicially try members of enemy forces during wartime, operating outside the scope of conventional criminal and civil proceedings. The judges are military officers and fulfill the role of jurors. Military tribunals are distinct from courts-martial.

A military tribunal is an inquisitorial system based on charges brought by military authorities, prosecuted by a military authority, judged by military officers, and sentenced by military officers against a member of an enemy army.

The United States has made use of military tribunals or commissions, rather than rely on a court-martial, within the military justice system, during times of declared war or rebellion.

Most recently, as discussed below, the administration of George W. Bush sought to use military tribunals to try &quot;unlawful enemy combatants&quot;, mostly individuals captured abroad and held at a prison camp at a military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

==Jurisdiction==
A military tribunal or commission is most usually used to refer to a court that asserts jurisdiction over persons who are members of an enemy army, are held in military custody, and are accused of a violation of the laws of war. In contrast, courts-martial generally take jurisdiction over only members of their own military. A military tribunal or commission may still use the rules and procedures of a court-martial, although that is not generally the case.

Military tribunals also, generally speaking, do not assert jurisdiction over people who are acknowledged to be civilians who are alleged to have broken civil or criminal laws. However, military tribunals are sometimes used to try individuals not affiliated with a particular state&#x27;s military who are nonetheless accused of being combatants and acting in violation of the laws of war.

==History==
General George Washington used military tribunals during the American Revolution, including the prosecution of British Major John André, who was sentenced to death for spying and executed by hanging. Commissions were also used by General (and later President) Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812 to try a British spy; commissions, labeled &quot;Councils of War,&quot; were also used in the Mexican–American War.

The Union used military tribunals during and in the immediate aftermath of the American Civil War. Military tribunals were used to try Native Americans who fought the United States during those Indian Wars which occurred during the Civil War; the thirty-eight people who were executed after the Dakota War of 1862 were sentenced by a military tribunal. The so-called Lincoln conspirators were also tried by military commission in the spring and summer of 1865. The most prominent civilians tried in this way were Democratic politicians Clement L. Vallandigham, Lambdin P. Milligan, and Benjamin Gwinn Harris. All were convicted, and Harris was expelled from the Congress as a result. All of these tribunals were concluded prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Milligan&quot;.

The use of military tribunals in cases of civilians was often controversial, as tribunals represented a form of justice alien to the common law, which governs criminal justice in the United States, and provides for trial by jury, the presumption of innocence, forbids secret evidence, and provides for public proceedings. Critics of the Civil War military tribunals charged that they had become a political weapon, for which the accused had no legal recourse to the regularly constituted courts, and no recourse whatsoever except through an appeal to the President. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed, and unanimously ruled that military tribunals used to try civilians in any jurisdiction where the civil courts were functioning were unconstitutional, with its decision in &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot; (1866).

Military commissions were also used in the Philippines in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War; as these were used in an active war zone as an expedient of war, they did not fall afoul of &quot;Milligan&quot;.

During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a military tribunal for eight German prisoners accused of espionage and planning sabotage in the United States as part of Operation Pastorius. Roosevelt&#x27;s decision was challenged, but upheld, in &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot; (1942). All eight of the accused were convicted and sentenced to death. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942. Two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by Roosevelt to prison terms. In 1948, they were released by President Harry S. Truman and deported to the American occupation zone of Germany.

===Hamdi v. Rumsfeld===

Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court recognized the power of the U.S. government to detain enemy combatants, including U.S. citizens, but ruled that detainees who are U.S. citizens must have the rights of due process, and the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial authority.

It reversed the dismissal by a lower court of a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition brought on behalf of Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S. citizen who was being detained indefinitely as an illegal enemy combatant after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Following the court&#x27;s decision, on October 9, 2004, the U.S. government released Hamdi without charge and deported him to Saudi Arabia, where his family lived and he had grown up, on the condition that he renounce his U.S. citizenship and commit to travel prohibitions and other conditions.

<text>The Boeing Model 247 is an early American airliner, and one of the first such aircraft to incorporate advances such as all-metal (anodized aluminum) semimonocoque construction, a fully cantilevered wing, and retractable landing gear. Other advanced features included control surface trim tabs, an autopilot and de-icing boots for the wings and tailplane. The 247 first flew on February 8, 1933, and entered service later that year.

==Design and development==
Boeing introduced a host of aerodynamic and technical features into a new commercial airliner building on work with the earlier Monomail (Models 200, 221, 221A) mailplanes and B-9 bomber designs. The Boeing 247 was faster than the best U.S. fighter of its day, the open-cockpit biplane Boeing P-12. The low landing speed of avoided the need for flaps, and pilots learned that at speeds as low as , the 247 could be taxied &quot;tail high&quot; for ease of ground handling.

The 247 could fly on one engine. With controllable-pitch propellers, the 247 could maintain at maximum gross weight on one engine. Aside from its size, much lower wing loading, and the wing spar obstructing the cabin, many of its features became the norm for airliners, including the Douglas DC-1, before World War II. Originally planned as a 14-passenger airliner powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, the preliminary review of the design concept by United Air Lines&#x27; pilots had resulted in a redesign to a smaller, less capable configuration, powered by R-1340 Wasp engines.

One concern of the pilots was that in their view, few airfields could safely take an eight-ton aircraft. They also objected to the Hornet engines, which had a detonation problem when using the available low octane fuel, and suffered from excessive vibration. Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s chief engineer, George Mead, knew the problem would be resolved eventually, but P&amp;W&#x27;s president, Frederick Rentschler acquiesced to the airline pilots&#x27; demand. The decision created a rift between Mead and Rentschler. Despite the disagreements, the 247 would be Boeing&#x27;s showcase exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair.

The slope of the early 247&#x27;s windshield was reversed from normal. This was a design solution, also used on other contemporary aircraft, to the problem of control panel instrument lights reflecting off the windshield, but the reversed windshield reflected ground lights instead, especially during landings, and it also increased drag. By the introduction of the 247D, the windshield was sloped normally, and the glare was resolved with a glarescreen extension over the panel.

Boeing incorporated design elements to enhance passenger comfort, such as the thermostat controlled, air conditioned, and noise-proofed cabin. The crew included a pilot and copilot, as well as a flight attendant (then known as a &quot;steward&quot;), who could tend to passenger needs. The main landing gear did not fully retract; the wheels extended slightly below the nacelles, typical of designs of the time, as a means of reducing structural damage in a wheels-up landing. The tailwheel was not retractable. While the Model 247 and 247A had speed-ring engine cowlings and fixed-pitch propellers, the Model 247D incorporated NACA cowlings and variable-pitch propellers.

==Operational history==


As the 247 emerged from its test and development phase, the company further showcased its capabilities by entering a long-distance air race in 1934, the MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia. During the 1930s, aircraft designs were often proven in air races and other aerial contests. A modified 247D was entered, flown by Colonel Roscoe Turner and Clyde Pangborn. The 247, race number &quot;57&quot;, was essentially a production model, but all airliner furnishings were removed to accommodate eight additional fuselage fuel tanks. The MacRobertson Air Race attracted aircraft entries from all over the globe, including both prototypes and established production types, with the grueling course considered an excellent proving ground, as well as an opportunity to gain worldwide attention. Turner and Pangborn came in second place in the transport section (and third overall), behind the Boeing 247&#x27;s eventual rival, the new Douglas DC-2.

Being the winner of the 1934 U.S. Collier Trophy for excellence in aviation design, the first 247 production orders were earmarked for William Boeing&#x27;s airline, Boeing Air Transport. The 247 was capable of crossing the United States from east to west eight hours faster than its predecessors, such as the Ford Trimotor and Curtiss Condor. Entering service on May 22, 1933, a Boeing Air Transport 247 set a cross-country record of hours on its San Francisco to New York City inaugural flight.

Boeing sold the first 60 247s, an unprecedented $3.5 million order, to its affiliated airline, Boeing Air Transport (part of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, UATC), at a unit price of $65,000. TWA (Transcontinental &amp; Western Air) also ordered the 247, but UATC declined the order, which resulted in TWA President Jack Frye setting out requirements for a new airliner and funding Don Douglas to design and build the Douglas DC-1 prototype. Douglas eventually developed the design into the DC-2 and DC-3.

The Boeing design had been the first to enter series production, but the 247 proved to have some serious deficiencies. Airlines considered its limited capacity a drawback, since it carried only 10 passengers, in five rows with a seat on each side of the aisle, as well as a stewardess. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247&#x27;s main wing spar ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin had to step over it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration, and while it was a more compact design, the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and at a lower cost-per-mile.

Seventy-five 247s were built; Douglas collected 800 civil orders for DC-3s before the Pearl Harbor attack, and produced over 10,000 DC-3s, including wartime production of C-47s, while the rival Lockheed Electra &quot;family&quot; was eventually to reach over 3,000 in its various civil and military variants. Boeing Air Transport bought 60 examples, United Aircraft Corp. 10, Lufthansa ordered three, but only two were delivered, and one went to a private owner in China. While the industry primarily standardized on Boeing&#x27;s competitors, many of United&#x27;s aircraft were later purchased by Western Air Express at &quot;bargain-basement prices&quot;.
The 247 remained in airline service until World War II, when several were converted into C-73 transports and trainers. The Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s 121 Squadron operated seven 247Ds as medium transports during the early part of the war. One of these aircraft was donated to the Royal Air Force (RAF) for radar testing, where it was renumbered DZ203. DZ203 was passed among several units in the RAF before being used to make the world&#x27;s first fully automatic blind landing on 16 January 1945.

Warlord &quot;Young Marshal&quot; Zhang Xueliang ordered two Boeing 247Ds for his air force. He used one of them, named &quot;Bai-Ying&quot; (White Eagle), during the &quot;Xi&#x27;an incident&quot; in 1936, during which he flew into the opposing Nationalist army&#x27;s camp at &quot;Sian&quot; (now rendered as &quot;Xi&#x27;an&quot;) under a secret truce, and had their leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, arrested, ending the civil war between the Communist and Nationalist armies, so they could fight together against the Japanese invaders.

A number of specially modified variants included a Boeing 247Y appropriated from United for Air Corps use as a test aircraft fitted with two machine guns in the nose. The same installation later was fitted to a 247Y owned by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. This aircraft also featured a Colt machine gun in a flexible mount. A 247D purchased by the British RAF became a testbed for instrument approach equipment and received a nonstandard nose, new powerplants, and fixed landing gear. Some 247s were still flying in the late 1960s as cargo transports and business aircraft.

The Turner/Pangborn 247D still exists. Originally flown on September 5, 1934, it was leased from United Airlines for the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race and returned to United, where it served in regular airline service until 1937. Subsequently, the 247D was sold to the Union Electric Company of St. Louis for use as an executive transport. The Air Safety Board purchased the aircraft in 1939 and it remained in use for 14 years before it was donated to the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC. It is displayed today with two sets of markings, the left side is marked as NR257Y, in Colonel Turner&#x27;s 1934 MacRobertson Air Race colors, while the right side is painted in United Airlines livery, as NC13369.

<doc id="487891" wikidata="Q769070" url="?curid=487891" title="What's with Andy?">
<text>What&#x27;s with Andy? (French: &quot;Sacré Andy!&quot;) is an animated children&#x27;s television series loosely based on the semi-autobiographical &quot;Just!&quot; book series by Australian author Andy Griffiths. The series is produced by CinéGroupe and aired on Teletoon, with various Disney-affiliated foreign studios and networks involved throughout the production of the series.

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous teen and the self-proclaimed &quot;world&#x27;s greatest prankster&quot;. The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate practical jokes, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle, as his best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank; his antagonists include: his older sister, Jen Larkin; and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. He has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney, whom he usually tries to impress.

The first season features an American cast of voice actors (with the exception of Canadian-born Ian James Corlett) and takes place in the United States. However, starting with the second season, all voice actors and screenwriters are Canadians and the show is set in the Canadian Prairies. Throughout the series, Andy often breaks the fourth wall to address the audience, with the screen freezing in black and white in the first season – a distinctive feature of the show referred to as &quot;Doodle Vision&quot;.

==Characters==
===Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Larkin===
Andy is a teenager who loves to prank and joke people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is &quot;Cheque, please!&quot; His name comes from Andy Griffiths, whom he is based on.

===Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Tadeus Pickett===
Andy&#x27;s best friend and right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks and jokes. His last name has always been Pickett. The name &quot;Danny Pickett&quot; is taken directly from the Just books. It&#x27;s revealed in The Unfortunate One, that Danny is an Aries.

===Lori Mackney===
Andy&#x27;s crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy&#x27;s feelings and dislikes Jen because she thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a cropped green tank top, blue skirt and slide sandals. She is known as &quot;Lisa&quot; in the books.

===The Larkin family===
* Mr. Al Larkin: Andy and Jen&#x27;s father and Freida&#x27;s husband who also used to be a prankster, known as &quot;The Mystery Prankster and Jester&quot;, aka &quot;The Mystery Prankster and Jester of East Gackle&quot; (he hides this fact from his family). However, he was cured of pranking and joking by school counselor, Mrs. Murphy.
* Mrs. Freida Larkin: Andy and Jen&#x27;s mother and Al&#x27;s wife. She knows nothing about her husband&#x27;s past as a prankster and jester.
* Jennifer &quot;Jen&quot; Larkin: Andy&#x27;s older sister who is always cranky and irritable. She blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything and finds his pranks jokes childish and unfunny. She is unaware of her father&#x27;s past as a prankster and jester.
* Spank Larkin: Andy&#x27;s fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk. He also appears to have flatulence problems.
* Norman Larkin: Andy&#x27;s grandfather and Al&#x27;s father who is also a prankster and jester, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters and jesters (apparently with the exception of Al, but in the episode &quot;Mind Games&quot; it was revealed that he also used to be a prankster and jester, possibly even greater than his son or father).

===Recurring/minor characters===
* Teri: Jen&#x27;s best friend.
* Jervis Coltrane: A Canadian French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.
* Peter Lik and Andrew Leech: Peter and Andrew are Andy&#x27;s and Danny&#x27;s nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.
* Craig Bennett: Jen&#x27;s crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.
* Martin Bonwick: He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.
* Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Muskowitz (Mush): The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.
* Steve Rowgee Jr.: A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.
* Steve Rowgee Sr.: A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.
* Principal DeRosa: He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle who is obsessed with punishing Andy.
* Mr. Hutchins: One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank and joke him more than the other teachers.
* Mayor Henry K. Roth: The mayor of East Gackle.
* Mayor Simms: Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth&#x27;s rival.
* Clyde: The janitor of the school.
* Hazel Strinner: She has a crush on Andy and Lori&#x27;s protecting friend.
* Louella Berman: Frieda&#x27;s best friend.
* Mrs. Wibbles: Principal DeRosa&#x27;s secretary.

==Episodes==

==Production==
The show is based on Andy Griffiths&#x27; children&#x27;s series of &quot;Just!&quot; books (which were illustrated by Terry Denton), although many episodes are not directly based on the books. Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy&#x27;s last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori&#x27;s name being Lisa in the books. The book series was based on the early life of Andy Griffiths.

It was originally an interactive Flash movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for Fox Kids. A TV adaptation was announced by CinéGroupe on March 23, 2001 for broadcast on Teletoon and Fox Family later on in the year. Saban Entertainment participated in production and held distribution rights (Saban International).

The main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio SIP Animation (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel Super RTL. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin&#x27;s voice actor Ian James Corlett, as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary Buena Vista International Television.

In September 2003, the voice of Lori in Season 2, Jaclyn Linetsky, who also played the title character on Caillou, Meg in Mega Babies, and Megan O’ Connor in 15/Love, died in a traffic collision during production. She had managed to finish all of Season 2 prior to her death, but for the following season she was replaced by Eleanor Noble. The episode &quot;Nurse Jen&quot; was dedicated in her memory.

Season 3 was a collaboration between CinéGroupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to CinéGroupe distribution partner HG Distribution&#x27;s catalogue.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
&quot;What&#x27;s with Andy?&quot; originally aired on Teletoon in Canada. In Australia, where the books originated, it was broadcast on Fox Kids.

====United States====
In the United States, the series was first shown on September 22, 2001 on Fox Family Channel, later ABC Family. On January 17, 2005, it premiered on Toon Disney, which also had rights to the second but not the third season.

====Europe====
In Europe, the series was licensed to Fox Kids Europe, with television distribution serviced by Buena Vista International Television. The show aired on Fox Kids networks in the UK, France and Greece, with Super RTL in Germany and TF1 in France having free-TV rights at the time. By June 2003, plans for the series to air on Fox Kids in Central and Eastern Europe were announced, along with plans for a free-TV expansion for the series, with plans to pre-sell the series to Fox Kids in the Netherlands, Mediatrade in Italy, Antena 3 in Spain, SIC in Portugal and RTE in Ireland.

The show continued to air on the network after the rebranding as Jetix.

===Home media===
====VHS====
On April 8, 2003, CinéGroupe Star released a set of three VHS tapes called &quot;Double Trouble&quot;/&quot;Sacré Délire&quot;, which featured an episode each from this show and &quot;The Kids from Room 402&quot;, alongside a music video from the &quot;Pig City&quot; tie-in album &quot;Reggie and the Rashers&quot;. Volume 1 featured the episode &quot;It Came from East Gackle&quot;, Volume 2 featured the episode &quot;Just Stuffing&quot;, and Volume 3 featured the episode &quot;Rhyme Time&quot;. The releases were sold in separate English and French versions, respectively.

====DVD====
As with many other Saban Entertainment series, the only major English-language DVD release is by Czech distributor North Video, featuring both Czech and English audio and original video (with English-language text) in the original production order. The first 33 episodes (including all 26 episodes from season 1) were released on 10 volumes, from April 13 to July 15, 2010.

The show was also released on DVD in other European countries, but only in the respective languages (i.e. without the original English audio). All of season 2 (and most of season 1) was released on DVD in Germany, and the entirety of season 1 was released on 5 DVD volumes in Russia.

===Streaming===
Season 3 was available on the Canadian YouTube channel Encore+ in both English and French until its shutdown in November 2022. This season was previously available in German on Kividoo.

===Music===
The three German-language theme songs for each season were released on Toggo music CDs volumes 4, 7, and 17 respectively by Sony Music, with the first and third-season songs being extended versions. The original English-language theme was also released on volume 2.

The soundtrack (including themes) from the first two seasons is distributed as production music by Red Brick Songs (formerly Casablanca Media Publishing) in Canada.

==Reception==
&quot;What&#x27;s with Andy?&quot; received very high ratings in a number of countries. On Teletoon in Canada, it was reported to be the second highest-rated original production as of October 2007. It also had about 40% market share in France (Fox Kids/TF1) and Germany as of 2003. The show won a fall 2002 Super RTL cartoon election poll with 60% of the vote, and obtained the second-highest ratings on the channel in July 2006.

The series&#x27; sense of humour proved popular enough that Teletoon&#x27;s vice president of programming cited it as an influence on the later Teletoon original &quot;Carl²&quot;.

<text>The sticklebacks are a family of ray-finned fishes, the Gasterosteidae which have a Holarctic distribution in fresh, brackish and marine waters. They were thought to be related to the pipefish and seahorses but are now thought to be more closely related to the eelpouts and sculpins.

==Taxonomy==
The stickleback family, Gasterosteidae, was first proposed as a family by the French zoologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1831. It was long thought that the sticklebacks and their relatives made up a suborder, the Gasterosteoidei, of the order Gasterostiformes with the sea horses and pipefishes making up the suborder Syngnathoidei. More recent phylogenetic work has shown that the Gaterosteoidei is more closely related to the Zoarcoidei and the Cottoidei, which means that this taxon would belong in the order Scorpaeniformes. but in other phylogenetic classifications it is treated as the infraorder Gasterosteales within the suborder Cottoidei or as a sister clade to the Zoarcales in the order Zoarciformes.

FishBase recognises 16 species in the family, grouped in five genera. However, several of the species have a number of recognised subspecies, and the taxonomy of the family is thought to be in need of revision.

===Genera===
The family Gasterosteidae includes the following genera:

* &quot;Apeltes&quot; 
* &quot;Culaea&quot; 
* &quot;Gasterosteus&quot; 
* &quot;Pungitius&quot; 
* &quot;Spinachia&quot; 

==Description==
Sticklebacks are endemic to the temperate zone and are most commonly found in the ocean, but some can be found in fresh water. The freshwater taxa were trapped in Europe, Asia, and North America after the Ice Age 10,000–20,000 years ago, and have evolved features different from those of the marine species.

Sticklebacks are carnivorous, feeding on small animals such as insects, crustaceans and fish larvae.

Sticklebacks are characterised by the presence of strong and clearly isolated spines in their dorsal fins. An unusual feature of sticklebacks is that they have no scales, although some species have bony armour plates.

===Sizes===
The maximum size of the best-known species, the three-spined stickleback (&quot;Gasterosteus aculeatus&quot;), is about 4 inches, but few of them are more than 3 inches long. They mature sexually at a length of about 2 inches. Most other stickleback species are roughly similar in size or somewhat smaller. The only exception is the far larger fifteen-spined stickleback (&quot;Spinachia spinachia&quot;), which can reach 22 cm (approx. 8.8 inches). Body form varies with habitat: sticklebacks in shallow lakes have developed a deep body specialized to enable feeding on benthic invertebrates, whilst those in deep oligotrophic lakes have adapted to feed on plankton and have a more slimlined body.

===Personality===
Research has shown that Sticklebacks display distinct personality traits, specifically in the area of taking a risk, and, can be considered bold or shy. These personality traits were determined to directly influence if they would lead, and if discouraged, attempt to lead again.

==Mating==
All stickleback species show similar, unusual mating behaviour. Freshwater males develop a red colouration, and although this may be seen in oceanic and benthic species these tend to remain dull-coloured. The male then constructs a nest from weeds held together by spiggin, a kidney secretion, then attract females to the nest. Females signal their readiness to mate with solitary rather than shoaling behaviour, a head-up posture; their bellies are also obviously distended with eggs. Courtship typically involves a zig-zag &#x27;dance&#x27; where the male approaches the female in an erratic side-to-side pattern, and dorsal pricking of the female&#x27;s abdomen. A female lays her eggs inside the nest, where the male fertilises them. The male then guards the eggs until they hatch 7–14 days later (depending on temperature), and may continue to guard the fry after they hatch. This large investment in both the nesting site and guarding of the eggs limits the number of females a male can mate with however males spawn multiple times. This introduces the ability for selection to favor male mate choice. Some males die following spawning.

=== Mating choice ===
Typically, the sex with the greatest parental investment has the strongest mate preferences. Stickleback species exhibit mutual mate choice in which both the male and female have strong mate preferences. This is due in part to the strong parental investment on behalf of the male in guarding the eggs.

=== Female mate choice ===
Female sticklebacks show a strong preference to male stickleback with bright red coloration under their throats. Females mate both more often with males with brighter red coloration and give on average, larger eggs to be fertilized by these males. This preference has led to brighter red coloring. This association is possible because the red coloration can only be produced by males that are free of parasites. This is referred to in the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis.

However, there is also evidence that attractive male red coloration may be a faulty signal of male quality. Male sticklebacks that are more attractive to females due to carotenoid colorants may under-allocate carotenoids to their germline cells. Since carotinoids are beneficial antioxidants, their under-allocation to germline cells can lead to increased oxidative DNA damage to these cells. Therefore, female sticklebacks may risk fertility and the viability of their offspring by choosing redder, but more deteriorated partners with reduced sperm quality.

Female mate choice has also been seen to be condition dependent. Females are almost always the more choosy sex in most species. Female sticklebacks though, have been found to be less choosy of mates when in poor physical condition and inversely, more choosy in good condition.

=== Male mate choice ===
In some species, such as the three-spined stickleback, the large investment in both nesting site and guarding of eggs by males limits the number of females a male can mate with. This introduces the ability for selection to favor male mate choice. Male mate choice is rarely studied or observed in many species but multiple studies have confirmed male mate choice within stickleback species. Males show a choosiness similar to females as to what female they are willing to court and mate. Male sticklebacks have been observed to show preference towards female sticklebacks that are larger and longer. This is believed to be because larger females on average produce larger eggs, which leads to a greater offspring survival and fitness. In addition, male sticklebacks have also been observed to prefer females with more distended or bloated stomachs. The benefits of this is also due to larger eggs and thus offspring survival and fitness

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Female three-spined sticklebacks adjust their courting behaviour to the risk of inbreeding. When gravid females are given the choice between a courting unfamiliar non-sibling and a familiar brother, they prefer to mate with the non-sibling and thus avoid the disadvantages that accompany incest. Eggs from inbred matings compared to eggs from outbred matings have a lower rate of fertilization and hatching, and fewer progeny survive to reproductive age.

==Use in science==
Niko Tinbergen&#x27;s studies of the behaviour of this fish were important in the early development of ethology as an example of a fixed action pattern. More recently, the fish have become a favourite system for studying the molecular genetics of evolutionary change in wild populations and a powerful &quot;supermodel&quot; for combining evolutionary studies at molecular, developmental, population genetic, and ecological levels. The nearly complete genome sequence of a reference freshwater stickleback was described in 2012, along with set of genetic variants commonly found in 21 marine and freshwater populations around the world. Some variants, and several chromosome inversions, consistently distinguish marine and freshwater populations, helping identify a genome-wide set of changes contributing to repeated adaptation of sticklebacks to marine and freshwater environments. The adaptations seen in oceanic threespine sticklebacks make them an ideal organism for the study of parallel evolution.

==In culture==

There is a sculpture in Kronstadt dedicated to stickleback, which saved thousands of city residents from starvation during the Leningrad Siege of World War II.
