==Plot==
One day, Shuji on his motorbike and Kyoko in her car meet at the crossroads—they get into a small argument over her driving. They don&#x27;t have any interest in each other at that moment but at the library where Kyoko works. Shuji sees Kyoko using a wheelchair. That was how they first met. They begin to talk and Kyoko feels regarded because Shuji never looked at her as a disabled person. Gradually, her feelings change and she waits for Shuji to come to the library.

Shuji works as a hairstylist at a popular hair salon called HOT LIP. A fashion magazine asks the salon to choose its best haircut for an article, and the owner says that both Shuji and Satoru should find a cut model themselves and that he will choose the best haircut. After some thought, Shuji asks Kyoko to be his cut model. She first says no, worried about her appearance and her disability, but Shuji tells her that he will be her ‘barrier free’ so she does not need to be anxious about it.

Shuji&#x27;s haircut is chosen for the magazine, but Kyoko feels ashamed when she sees it. Everyone thinks the magazine chose Shuji&#x27;s design because Kyoko was in a wheelchair in the photo, just because of the &#x27;impact&#x27; it makes. But soon, Sachie tells Kyoko she shouldn&#x27;t care about her appearance.

Satoru feels jealous of Shuji because Shuji is becoming more popular. Satoru steals Shuji&#x27;s haircut design and says it is his. But Shuji becomes a Top Stylist so he forgets about the stealing.

Gradually, Shuji and Kyoko get close. But still, Kyoko doesn&#x27;t trust Shuji from her heart. Shuji is now the best hairstylist at HOT LIP and he is very busy. They don&#x27;t have time to see each other.

Sachie and Masao are getting close too. At first they are both scared to speak because they like each other, but slowly, they get to know each other.

Kyoko is worried because she and Shuji live in completely different worlds. She thinks about breaking up with him. On the other hand, Takumi was resisting Shuji but he realizes that Shuji was the one who was right and forgets about all the jealousy.

Sachie gets pregnant but Masao tells her he can&#x27;t marry yet because he is worried about Kyoko&#x27;s disease. Kyoko&#x27;s mother tells Shuji about her disease that she doesn&#x27;t know how much of her life is left and she can die at any time.

The story is getting closer to the end now and Kyoko&#x27;s condition is getting very bad. She is told to enter the hospital but soon after, knowing that it is not good for her body, she leaves the hospital and starts to live together with Shuji. Masao, Sachie, and Kyoko&#x27;s parents all support Shuji and Kyoko.

Her sickness is getting worse every day. But one day, Shuji takes part in a fashion show as a hairstylist. Kyoko asks if she could go and see the show but her brother Masao and Sachie both tell her that her body will not be able to bear it. But in the end, the three of them go to the show.

Kyoko faints while watching the show and she is carried to the hospital. Soon, she passes away.

The series ends with a scene from a few years later. Shuji has opened a hair salon at the seaside and is living with the memory of Kyoko.

<doc id="495095" wikidata="Q2721209" url="?curid=495095" title="Akagi (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuyuki Fukumoto. First published in 1991 in Takeshobo&#x27;s weekly magazine &quot;Kindai Mahjong&quot;, it is a spin-off prequel to the author&#x27;s previous work &quot;Ten&quot;. It revolves around Shigeru Akagi, a boy who defeats yakuza members well versed in mahjong at 13. He returns to the game six years later, carrying a mythical status and still impresses his opponents.

It was adapted as two V-Cinema live-action films directed by Kenzō Maihara in 1995 and 1997. A 26-episode anime television series directed by Yūzō Satō was broadcast on Nippon Television from October 2005 to March 2006. Two live-action television dramas directed by Mitsuru Kubota aired on BS SKY PerfecTV! between July 2015 and June 2018. The series has also spawned several companion books, spin-off manga, video games, and other merchandise.

By February 2017, the &quot;Akagi&quot; manga series had over 12 million copies in circulation.

==Plot==
The story revolves around the mahjong gambling exploits of (voiced by Masato Hagiwara in the anime adaptation). After a death-defying game of chicken one evening in 1958, Akagi nonchalantly enters a yakuza mahjong parlor to shake the police&#x27;s trail. Although he is unfamiliar with the rules of mahjong, his gambling intuition saves a small-time gambler, (voiced by Rikiya Koyama), and grants him a seat at the gambling table. As the night progresses, the stakes are raised both within the game and for Akagi, who is under the suspicion of the local policeman, (voiced by Tessho Genda). However, Akagi manages to defeat (voiced by Wataru Takagi)—despite Yagi&#x27;s cheating during the game—and impresses the members of the gambling house. Yasuoka arranges a new match against other yakuza members, in which Akagi defeats (voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka), a blind professional mahjong player with very accurate hearing. After defeating him, Akagi gains mythical status at 13 but then disappears, becoming a legendary figure all over Japan.

Six years later, Yasuoka orders (voiced by Ginpei Sato) to pretend to be Akagi to impress some yakuza bosses and make money. Meanwhile, Nangō finds the real Akagi, now aged 19 and working at a toy factory. Akagi, however, does not need to play with Hirayama as Hirayama is defeated by (voiced by Morio Kazama), a professional mahjong player for another yakuza group who is later defeated by Akagi. Akagi&#x27;s ultimate rival is (voiced by Masane Tsukayama), an old man who has made a lot of money and become one of the most powerful people in the Japanese underworld. Having built up massive funds from shady dealings in Japan&#x27;s post-war era, Washizu tempts people to bet their lives for the chance to win a large amount of money. Washizu and Akagi play mahjong in an unusual way that Washizu calls &quot;Washizu Mahjong,&quot; in which transparent glass tiles replace most of the tiles and make the game different in many ways. Three years after the fight with Washizu, Akagi is last seen winning big in Tehonbiki, a gambling game that leaves no room for chance, and wandering around local gambling dens with (voiced by Yūdai Satō), a freckled young coworker from the toy factory they used to work at.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Akagi: Yami ni Oritatta Tensai&quot;, written and illustrated by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, is a spin-off of Fukumoto&#x27;s 1989 manga series, &quot;Ten: Tenhōdōri no Kaidanji&quot;. Its first chapter was published in Takeshobo&#x27;s magazine &quot;Kindai Mahjong&quot; on June 1, 1991. The manga&#x27;s first (collected volume) was released by Takeshobo on April 24, 1992. Some volumes—26 and 28—were published both on a regular and a special edition. The former had a 13-year-old Akagi plush doll as a bonus and the latter included a Zippo lighter in the format of a mahjong tile engraved with Akagi&#x27;s and Washizu&#x27;s faces. Its latest volume—the 36th—was published on June 27, 2018.

In February 2017, Takeshobo started to display eight different posters at 15 major railway stations on the Yamanote Line in Tokyo to announce the series planned conclusion on February 1, 2018. However, the series editor said it did not mean the manga would really reach its conclusion but that it would continue irregularly. To announce it one year before the ending was in fact a marketing strategy to attract the readers who quit reading the series and those who did not read it yet. A three-on-one edition featuring new cover illustrations started to be published on February 15, 2017, and marked the start of what the editor called their one-year &quot;grace period&quot; as part of their tactic to attract readers. The 33rd and latest volume of this edition was published on December 26, 2017.

==Reception==
===Public response===
By February 2017, the &quot;Akagi&quot; manga had over 12 million copies in circulation worldwide. Individual volumes have been featured in Oricon&#x27;s weekly charts of best-selling manga in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016. The series has a cult following, and has aroused interest for mahjong in the West, especially in Russia, where it &quot;ignited a boom&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Akagi&quot; has been surpassed in popularity by Fukumoto&#x27;s other work, &quot;Kaiji&quot;.

===Critical response===
English-language reviewers have analyzed the anime adaptation more than the manga. David Cabrera of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; called Akagi a &quot;nihilistic badass,&quot; highlighting how he can &quot;psychologically dismantle a man.&quot; Both John Oppliger of AnimeNation and &quot;Anime News Network&quot;&#x27;s Michael Toole compared it to &quot;Kaiji&quot;. Oppliger, however, stated that &quot;Kaiji&quot; relies on events but &quot;Akagi&quot; is based on &quot;skilled gamesmanship.&quot; He opined that the series is &quot;engrossing and addicting because of its smart, suspenseful writing.&quot; Toole found it reminiscent of a period piece due to the 1950–60&#x27;s setting, calling it a &quot;cool series&quot; because of this. He also declared that &quot;&quot;Akagi&quot; isn&#x27;t about whether or not the title character will win—he will definitely win. It&#x27;s about the joy of seeing how he wins, about observing a young man who seriously does not give a fuck relentlessly picking off bad guy after bad guy.&quot;

Bradley Meek wrote for &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; how it differed from traditional sports anime, describing it as a &quot;hard-boiled, grimy&quot; anime in which &quot;there&#x27;s a tangible sense of danger&quot;. Concluding that &quot;it has an appealing package, but not a lot of entertainment value. This anime is a dark tale about characters who gamble for very high stakes illegally in smoke filled rooms guarded by bulky men in sunglasses. There&#x27;s a tangible sense of danger in this anime; when characters sweat over what their next move will be, they have a good reason&quot;. He also mentioned that he, as a layperson, could not understand the jargon of the mahjong matches that Akagi plays. &quot;UK Anime Network&quot;&#x27;s Elliot Page gave the anime series a 8 out of 10, he argued that understanding mahjong was not necessary as the entertainment is provided not by the mahjong itself but by the characters&#x27; attitudes, and highlighted how the narrator provides further tension in the events. Page praised the uncommon animation style that, &quot;while not amazing by any metric, are tuned to be highly expressive, dragging you into the action and the intensity of the moment&quot;. He also mentioned that the last arc does not finish in the anime series, and concluded with, &quot;arguably this isn&#x27;t very important in the grand scheme - as the main joy of the series is watching the mind games on display as the opponents try and mentally dismantle each other, which it does still deliver in spades&quot;.

<text>The Dorian mode or Doric mode can refer to three very different but interrelated subjects: one of the Ancient Greek &quot;harmoniai&quot; (characteristic melodic behaviour, or the scale structure associated with it); one of the medieval musical modes; or—most commonly—one of the modern modal diatonic scales, corresponding to the piano keyboard&#x27;s white notes from D to D, or any transposition of itself.

&lt;/score&gt;

== Greek Dorian mode ==
The Dorian mode (properly &quot;harmonia&quot; or &quot;tonos&quot;) is named after the Dorian Greeks. Applied to a whole octave, the Dorian octave species was built upon two tetrachords (four-note segments) separated by a whole tone, running from the &quot;hypate meson&quot; to the &quot;nete diezeugmenon&quot;.

In the enharmonic genus, the intervals in each tetrachord are quarter tone–quarter tone–major third.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Dorian tonos (enharmonic genus) on E } feh geses a b ceh deses e
&lt;/score&gt;

In the chromatic genus, they are semitone–semitone–minor third.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Dorian tonos (chromatic genus) on E } f ges a b c des e
&lt;/score&gt;

In the diatonic genus, they are semitone–tone–tone.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Dorian tonos (diatonic genus) on E } f g a b c d e
&lt;/score&gt;

In the diatonic genus, the sequence over the octave is the same as that produced by playing all the white notes of a piano ascending from E to E, a sequence equivalent to the pattern of the modern Phrygian mode, although the temperament differs by small amounts.

Placing the single tone at the bottom of the scale followed by two conjunct tetrachords (that is, the top note of the first tetrachord is also the bottom note of the second), produces the Hypodorian (&quot;below Dorian&quot;) octave species: A | B C D E | (E) F G A. Placing the two conjunct tetrachords together and the single tone at the top of the scale produces the Mixolydian octave species, a note sequence equivalent to modern Locrian mode.

==Medieval Dorian mode==
The early Byzantine church developed a system of eight musical modes (the octoechos), which served as a model for medieval European chant theorists when they developed their own modal classification system starting in the 9th century. The success of the Western synthesis of this system with elements from the fourth book of &quot;De institutione musica&quot; of Boethius, created the false impression that the Byzantine octoechos was inherited directly from ancient Greece.

Originally used to designate one of the traditional &quot;harmoniai&quot; of Greek theory (a term with various meanings, including the sense of an octave consisting of eight tones), the name was appropriated (along with six others) by the 2nd-century theorist Ptolemy to designate his seven &quot;tonoi&quot;, or transposition keys. Four centuries later, Boethius interpreted Ptolemy in Latin, still with the meaning of transposition keys, not scales. When chant theory was first being formulated in the 9th century, these seven names plus an eighth, Hypermixolydian (later changed to Hypomixolydian), were again re-appropriated in the anonymous treatise &quot;Alia Musica&quot;. A commentary on that treatise, called the &quot;Nova expositio&quot;, first gave it a new sense as one of a set of eight diatonic species of the octave, or scales.

In medieval theory, the authentic Dorian mode could include the note B &quot;by licence&quot;, in addition to B. The same scalar pattern, but starting a fourth or fifth below the mode final D, and extending a fifth above (or a sixth, terminating on B), was numbered as mode 2 in the medieval system. This was the plagal mode corresponding to the authentic Dorian, and was called the Hypodorian mode. In the untransposed form on D, in both the authentic and plagal forms the note C is often raised to C to form a leading tone, and the variable sixth step is in general B in ascending lines and B in descent.

==Modern Dorian mode==
The modern Dorian mode (also called &quot;Russian minor&quot; by Balakirev,) by contrast, is a strictly diatonic scale corresponding to the white keys of the piano from D to D (shown below)

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 d4^\markup { Modern D Dorian mode } e f g a b c d2
&lt;/score&gt;

or any transposition of its interval pattern, which has the ascending pattern of whole steps and half steps as follows:

: whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half, whole

Thus, the Dorian mode is a symmetric scale, since the pattern of whole and half steps is the same ascending or descending.

The modern Dorian mode can also be thought of as a scale with a minor third and seventh, a major second and sixth, and a perfect fourth and fifth, notated relative to the major scale as:

: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

It may be considered an &quot;excerpt&quot; of a major scale played from the pitch a whole tone above the major scale&#x27;s tonic, i.e., a major scale played from its second scale degree up to its second degree again. The resulting scale is, however, &quot;minor&quot; in quality, because, as the D becomes the new tonal centre, the F a minor third above the D becomes the new mediant, or third degree. Thus, when a triad is built upon the tonic, it is a minor triad.

The modern Dorian mode is equivalent to the natural minor scale (or the Aeolian mode) but with a major sixth. The modern Dorian mode resembles the Greek Phrygian &quot;harmonia&quot; in the diatonic genus.
It is also equivalent to the ascending melodic minor scale with a minor seventh.

==Notable compositions in Dorian mode==


===Traditional===
* &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot;
* &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;
* &quot;Noël nouvelet&quot; (15th century French Christmas carol, often sung in English as &quot;Sing We Now of Christmas&quot;)

===Medieval===
* &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;, Gregorian chant (Marian hymn)
* &quot;Dies irae&quot; (original setting in Gregorian chant, sequence).
* &quot;Victimae paschali laudes&quot;, Gregorian chant (sequence)
* &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot;, Gregorian chant (sequence)
* &quot;Alle Psallite Cum Luya&quot;, an anonymous three-part Latin motet from the late 13th or early 14th century, recorded in the Montpellier Codex and thought to have originated in France.
*&quot;Chominciamento di gioia&quot;, a 14th-century monophonic Italian estampie in five sections (British Library, Add MS 29987, No. 78).
* &quot;Lamento di Tristano&quot;, a 14th-century monophonic Italian dance in two parts, with the second section designated &quot;La Rotta&quot; (British Library, Add MS 29987, No. 91).
* &quot;La Manfredina&quot;, a 14th-century monophonic Italian dance in two parts, with the second section designated &quot;La Rotta della Manfredina&quot; (British Library, Add MS 29987, No. 92).
* The Kyrie, Gloria, and Credo of &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; (Mass of Our Lady), a polyphonic mass composed before 1365 by French poet and composer Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300–1377).
*&quot;Personent Hodie&quot;, Medieval Latin Christmas carol

===Renaissance===
* &quot;Il est bel et bon&quot;, a madrigal by Pierre Passereau

===Baroque===
* &quot;Chorale prelude for organ in Dorian mode, BuxWV 180: Christ, unser Herr zum Jordan kam&quot;, an organ piece by Dieterich Buxtehude.
* &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538&quot;, an organ piece by Johann Sebastian Bach (also informally known as &quot;the Dorian&quot; to distinguish it from the better known &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565&quot;). Although Bach left no explicit indication, the piece is commonly assumed to be in the Dorian mode, since it bears no key signature.

===Romantic===
* The &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot; in the Credo movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;.
* The &quot;Royal March of the Lions&quot; from Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot; suite uses Dorian mode to evoke a &quot;Persian style.&quot;
* Large portions of the Symphony No. 6 by Jean Sibelius are in the Dorian mode.
* In &quot;La Brise&quot; (from the &quot;Mélodies Persanes&quot;, Op. 26), Saint-Saëns uses an E Dorian scale in the first half of the song.

===Jazz===
* &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; by Herbie Hancock – The composition takes an AABA form with chords in the &quot;A&quot; sections in D Dorian and the &quot;B&quot; section in E Dorian.
* &quot;Milestones&quot; by Miles Davis
* &quot;Oye Como Va&quot; by Tito Puente, popularized by Santana
* &quot;So What&quot; by Miles Davis – The composition takes an AABA form with the &quot;A&quot; sections in D Dorian and the &quot;B&quot; section in E Dorian.

===Popular===
* &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot; written by Booker T. Jones and William Bell. The song is a simple but atypical I7-V7-IV7 12-bar progression with a key signature corresponding to C major but with every B and E lowered to B and E, making the song C Dorian.
* &quot;Dorian&quot; by First of October. The song uses the modern Dorian scale on the piano during the choruses to build tension, while staying in the key of D minor for the verses and melody.
* &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; by the Beatles is often cited as a Dorian modal piece, and while the melody line in places uses the major sixth scale degree, the chord progression is in Aeolian (I–VI and VI–I).
* The chord sequence i–III–VII–IV is sometimes used in pop songs, where the harmonic rhythm leads the listener to think of it as a minor song. In the final chord of the sequence, however, the third is a major sixth above the tonic, as in the Dorian scale. Examples include: &quot;Mad World&quot; by Tears for Fears.
* &quot;Get Lucky&quot; by Daft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams (B Dorian)
* &quot;The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia&quot; (1973) by Vicki Lawrence
* &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by Sugarhill Gang is often written in E minor with a persistent C accidental, but is actually played in E Dorian. It shares a key signature (F, C) with its relative key, D major.
* &quot;Tick Tock&quot; by Clean Bandit (and Mabel) sounds heavily pentatonic, but is in fact (nominally) in the &#x27;D&#x27; Dorian mode.

<doc id="495100" wikidata="Q250526" url="?curid=495100" title="Dororo">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by the manga artist Osamu Tezuka. Tezuka&#x27;s childhood memory of his friends pronouncing as &quot;dororo&quot; inspired the title of the series. &quot;Dororo&quot; was first serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; between August 1967 and July 1968, before being cancelled. The manga was then concluded in Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Bōken&#x27;ō&quot; magazine in 1969.

A 26-episode anime television series adaptation produced by Mushi Productions aired in 1969. The anime series bears the distinction of being the first entry in what is now known as the &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot; series (&quot;Calpis Comic Theater&quot; at the time). &quot;Dororo&quot; was also made into a live-action film in 2007. A 24-episode second anime television series adaptation by MAPPA and Tezuka Productions aired from January to June 2019.

==Plot==
&quot;Dororo&quot; revolves around a &quot;rōnin&quot; named and young orphaned thief named during the Sengoku period. The rōnin was born malformed, limbless and without facial features or internal organs. This was the result of his birth father &quot;daimyō&quot; Kagemitsu Daigō forging a pact with 48 sealed demons so that he might rule the land and increase its wealth and prosperity. In return, he promised the demons anything that they wanted which belonged to him. This enabled them to roam free and commit atrocities in the countryside.

After his mother Nui no Kata was forced to set him adrift on the river, lest he be killed by his father, the infant was subsequently found and raised by Jukai, a medicine man who used healing magic and alchemical methods to give the child prostheses crafted from the remains of children who had died in the war. As a result, the boy became nearly invincible against any mortal blow. Grafted into his left arm was a very special blade that a traveling storyteller presented to Jukai, believing it was fated to be within his possession given that ever since the boy had been discovered, the doctor had been visited by goblins. As revealed in a short tale about the blade&#x27;s origin, the blade had been forged out of vengeance to kill goblins as well as other supernatural entities.

After the sensei was forced to send him on his way because he was attracting demons, the young man learned from a ghostly voice of the curse that had been set upon him at birth that by killing the demons responsible he could reclaim the stolen pieces of his body and thus regain his humanity. Across his travels, he earned the name among other names for his inhuman nature. On one such hunt of a demon, Hyakkimaru came across a young orphan thief named Dororo, who thereafter travels by his side through the war-torn countryside. When Hyakkimaru met Dororo, he had already killed 15 demons.

Throughout their journey, Hyakkimaru killed six more demons, bringing the total to 21. Along the way, Hyakkimaru learns that Dororo was hiding a big secret. Dororo&#x27;s father, Bandit Hibukuro, hid money he saved up on his raids on Bone Cape to later be distributed to the people squeezed dry by the samurai. Itachi, a bandit who betrayed Hibukuro and sided with the authorities, crippled Hibukuro. Hibukuro escaped with limping legs, along with his wife and young child. Hibukuro dies trying to let his remaining family escape. Fearing that she, too, will die, Ojiya had prayed to Buddha and, with her blood, drew the map that will lead him to Bone Cape. Three days later, she froze to death.

Itachi kidnapped Dororo and used the map on his back to lead them to Bone Cape. A mysterious boatman ferried them to the cape but he had two demon sharks with him. One of the sharks ate half of Itachi&#x27;s bandits while the other shark left with the boatman. However, Dororo and the remaining bandits managed to kill the shark. When the boatman and the second shark returned, Dororo was able to separate the boatman and the shark. Hyakkimaru arrived to stab the shark in one of its eyes, but it escaped. They held the boatman prisoner and then they landed on Bone Cape.

The boatman told the thirsty bandits of a spring not too far from their camp, and they went to drink, leaving Itachi, Dororo, the boatman, and Hyakkimaru. Dororo later found their corpses and blood leading to the half-blind shark. Hyakkimaru killed the shark and the boatman, then recovered his real voice. Itachi went to search for the money but only found a letter from Hibukuro saying that he had hidden it somewhere else. The magistrate arrived under the pretense of getting rid of the bandits but actually came for the treasure. Hyakkimaru, Dororo, and Itachi kill them, but Itachi was left for dead. Hyakkimaru and Dororo continued on their journey.

Sometime later Hyakkimaru learns that his father, Kagemitsu Daigo, was possessed by the 48 demons, and went to slay him. Things were going badly on the Daigo clan&#x27;s land, and the citizens were forced to build a fort for him. The slaves were planning a rebellion, but one of the slaves told Kagemitsu of their plans, and he was prepared. His archers shot and killed many slaves and the remainder hid in a tunnel they had built under the fort.

Hyakkimaru left Dororo and ran into the fort. Dororo joined the slaves in their ambush, but Kagemitsu Daigo&#x27;s soldiers caught Dororo. To prove his loyalty, Kagemitsu told Hyakkimaru to kill Dororo. Hyakkimaru acted as if he was about to kill Dororo but turned around and threw his sword into the dark, stabbing the physical manifestation of the 48 demons, but some of them managed to escape. The slaves charged through the tunnel and attacked Kagemitsu&#x27;s soldiers. Kagemitsu, weak because of the slain demons, escaped with his wife Nui.

After he regained his eyes, Hyakkimaru figured out that Dororo is female, though Dororo rejects the notion and refers to himself as a boy despite Hyakkimaru&#x27;s insistence to act more feminine. This is in part due to Dororo being raised as a boy by his parents in order to be tough. Hyakkimaru also wanted Dororo to fight with the farmers against those in power because Dororo&#x27;s father was a farmer. Hyakkimaru gave his sword to Dororo, the one that he had desired throughout the series. Hyakkimaru planned to continue his journey alone, agreeing to meet Dororo again when his body was whole. They parted with Dororo crying at the doors. It was not until 20 years later that the last of the 48 demons was slain.

:Hyakkimaru is a teenage &quot;rōnin&quot; during the Sengoku period and the eldest son of Lord Kagemitsu Daigo and Lady Nui no Kata. Due to a pact forged by his father with 48 demons, the unnamed baby was born malformed, limbless and without facial features or internal organs. The infant was set adrift in the river and was subsequently found and raised by Dr. Jukai who gave the mute child prostheses including special blades grafted into his hard-clay arms forged out of vengeance to kill supernatural entities and regain his true human body. The boy became nearly invincible as a result of the prostheses and nearly heightened senses as he regains each part of his body. During his travels, he earned the name &quot;Hyakkimaru&quot; among other names for his inhuman nature, such as &quot;Dororo&quot; whom he had given to the orphan boy he befriends and journeys with to fulfill his quest in rightfully becoming whole.

:Dororo is an orphaned thief who joins Hyakkimaru in his travels and adventures. For the better part of the series the viewer is led to believe Dororo is a boy. In the original manga and 1969 anime adaptation, Hyakkimaru learns that Dororo is a girl; with the latter freaking-out if Hyakkimaru knows. In the 2019 anime it is revealed early on, though Hyakkimaru makes no note of it. Raised by his parents as a boy, Dororo adopted the masculine speech pattern (rude and abrasive) and ambling stances of the bandits around him. In the original manga and 1969 anime Dororo&#x27;s father, Hibukuro, was wounded by a samurai official (Itachi in the 2019 anime) and later died. Dororo’s mother, Ojiya, froze to death (starvation in the 2019 anime) while fleeing in the snow, but before she died she tattooed a map on Dororo&#x27;s back to locate money hidden by Hibukuro at Bone Cape. This tattoo only appears when his back is warmed, which he learns of while in a bath. In the epilogue of the 2019 anime, an adult Dororo reunites with a fully human Hyakkimaru.

:Hyakkimaru&#x27;s father and Samurai in the Muromachi period, Lord of Ishikawa and vassal to the governor of Kaga Province. Out of a lust for power, he forged a pact with 48 demons where each could obtain a piece of his newborn child&#x27;s body. The 2019 anime tweaks his motives, where he made a pact with the 12 demons for the prosperity of his land out of desperation as it suffered from famines, epidemics, droughts and disasters, even if he retains his ambitious and cold characteristics.

: Younger brother of Hyakkimaru and the second son of Kagemitsu Daigo. Born after Hyakkimaru was abandoned. He dies in the same chapter he is introduced in the manga, but the 2019 anime expands his role and presents him as a young man who cares about his father&#x27;s land. At first, he hates the sins committed to his older brother, but quickly finds out that the prosperity is reliant upon Hyakkimaru&#x27;s suffering. In their first duel, Hyakkimaru escapes by slicing Tahomaru&#x27;s right eye in a riposte; it is doubtful Hyakkimaru did this on purpose, as he was greatly outnumbered and trying to find cover. After this battle, Tahomaru grows increasingly unstable and trains relentlessly to accommodate his missing eye and changed depth perception.

:Hyakkimaru&#x27;s first love, a beautiful young woman who took care of orphaned children by begging food from soldiers. In the manga and 1969 anime she died before the action starts and therefore is seen only in flashbacks, but in the 2019 anime she shows up in the present and meets Hyakkimaru shortly after he regains his hearing. She sings a lot and her voice is the only thing he can tolerate until he gets used to all the new noises. She gains food and money by prostituting herself to the two armies. Dororo finds this out by following her one night. She dies protecting the other children from a raid ordered by Kagemitsu. Kagemitsu&#x27;s scouts find her going in and out of the rival camp and assume she is a spy. Hyakkimaru is unable to defend them because he was a returning from killing a demon.

:A bandit and 2nd-in-command, who betrayed Dororo&#x27;s father Hibukuro and sided with the authorities. He later kidnapped Dororo to get the map to find the money hidden by Hibukuro. He was about a day behind Ojiya and Dororo, when she the first died in a red lily field. He found her shallow grave and dug it up, to get to her back tattoo. He was eventually betrayed himself, used as bait by his lord, and accepts what Hibukuro always said: The nobles do not care about them. He and a few other samurai survive and return to a life of brigands, looking for Dororo and the treasure.
:A puppy wearing a hat that travels with Hyakkimaru. Original to the 1969 anime. Makes a cameo appearance in the first episode of the 2019 anime.

<text>, Tricholoma matsutake, is a species of choice edible mycorrhizal mushroom that grows in Eurasia and North America. It is prized in Japanese cuisine for its distinct spicy-aromatic odor.

==Etymology==
The common name and specific epithet, &quot;matsutake&quot;, in use since the late 19th century, derives from Japanese &quot;matsu&quot; (pine tree) and &quot;take&quot; (mushroom).

== Similar species ==
In Japan, several closely related species have been found, including &quot;Tricholoma bakamatsutake&quot; (&quot;baka-matsutake&quot; – &#x27;stupid matsutake&#x27; in Japanese), &quot;Tricholoma fulvocastaneum&quot; (&quot;nise-matsutake&quot; – &#x27;fake matsutake&#x27;), and &quot;Tricholoma robustum&quot; (&quot;matsutake-modoki&quot; – &#x27;imitation of matsutake&#x27;). Of those species, only baka-matsutake has a taste similar to that of matsutake. Both baka-matsutake and nise-matsutake grow in Fagaceae forests, while matsutake-modoki grows in the same pine forests as the genuine matsutake.

In the North American Pacific Northwest, &quot;Tricholoma murrillianum&quot; is found in coniferous forests of one or more of the following tree species: western hemlock, Douglas fir, Noble fir, Shasta red fir, Sugar pine, Ponderosa pine, or Lodgepole pine. In California and parts of Oregon, it is also associated with hardwoods, including Tanoak, Madrone, Rhododendron, Salal, and Manzanita. In northeastern North America, the closely related mushroom &quot;Tricholoma magnivelare&quot; is generally found in Jack pine forests. A 2000 report categorized &quot;T. nauseosum&quot; as a synonym of &quot;T. matsutake&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Matsutake mushrooms grow in East Asia, South Asia (Bhutan), and Southeast Asia (Laos), parts of Europe such as Estonia, Finland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and along the Pacific coasts of Canada and the United States.

Matsutake mushrooms grow under trees and are usually concealed under litter on the forest floor, forming a symbiotic relationship with roots of various tree species. In Korea and Japan, matsutake mushrooms are most commonly associated with &quot;Pinus densiflora&quot;. In China, matsutake () is mainly distributed in the northeast and southwest regions. In the northeast, the growth of matsutake depends on the &quot;P. densiflora&quot;, its distribution is the same as that of &quot;P. densiflora&quot;. Longjing City, Jilin Province, China is known as the &quot;Hometown of Matsutake&quot;. &quot;天佛指山/Tianfozhi Mountain&quot; in Longjing has been approved as a national nature reserve by the State Council of China. This is the first nature reserve for an edible mushroom and its ecosystem in China.

== Ecology ==
The candy cane plant or sugarstick, &quot;Allotropa virgata&quot;, parasitizes these mushrooms by deriving nourishment from the fungal mycelia via its root system. These plants can be used to signal hunters of the mushrooms, both human and animal, to the location of the fungus’ underground mycelia. Additionally, insects are also known to target these mushrooms as food and a place to lay their eggs, limiting the amount of the mushrooms that can be harvested by human gatherers.

Matsutake are hard to find because of their specific growth requirements, the rarity of appropriate forest and terrain, and competition from wild animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and deer for the once-yearly harvest of mushrooms. Domestic production of matsutake in Japan has also been sharply reduced over the latter half of the 20th century due to the pine-killing nematode &quot;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.&quot;

== Uses ==

The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan is now less than 1,000 tons, with the Japanese mushroom supply largely made up by imports from China, Korea, the Pacific Northwest, British Columbia, and northern Europe. This results in prices in the Japanese market highly dependent on quality, availability, and origin that can range from as high as for domestically harvested matsutake at the beginning of the season to as low as , though the average value for imported matsutake is about .

In the 1940s, the abundance of the mushrooms in Japan made them accessible to the general public after long being considered a luxury good, but after the decline of these mushrooms in the region, international trade for them created a fluctuating market that sometimes became very lucrative for the regions of the world that these mushrooms grow in, such as Yunnan Province of Southwest China. Very few countries other than Korea had a preexisting economy for matsutake, and Japanese speculators scoped out regions to market the fungi. Certain regions garner a higher price as well, with regions such as North America seeing a higher price by weight than regions such as those in Southwest China. 

The price gathered for matsutake in Japan can vary based on the state of the mushroom. Frozen or dried matsutake are less sought after than fresh ones in luxury markets, meaning that the international trade must be done at a quick pace to keep the mushrooms from decaying.

<text>The economic history of Japan refers to the economic progression in what is now known as modern-day Japan across its different periods. Japan&#x27;s initial economy was primarily agricultural, in order to produce the food required to sustain the population. Trade existed in this period, and artifacts of culture from mainland Asia were introduced to the Japanese, such as pottery.

The rise of political centralization and a subsequent authoritarian body, through the establishment of the Imperial House in 660 BC saw the appointment of the first Emperor of Japan, and the Imperial House would help manage foreign trade, which at the time, still primarily consisted of trade towards East Asian countries like China. However, the overthrowing of the existing Soga Clan by the Fujiwara Clan in 645 was a period of reform for the Japanese. Confucianist ideas were brought into Japan, where importantly, land and people were now under the direct control of the government. During this period, the first currency was developed in Japan, following similar ideas from the Chinese Tang Dynasty. The remainder of the classical period of Japan would be characterised by a steady increase of economic activity, spurred by improved efficiency in both trade and taxation.

The era of Feudal Japan saw prosperity across the island, with improvements in farming techniques allowing for a significant increase in the country&#x27;s population, allowing for greater productivity. It was also in this period, that Japan reshaped from a bartering-based to a currency-based economy. Japan first contacted Europeans in the 16th century. European trade would proceed soon after the first contact, with Japan&#x27;s main trading partners at the time being Portugal.

However, fearing the foreign influence of religion from the Europeans, Japan entered a period of isolationism in the mid 17th century, where formal relations between Japan and other countries were severely limited, and stricter border control stopping foreigners from entering and citizens from leaving. The fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate and ensuing abandonment of the isolationist stance catalysed development in Japanese society in the Meiji Period, where Japan began rapid industrialization and westernization. Japan&#x27;s new factories allowed them to be competitive with western countries in various industries.

Japan&#x27;s involvement in WW1 and WW2 would prove to be detrimental to their economy. The conclusion of WW1 saw a rise in the price of rice, leading to the 1918 Rice Riots. In WW2, Japan&#x27;s expansionist policies were supplemented by the rising steel industries, where the country was producing up to 9 million tons of steel. Additionally, Japan&#x27;s aircraft manufacturing industries at the time could produce up to 10,000 aircraft a year. However, military conscription would cause a labour shortage, which the Japanese solved by using captured prisoners-of-war as factory workers.

The end of WW2 in Japan would exemplify the economic destruction that the war caused to Japan. Resource shortages, damaged infrastructure and transport issues would bring the Japanese economy to a standstill. The occupation of American Soldiers in the following years symbolised reform, where the Japanese government shifted to a democracy, and the long-standing feudal system would be dismantled.

The assistance of the USA would spur rapid economic development in Japan for the remainder of the 20th century. In this period, the agricultural sector dwindled, and would be slowly replaced by the manufacturing sector, supplementing the rise of consumerism. In the 1990s, Japan faced a period of deflation, and the government would implement quantitative easing in an attempt to combat it. Japan&#x27;s economy has since seen comparatively slower growth, compared to the &#x27;miracles&#x27; post WW2.

==Prehistoric and ancient Japan==

===Jōmon period===

In Japanese history, the is the time between  14,000 and 300 BCE, during which Japan was inhabited by a diverse hunter-gatherer and early agriculturalist population united through a common Jōmon culture, which reached a considerable degree of sedentism and cultural complexity. The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of Jōmon culture was decorated by impressing cords into the surface of wet clay and is generally accepted to be among the oldest in the world. The Jōmon period was rich in tools and jewelry made from bone, stone, shell and antler; pottery figurines and vessels; and lacquerware.
Archaeologist Junko Habu claims &quot;[t]he majority of Japanese scholars believed, and still believe, that pottery production was first invented in mainland Asia and subsequently introduced into the Japanese archipelago.&quot; This seems to be confirmed by recent archaeology. As of now, the earliest pottery vessels in the world date back to and were discovered in Xianren Cave in Jiangxi, China. The pottery may have been used as cookware. Other early pottery vessels include those excavated from the Yuchanyan Cave in southern China, dated from , and at present it appears that pottery emerged at roughly the same time in Japan, and in the Amur River basin of the Russian Far East. The manufacture of pottery typically implies some form of sedentary life because pottery is heavy, bulky, and fragile and thus generally unusable for hunter-gatherers. However, this does not seem to have been the case with the first Jōmon people, who perhaps numbered over the whole archipelago.

The degree to which horticulture or small-scale agriculture was practiced by Jōmon people is debated. Currently there is no scientific consensus to support a conceptualization of Jōmon period culture as only hunter-gatherer. There is evidence to suggest that arboriculture was practiced. An apparently domesticated variety of peach appeared very early at Jōmon sites in 6700–6400 BP (4700–4400 BC). This was already similar to modern cultivated forms. This domesticated type of peach was apparently brought into Japan from China. Nevertheless, in China, itself, this variety is currently attested only at a later date of 5300–4300 BP.
The Middle Jōmon period (3520–2470 BCE) saw a rise in complexity in the design of pit-houses, the most commonly used method of housing at the time, with some even having paved stone floors. At the end of the Jōmon period the local population declined sharply. Scientists suggest that this was possibly caused by food shortages and other environmental problems. They concluded that not all Jōmon groups suffered under these circumstances but the overall population declined. Examining the remains of the people who lived throughout the Jōmon period, there is evidence that these deaths were not inflicted by warfare or violence on a large enough scale to cause these deaths.

===Yayoi period===
The Yayoi period is generally accepted to date from 300 BCE to 300 CE. However, radio-carbon evidence suggests a date up to 500 years earlier, between 1,000 and 800 BCE. During this period Japan transitioned to a settled agricultural society. As the Yayoi population increased, the society became more stratified and complex. They wove textiles, lived in permanent farming villages, and constructed buildings with wood and stone. They also accumulated wealth through land ownership and the storage of grain. Such factors promoted the development of distinct social classes. Yayoi chiefs, in some parts of Kyūshū, appear to have sponsored, and politically manipulated, trade in bronze and other prestige objects. That was made possible by the introduction of an irrigated, wet-rice agriculture from the Yangtze estuary in southern China via the Ryukyu Islands or Korean Peninsula.

===Kofun period (250–538)===
The Kofun period recorded Japan&#x27;s earliest political centralization, when the Yamato clan rose to power in southwestern Japan, established the Imperial House, and helped control trade routes across the region. Much of the material culture of the Kofun period demonstrates that Japan was in close political and economic contact with continental Asia (especially with the southern dynasties of China) via the Korean Peninsula; bronze mirrors cast from the same mould have been found on both sides of the Tsushima Strait. Irrigation, sericulture, and weaving were brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants, who are mentioned in ancient Japanese histories; the Chinese Hata clan introduced sericulture and certain types of weaving.

==Classical Japan==
===Asuka period (538–710)===
The Yamato polity evolved greatly during the Asuka period, which was concentrated in the Asuka region and exercised power over clans in Kyūshū and Honshū, bestowing titles, some hereditary, on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with all of Japan as the Yamato rulers suppressed other clans and acquired agricultural lands. Based on Chinese models (including the adoption of the Chinese written language), they developed a system of trade roads and a central administration. By the mid-seventh century, the agricultural lands had grown to a substantial public domain, subject to central policy. The basic administrative unit of the system was the county, and society was organized into occupation groups. Most people were farmers; others were fishers, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.

In 645, the Soga clan were overthrown in a coup launched by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari, the founder of the Fujiwara clan. Their government devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. What were once called became , as the court now sought to assert its control over all of Japan and to make the people direct subjects of the throne. Land was no longer hereditary but reverted to the state at the death of the owner. Taxes were levied on harvests and on silk, cotton, cloth, thread, and other products. A corvée (labor) tax was established for military conscription and building public works.

 is the oldest official Japanese coinage, having been minted starting on 29 August 708 on order of Empress Genmei. Inspired by the Chinese Tang dynasty coinage &quot;Kaiyuan Tongbao&quot;, the &quot;Wadōkaichin&quot; began being produced following the discovery of large copper deposits in Japan during the early 8th century.

===Nara period (710–794)===

Before the Taihō Code was established, the capital was customarily moved after the death of an emperor because of the ancient belief that a place of death was polluted. Reforms and bureaucratization of government led to the establishment of a permanent imperial capital at Heijō-kyō, or Nara, in AD 710. The capital was moved shortly (for reasons described later in this section) to Kuni-kyō (present-day Kizugawa) in 740–744, to Naniwa-kyō (present-day Osaka) in 744–745, to Shigarakinomiya (紫香楽宮, present-day Shigaraki) in 745, and moved back to Nara in 745. Nara was Japan&#x27;s first truly urban center. It soon had a population of 200,000 (representing nearly 7% of the country&#x27;s population) and some 10,000 people worked in government jobs.

Economic and administrative activity increased during the Nara period. Roads linked Nara to provincial capitals, and taxes were collected more efficiently and routinely. Coins were minted, if not widely used. Outside the Nara area, however, there was little commercial activity, and in the provinces the old Shōtoku land reform systems declined. By the mid-eighth century, shōen (landed estates), one of the most important economic institutions in prehistoric Japan, began to rise as a result of the search for a more manageable form of landholding. Local administration gradually became more self-sufficient, while the breakdown of the old land distribution system and the rise of taxes led to the loss or abandonment of land by many people who became the &quot;wave people&quot; (furōsha). Some of these formerly &quot;public people&quot; were privately employed by large landholders, and &quot;public lands&quot; increasingly reverted to the shōen.

Factional fighting at the imperial court continued throughout the Nara period. Imperial family members, leading court families, such as the Fujiwara, and Buddhist priests all contended for influence. Earlier during this period, Prince Nagaya seized power at the court after the death of Fujiwara no Fuhito. Fuhito was succeeded by four sons, Muchimaro, Umakai, Fusasaki, and Maro. They put Emperor Shōmu, the prince by Fuhito&#x27;s daughter, on the throne. In 729, they arrested Nagaya and regained control. However, as a major outbreak of smallpox spread from Kyūshū in 735, all four brothers died two years later, resulting in temporary reduction in the Fujiwara dominance. In 740, a member of the Fujiwara clan, Hirotsugu, launched a rebellion from his base in Fukuoka, Kyushu. Although defeated, it is without doubt that the Emperor was heavily shocked about these events, and he moved the palace three times in only five years from 740, until he eventually returned to Nara. In the late Nara period, financial burdens on the state increased, and the court began dismissing nonessential officials. In 792 universal conscription was abandoned, and district heads were allowed to establish private militia forces for local police work. Decentralization of authority became the rule despite the reforms of the Nara period. Eventually, to return control to imperial hands, the capital was moved in 784 to Nagaoka-kyō and in 794 to Heian-kyō (literally Capital of Peace and Tranquility), about twenty-six kilometers north of Nara. By the late eleventh century, the city was popularly called Kyoto (capital city), the name it has had ever since.

===Heian period (794–1185)===
While on one hand, the Heian period was an unusually long period of prosperity, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and was a fundamental base for their power. The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the &quot;Ryōmin&quot; (良民 &quot;Good People&quot;) numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realized system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange.

Throughout the Heian period, the power of the imperial court declined. The court became so self-absorbed with power struggles, and with the artistic pursuits of court nobles, that it neglected the administration of government outside the capital. The nationalization of land undertaken as part of the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; state decayed as various noble families and religious orders succeeded in securing tax-exempt status for their private &quot;shōen&quot; manors By the eleventh century, more land in Japan was controlled by &quot;shōen&quot; owners than by the central government. The imperial court was thus deprived of the tax revenue to pay for its national army. In response, the owners of the &quot;shōen&quot; set up their own armies of samurai warriors. Two powerful noble families that had descended from branches of the imperial family, the Taira and Minamoto clans, acquired large armies and many &quot;shōen&quot; outside the capital. The central government began to use these two warrior clans to suppress rebellions and piracy. Japan&#x27;s population stabilized during the late-Heian period after hundreds of years of decline.

==Feudal Japan==
===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
The samurai armies of the whole nation were mobilized in 1274 and 1281 to confront two full-scale invasions launched by Kublai Khan of the Mongol Empire. Though outnumbered by an enemy equipped with superior weaponry, the Japanese fought the Mongols to a standstill in Kyushu on both occasions until the Mongol fleet was destroyed by typhoons called &quot;kamikaze&quot;, meaning &quot;divine wind&quot;. In spite of the Kamakura shogunate&#x27;s victory, the defense so depleted its finances that it was unable to provide compensation to its vassals for their role in the victory. This had permanent negative consequences for the shogunate&#x27;s relations with the samurai class. Japan nevertheless entered a period of prosperity and population growth starting around 1250. In rural areas, the greater use of iron tools and fertilizer, improved irrigation techniques, and double-cropping increased productivity and rural villages grew. Fewer famines and epidemics allowed cities to grow and commerce to boom.

===Muromachi period (1333–1568)===


In spite of the war Japan&#x27;s relative economic prosperity, which had begun in the Kamakura period, continued well into the Muromachi period. By 1450 Japan&#x27;s population stood at ten million, compared to six million at the end of the thirteenth century. Commerce flourished, including considerable trade with China and Korea. Because the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and other groups within Japan were minting their own coins, Japan began to transition from a barter-based to a currency-based economy. During the period, some of Japan&#x27;s most representative art forms developed, including ink wash painting, &quot;ikebana&quot; flower arrangement, the tea ceremony, Japanese gardening, &quot;bonsai&quot;, and &quot;Noh&quot; theater. Though the eighth Ashikaga shogun, Yoshimasa, was an ineffectual political and military leader, he played a critical role in promoting these cultural developments.

The Japanese contact with the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) began when China was renewed during the Muromachi period after the Chinese sought support in suppressing Japanese pirates in coastal areas of China. Japanese pirates of this era and region were referred to as &quot;wokou&quot; by the Chinese (Japanese &quot;wakō&quot;). Wanting to improve relations with China and to rid Japan of the wokou threat, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu accepted a relationship with the Chinese that was to last for half a century. In 1401 he restarted the tribute system, describing himself in a letter to the Chinese Emperor as &quot;Your subject, the King of Japan&quot;. Japanese wood, sulfur, copper ore, swords, and folding fans were traded for Chinese silk, porcelain, books, and coins, in what the Chinese considered tribute but the Japanese saw as profitable trade.

==Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603)==
Renaissance Europeans were quite admiring of Japan when they reached the country in the 16th century. Japan was considered a country immensely rich in precious metals, a view that owed its conception mainly to Marco Polo&#x27;s accounts of gilded temples and palaces, but also due to the relative abundance of surface ores characteristic of a volcanic country, before large-scale deep-mining became possible in Industrial times. Japan was to become a major exporter of copper and silver during the period.
Japan was also perceived as a sophisticated feudal society with a high culture and advanced pre-industrial technology. It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese &quot;excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well&quot; (Alessandro Valignano, 1584, &quot;Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).

Early European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill.

===Trade with Europe===
The cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about four small ships every year) that arrived in Japan consisted almost entirely of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the Emperor of China, as a punishment for Wakō pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called &quot;Nanban&quot;, lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.
From the time of the acquisition of Macau in 1557, and their formal recognition as trade partners by the Chinese, the Portuguese started to regulate trade to Japan, by selling to the highest bidder the annual &quot;Captaincy&quot; to Japan, in effect conferring exclusive trading rights for a single carrack bound for Japan every year. The carracks were very large ships, usually between 1000 and 1500 tons, about double or triple the size of a large galleon or junk.

That trade continued with few interruptions until 1638, when it was prohibited on the ground that the ships were smuggling priests into Japan.

Portuguese trade was progressively more and more challenged by Chinese smugglers on junks, Japanese Red Seal Ships from around 1592 (about ten ships per year), Spanish ships from Manila from around 1600 (about one ship per year), the Dutch from 1609, and the English from 1613 (about one ship per year).

The Dutch, who, rather than &quot;Nanban&quot; were called &quot;Kōmō&quot; (Jp:紅毛, lit. &quot;Red Hair&quot;) by the Japanese, first arrived in Japan in 1600, on board the &quot;Liefde&quot;. Their pilot was William Adams, the first Englishman to reach Japan. In 1605, two of the &quot;Liefde&quot;&#x27;s crew were sent to Pattani by Tokugawa Ieyasu, to invite Dutch trade to Japan. The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, refused on the ground that he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia. In 1609 however, the Dutch Jacques Specx arrived with two ships in Hirado, and through Adams obtained trading privileges from Ieyasu.

The Dutch also engaged in piracy and naval combat to weaken Portuguese and Spanish shipping in the Pacific, and ultimately became the only westerners to be allowed access to Japan from the small enclave of Dejima after 1638 and for the next two centuries.

==Edo period (1603–1898)==


Economic development during the Edo period included urbanization, increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and handicraft industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, &quot;han&quot; authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts. By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other castle towns grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods. Rice was the base of the economy, as the daimyō collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the &quot;fudasashi&quot; market in Edo. To raise money, the daimyō used forward contracts to sell rice that was not yet harvested. These contracts were similar to modern futures trading.

The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period, during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. At the beginning of the Edo period, Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;, a 500-ton galleon-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga to the Americas, and then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the &quot;bakufu&quot; commissioned around 350 Red Seal Ships, three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, were active throughout Asia.

To eradicate the influence of Christianization, Japan entered in a period of isolation called sakoku, during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress. But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of Japanese export porcelain increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, in Jingdezhen, out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century most Japanese porcelain production was in Kyushu for export through the Chinese and Dutch. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.

During the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called &quot;rangaku&quot;, literally &quot;Dutch studies&quot;) through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in Dejima. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or wadokei, inspired from Western techniques.

Among the economic impacts of the 1850s unequal treaties imposed on Japan by the United States and Europe was that Japan could not unilaterally set tariff rates on imported goods. As a result, it was hampered in developing domestic industries that could compete with imported goods.

==Meiji era (1868–1912) ==

After the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate and subsequent founding of the Meiji government in 1868, Japan underwent significant Westernization.

It involved rapid industrialization, the development of a capitalist economy, and the transformation of many feudal workers to wage labour. The use of strike action also increased, and 1897, with the establishment of a union for metalworkers, the foundations of the modern Japanese trade-union movement were formed.

Japan developed modern industry through direct state intervention. From the late 1860s to the early 1890s, Japan established state-owned factories to serve as models for industrial development. These factories made significant use of foreign technology and foreign experts. Government-owned enterprises were important to the development of key economic sectors like railways. 

Through government connections, major private enterprises received various forms of financial support from the state. After the late 1880s, most economic development came from private enterprise, particularly the &quot;zaibatsu&quot;.

Industrialization first appeared in the textile industries, especially cotton and silk production, which were based in home workshops in rural areas. By the 1890s, Japanese textiles dominated the home markets and competed successfully with British products in China and India, as well. Japanese shippers were also competing with European traders to carry these goods across Asia and even to Europe. As in the West, the textile mills employed mainly women, half of them under age twenty. They were sent there by their fathers, and they turned over their wages to their fathers. Japan largely skipped water power and moved straight to steam powered mills, which were more productive and created a demand for coal.

1907 saw the greatest number of labor disputes in a decade, with large-scale riots at Japan&#x27;s two leading copper mines, Ashio and Besshi, which were only suppressed by the use of troops. None of these early unions were large (the metalworkers union had 3,000 members, only 5% of workers employed in the industry), or lasted longer than three or four years, largely due to strong opposition from employers and the government&#x27;s anti-union policies, notably the Public Order and Police Provisions Law (1900).

Despite this, Japanese citizens were given more opportunities for social mobility. Samurai and their descendants were allowed to work in any occupation. Admissions to universities were done on the basis of examination results. Nonetheless, samurai and their descendants were still overrepresented in the new elite class. The government also recruited more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).

Japan colonized Korea, officially annexing it on 22 August 1910 as the Province of Choson. Japan encouraged an inflow of Japanese capital to Korea&#x27;s less developed economy. A large majority of major firms in Korea became Japanese owned and operated as a result, with key positions reserved for Japanese. Most of Korea&#x27;s coal, iron, and crop production was shipped to Japan.

===Banking===
Before 1868 the feudal fiefs all issued their own money, &quot;called hansatsu&quot;, in an array of incompatible denominations. The government sent observers to the United States, and at first copied the decentralized American system with no central bank. The &quot;New Currency Act&quot; of Meiji 4 (1871) did away with local currencies and established the yen as the new decimal currency. It had parity with the Mexican silver dollar. 

The former han (fiefs) became prefectures and their mints became private chartered banks. Initially they retained the right to print money. For a time both the central government and these so-called &quot;national&quot; banks issued money. That period ended when central bank—the Bank of Japan—was founded in 1882, after the Belgian model. It has since been partly privately owned (its stock is traded over the counter, hence the stock number). The national Bank was given a monopoly on controlling the money supply in 1884, and by 1904 the previously issued notes were all retired. 

The Bank was formally on a bimetallic standard but due to a lack of gold, it was practically on the silver standard. It adopted the gold standard in 1897. The gold standard was suspended in 1917 and dropped in 1931. In 1973 flexible exchange rates were adopted.

===Railways===

After 1868 the new Meiji regime strongly encouraged railroad construction. This modernizing move had multiple objectives. It would weaken feudalistic institutions. Railroads would enable rapid military responses to invasion threats, by Russia in particular. The movement and therefore price of rice would become cheaper and foreign trade would grow. In a broader sense, modernized transportation would inspire the people and facilitate growth. The government made the final decision to build the system in 1870, using a million-pound sterling loan from Britain and British engineers. The Japanese Public Works Ministry handled the actual construction.

In 1868 Thomas Blake Glover, a Scottish merchant, was responsible for bringing the first steam locomotive, &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, to Japan, which he demonstrated on an 8-mile track in the Ōura district of Nagasaki. However, after centuries of a culture of &#x27;distrust of foreigners&#x27;, construction of the premier railway built by non-Japanese was considered politically unacceptable to the new Japanese regime. Therefore, the government of Japan decided to build a railway from the major port of Yokohama to Tokyo using British financing and 300 British and European technical advisors: civil engineers, general managers, locomotive builders and drivers. To undertake its construction, foreign experts were contracted, with the specific intent that such experts would educate Japanese co-workers so that Japan could become self-sufficient in railway construction expertise, at which time the foreign contractors were expected to leave the country. In late 1872, the first railway, between Shimbashi (later Shiodome) and Yokohama (present Sakuragichō) opened. A one-way trip took 53 minutes in comparison to 40 minutes for a modern electric train. Service started with nine round trips daily.

British engineer Edmund Morel (1841–1871) supervised construction of the first railway on Honshu. American engineer Joseph U. Crowford (1842–1942) supervised construction of a coal mine railway on Hokkaidō in 1880, and German engineer Herrmann Rumschottel (1844–1918) supervised railway construction on Kyushu beginning in 1887. All three trained Japanese engineers to undertake railway projects. Two men trained by Crowford later became presidents of Japan National Railways.

The precise reason why a track gauge of (also known as &quot;Cape gauge&quot;) came to be selected remains uncertain. It could be because was supposed to be cheaper to build than the internationally more widely used &quot;Stephenson gauge&quot; of , or because the first British agent, whose contract was later cancelled, ordered iron sleepers made for the narrower gauge. It seems most likely, however, that Morel&#x27;s previous experience building Cape gauge railways in similar New Zealand terrain was a significant influence, and Cape gauge became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

====Network expansion====

The next line constructed was from another port, Kobe, to the major commercial city of Osaka (opening in 1874), and then to Kyoto (1877) and Otsu (1880) at the southern end of Lake Biwa. A line was constructed from Tsuruga, on the Sea of Japan, to Ogaki (connecting to a canal to Nagoya) via Nagahama on the northern end of Lake Biwa, opening in 1884 and using trans-shipment onto water-going vessels to connect the Sea of Japan to Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya.

Linking Tokyo to Nagoya and Kyoto became the next priority. Initially the proposed route was inland, from Tokyo north to Takasaki, then west through the Usui Pass to Karuizawa and the Kiso River valley. At this time the Nippon Railway Co. (NRC) became the first to be granted a concession to operate what became the Tohoku Main Line from Ueno to Aomori, with a branch line from Omiya to Takasaki. Construction of both lines was undertaken by the Government at the company&#x27;s expense, with the government having running rights on the Takasaki-Ueno section. The line to Takasaki opened in 1884, as did the Tohoku line as far as Utsunomiya.

The NRC also financed a new line linking to the Yokohama line which was built from Akabane via Shinjuku to Shinagawa (with the NRC gaining track usage rights at the government station at Shinagawa). This was the first section of what has become the Yamanote Line, and opened in 1885.

The government funded line from Takasaki reached Yokokawa at the base of the Usui Pass in 1885, and initial surveys indicated a ruling grade of 10% (later improved to 6.67%) and extensive tunneling was required to reach Karuizawa.

Construction also started on another line from the Sea of Japan, commencing at Naoetsu and opening to Karuizawa via Nagano in 1888.

As the costs of construction through the mountainous interior of Japan became apparent, in 1886 the construction of what became the Tokaido line was approved, approximately paralleling the southern coastline (and Tokaido road) as far as Nagoya. Although ~238 km longer, it was projected to cost 13% less, this saving then being allocated to construct a line from Otsu along the eastern side of Lake Biwa to Nagahama to remove the need for trans-shipment, which opened in 1889, as did the final section of the Tokaido Line via Gotemba. Until the opening of the Tokaido Shinkansen in 1964, this was the most important main line in Japan.

====Consolidating the network====

In 1888 the San&#x27;yō Railway Co. (SRC) was granted a charter to build the San&#x27;yō Main Line from Kobe west to Shimonoseki, a port providing a connection to the port of Moji on Kyushu, from which the Kyushu Railway Co (KRC) built its line to Hakata and Kumamoto opening between 1889 and 1891, extended to Yatsushiro in 1896. The SRC line reached Hiroshima in 1894, and Shimonoseki in 1901. Other private endeavors included the Mito Railway, which opened the first section of the Joban Line in 1889 and was acquired by the NRC in 1892 which extended to Sendai via an east coastal route in 1905 and the Bantan Railway, which built a 52 km line north from Himeji between 1894 and 1901, and was acquired by the SRC in 1903.

The success of the Nippon Railway Co and other private companies led to a Japanese situation akin to the UK Railway Mania. From the mid-1880s until 1891 new railway companies had little difficulty in attracting funding, usually through issuing shares. However, in 1891 the failure of a company proposing to build a line from Gotenba to Matsumoto ended the &#x27;mania&#x27;, and the Government realized a more planned approach to the network expansion it desired was required.

====Evolving policy====

In 1887 the Japanese Army proposed building its own lines to ensure routes of military significance were given priority. The Railway Department deflected that proposal by commencing development of a policy for a comprehensive national network. The Japanese Government became increasingly interested in the policy formulation following the completion of the Tokaido Main Line in 1889, the creation of the National Diet in 1890 and the financial panic of 1891. The 1892 Railway Construction Act (RCA) listed a series of priority routes on Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku (Hokkaido was covered separately in 1896 legislation), with the specific policy that private construction of such routes would be encouraged, with the Japanese Government only funding routes not able to be privately constructed. By that year the privately owned network was ~2,124 km compared to the government owned sections totaling ~887 km. While this figure seemed to indicate the potential for further private funding of railway construction (notwithstanding the routes already targeted by private companies), subsequent events demonstrated otherwise.

A two-phase approach was adopted in the RCA, with 40 routes totaling ~3,000 km included in the &quot;phase one&quot; 12-year program, with phase 2 covering another ~4,000 km of proposed lines, the priorities being set on the basis of economic development and/or military strategic importance.

A specific outcome of the RCA was that every prefecture would be served by railway communication. The major routes proposed under the act for government construction included;
* The Chuo line, an inland connection from Tokyo to Nagoya favored by the military (detailed below);
* The Ou line, also detailed below;
* Extension of the line from Tsuruga to Kanazawa and Toyama (Hokuriku Main Line) opened 1896–1899;
* A connection from the Chuo line at Shiojiri to Matsuyama and Nagano (Shinonoi Line) opened 1900–1902; and
* The original inland line from Kagoshima to Yatsushiro (now the Nippo Main Line and Hisatsu Line) opened 1901–1909

The Chuo line, the route of which approximated the initial proposed inland line between Tokyo and Nagoya, was favored by the military as its inland alignment protected it from perceived risk of bombardment by enemy vessels. A privately built line from Shinjuku to the silk industry centre of Hachioji had opened 1889, and this became the starting point for government construction.

The newly determined route was via Kofu (through the 4,657 m Sasago tunnel, which was the longest in Japan until the Shimizu Tunnel opened in 1931), Shiojiri and then via the Kiso River valley to Nagoya. Construction was undertaken from both ends, with sections opening sequentially from 1900 until the lines were connected in 1911.

The Ou line from Fukushima to Yamagata, Akita and Aomori, serving the poorer northern Sea of Japan coastal prefectures, was seen as a priority for national development that was commercially unattractive. The government commenced construction from Aomori towards Hirosaki in 1894, and at the southern end from Fukushima in 1899, the lines connecting in 1905. Most of the major routes proposed under the act for private construction were not so funded and were ultimately constructed by the government.

The Japanese National Railways was formed by the nationalization of 17 private railways in 1907. It actively promoted uniformity and scientific management.

==Taishō era (1912–1926)==
An economic boom produced during the World War I era subsided and ended by 1921. The Japanese economy had high unemployment, shortages of raw materials, and overpopulation. The price of rice increased dramatically, resulting in the 1918 Rice Riots. Significant labor unrest in the industrial sector also resulted. 

From 1918 to 1921, a wave of major industrial disputes marked the peak of organized labour power. The prolonged economic slump brought cutbacks in employment in heavy industry.

In 1927, 25% of Japanese banks failed during a crisis in the country&#x27;s banking sector.

By 1928, the GNP of Japan at current prices peaked at ¥16,506 million. In the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were a tenth of those in the United States (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% that of the US.

==Shōwa era (1926–1989)==
In the 1930s, the Japanese economy suffered less from the Great Depression than most industrialized nations, its GDP expanding at a rapid rate of 5% per year. Manufacturing and mining came to account for more than 30% of GDP, more than twice the value for the agricultural sector. Most industrial growth, however, was geared toward expanding the nation&#x27;s military power.

Among the influences on Japanese policymakers&#x27; view of industrialization was the speed of the Soviet Union&#x27;s catch-up industrialization. Economic planning in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo was influenced by Japanese observations of the Soviet approach and reflected in Manchukuo&#x27;s Five Year Plan for Heavy Industry. The development of industry in Manchukuo further influenced Japanese economic mobilization following the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Beginning in 1937 with significant land seizures in China, and to a greater extent after 1941, when annexations and invasions across Southeast Asia and the Pacific created the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese government sought to acquire and develop critical natural resources to secure economic independence. Among the natural resources that Japan seized and developed were: coal in China, sugarcane in the Philippines, petroleum from the Dutch East Indies and Burma, and tin and bauxite from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. Japan also purchased the rice production of Thailand, Burma, and Cochinchina. According to a 2020 study, Japan used its imperial power to boost its industrialization. Although Japan intended to extract resources from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to support its war effort, strong resistance from the countries it occupied and the overall war pressures meant that Japan ultimately obtained little economic benefit.

During the early stages of Japan&#x27;s expansion, the Japanese economy expanded considerably. Steel production rose from 6,442,000 tons to 8,838,000 tons over the same time period. In 1941 Japanese aircraft industries had the capacity to manufacture 10,000 aircraft per year. Much of this economic expansion benefited the , large industrial conglomerates. The Tojo cabinet (1941 to 1944) established control associations to control industrial production deemed critical to Japan&#x27;s military capacity, including iron and steel production, coal, cement, machinery, motor vehicles, ship building, and foreign trade. Individual companies continued to be privately owned, but were responsible for meeting production targets set by government ministries. Control associations were headed by chairmen from the &quot;zaibatsu&quot;.

Japan&#x27;s manufacturing sector experienced labor shortages in the early 1940s as a result of its military conscription. Japan forced prisoners of war and foreign labors to work in factories, including more than one million Koreans whom it took to Japan for this purpose from 1941 to 1945. Beginning in 1944, the Japanese government drafted middle school boys to work in factories.

Over the course of the Pacific War, the economies of Japan and its occupied territories all suffered severely. Inflation was rampant; Japanese heavy industry, forced to devote nearly all its production to meet military needs, was unable to meet the commercial requirements of Japan (which had previously relied on trade with Western countries for their manufactured goods). Local industries were unable to produce at high enough levels to avoid severe shortfalls. Furthermore, maritime trade, upon which the Empire depended greatly, was sharply curtailed by damage to the Japanese merchant fleet over the course of the war.

By the end of the war, what remained of the Japanese Empire was wracked by shortages, inflation, and currency devaluation. Transport was nearly impossible, and industrial production in Japan&#x27;s shattered cities ground to a halt. The destruction wrought by the war eventually brought the Japanese economy to a virtual standstill.

===Post-World War II===

The war wiped out many of the gains which Japan had made since 1868. About 40% of the nation&#x27;s industrial plants and infrastructure were destroyed, and production reverted to levels of about fifteen years earlier. The people were shocked by the devastation and swung into action. New factories were equipped with the best modern machines, giving Japan an initial competitive advantage over the victor states, who now had older factories. As Japan&#x27;s second period of economic development began, millions of former soldiers joined a well-disciplined and highly educated work force to rebuild Japan. Japan&#x27;s colonies were lost as a result of World War II, but since then the Japanese extended their economic influence throughout Asia and beyond.

====Occupation and reform====

After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, allied forces, mostly American, rapidly began arriving in Japan. Almost immediately, the occupiers began an intensive program of legal changes designed to democratize Japan. In the wake of World War II, the Japanese citizenry was suffering from widespread exhaustion and despair from the war, known as , causing large-scale dejection and despondency. The term &quot;gifts from Heaven&quot; was coined by cartoonist Kato Etsuro in his first illustrations under US military occupation. These gifts referred to the bloodless democratic revolution from above ushered in by US forces that put an end to a socially debilitating war. Of the many aspects of the revolution from above, the reforms extending the right to vote to women, strengthening labor unionization, and liberalizing the economy were some of the most enduring changes that stand to this day.

One of the most significant economic reforms was the division and distribution of rural land to Japanese tenant farmers. Previously, property belonged to landlords and farmers worked on it in a feudal type system. Modern capitalist theory held that this feudal practice did not incentivize growth and the rural landlord class was dissolved. In addition to the dissolution of the landlord class, the massive business conglomerates known as that had effectively controlled the Japanese economy for almost 100 years were also broken up and faced market competition. The Law for the Elimination of Excessive Economic Concentration (passed in December 1947) provided for the dissolution of any company considered to be monopolistic, while the &quot;law on the expulsion of Zaibatsu-affiliated controls&quot; of January 1948 enforced the resignation of Zaibatsu board members who were related closely to Zaibatsu families, while a measure was taken to ban on holding the concurrent board posts of their affiliated companies. In addition, a government employees law was enacted, the first group of Japanese Supreme Court justices was appointed, local government and the police were reorganised, the Ministries of Home Affairs, Navy, and War were abolished, extensive revisions were made to criminal law, and progress was made on land reform.

Finally, the unionization of Japanese workers was encouraged by US occupying forces that forced companies to compete on technology and innovation. Trade unions had emerged in Japan in the second half of the Meiji period as the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization. Until 1945, however, the labor movement had remained weak, impeded by lack of legal rights, anti-union legislation, management-organised factory councils, and political divisions between &quot;cooperative&quot; and radical unionists. At the encouragement of occupation authorities, a Trade Union Law allowing workers to organize, strike, and bargain collectively for the first time was passed by the Diet on 22 December 1945. While the law was created while Japan was under occupation, the law itself was largely a Japanese work. It was put together by a large legal advisory commission headed by the legal scholar Suehiro Izutaro. The commission was quite large, consisting of &quot;three Welfare ministry bureaucrats and two scholars, a steering committee of 30 members (including the communist firebrand Kyuichi Tokuda), and an overall membership of more than 130 members representing universities, corporations, political parties, the bureaucracy, social workers, and labor.&quot;

US assistance totaled about US$1.9 billion during the occupation, or about 15% of the nation&#x27;s imports and 4% of GNP in that period. About 59% of this aid was in the form of food, 15% in industrial materials, and 12% in transportation equipment. US grant assistance, however, tapered off quickly with the end of the occupation in the 1952 and the cessation of the Korean War in 1953. US military procurement from Japan peaked at a level equivalent to 7% of Japan&#x27;s GNP in 1953 and fell below 1% after 1960. A variety of United States-sponsored measures during the occupation, such as land reform, contributed to the economy&#x27;s later performance by increasing competition. In particular, the post-war purge of industrial leaders allowed new talent to rise in the management of the nation&#x27;s rebuilt industries.

====&quot;Reverse Course&quot; and retrenchment====

The is the name commonly given to a major shift in the Occupation policies that began in 1947 in response to the emerging global Cold War. In particular, U.S. priorities shifted from democratizing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the shattered economy, and remilitarizing Japan to the extent possible under Article 9, in support of U.S. Cold War objectives in East Asia. This involved relaxing and in some cases even partially undoing earlier reforms the Occupation had enacted in 1945 and 1946.

Thanks to the occupation&#x27;s initial, pro-union policies, union membership had rapidly risen to 5 million by February 1947. However, in a Cold War context, Japan&#x27;s increasingly militant labor unions were increasingly seen as a threat to economic stability, and occupation authorities refused to allow a massive, nationwide general strike that labor unions had scheduled for 1 February. Thereafter, the occupation took measures to reduce the power of unions, most notably by issuing an edict stripping public-sector workers of their right to go on strike. The labor organization rate peaked at 55.8% in 1949 and subsequently declined to 18.2% by 2006.

Following the cancellation of the 1947 general strike, a broader shift in Occupation policies became more and more apparent. Thousands of conservative and nationalist wartime leaders were de-purged and allowed to reenter politics and government ministries. In the industrial sector, plans for further anti-trust actions against the remains of the old &quot;zaibatsu&quot; industrial conglomerates were scrapped, and some earlier anti-trust policies were partially undone. The incomplete suppression of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; allowed them to partially reform as &quot;informal associations&quot; known as &quot;keiretsu.&quot;

To stabilize the Japanese economy as soon as possible, American banker Joseph Dodge was brought in as an economic consultant. Dodge implemented the &quot;Dodge Line&quot; in 1949, a set of draconian contractionary fiscal and monetary policies that caused much hardship for the Japanese populace but succeeded in getting rampant inflation under control. Dodge also fixed the exchange rate at 360 yen to the dollar, a favorable rate that would help boost Japanese exports in the years to come and power the Japanese economic miracle.

====Economic Miracle====
The early post-war years were devoted to rebuilding lost industrial capacity: major investments were made in electric power, coal, steel, and chemicals. By the mid-1950s, production matched prewar levels. Released from the demands of military-dominated government, the economy not only recovered its lost momentum but also surpassed the growth rates of earlier periods. Between 1953 and 1965, GDP expanded by more than 9% per year, manufacturing and mining by 13%, construction by 11%, and infrastructure by 12%. In 1965 these sectors employed more than 41% of the labor force, whereas only 26% remained in agriculture.

Major reasons for the country&#x27;s economic growth from 1956 to 1979 included its domestic work force, international trade opportunities, and U.S. financial and technological aid.

Through the Yoshida Doctrine, the state involved itself more in economic planning, financial support, and trade promotion than did any other non-socialist state. The state also protected domestic industry from foreign competition, welcoming only foreign investment that brought in new technology.

Japan&#x27;s highly acclaimed post-war education system contributed strongly to the modernizing process. The world&#x27;s highest literacy rate and high education standards were major reasons for Japan&#x27;s success in achieving a technologically advanced economy. Japanese schools also encouraged discipline, another benefit in forming an effective work force.

The mid-1960s ushered in a new type of industrial development as the economy opened itself to international competition in some industries and developed heavy and chemical manufactures. Whereas textiles and light manufactures maintained their profitability internationally, other products, such as automobiles, electronics, ships, and machine tools assumed new importance. The value added to manufacturing and mining grew at the rate of 17% per year between 1965 and 1970. Growth rates moderated to about 8% and evened out between the industrial and service sectors between 1970 and 1973, as retail trade, finance, real estate, information technology, and other service industries streamlined their operations.

Japanese consumerism continued to grow throughout the 1960s, giving rise to a well-known saying that the &quot;three treasures&quot; which all Japanese families needed to have were a refrigerator, a washing machine, and a television set. By 1962, it was estimated that 79.4% of all urban homes and 48.9% of rural homes in Japan had access to television.

Throughout this period, Japan&#x27;s economy continued to benefit from the US-Japan Alliance in a variety of ways. Along with financial and technological aid, the US opened its domestic markets to imports from Japan. A 2018 study, using the synthetic control method whereby Japan is compared to &quot;synthetic Japan&quot; (a combination of countries which are similar to Japan but without the US alliance), found that the US alliance allowed Japan&#x27;s GDP to &quot;grow much faster&quot; from 1958 to 1968.

====Oil crisis====

Japan faced a severe economic challenge in the mid-1970s. The 1973 oil crisis shocked an economy that had become dependent on imported petroleum. Japan experienced its first post-war decline in industrial production, together with severe price inflation. The recovery that followed the first oil crisis revived the optimism of most business leaders, but the maintenance of industrial growth in the face of high energy costs required shifts in the industrial structure.

Changing price conditions favored conservation and alternative sources of industrial energy. Although the investment costs were high, many energy-intensive industries successfully reduced their dependence on oil during the late 1970s and 1980s and enhanced their productivity. Advances in microcircuitry and semiconductors in the late 1970s and 1980s led to new growth industries in consumer electronics and computers, and to higher productivity in pre-established industries. In 1978, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry provided subsidies, which was illegal under international law, to help Japanese semiconductor companies sell their chips at artificially low prices in the United States while keeping prices high in Japan, a trade practice known as dumping The net result of these adjustments was to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing and to expand knowledge-intensive industries. The service industries expanded in an increasingly postindustrial economy.

Structural economic changes, however, were unable to check the slowing of economic growth as the economy matured in the late 1970s and 1980s, attaining annual growth rates at only 4–6%. But these rates were remarkable in a world of expensive petroleum and in a nation of few natural resources. Japan&#x27;s average growth rate of 5% in the late 1980s, for example, was far higher than the 3.8% growth rate of the United States. Despite more petroleum price increases in 1979, the strength of the Japanese economy was apparent. It expanded without the double-digit inflation that afflicted other industrial nations (and that had bothered Japan itself after the first oil crisis in 1973). Japan experienced slower growth in the mid-1980s, but its demand-sustained economic boom of the late 1980s revived many troubled industries.

====Factors of growth====
Complex economic and institutional factors affected Japan&#x27;s post-war growth. First, the nation&#x27;s prewar experience provided several important legacies. The Tokugawa period (1600–1867) bequeathed a &quot;vital commercial sector&quot; in burgeoning urban centers, a relatively well-educated elite (although one with limited knowledge of European science), a sophisticated government bureaucracy, productive agriculture, a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems, and a national infrastructure of roads. The buildup of industry during the Meiji period to the point where Japan could vie for world power was an important prelude to post-war growth from 1955 to 1973, and provided a pool of experienced labor.

Second, and more important, was the level and quality of investment that persisted through the 1980s. Investment in capital equipment, which averaged more than 11% of GNP during the prewar period, rose to about 20% of GNP during the 1950s and to more than 30% in the late 1960s and 1970s. During the economic boom of the late 1980s, the rate still hovered around 20%. Japanese businesses imported the latest technologies to develop the industrial base. As a latecomer to modernization, Japan was able to avoid some of the trial and error earlier needed by other nations to develop industrial processes. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japan improved its industrial base through licensing from the US, patent purchases, and imitation and improvement of foreign inventions. In the 1980s, industry stepped up its research and development, and many firms became famous for their innovations and creativity.

Japan&#x27;s labor force contributed significantly to economic growth, because of its availability and literacy, and also because of its reasonable wage demands. Before and immediately after World War II, the transfer of numerous agricultural workers to modern industry resulted in rising productivity and only moderate wage increases. As population growth slowed and the nation became increasingly industrialized in the mid-1960s, wages rose significantly. However, labor union cooperation generally kept salary increases within the range of gains in productivity. 

High productivity growth played a key role in post-war economic growth. The highly skilled and educated labor force, extraordinary savings rates and accompanying levels of investment, and the low growth of Japan&#x27;s labor force were major factors in the high rate of productivity growth. 

The nation also benefited from economies of scale. Although medium-sized and small enterprises generated much of the nation&#x27;s employment, large facilities were the most productive. Many industrial enterprises consolidated to form larger, more efficient units. Before World War II, large holding companies formed wealth groups, or zaibatsu, which dominated most industry. The zaibatsu were dissolved after the war, but keiretsu—large, modern industrial enterprise groupings—emerged. The coordination of activities within these groupings and the integration of smaller subcontractors into the groups enhanced industrial efficiency.

Japanese corporations developed strategies that contributed to their immense growth. Growth-oriented corporations that took chances competed successfully. Product diversification became an essential ingredient of the growth patterns of many . Japanese companies added plant and human capacity ahead of demand. Seeking market share rather than quick profit was another powerful strategy.

Finally, circumstances beyond Japan&#x27;s direct control contributed to its success. International conflicts tended to stimulate the Japanese economy until the devastation at the end of World War II. The Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), World War I (1914–1918), the Korean War (1950–1953), and the Second Indochina War (1954–1975) brought economic booms to Japan. In addition, benign treatment from the United States after World War II facilitated the nation&#x27;s reconstruction and growth.

====The changing occupational structure====
As late as 1955, some 40% of the labor force still worked in agriculture, but this figure had declined to 17% by 1970 and to 7.2% by 1990 and under 5% in the 21st century as Japan imported more and more of its food and small family farms disappeared.

Japan&#x27;s economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s was based on the rapid expansion of heavy manufacturing in such areas as automobiles, steel, shipbuilding, chemicals, and electronics. The secondary sector (manufacturing, construction, and mining) expanded to 35.6% of the work force by 1970. By the late 1970s, however, the Japanese economy began to move away from heavy manufacturing toward a more service-oriented (tertiary sector) base. During the 1980s, jobs in wholesaling, retailing, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation, communications, and government grew rapidly, while secondary-sector employment remained stable. The tertiary sector grew from 47% of the work force in 1970 to 59.2% in 1990.

Partially as a result of these transformations, The labor movement went through a process of reorganization from 1987 to 1991 from which emerged the present configuration of three major trade union federations, RENGO, Zenroren, and Zenrokyo, along with other smaller national union organizations.

===1980s===

Throughout the 1970s, Japan had the world&#x27;s third largest gross national product (GNP)—just behind the United States and Soviet Union—and ranked first among major industrial nations in 1990 in per capita GNP at US$23,801, up sharply from US$9,068 in 1980. After a mild economic slump in the mid-1980s, Japan&#x27;s economy began a period of expansion in 1986 that continued until it again entered a recessionary period in 1992. Economic growth averaging 5% between 1987 and 1989 revived industries, such as steel and construction, which had been relatively dormant in the mid-1980s, and brought record salaries and employment. In 1992, however, Japan&#x27;s real GNP growth slowed to 1.7%. Even industries such as automobiles and electronics that had experienced phenomenal growth in the 1980s entered a recessionary period in 1992. The domestic market for Japanese automobiles shrank at the same time that Japan&#x27;s share of the United States&#x27; market declined. Foreign and domestic demand for Japanese electronics also declined, and Japan seemed on the way to losing its leadership in the world semiconductor market to the United States, Korea and Taiwan.

Unlike the economic booms of the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing exports played the key role in economic expansion, domestic demand propelled the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. This development involved fundamental economic restructuring, moving from dependence on exports to reliance on domestic demand. The boom that started in 1986 was generated by the decisions of companies to increase private plant and equipment spending and of consumers to go on a buying spree. Japan&#x27;s imports grew at a faster rate than exports. Japanese post-war technological research was carried out for the sake of economic growth rather than military development. The growth in high-technology industries in the 1980s resulted from heightened domestic demand for high-technology products such as electronics, and for higher living, housing, and environmental standards; better medical care and more welfare; expanded leisure-time facilities; and improved ways to accommodate a rapidly aging society.

During the 1980s, the Japanese economy shifted its emphasis from primary and secondary activities (notably agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) to processing, with telecommunications and computers becoming increasingly vital. Information became an important resource and product, central to wealth and power. The rise of an information-based economy was led by major research in highly sophisticated technology, such as advanced computers. The selling and use of information became very beneficial to the economy. Tokyo became a major financial center, home to some of the world&#x27;s major banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and the world&#x27;s largest stock exchange, the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Even here, however, the recession took its toll.

In 1985, Japan signed the Plaza Accords in which Japan agreed to depreciate the dollar against the yen. Japan&#x27;s economy entered a bubble phase as Japanese capital (which following the Plaza Accords was relatively more valuable than foreign currencies) exited Japan to purchase foreign assets. Japanese banks had significant cash which they loaned out at low interest rates. This also forced up the prices of Japanese real estate.

In 1992, the Nikkei 225 stock average began the year at 23,000 points, but fell to 14,000 points in mid-August before leveling off at 17,000 by the end of the year.

==Heisei era (1989–2019)==
===1989 economic bubble===

In the decades following World War II, Japan implemented stringent tariffs and policies to encourage the people to save their income. With more money in banks, loans and credit became easier to obtain, and with Japan running large trade surpluses, the yen appreciated against foreign currencies. This allowed local companies to invest in capital resources more easily than their overseas competitors, which reduced the price of Japanese-made goods and widened the trade surplus further. And, with the yen appreciating, financial assets became lucrative.

With so much money readily available for investment, speculation was inevitable, particularly in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the real estate market. The Nikkei stock index hit its all-time high on 29 December 1989 when it reached an intra-day high of 38,957.44 before closing at 38,915.87. The rates for housing, stocks, and bonds rose so much that at one point the government issued 100-year bonds. Additionally, banks granted increasingly risky loans.

At the height of the bubble, real estate was extremely over-valued. Prices were highest in Tokyo&#x27;s Ginza district in 1989, with choice properties fetching over US$1.5 million per square meter ($139,000 per square foot). Prices were only slightly less in other areas of Tokyo. By 2004, prime &quot;A&quot; property in Tokyo&#x27;s financial districts had slumped and Tokyo&#x27;s residential homes were a fraction of their peak, but still managed to be listed as the most expensive real estate in the world. Trillions were wiped out with the combined collapse of the Tokyo stock and real estate markets.

With Japan&#x27;s economy driven by its high rates of reinvestment, this crash hit particularly hard. Investments were increasingly directed out of the country, and Japanese manufacturing firms lost some degree of their technological edge. As Japanese products became less competitive overseas, some people argue that the low consumption rate began to bear on the economy, causing a deflationary spiral.

The easily obtainable credit that had helped create and engorge the real-estate bubble continued to be a problem for several years to come, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low guarantee of being repaid. Loan officers and investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that would return a profit. Meanwhile, the extremely low interest rate offered for deposits, such as 0.1%, meant that ordinary Japanese savers were just as inclined to put their money under their beds as they were to put it in savings accounts. Correcting the credit problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so-called &quot;zombie businesses&quot;. Eventually a carry trade developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere and then the Japanese were paid back, with a nice profit for the trader.

The time after the , which occurred gradually rather than catastrophically, is known as the in Japan. The Nikkei 225 stock index eventually bottomed out at 7603.76 in April 2003, moved upward to a new peak of 18,138 in June 2007, before resuming a downward trend. The downward movement in the Nikkei is likely due to global as well as national economic problems.

===Deflation from the 1990s===

Deflation in Japan started in the early 1990s. On 19 March 2001, the Bank of Japan and the Japanese government tried to eliminate deflation in the economy by reducing interest rates (part of their &#x27;quantitative easing&#x27; policy). Despite having interest rates near zero for a long period, this strategy did not succeed. Once the near-zero interest rates failed to stop deflation, some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians spoke of deliberately causing (or at least creating the fear of) inflation.
Systemic reasons for deflation in Japan can be said to include: 
* Fallen asset prices. There was a large price bubble in both equities and real estate in Japan in the 1980s (peaking in late 1989). 
* Insolvent companies: Banks lent to companies and individuals that invested in real estate. When real estate values dropped, many loans went unpaid. The banks could try to collect on the collateral (land), but due to reduced real estate values, this would not pay off the loan. Banks have delayed the decision to collect on the collateral, hoping asset prices would improve. These delays were allowed by national banking regulators. Some banks make even more loans to these companies that are used to service the debt they already have. This continuing process is known as maintaining an &quot;unrealized loss&quot;, and until the assets are completely revalued and/or sold off (and the loss realized), it will continue to be a deflationary force in the economy. 
* Insolvent banks: Banks with a large percentage of their loans which are &quot;non-performing&quot; (loans for which payments are not being made), but have not yet written them off. These banks cannot lend more money until they increase their cash reserves to cover the bad loans. Thus the number of loans is reduced sooner and less funds are available for economic growth. 
* Fear of insolvent banks: Japanese people are afraid that banks will collapse so they prefer to buy gold or (United States or Japanese) Treasury bonds instead of saving their money in a bank account. People also save by investing in real estate. 

By 1998, Japan&#x27;s public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy&#x27;s stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook &quot;structural reform&quot; policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used quantitative easing to expand the country&#x27;s money supply to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period. Unlike previous recovery trends, domestic consumption has been the dominant factor of growth.

Despite having interest rates down near zero for a long period of time, the quantitative easing strategy did not succeed in stopping price deflation. This led some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians, to advocate the generation of higher inflation expectations. In July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the lowest interest rates in the developed world, but deflation had still not been eliminated and the Nikkei 225 has fallen over approximately 50% (between June 2007 and December 2008). However, on 5 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced that it would be purchasing 60–70 trillion yen in bonds and securities in an attempt to eliminate deflation by doubling the money supply in Japan over the course of two years. Markets around the world have responded positively to the government&#x27;s current proactive policies, with the Nikkei 225 adding more than 42% since November 2012. In recent years, Japan has been the top export market for almost 15 trading nations worldwide.

The global economic recession of the late 2000s significantly harmed the economy of Japan. The nation suffered a 0.7% loss in real GDP in 2008 followed by a severe 5.2% loss in 2009. In contrast, the data for world real GDP growth was a 3.1% hike in 2008 followed by a 0.7% loss in 2009.

&quot;The Economist&quot; has suggested that improvements to bankruptcy law, land transfer law, and tax law will aid Japan&#x27;s economy. In October 2009 the Japanese government announced plans to increase tobacco and green taxes while reducing rates for small and medium-sized companies, according to NHK. In 2011, Japan under Yoshihiko Noda decided to consider joining the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership.

Although the Japanese economic miracle has already ended in the 1980s, the years of 2011 to 2012 saw the peak of the Japanese economy, exceeding over 6 trillion dollars in USD.

In December 2018, a free trade agreement between Japan and the European Union was cleared to commence in February 2019. It creates the world&#x27;s largest free trade zone valued at of global gross domestic product. This reduces tariffs on Japanese cars by 10%, duties by 30% on cheese and 10% on wines and opens service markets.

Economic policy over the past several quarters in Japan has been influenced by the &#x27;Abenomics&#x27; debate, with the government pursuing aggressive government infrastructure spending hikes and significant yen devaluations.

==Reiwa era (2019–present)==

Prior to the global COVID-19 recession, the 2019 4th quarter GDP shrank an annualized 7.1% from the previous quarter due to two main factors. One is the government&#x27;s raise in consumption tax from 8% to 10%. The other is the devastating effects of Typhoon Hagibis, also known as the , or . The 38th depression, 9th typhoon and 3rd super typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, it was the strongest typhoon in decades to strike mainland Japan, and one of the largest typhoons ever recorded at a peak diameter of . It was also the costliest Pacific typhoon on record, surpassing Typhoon Mireille&#x27;s record by more than US$5 billion (when not adjusted for inflation). In the resort town of Hakone, record rainfall of almost a meter (942.3 mm, 37.1 inches) fell in only 24 hours. This adds to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people&#x27;s lives and the economy, the prime minister unveiling a &quot;massive&quot; stimulus amounting to 20% of GDP. In April 2020, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, which also forced a national state of emergency, gave the nation its worst economic crisis since the end of World War II. Jun Saito of the Japan Center for Economic Research stated that the pandemic delivered the &quot;final blow&quot; to Japan&#x27;s long fledging economy, which also resumed slow growth in 2018. Two stimulus packages, in April and May 2020, injected 234 trillion yen (US$2.2 trillion), or almost 40% of Japan&#x27;s GDP.

=== 2020–21 recession ===
Since early January 2020, Japanese economy began to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic as several countries reported a significant increase in cases by March 2020. However, in early April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that he declared state of emergency, citing gave the nation its worst economic crisis since the end of World War II. Jun Saito of the Japan Center for Economic Research stated that the pandemic delivered the &quot;final blow&quot; to Japan&#x27;s long fledging economy, which also resumed slow growth in 2018.
Less than a quarter of Japanese people expect living conditions to improve in the coming decades.

In October 2020 during the pandemic, Japan and the United Kingdom formally signed the first free-trade agreement post-Brexit, which will boost trade by approximately £15.2 billion. It enables tariff-free trade on 99% of exports to Japan.

On 15 February 2021, the Nikkei average breached the 30k benchmark, the highest since November 1991. It is due to strong corporate earnings, GDP data and optimism over COVID-19 vaccination program in the country.

In the year ending of March 2021 despite COVID-19 spreading, SoftBank Group made a record net profit of 45.88 billion, which is largely due to the debut of e-commerce company Coupang. However, this is the largest annual profit by a Japanese company in the nation&#x27;s history.

As of result, Japanese economic impact of COVID-19 was officially ended by early October 2021 as the country ahead of the endemic phase.

=== Post-recession (2021–present) ===
At the end of March 2022, the Ministry of Finance announced that the national debt reached precisely 1.017 million billion yen. The total public debt of the country, which includes debts contracted by local governments, represents 1.210 million billion yen (9,200 billion dollars) which is nearly 250% of Japan&#x27;s GDP. Economist Kohei Iwahara said such an exceptional debt to GDP level is only possible because Japanese hold most of the debt: &quot;“Japanese households hold most of their savings in bank accounts (48%) and these sums are used by commercial banks to buy Japanese government bonds. Thus, 85.7% of these bonds are held by Japanese investors.” However, an aging population could decrease savings.

<doc id="495104" wikidata="Q9159523" url="?curid=495104" title="Named parameter">
<text>In computer programming, named parameters, named-parameter arguments, named arguments or keyword arguments refer to a computer language&#x27;s support for function calls to clearly associate each argument with a given parameter within the function call.

== Overview ==
A function call using named parameters differs from a regular function call in that the arguments are passed by associating each one with a parameter name, instead of providing an ordered list of arguments.

For example, consider this Java or C# method call that doesn&#x27;t use named parameters:
window.addNewControl(&quot;Title&quot;, 20, 50, 100, 50, true);
Using named parameters in Python, the call can be written as:

window.addNewControl(title=&quot;Title&quot;,
 xPosition=20,
 yPosition=50,
 width=100,
 height=50,
 drawingNow=True)

Using named parameters in PHP, the call can be written as:

$window-&gt;addNewControl(title: &quot;Title&quot;,
 xPosition: 20,
 yPosition: 50,
 width: 100,
 height: 50,
 drawingNow: True);

The version with positional arguments is more implicit. The versions that name parameters are more explicit. Depending on circumstance, a programmer may find one or the other to be easier to read.

== Use in programming languages ==
Named parameters are supported explicitly in many languages. A non-exhaustive selection of examples includes Ada, C# 4.0+, Ceylon, ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML), Common Lisp, Fortran, IDL, Kotlin, Mathematica, PL/SQL, PowerShell, Python, R, PHP, Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, Swift and Visual Basic. Objective-C does not have named parameters (even though parts of the method name may look like named parameters).
&lt;br&gt;In C++, you can achieve named parameters by using designated initializers since C++20, like so:

struct A {int a{}, int b{} }; 

void
foo(A bar)
 std::cout « bar.a « bar.b;
foo({ .a = 1, .b = 3 });
== Order of parameters ==
In languages that do not support named parameters, the &quot;order&quot; of arguments in a function call is necessarily fixed, since it is the only way that the language can identify which argument is intended to be used for which parameter.

With named parameters, it is usually possible to provide the arguments in any order, since the parameter name attached to each argument identifies its purpose. This reduces the connascence between parts of the program. A few languages support named parameters but still require the arguments to be provided in a specific order.

== Optional parameters and positional parameters==

Named parameters are often used in conjunction with optional parameters. Without named parameters, optional parameters can only appear at the end of the parameter list, since there is no other way to determine which values have been omitted. In languages that support named optional parameters, however, programs may supply any subset of the available parameters, and the names are used to determine which values have been provided.

An added complication arises in languages such as OCaml that support both optional named parameters and partial application. It is impossible in general to distinguish between a function partly applied, and a function to which a subset of parameters have been provided. OCaml resolves this ambiguity by requiring a positional argument after all optional named-parameter arguments: its presence or absence is used to decide if the function has been fully or partly applied. If all parameters are optional, the implementor may solve the issue by adding a dummy positional parameter of type unit.

== Emulating ==
In languages that do not support named parameters, some of the same benefits can be achieved in other ways.

=== With documentation ===
Their value as documentation can be replicated by tooltips in integrated development environments (IDEs) for languages such as Java, or with comments (in C):

MyFunctionCall(
 20, /* x coordinate */
 50, /* y coordinate */
 100, /* width */
 5, /* height */
 TRUE /* drawing now? */


Such comments are not checked for correctness and the order of arguments remains important.

=== With data structures ===
Removing the argument order restriction, and the ability to leave some values unspecified, can be achieved by passing a record or associative array.

For example, in JavaScript, these two calls are equivalent:

MyFunctionCall({ xPosition: 20, yPosition: 50, width: 100, height: 5,
 drawingNow: true });
MyFunctionCall({ width: 100, height: 5, xPosition: 20, yPosition: 50,
 drawingNow: true });
Compare to C99:

struct MyParam {
 int xPosition;
 int yPosition;
 int width;
 int height;
 unsigned char drawingNow;
…
MyParam parameters = { .xPosition = 20, .yPosition = 50,
 .width = 100, .height = 5, .drawingNow = TRUE };
MyFunctionCall(&amp;parameters);
==== Special Support ====

In Perl and pre-2.0 Ruby a similar convention exists (generally called a &quot;hash&quot; or &quot;options hash&quot;), with special support for omitting the delimiters within function calls. As an example, the core module&#x27;s Net::FTP &quot;new&quot; function accepts a hash of optional arguments.

=== With chained method calls ===
In object-oriented programming languages, it is possible to use method chaining to simulate named parameters, as a form of fluent interface. Each named-parameter argument is replaced with a method on an &quot;arguments&quot; object that modifies and then returns the object. In C++, this is termed the &quot;named parameter idiom&quot;. The object may then be passed to a function that uses the arguments it contains.

Method chaining is often used in conjunction with the builder pattern as a way to override default values provided by the builder class.

<doc id="495106" wikidata="Q1049521" url="?curid=495106" title="Marimo Ragawa">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. She began submitting manga to comic magazines when she was only 12 years old, in the sixth grade of elementary school. She continued to send her manga to the same magazine for four years, but failed to receive a positive critical reception. Ragawa then decided to switch to a different magazine, &quot;Hana to Yume&quot;. Her first submission to this magazine won a prize called the &quot;Top Prize&quot; (). Two years later in 1990, she succeeded in achieving her debut with her one-shot manga , published in &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; issue 22.

<text>Georges Duhamel (; ; 30 June 1884 – 13 April 1966) was a French author, born in Paris. Duhamel trained as a doctor, and during World War I was attached to the French Army. In 1920, he published &quot;Confession de minuit&quot;, the first of a series featuring the anti-hero Salavin. In 1935, he was elected as a member of the Académie française. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twenty-seven times. He was also the father of the musicologist and composer Antoine Duhamel.

==Biography==
Georges Duhamel was born in the 13th arrondissement of Paris on 30 June 1884. He was the third child of a family which struggled to survive on the income of his unstable father. The strains and tensions of these early years are reflected in his famous autobiographical novel &quot;Le Notaire du Havre&quot; (1933), the first book of his Pasquier saga.

In spite of this childhood disrupted by numerous crises, which on far too many occasions caused the Duhamel family to relocate abruptly, Georges nonetheless passed his baccalaureate in 1902. His first choice of career was to become a doctor, although he had a great love of literature and the arts and continued to pursue these interests also.

Between 1906 and 1909 he founded an artistic community &quot;l&#x27;Abbaye de Créteil&quot; with Charles Vildrac (who would become his brother in law). The group brought together poets, writers, musicians and painters. From 1912, he became an editor of the literary review &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. In 1935, he took over the direction of the review and its publishing house. In 1937, he was elected to the French Académie Nationale de Médecine and Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. In 1938, because of Duhamel&#x27;s anti-war stance, he was replaced by Jacques Bernard, but Duhamel returned to directing the Mercure de France publishers in 1945 (he was majority stock-holder of the company).

When the First World War was declared, Duhamel signed up and worked as an army surgeon for four years, often in dangerous situations. This painful experience provided the subject matter for two narratives which brought him immediate success, &quot;Vie des martyrs&quot; and &quot;Civilisation&quot; (which won him the Prix Goncourt in 1918). Once he returned to civilian life, Duhamel dedicated himself to literature and defending human civilisation. In 1919, he found two spots in the Val-d&#x27;Oise where he would henceforth spend his summers (Sausseron Valley and Valmondois).

In 1935, Duhamel was elected to the 30th chair at the Académie française. Between 1930 and 1940 he traveled to many conferences in France and abroad, speaking brilliantly of French language and culture as well as promoting the idea of a civilisation built on the human heart rather than technological progress.

Duhamel described himself as &quot;a pacifist and an internationalist.&quot; During the Second World War, Duhamel&#x27;s work was banned by the Germans. He showed courage in his opposition to the occupation and the Petainist faction of the Académie française, later receiving public praise from Général de Gaulle.

After the war, Duhamel was named president of the Alliance française and returned to public speaking on French culture. He built up numerous schools of the Alliance. Duhamel&#x27;s health deteriorated from 1960 and he reduced his activities. He died in Valmondois on 13 April 1966.

Cécile Debray is the great-granddaughter of Georges Duhamel and represents his heirs.

<doc id="495109" wikidata="Q1212531" url="?curid=495109" title="Die Form">
<text>Die Form is a French post-industrial and electronic band formed in 1977-78. The name &#x27;Die Form&#x27; means &#x27;(the) form/shape&#x27; in German, like the Bauhaus diary, and is a play on the English homonym &#x27;deform&#x27; and on the French homonym &#x27;difforme&#x27; (deformed).

== Biography ==
Die Form is the primary project of the French electronic musician and multimedia artist Philippe Fichot. He began his own record label, Bain Total, in 1977 and began recording a number of experimental cassette releases as Die Form, starting with Die Form 1 in 1977, with the first Die Form vinyl release (&#x27;Die Puppe&#x27;) appearing in 1982. Whilst the project was still in its infancy, the underlying concepts were still evident - a combination of esoteric electronic experiments with an underlying theme of erotism, death and other &#x27;taboo&#x27; subjects, apparent in both the music and the album artwork, which Philippe also produces. Other early projects of Philippe Fichot included Krylon Hertz, Mental Code, Camera Obscura, Eva-Johanna Reichstag, Hurt and Fine Automatic.

&#x27;Some Experiences With Shock&#x27; followed in 1984, with the project taking a direction towards a more commercial sound on 1986&#x27;s &#x27;Poupée Mécanique&#x27;. The project then consolidated its experimental and melodic sides on &#x27;Photogrammes&#x27;, before introducing vocalist (and model) Eliane P. on the 1991 album &#x27;Corpus Delicti&#x27;, who remains with the project to this day. The next release, 1992&#x27;s &#x27;Confessions&#x27; saw a club hit in &#x27;Silent Order&#x27;, with sister album &#x27;Ad Infinitum&#x27; (which originated from the same recording sessions) released a year later.

The next &#x27;Die Form&#x27; releases saw the poetic, emotional side of their sound richen via &#x27;The Trilogy of Passions&#x27;, starting with &#x27;Suspiria De Profundis&#x27; in 1994, followed by &#x27;L&#x27;âme électrique&#x27; the following year. 1997&#x27;s &#x27;Duality&#x27; does not complete the trilogy, Phillipe Fichot choosing to leave the project open-ended. The &#x27;Histories&#x27; compilation discs appeared in 1998, with the next album &#x27;Extremum/XX&#x27; appearing in 2000. Then followed the &#x27;diptych&#x27; of &#x27;InHuman&#x27; (2004) and &#x27;ExHuman&#x27; (2006), continuing their release of interrelated concept albums.

&quot;The Bach project&quot; was released in January 2008, an album obviously devoted to Bach. Die Form first presented this work live during the annual Bach Days in the German city of Leipzig, where they got invited. Die Form has created a new show for this project with the German dancer Sabine Seume.

Die Form left Trisol to join Out of Line in late 2008. A new single, &quot;Her[t]z Frequenz&quot;, was released in October 2008, followed by the &quot;Best of XXX&quot; in November 2008 (a compilation with reworked and remastered songs from the past 30 years).

In 2009, &quot;Noir Magnétique&quot; saw Die Form back in a club-oriented sound. The album was made available on CD only, with a special edition limited to 999 copies in a box with a 7-inch single and extra artwork. Die Form created a new show with Laina Fischbeck on stage.

In March 2010, a vinyl boxset compilation of early K-Cassette material was released on Vinyl-On-Demand.

In 2011, a double-CD digipak limited edition of Sombre Printemps (&quot;Ambient &amp; Film Music 1+2&quot;) has been released on Out Of Line.

<text>Robert Gerhard i Ottenwaelder (; 25 September 1896 – 5 January 1970) was a Spanish and British composer, musical scholar, and writer, generally known outside his native region of Catalonia as Roberto Gerhard.

== Life ==
Gerhard was born in Valls, near Tarragona, Spain. His father was of German and Swiss ancestry; his mother was from Alsace-Lorraine. He studied piano with Enrique Granados and composition with scholar-composer Felip Pedrell, teacher of Isaac Albéniz, Granados and Manuel de Falla. Gerhard visited Falla in Granada, but dismissed him as a possible teacher and decided to shut himself away in a Catalan farmhouse to reflect on his professional future and concentrate on his work. Seeking systematicity, he turned his gaze to German avant-garde music and decided to send a long letter to the composer Arnold Schoenberg, enclosing his compositions, on 21 October 1923, begging to be accepted as his pupil. After the latter&#x27;s acceptance, Gerhard immediately left for Vienna. He was Schoenberg&#x27;s only Spanish pupil. Gerhard studied with Schoenberg in Vienna and Berlin between 1923 and 1928, and the teacher-pupil relationship became a lifelong friendship, as is shown in the complete correspondence published between the two composers.

In 1928, Gerhard returned to Barcelona. He devoted his energies to new music through concerts and journalism, in conjunction with the flourishing literary and artistic avant-garde of Catalonia. He befriended Joan Miró and Pablo Casals, brought Schoenberg and Anton Webern to Barcelona, and was the principal organizer of the 1936 ISCM Festival. He also collected, edited, and performed folksongs and Spanish music from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century.

Gerhard supported the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War (as musical adviser to the Minister of Fine Arts in the Catalan Government and a member of the Republican government&#x27;s Social Music Council). He was forced to flee to France in 1939 and later that year settled in Cambridge, England. Until the death of Francisco Franco, his music was virtually proscribed in Spain, to which he never returned except for holidays. Apart from scores for the BBC and in the theatre, Gerhard&#x27;s compositions of the 1940s were explicitly related to aspects of Spanish and Catalan culture, beginning in 1940 with a &quot;Homenaje a Pedrell&quot;, a symphony in memory of Pedrell, and the first version of the ballet &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The period culminated with &quot;The Duenna&quot;, a Spanish opera on an English play by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, which is set in Spain. The Covent Garden production of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the BBC broadcasts of &quot;The Duenna&quot; popularized Gerhard&#x27;s reputation in the UK, but not in Spain.

During the 1950s, the legacy of Schoenbergian serialism, a background presence in these overtly national works, engendered an increasingly radical approach to composition which, by the 1960s, placed Gerhard firmly in the ranks of the avant-garde. From the early 1950s Gerhard suffered from a heart condition which eventually ended his life. He died in Cambridge in 1970 and is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife Leopoldina &#x27;Poldi&#x27; Feichtegger Gerhard (1903–1994).

His archive is kept at Cambridge University Library. Other personal papers of Gerhard are preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya. The vast majority of the correspondence between Gerhard and Arnold Schoenberg can be found at the Arnold Schoenberg Center.

== Music ==

=== Stylistic evolution ===
For twenty years – first in Barcelona and then in exile in England – Gerhard cultivated, and enormously enriched, a modern tonal idiom with a pronounced Spanish-folkloric orientation that descended on the one hand from Pedrell and Falla, and on the other from such contemporary masters as Bartók and Stravinsky. This was the idiom whose major achievements included the ballets &quot;Soirées de Barcelone&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the Violin Concerto and the opera &quot;The Duenna&quot;.

Gerhard often said that he stood by the &quot;sound&quot; of his music: &#x27;in music the sense is in the sound&#x27;. Yet dazzling as their scoring is, his last works are in no sense a mere succession of sonic events. Their forms are meticulously organized and several make use of his special development of serialism where a twelve-tone pitch series, governing intervallic relations, interacts with a twelvefold &quot;time&quot; series governing the music&#x27;s duration and proportions.

=== Selected list of works ===

Gerhard&#x27;s most significant works, apart from those already mentioned, include four symphonies (the Third, &quot;Collages&quot;, for orchestra and tape), the Concerto for Orchestra, concertos for violin, piano and harpsichord, the cantata &quot;The Plague&quot; (after Albert Camus), the ballets &quot;Pandora&quot; and &quot;Ariel&quot;, and pieces for a wide variety of chamber ensembles, including Sardanas for the indigenous Catalan street band, the cobla. He was perhaps the first important composer of electronic music in Britain; his incidental music for the 1955 Stratford-on-Avon &quot;King Lear&quot; – one of many such commissions for the Royal Shakespeare Company – was the first electronic score for the British stage.

<text>Florent Schmitt (; 28 September 187017 August 1958) was a French composer. He was part of the group known as Les Apaches. His most famous pieces are &quot;La tragédie de Salome&quot; and &quot;Psaume XLVII&quot; (Psalm 47). He has been described as &quot;one of the most fascinating of France&#x27;s lesser-known classical composers&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Meurthe-et-Moselle, Schmitt took music lessons in Nancy with the local composer Gustave Sandré. At the age of 19 he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied with Gabriel Fauré, Jules Massenet, Théodore Dubois, and Albert Lavignac. In 1900 he won the Prix de Rome. During the 1890s he became friendly with Frederick Delius, who was living in Paris at the time, and Schmitt prepared vocal scores for four of Delius&#x27;s operas: &quot;Irmelin&quot;, &quot;The Magic Fountain&quot;, &quot;Koanga&quot; and &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

From 1929 to 1939 Schmitt worked as a music critic for &quot;Le Temps&quot;, where he proved controversial. He was known to shout out his views from his seat in the hall. The music publisher Heugel called him &quot;an irresponsible lunatic&quot;. In November 1933, at a concert that included music by Kurt Weill, who had just been forced to leave Germany and was present, Schmitt led a group in shouting &quot;Vive Hitler!&quot;, as reported by a communist journal.

===Later life===
Though he was one of the most often performed French composers during the first four decades of the 20th century, and though he never stopped composing, Schmitt&#x27;s works fell into comparative neglect. In 1952 he was admitted to the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. He became the subject of attacks — both in his last years and posthumously — because of his sympathies towards the actions of the Nazi party in the early 1930s and over his willingness to work for the Vichy regime in the 1940s, as had other eminent French musicians, notably Alfred Cortot and Joseph Canteloube.

Schmitt&#x27;s early career was later re-examined in association with Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s biography of English composer Frederick Delius. Beecham had known Delius in his Paris daysthe friend of August Strindberg, Paul Gauguin, Edvard Munch and other figures of the time.

Assisting Sir Thomas Beecham, Felix Aprahamian identified Florent Schmitt as having been one of Delius&#x27;s few French musician-friends. Schmitt was probably the last to remember &quot;Le grand Anglais&quot; of the Latin Quarter, as Delius had been known.

In 1956, Aprahamian arranged for Schmitt to meet Sir Thomas in England. On the occasion of his visit, Ralph Vaughan Williams telephoned to say that he had not met Florent Schmitt since before the First World War, when he had been a pupil of Ravel&#x27;s in Paris, and would like to see him. This precipitated a reunion of the two composers after a half-century. Afterwards, Schmitt travelled with Aprahamian to the Abbey Road Studios where Sir Thomas was then engaged in a recording project.

Although it had been his express wish to interview him, all Sir Thomas could do was to greet Schmitt briefly, shake him by the hand, and pass on down the corridor. Schmitt brushed off the encounter casually saying, &quot;Il était toujours un homme curieux. (He was always a curious man.)&quot; Two years later, when Aprahamian saw Schmitt again, at the 1958 Strasbourg Music Festival, he (Schmitt) was already seriously ill. He had journeyed there only to hear Charles Munch conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony. A few months later Schmitt died in Neuilly-sur-Seine, aged 87.

Aprahamian&#x27;s recollections of his encounters with Florent Schmitt were later included in his introduction to the revised edition (Severn House, 1975) of Beecham&#x27;s biography of Frederick Delius (Hutchinson, 1959). This introduction was reprinted by the Delius Society on the 50th anniversary of Beecham&#x27;s biography.

==Music==

Schmitt wrote 138 works with opus numbers. He composed examples of most of the major forms of music, except for opera. His Piano Quintet in B minor, written in 1908, helped establish his reputation. Other works include a violin sonata (&quot;Sonate Libre&quot;), a late string quartet, a saxophone quartet, &quot;Dionysiaques&quot; for wind band, two symphonies as well as several piano cycles such as &quot;Crépuscules&quot;, &quot;Ombres&quot; and &quot;Mirages&quot;.

He was part of the group known as Les Apaches. His own style, recognizably impressionistic, owed something to the example of Debussy, though it had distinct traces of Wagner and Richard Strauss also.

In 1907 Schmitt composed a ballet, &quot;La tragédie de Salomé&quot;, to a commission from Jacques Rouché for Loie Fuller and the Théâtre des Arts. The original ballet score required twenty instruments and lasted about an hour, In 1910 Schmitt prepared a suite using several of the ballet&#x27;s movement, half as long as the ballet score, for a much expanded orchestra. The suite is much better-known, with recordings conducted by Schmitt himself, Paul Paray, Jean Martinon, Antonio de Almeida, Marek Janowski and others. There is also a recording of the 1907 original score under Patrick Davin on the Marco Polo label. The rhythmic syncopations, polyrhythms, percussively treated chords, bitonality, and scoring of Schmitt&#x27;s work anticipate Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. While composing &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, Stravinsky acknowledged that Schmitt&#x27;s ballet gave him greater joy than any work he had heard in a long time, but the two composers fell out in later years, and Stravinsky reversed his opinion of Schmitt&#x27;s works.

Schmitt was one of the ten French composers who each, in 1927, contributed a dance for the children&#x27;s ballet &quot;L&#x27;éventail de Jeanne&quot;. Schmitt wrote the finale, a &quot;Kermesse-Valse&quot;.

Other works include the suite for orchestra &quot;Oriane et le Prince d&#x27;Amour&quot;, Op. 83 bis (1934), the symphonic diptych to the memory of Gabriel Fauré &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, Op. 72 (1937), the &quot;Ronde Burlesque&quot;, Op. 78 (1927), the &quot;Legende pour alto et orchestre&quot;, Op. 66 (1918), and the orchestral fresco &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; (1920).

The 1990s and 2000s witnessed a revival of his compositions, and an increased coverage of it on compact disc. Beginning in late 2012, the Invencia Piano Duo (Andrey Kasparov and Oksana Lutsyshyn), in collaboration with Naxos Records, on its Grand Piano series, released four CDs of Schmitt&#x27;s complete duo-piano works. The collection includes Schmitt&#x27;s &quot;Trois rapsodies&quot;, Op. 53, and the first recording of Schmitt&#x27;s &quot;Sept pièces&quot;, Op. 15, composed in 1899. It also includes one of two unpublished duets by Schmitt, &quot;Rhapsodie parisienne&quot; (1900). As of November 2016, it was announced all four volumes would be made available in a box set, with a scheduled release in January 2017.

<text>U.S. Route 24 or U.S. Highway 24 (US 24) is one of the original United States Numbered Highways of 1926 which runs east and west for most of its routing. It originally ran from Pontiac, Michigan, in the east to Kansas City, Missouri, in the west. Today, the highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Independence Township, Michigan, at an intersection with Interstate 75 (I-75), and its western terminus is near Minturn, Colorado, at an intersection with I-70. The highway transitions from north–south to east–west signage at the Ohio–Michigan state line.

===Colorado===
In Colorado, US 24 begins at the interchange of I-70 and US 6 (exit 171) near Minturn. From this interchange, US 24 proceeds southeast through Minturn and continues south to the Continental Divide at Tennessee Pass. It continues south to Johnson Village and then joins with US 285 northbound to Trout Creek Pass. After the pass, US 24 separates from US 285 and continues east to Colorado Springs and then northeast to Limon, where US 24 joins I-70 for most of the rest of its routing to the Kansas state line.

When the U.S. Numbered Highway System was started in 1926, US 24 in Colorado was designated US 40S. It began in Grand Junction and went east along the current I-70 corridor to Minturn, from which it followed the current route to Limon. From Limon east to the Kansas border, the current US 24 was designated US 40N. US 40S west of Limon and US 40N east of Limon received the US 24 designation in 1936, when US 24 was extended west from Kansas City, Missouri. The segment between Grand Junction and Minturn was decommissioned in 1975.

In Kansas, US 24 enters from Colorado west of Kanorado; it overlaps I-70 for to Colby. US 24 does not meet I-70 again until Kansas City. On December 1, 2008, US 24 was rerouted southward on US 73 to I-70 west of Kansas City, continuing east on I-70 on the final in Kansas. US 24 serves Manhattan, as well as the northern sides of Topeka and Lawrence.

The original designation for the current US 24 route in Kansas was US 40N. It went from the Colorado border to Manhattan. In 1936, US 24 received its current designation after an extension west from Kansas City.

In Kansas, US 24 is merged with US 59 from Williamstown to a place in northern Lawrence called Teepee Junction. From there, it is merged with US 40 until Kansas City.

===Missouri===

In Missouri, US 24 serves Kansas City, Independence, Buckner, Lexington, Waverly, Carrollton, Keytesville, Moberly, Madison, Monroe City, Palmyra, and West Quincy. It runs concurrently with US 65 between Waverly and Carrollton, passing over the Missouri River via the Waverly Bridge when concurrent. After becoming a two-lane road, it is then concurrent with Route 5 in Keytesville (where it is called Jackson Street) and then passes by the city of Huntsville before turning into a four-lane highway and crossing US 63 at Moberly. It is finally concurrent (for the third time) with US 36 east of Monroe City and with US 61 from south of Palmyra to West Quincy. The segment shared with US 61 is part of the Avenue of the Saints.

Along the route within Independence is the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum.

===Illinois===

Crossing into Illinois, US 24 uses the pairing of the cable-stayed Bayview Bridge (westbound) and the older Quincy Memorial Bridge (eastbound) over the Mississippi River in Quincy. , it is the main arterial highway from Quincy northeast to Peoria. Between these two cities, the highway follows the old Peoria to Quincy stage coach route. US 24 travels onto the Shade–Lohmann Bridge on I-474 to bypass Peoria, and it gets off at exit 9.

In East Peoria, US 24 forms a wrong-way concurrency with Illinois Route 116 and US 150 as it parallels the Illinois River. From East Peoria, US 24 runs directly east (parallel to the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway) through a number of small towns en route to Indiana. US 24 crosses into Indiana at the state line east of Sheldon.

===Indiana===

In Indiana, US 24 runs east from the Illinois state line to Huntington. At Huntington, US 24 turns northeast and runs to Fort Wayne; it then overlaps I-69 and I-469 to bypass the city before entering Ohio at the state line east of Fort Wayne. The segment of US 24 between Logansport and Toledo, Ohio, is part of the Hoosier Heartland Industrial Corridor project of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.

===Ohio===

From Fort Wayne, US 24 follows the path of the Maumee River toward Toledo. In Ohio, the roadway enters the state east of Woodburn, Indiana, near Antwerp. Between the Indiana state line and Toledo, this portion of the roadway is known as the Fort to Port segment of the Hoosier Heartland Industrial Corridor.

Between Napoleon and Toledo, modern US 24 lies north of the Maumee River as a highway built to Interstate Highway standards. Just north of Waterville is the site of the Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1794. General Anthony Wayne after constructing a trail from Fort Wayne to (Fort) Defiance, fought and defeated a Native American consortium, thus opening northern Ohio to white settlement. At a point on Toledo&#x27;s north side, US 24 veers from northeast–southwest to true north–south, turning on to Telegraph Road, while Detroit Avenue continues as a city street that connects to M-125 (Dixie Highway) at the Michigan border.

The path through Toledo of US 24 follows the course of old US 25, old US 25 being farther away from the course of north–south I-75. Partially truncated as a state route, what had been US 24 was renumbered as State Route 25 where it remained a state highway, and US 25 in greater Toledo became US 24.

===Michigan===

In Michigan, US 24 enters from Toledo, Ohio, and serves the city of Monroe and Metro Detroit, where it is known as Telegraph Road. It continues north through the western edge of Detroit. It passes through Michigan&#x27;s &quot;mixing bowl&quot;, which is where I-696 (Walter P. Reuther Freeway), M-10 (John C. Lodge Freeway/Northwestern Highway), and Lahser Road intersect. US 24 continues north along Telegraph Road as the border between Waterford and Pontiac until its intersection with Dixie Highway where it travels to the northwest until its termination at I-75 in Independence Township.

==History==
Between Dixie Highway in Pontiac, Michigan, and Laskey Road in Toledo, Ohio, the highway is known as Telegraph Road, named before the highway system existed after the telegraph wires to which it once ran parallel. Mark Knopfler of the rock band Dire Straits wrote the song &quot;Telegraph Road&quot; about the development and decay of the road, which he spotted en route to a concert. It is a major surface route through western areas of Metro Detroit. 

US 24 (Telegraph Road) along the west edge of Detroit, Michigan, was one of the first roads where Michigan left turns were implemented. This pattern was introduced at the time of, or soon after, its widening to a six- to eight-lane divided highway between 1960 and 1963. Several other channelization techniques are also used; for instance, the M-153 (Ford Road) intersection includes a southbound jughandle and a cutoff for northbound left-turning traffic.

US 24 from Minturn to Limon, Colorado, is a former route of US 40S. Between Limon and Manhattan, Kansas, US 24 follows the old route of US 40N.

US 24 followed State Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas until December 1, 2008, when it was rerouted onto K-7 and I-70.

From 2008 to 2012, US 24 from Fort Wayne to Toledo was mostly expanded to Interstate standards as part of an overall &quot;Fort to Port&quot; project, in reference to Fort Wayne and the port of Toledo.

As of 2021, US 24 has been moved to follow I-435 south and I-70 west in Kansas City, Missouri; the original US 24 that used to follow Independence Avenue is now US 24 Business.

<doc id="495133" wikidata="Q7372879" url="?curid=495133" title="Roy H. Park">
<text>Roy Hampton Park (15 September 1910 – 25 October 1993) was an American entrepreneur and media mogul. He is known for creating the Duncan Hines brand of packaged food products, and for his television/radio/newspaper conglomerate, Park Communications. He created the Park Foundation, which has funded many programs in his name at Ithaca College, Cornell University, and North Carolina State University.

==Biography==
Park was born in Dobson, North Carolina, the son of a tenant farmer. He began writing for two local North Carolina newspapers at the age of 12; although he suffered a severe bout with rheumatic fever at 13, Park graduated from Dobson High School at the age of 15 and followed his brother to North Carolina State University.

After crashing his brother&#x27;s automobile, Park took his first job to pay off the damages; this job was at the local Associated Press bureau, where he worked his way up from office boy to reporter by the time of this graduation from college. He also wrote for the college&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;Technician&quot;, and extended his term of study at college so that he could serve as the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief. Upon graduation in 1931 with a degree in business administration, he was awarded the senior superlative of &quot;Best Writer.&quot;

After graduation, Park accepted the position of public relations director for the North Carolina Cotton Growers Cooperative Association; there, he pioneered innovative ways of promoting cotton, including &quot;Cotton Balls,&quot; with dancers and performers dressed in cotton formal wear. In 1936, he married Dorothy Goodwin Dent, one of the &quot;Maids of Cotton,&quot; whom he met prior to these events.

At the Cotton Cooperative, Park founded and published three periodicals, the &quot;Carolina Cooperator,&quot; the &quot;Rural Electrification Guide&quot;, and &quot;Cooperative Digest and Farm Power&quot;, which attracted the attention of H. E. Babcock, the founder of the Grange League Federation. Babcock offered Park a position at the agency, in Ithaca, New York, which Park accepted in 1942.

==Duncan Hines==
In the late 1940s, the Grange approached Park to find a way to market their excess food products; Park approached well-known food critic Duncan Hines to lend his name to a brand of packaged food products. The resulting company, Hines-Park Foods, was a stunning success in the American food market, especially with its flagship product, Duncan Hines Cake Mix. Only five years after releasing its first products, Hines-Park was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble in 1956 for 360,000 shares of Procter &amp; Gamble stock and an undisclosed amount of cash. Park stayed with Procter &amp; Gamble as a senior executive until 1962.

==Park Communications==

After selling Duncan Hines, Park began to look around for new business opportunities. In 1961, he used his shares of Procter &amp; Gamble as collateral to acquire two radio stations in North Carolina and established Park Broadcasting, Inc. He left Procter &amp; Gamble the following year and began rapidly purchasing other radio and TV stations. In 1972, he started purchasing newspapers; five years later, he owned 40 of them. Most of his acquisitions were in small to medium-sized markets, far away from big cities.

&quot;Park saw gold in owning broadcast stations,&quot; said his longtime deputy Johnny Babcock. &quot;They are reasonably invulnerable to competition, not overburdened with depreciable assets, high profile in their community, and while regulated by the government, the franchise for the assigned frequency on the airwaves is protected by Uncle Sam.&quot; Park&#x27;s TV stations operated at a 45% profit margin, with radio in the high 30s, &quot;outdoor billboards in the low 30s, newspapers in the mid to high 20s. A big grocery retailer does well to turn a profit of 2-3 percent; industrial concerns score success if they exceed 10 percent operating profit. Broadcasting was a pretty fat cat.&quot;

By 1977, Park had become the first broadcaster to acquire seven television stations, seven AM radio, and seven FM radio stations—the legal limit at the time. In 1983, Congress relaxed limits on ownership, and Park resumed buying. Park changed the name of the company and went public in 1983, selling 10% of his shares and retaining 90% of the company. At the time of his death, Park Communications controlled 21 radio stations, seven television stations, and 144 publications; the company&#x27;s market reach was estimated at one-quarter of all American households and employed over 3,000 people. As the conglomerate grew, he often said that he did not sell media properties, he bought them.

After his death, Park Communications was bought for $710 million by a pair of investors using a loan from the Retirement Systems of Alabama. It was resold in 1996 to Media General.

In 2017, Media General was sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group. The combined company is now known as Nexstar Media Group.

==Other==

Park lived in the Ithaca, New York area for the remainder of his life, having purchased a stone mansion on seven acres in Cayuga Heights in the mid-1950s. He maintained connections to his native state, sitting on the Board of Visitors for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and on the Board of Trustees of North Carolina State University. In 1989, the state of North Carolina presented him with its highest civilian honor, the North Carolina Award.

In addition to his media holdings, Park owned a number of rental properties in Ithaca, timberland in North Carolina, and was a major shareholder in both Procter &amp; Gamble and the Tompkins County Trust Company, owning 7% of the latter at his death. He also owned a billboard and outdoor advertising business that he eventually sold to his son.

Park was actively involved with Ithaca College, joining its board of trustees in 1973 and serving as chairman from 1981 to 1992. In 1989, the college&#x27;s media school was renamed the Roy H. Park School of Communications. The college&#x27;s School of Business is housed in the Dorothy D. and Roy H. Park Center, which opened in 2008.

At Cornell University, he sat on the Advisory Council of the Johnson Graduate School of Management and endowed the Lewis H. Durland Memorial Lecture Series, which brings a prominent business leader to campus every year. (Durland, the longtime university treasurer, was a friend of Park.)

Park died in 1993 from a heart attack in New York City.

==Philanthropy==

In 1966, Park created the Park Foundation as an outlet for his philanthropic interests. After his death, a substantial percentage of his wealth went to the foundation.

The foundation quickly ran into trouble, with Park&#x27;s two children (one liberal, one conservative) disagreeing about which causes to support. In 2001, Dorothy Park divided the foundation in two. She, along with her daughter Adelaide Gomer and Gomer&#x27;s daughter, continued to operate the Park Foundation, whereas Park Jr. and his children took over the spun-off Triad Foundation.

In 2010, with Dorothy Park suffering from advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s, her two children sued each other after disagreeing over whose foundation should get the bulk of her estimated $220-million estate. (Dorothy Park died in 2016, at 103.)

The Park Foundation supports a myriad of causes including higher education, media and public awareness, and environmental protection. Among their largest contributions include the Park Scholarships program at North Carolina State University and the Park Scholar program at Ithaca College within the Park School of Communications. In addition, the Dorothy and Roy Park Alumni Center at North Carolina State was named after the couple.

<doc id="495138" wikidata="Q1003008" url="?curid=495138" title="Builders of the Adytum">
<text>The Builders of the Adytum (BOTA, also spelled B.O.T.A., BotA, or B.o.t.A.) is a school of the Western mystery tradition based in Los Angeles which is registered as a non-profit tax-exempt religious organization. It was founded by Paul Foster Case and has its roots in both the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Masonic blue lodge system. It was later extended by Ann Davies.

The B.O.T.A. teaches by correspondence, covering esoteric psychology, occult tarot, Hermetic Qabalah, astrology, and meditation techniques. It also holds a variety of ritual services and study groups, some open to the public.

Worldwide membership is around 5,000.

==Origins of the name==
 is Latin for &quot;Inner Shrine&quot; or &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; and &quot;Builders&quot; refers to the emulation of the Carpenter from Nazareth, Jesus, whom some members of the B.O.T.A. believe was adept in the mysteries of building a living temple without hands ().

==History==
The Order was founded 1922 by Paul Foster Case. Case was a senior member of the Hermes-Thoth Alpha et Omega Temple in the United States. After a disagreement with Moina Mathers, principal head and widow of MacGregor Mathers, he left the Golden Dawn along with some former members and formed a separate order.

With the death of Paul Foster Case his secretary Ann Davies became the head of B.O.T.A.. The order flourished and expanded to Europe and Australia.

==Beliefs==
B.O.T.A. believes that the Qabalah is the mystical root of both ancient Judaism and the original Christianity. People of all faiths are accepted if they are mystically inclined.

For members of the B.O.T.A., the means whereby higher consciousness and divine illumination may be gained include both theory and practice. These teachings and practical secrets constitute what the Builders of the Adytum refer to as Ageless Wisdom. It is called &quot;Ageless&quot; because they believe it is not susceptible to the mutations of time. Ageless Wisdom is not viewed by the B.O.T.A. as primarily a product of man&#x27;s thinking. It is &quot;written by God upon the face of nature&quot; and is always there for men and women of all epochs to read, if they can.

==Regional organizations==
B.O.T.A. has Open Forum and Pronaos healing ritual work in many cities throughout the world:
# Northeast US
# Midwest / Southeast US
# Southwest US / Rocky Mt.
# Northwest US
# Southern California / Arizona / Nevada
# South America &amp; Mexico
# Australia and New Zealand
# Europe

===Open Forum===
These groups are open to all and afford an opportunity to interact with those who share a common spiritual teaching and practice. The purposes for the Open Forum include (1) developing fraternal Love and Harmony, (2) developing higher consciousness, (3) incorporating the principles of Ageless Wisdom in everyday life, (4) learning to enjoy together the operation of the One Will (the will of God), and (5) providing an open door to the Mysteries to all who genuinely seek them. Open Forum can be in-person or online.

===Group ritual===
Group Ritual Work has long been used in the Western mystery tradition as a dynamic means of bringing about spiritual and fraternal insights. Open only to B.O.T.A. members, this ritualistic work occurs after initiation into Pronaos which includes an oath of secrecy. Its aim is to impress symbolism more effectively upon the aspirants&#x27; psyches through dramatic enactment, bringing the static images of the B.O.T.A. tarot deck into motion.

<doc id="495143" wikidata="Q712830" url="?curid=495143" title="Imperial Rescript on Education">
<text>The , or IRE for short, was signed by Emperor Meiji of Japan on 30 October 1890 to articulate government policy on the guiding principles of education on the Empire of Japan. The 315 character document was read aloud at all important school events, and students were required to study and memorize the text.

==Background==
Following the Meiji Restoration, the leadership of the Meiji government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centered on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality; however, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the &#x27;modernization&#x27; of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an &quot;emperor-centered&quot; philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others.

After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Emperor Meiji.

Translated into English:Know ye, Our subjects:

Our Imperial Ancestors have founded Our Empire on a basis broad and everlasting and have deeply and firmly implanted virtue; Our subjects ever united in loyalty and filial piety have from generation to generation illustrated the beauty thereof. This is the glory of the fundamental character of Our Empire, and herein lies the source of Our education.

Ye, Our subjects, be filial to your parents, affectionate to your brothers and sisters; as husbands and wives be harmonious; as friends true; bear yourselves in modesty and moderation; extend your benevolence to all; pursue learning and cultivate arts, and thereby develop intellectual faculties and perfect moral powers; furthermore advance public good and promote common interests; always respect the Constitution and observe the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth.

So shall ye not only be Our good and faithful subjects, but render illustrious the best traditions of your forefathers. The Way here set forth is indeed the teaching bequeathed by Our Imperial Ancestors, to be observed alike by Their Descendants and the subjects, infallible for all ages and true in all places. It is Our wish to lay it to heart in all reverence, in common with you, Our subjects, that we may thus attain to the same virtue.

==Details==
The Rescript pushed traditional ideals of Confucianism, and in many ways contributed to the rise of militarism during the 1930s and 40s. The Rescript requested of the people that they &quot;furthermore advance public good and promote common interests; always respect the Constitution and observe the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth&quot;.

The basis of the Rescript was that Japan&#x27;s unique &quot;kokutai&quot; (system of government) was based on a historic bond between benevolent rulers and loyal subjects, and that the fundamental purpose of education was to cultivate virtues, especially loyalty and filial piety.

After the end of World War II in Asia following the surrender of Japan, the American occupation authorities forbade the formal reading of the Imperial Rescript in schools, and the National Diet officially abolished it on 19 June 1948.

==Kikuchi Dairoku and the Imperial Rescript on Education==
In 1907, Kikuchi Dairoku was invited by the University of London to give lectures on education from the middle of February for about five months. The central focus of his lectures was the Imperial Rescript on Education. The request for the lectures was initially communicated to Hayashi Tadasu, then ambassador in London (from December 1905). At first Sawayanagi Matsutaro was to give the lectures, but he was recalled when in Rome on the way to London and Kikuchi gave the lectures instead. As a preparation for the lectures he translated the Imperial Rescript into English.

<text>Tom Gilb (full name &quot;Thomas Steven Gilb&quot;, born 1940) is an American systems engineer, consultant, and author, known for the development of software metrics, software inspection, and evolutionary processes.

== Biography ==
Tom Gilb was born in 1940 in Pasadena, California, United States. He emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1956 and to Norway in 1958. He took his first job with IBM in 1958 and became a freelance consultant in 1960.

He is known for his early work on evolutionary software development processes from 1968 to 1981, which was a forerunner of agile software development methods.

He is currently (at least in spring 2018) a consultant, teacher and author, in partnership with his son Kai Gilb. He mainly helps multinational clients improve their organizations and methods by using &quot;evolutionary systems delivery&quot; (Evo). His method is based upon the core ideas that all architecture focus has to be on delivering value to the stakeholders and that engineering principles and scientific methods must be used in planning and management of change projects using a formal engineering language like the one that he has developed and named &quot;Planguage&quot;. He has &quot;guest lectured at universities all over UK, Europe, China, India, USA, Korea – and has been a keynote speaker at dozens of technical conferences internationally&quot;.

He is a member of INCOSE and is active in the Norwegian chapter, NORSEC, which presented him with an award in 2003. He lectures at INCOSE local chapters on his worldwide travels and at INCOSE conferences.

In 2012 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the British Computer Society.

<doc id="495148" wikidata="Q282242" url="?curid=495148" title="Oriental darter">
<text>The Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster) is a water bird of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. It has a long and slender neck with a straight, pointed bill and, like the cormorant, it hunts for fish while its body is submerged in water. It spears a fish underwater, bringing it above the surface, tossing and juggling it before swallowing the fish head first. The body remains submerged as it swims, and the slender neck alone is visible above the water, which accounts for the colloquial name of snakebird. Like the cormorants, it has wettable feathers and it is often found perched on a rock or branch with its wings held open to dry.

==Description==

The Oriental darter is like all other anhingas, a cormorant-like species that has a very long neck. The structure of the neck is as in other species of darter with strongly developed muscles about a kink in the neck at the 8th and 9th vertebrae that allows it to be flexed and darted forward with rapid force to stab fish underwater. The edges of the commissures of the mandible tips have minute inward pointing serrations that hold impaled fish.

The adult plumage above is black and the wing coverts and tertials having silvery streaks along the shaft. The crown and neck are brown shading to black towards the back of the neck. The underparts are blackish brown. A pale line over the eye and throat and a line running along the sides of the neck gives it a striped appearance. The iris is white with a yellow ring (brighter yellow in breeding birds) around it. The tip of the upper mandible is dark while the base is pale brown bill while the lower mandible is yellowish. The legs and webbing on the foot are yellow in immatures and non-breeding birds while breeding birds have darker grey tarsi and toes with yellow webbing. The sexes are not easily distinguishable but males tend to have black speckles that coalesce on the white throat. Adult females have a shorter bill and tend to have the black at the base of neck and chest separated from the hind neck by a wide buff band that ends at the shoulder. This pattern however is also found in immatures whose neck is lighter and lack the long pointed scapulars. In flight the long and slender neck, wide wing and wedge shaped tail make it distinctive. Young birds have a pale brown neck and appear whitish on the underside and lack the white streak along the side of the neck. The inner secondaries or tertials and the central tail feathers appear wavy or corrugated. The tail is long and made up of twelve stiff feathers which are dragged along the ground when the bird attempts to walk or hop on land.

==Taxonomy==
The Oriental darter is a member of the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to American (&quot;Anhinga anhinga&quot;), African (&quot;Anhinga rufa&quot;, with &quot;vulsini&quot; of Madagascar as a subspecies), and Australasian (&quot;Anhinga novaehollandiae&quot;) darters. These were for sometime treated as subspecies of &quot;Anhinga melanogaster&quot;. The Oriental darter differs in appearance from American darters most recognisably by its white lateral neck stripe.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The Oriental darter is found mainly in freshwater lakes and streams. They usually forage singly, with the entire body submerged, swimming slowly forward using their webbed feet while the head and neck is moved jerkily above the water. It darts its neck to impale fish and then brings them out of water, tossing them into the air before swallowing the fish head first. They may sometimes be found along with cormorants which share the habit of spreading out their wings to dry when perched on a waterside rock or tree. They sometimes soar on thermals during the warm part of the day but will alternate flapping and gliding in normal flight.

They nest in mixed species heronries where they build a stick platform on the nest tree which is usually surrounded by water. Several pairs may nest close to each other. The branch is flattened by the birds prior to the placement of the sticks that form the nest platform. The nest sites are defended from other birds with posturing and thrusts of the neck. The breeding season is June to August (during the rainy season) in northern India, April–May in southwestern India and in winter in southeastern India (during the northeast monsoon). The usual clutch consists of three to six spindle shaped bluish-green eggs with a white chalky covering that gets soiled over time. Both parents incubate the eggs, beginning after the first egg is laid which leads to asynchronous hatching of the young. The newly hatched chicks are bare and covered with some down on the head. As they grow, they become covered in white down. The chicks feed by thrusting their heads down the throat of their parents.
Adults go through a synchronous moult of their flight feathers after the breeding season, resulting in the loss of flying ability for a brief period. When disturbed from their perches during this period, they dive into the water below and attempt to escape underwater. This escape behaviour is also employed by chicks at the nest. They are very silent except at the nest where they produce grunts and croaks and a disyllabic &quot;chigi-chigi-chigi&quot;. Chicks are noisy when begging for food. Adults roost communally in trees close to or over water.

Chicks, especially those more than half grown are sometimes preyed on by raptors such as Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle (&quot;Haliaetus leucoryphus&quot;). The long scapular feathers were once popular for use in decorating hats. A number of parasites have been recorded from adult birds including &quot;Schwartzitrema anhingi&quot; (Trematoda), &quot;Petasiger nicolli&quot;, &quot;Mesorchis pendulus&quot;, and &quot;Echinorhynchotaenia tritesticulata&quot; (Cestoda:Dilepididae).In some parts of northeastern India, darters were (or are) used by tribals to capture fish from streams. A ring is tied around the neck to prevent them from swallowing the prey just as is done with cormorant fishing in parts of Southeast Asia.

<doc id="495149" wikidata="Q6245447" url="?curid=495149" title="John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale">
<text>John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale, PC FRS (25 April 165510 July 1700), known as Sir John Lowther, 2nd Baronet, from 1675 to 1696, was an English politician.

==Early life==
He was born at Hackthorpe Hall, Lowther, Westmorland, the son of Col. John Lowther of Lowther (the eldest son of Sir John Lowther, 1st Baronet) and his wife, Elizabeth Bellingham, daughter of Sir Henry Bellingham, 1st Baronet, of Hilsington, Westmoreland.

He was educated at Sedbergh School before admission to Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1670. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1671 and called to the Bar in 1677.

==Career==
Prior to his creation as a viscount in 1696, Lowther had succeeded his grandfather as a baronet, and was twice member of parliament for Westmorland between 1677 and 1696. In 1688 he was serviceable in securing Cumberland and Westmorland for King William III, and was appointed to the Privy Council in 1689. In 1690, he was first lord of the treasury, and he was Lord Privy Seal from March 1699 until his death. He was badly injured in a duel in 1691.

Lonsdale wrote in 1688 a brief account of events from the accession of James II to the landing of the Prince of Orange at Torbay, which was later printed as Memoirs of the Reign of James II (in 1808, for private circulation) and again in 1857. The &quot;Memoirs&quot; reveal no more of Lonsdale&#x27;s part in events than his public utterances.

==Personal life==
On 3 December 1674, he married Lady Katherine Thynne (1653–1712/3), sister of Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, and second daughter of Sir Henry Frederick Thynne, 1st Baronet and the former Hon. Mary Coventry (second daughter, by his second wife, of Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry). Together, they were the parents of:

* Richard Lowther, 2nd Viscount Lonsdale (1692–1713), who died a few months after reaching his majority in 1713.
* Henry Lowther, 3rd Viscount Lonsdale (1694–1751), who died unmarried in 1751.
* Hon. Mary Lowther (–1706), who married Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet of North Elmsall in February 1692.
* Hon. Elizabeth Lowther, who married Sir William Ramsden, 2nd Baronet on 6 August 1695.
* Hon. Margaret Lowther (d. 1728), who married Sir Joseph Pennington, 2nd Baronet on 20 April 1706.
* Hon. Barbara Lowther (d. 1716), who married Thomas Howard of Corby (d. 1740), a direct descendant of Lord William Howard.
* Hon. Anthony Lowther (d. 1741)
* Hon. Jane Lowther (d. 1752), who died unmarried.

He died at Lowther on 10 July 1700 and was buried in Lowther churchyard. His wife Katherine Lowther took over his political influence and she was eventually buried at Lowther in 1713. The tomb is by William Stanton.

His branch of the Lowther family became extinct when his son Henry, the 3rd viscount, died unmarried in March 1751, and the baronetcy and estates went to his cousin, James Lowther, later the first Earl of Lonsdale.

<text>Kenneth Brian Edmonds (born April 10, 1959), better known by his stage name Babyface, is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He has written and produced over 26 number-one R&amp;B hits throughout his career and has won 13 Grammy Awards. He was ranked number 20 on &quot;NME&quot; 50 of The Greatest Producers Ever list.

==Early life==
Edmonds was born on April 10, 1959, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Marvin and Barbara Edmonds. Barbara was a production operator at a pharmaceutical plant. Edmonds, who is the fifth of six brothers (including future After 7 band members Melvin and Kevon Edmonds, the latter of whom went on to have a modestly successful solo career), attended North Central High School in Indianapolis, and as a shy youth, wrote songs to express his emotions. When he was in eighth grade, Edmonds&#x27; father died of lung cancer, leaving his mother to raise her sons alone.

==Music career==
Edmonds later met funk performer Bootsy Collins, who tagged him &quot;Babyface&quot; because of his youthful look. He also performed in the group Manchild (which had a 1977 hit &quot;Especially for You&quot; with band member Daryl Simmons)as a guitarist. He played keyboards and guitar in the light-funk and R&amp;B group the Deele (which also included drummer Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid, with whom he would later form a successful writing and producing partnership). One of his first major credits as a songwriter for outside artists came when he wrote the tune &quot;Slow Jam&quot; for the R&amp;B band Midnight Star in 1983. The tune was on Midnight Star&#x27;s 1983 double-platinum &quot;No Parking on the Dance Floor&quot; album. Babyface remained in the Deele until 1988, when both he and Reid left the group.

His album &quot;Playlist&quot; consists of eight cover songs and two original works. It was released on September 18, 2007. It was the first album on the newly re-launched Mercury Records label.

On February 4, 2014, he released a Grammy Award-winning duet album with Toni Braxton titled &quot;Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce&quot; on Motown Records.

In April 2024, he announced a Las Vegas residency via an Instagram video, featuring a playful spoof of Kidman&#x27;s viral AMC Theaters ad.

==Other ventures==

===Writing and producing===
From the late 1980s to the early 90s, he wrote R&amp;B and dance songs, writing and producing music for Bobby Brown (&quot;Roni&quot;), Karyn White (&quot;Love Saw It&quot;), Pebbles (&quot;Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Mercedes Boy&quot;), The Whispers (&quot;Rock Steady&quot;, &quot;In the Mood&quot;), The Deele (&quot;Two Occasions&quot;), Johnny Gill (&quot;My My My&quot;), After 7 (&quot;Ready or Not&quot;), The Boys (&quot;Dial My Heart&quot;), Damian Dame (&quot;Right Down to It&quot;) and Sheena Easton.

In 1989, Edmonds co-founded LaFace Records with Reid. Three of the label&#x27;s early artists, TLC, Usher, and Toni Braxton, were very successful. TLC&#x27;s second album &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, for which he wrote and produced some of the hits, became the best-selling album of all time by an American girl group. Under his direction, TLC sold more than 60 million albums worldwide, and a combined total of 75 million records. Toni Braxton&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Toni Braxton&quot; (1993) and &quot;Secrets&quot; (1996), for which he wrote the majority of the songs, went on to sell a combined total of over 15 million copies.

Babyface helped form the late-1990s R&amp;B group Az Yet. Edmonds also helped to mold and work with some of his then-wife Tracey Edmonds&#x27; acts, such as Jon B and producer Jon-John Robinson.

&quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; (1990), produced for Whitney Houston, was Edmonds&#x27; first No. 1 Top 40 hit in the US. He also wrote and produced Boyz II Men&#x27;s 1992 &quot;End of the Road&quot; and 1994 &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot;, both of which established records for the longest stay at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. He co-wrote, co-produced, and provided backing vocals on Madonna&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, which featured the seven-week No. 1 hit &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, and shared billing with Eric Clapton on the chart-topping Grammy winner &quot;Change the World&quot; from the &quot;Phenomenon&quot; soundtrack. He also wrote and produced the No. 1 hit &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot; for Houston as well as the rest of the 10 million-selling &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; soundtrack in 1995, which spawned additional hits for Houston, Brandy and Mary J. Blige.

Edmonds has produced and written music for Bobby Brown, The Whispers, Pebbles, After 7, Johnny Gill, Deele, Karyn White, The Boys, Damian Dame, Tevin Campbell, Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Madonna, Janet Jackson, Faith Evans, Beyoncé, Diana Ross, Sheena Easton, Toni Braxton, Michael Jackson, Michael Bolton, Paula Abdul, Eric Clapton (&quot;Change the World&quot;), Whitney Houston, Brandy, Mary J. Blige, Tamia, Shola Ama, 3T, Sisqó, Dru Hill, Fall Out Boy, Céline Dion, Samantha Jade, Backstreet Boys, Honeyz, Katharine McPhee, Mariah Carey, Vanessa L. Williams, Bruno Mars, Kelly Clarkson, Chanté Moore, En Vogue, Zendaya, Kenny G, Kristinia DeBarge, Lil Wayne, Kevin Abstract, P!nk, Marc Nelson, TLC, Ariana Grande, Jessica Mauboy, Xscape, K-Ci &amp; JoJo, NSYNC, Jordin Sparks and Phil Collins. He received three consecutive Grammy Awards for Producer of the Year from 1995 to 1997.

Babyface worked on Ashanti&#x27;s album &quot;The Declaration&quot; (2008), producing the track &quot;Mother&quot;.

He worked on the Lil Wayne album &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; (2008), on the Kanye West-produced &quot;Comfortable&quot;. He also worked with R&amp;B singer Monica for her sixth studio album &quot;Still Standing&quot; (2010).

In 2013, Babyface served as producer for Ariana Grande&#x27;s debut album &quot;Yours Truly&quot;, producing five of the songs, including her second single, &quot;Baby I&quot;.

In September 2014, Babyface collaborated with Barbra Streisand on her album &quot;Partners&quot;, performing a duet on the track &quot;Evergreen&quot; and background vocals for other album tracks.

Babyface also collaborated with Foxes on her second album, &quot;All I Need&quot; (2016), producing and co-writing &quot;Scar&quot;.

In July 2016, Babyface along with Bruce Roberts and Carole Bayer Sager helped write the song &quot;Stronger Together&quot; sung by Jessica Sanchez. The song was played after Hillary Clinton&#x27;s speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The song&#x27;s title is named after the slogan that the Clinton campaign used as a show of uniting behind the Democratic nominee. The song was one of the top trending songs on Shazam that week. The song was widely perceived as positive by the listeners, and received praise by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian.

===Acting===
In 1994, he appeared and performed on an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, entitled &quot;Mr. Walsh Goes to Washington (Part 2)&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Edmonds and his then-wife Tracey Edmonds expanded into the business of motion pictures. Upon setting up Edmonds Entertainment Group, the company producing the films &quot;Soul Food&quot; (1997), &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; (2001), and also the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), which included contributions from numerous artists, including Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. They also executive produced the BET reality series &quot;College Hill&quot; (2004–2009). Edmonds also worked with David Foster to compose &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot;, the official song of the 1996 Summer Olympics, performed by Céline Dion. Linda Thompson provided the lyrics.

Babyface also participated as a duet partner on the Fox reality show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; (2006).

He was portrayed by Wesley Jonathan in the 2015 Lifetime biopic &quot;Whitney&quot; and is portrayed by actor Gavin Houston in the Lifetime biopic based on Toni Braxton entitled &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, which premiered on the network in early 2016.

<text>Hard determinism (or metaphysical determinism) is a view on free will which holds that determinism is true, that it is incompatible with free will, and therefore that free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to nomological determinism, it can also be a position taken with respect to other forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.

Hard determinism is contrasted with soft determinism, which is a compatibilist form of determinism, holding that free will may exist despite determinism. It is also contrasted with metaphysical libertarianism, the other major form of incompatibilism which holds that free will exists and determinism is false.

== History ==
=== Classical era ===
In ancient Greece, Socrates initiated the rationalistic teaching that any agent is obliged to pursue the chief good conceived by his or her mind. Strato of Lampsacus speculated that an unconscious divine power acts in the world and causes the origin, growth, and breakdown of things. Diodorus Cronus asserted the identity of the possible and the necessary and inferred that future events are as determined as the past ones. Chrysippus of Soli refuted the &quot;idle argument&quot; invented to discredit determinism as if human efforts were futile in a preordained world; he explained that fated events occur with the engagement of conscious agents.

The Bhagavad Gita, a classical Indian text composed around 4th century BCE, also mentions hard deterministic ideas. Krishna, the personification of Godhead, says to Arjuna in the verse 13.30:

=== Modern era ===
In the 17th century, both John Locke and Baruch Spinoza argued for strict causality of volitional acts.

In the Age of Enlightenment, Baron d’Holbach promulgated the naturalistic interpretation of mental events. Arthur Schopenhauer observed that everyone regards himself free &quot;a priori&quot;; however, &quot;a posteriori&quot; he must discover that he had been obliged to make the decisions he actually made. Friedrich Nietzsche noticed that free decisions are graded as &quot;causa sui&quot;, emerging from non-existence.

=== Contemporary history ===
Recently, Daniel Wegner stressed the limitations of free will on grounds of experimental evidence for unconscious choice and action. To prove determinism, the following putative experiment was proposed: all principal differences between the features of an artificial zygote and that developing naturally can be avoided.

==Overview==
Meeting a challenge, agents make decisions in conformity to the inherited character, life history, and current stimuli. The field of acute attention is limited, and motives partly remain unconscious. From the first person&#x27;s perspective, we have an intuitive commitment that many options are available. However, if the total of the mental content is considered from the third person&#x27;s perspective, only a single decision deemed by the agent as the most favorable at the moment turns out real. The validity of causation for any mental event becomes apparent taking into account their neurophysiological correlates. Different causal descriptions correspond to the mental and physical domain. Laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics govern the latter. Admitting downright mental causation of physiological impulses would mean surplus determination. The surmise that under identical conditions, alternative decisions and actions are possible is disproved by naturalists as an illusion.
Hard determinism is not taken to refer merely to a determinism on earth, but in all of reality (e.g. involving the effects of light from other galaxies, etc.); not just during a certain deterministic period of time, but for all time. This also means that the relation of necessity will be bi-directional. Just as the initial conditions of the universe presumably determine all future states, so too does the present necessitate the past. In other words, one could not change any one fact without affecting the entire timeline. Because hard determinists often support this eternalist view of time, they do not believe that there are genuine chances or possibilities, only the idea that events are 100% likely.

Unlike &quot;law fundamentalists&quot;, some philosophers are &quot;law pluralists&quot;: they question what it means to have a law of physics. One example is the &quot;Best Standards Analysis&quot;, which says that the laws are only useful ways to summarize all past events, rather than there being metaphysically &quot;pushy&quot; entities (this route still brings one into conflict with the idea of free will). Some law pluralists further believe there are simply no laws of physics. The mathematical universe hypothesis suggests that there are other universes in which the laws of physics and fundamental constants are different. Andreas Albrecht of Imperial College in London called it a &quot;provocative&quot; solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t dare&quot; go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that &quot;it&#x27;s actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is.&quot;

The feasibility of testing determinism is always challenged by what is known, or what is thought to be known, about the idea of a final, all-encompassing, theory of everything. Some physicists challenge the likelihood of determinism on the grounds that certain interpretations of quantum mechanics stipulate that the universe is fundamentally indeterministic, such as the Copenhagen interpretation; whereas other interpretations are deterministic, for example, the De Broglie-Bohm theory and the many-worlds interpretation.
Chaos theory describes how a deterministic system can exhibit perplexing behavior that is difficult to predict: as in the butterfly effect, minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences. Yet chaos theory is a wholly deterministic thesis; it merely demonstrates the potential for vastly different consequences from very similar initial conditions. Properly understood, then, it enlightens and reinforces the deterministic claim.

== Implications for ethics ==
Hard determinists reject free will. Critics often suggest that, in so doing, the hard determinist also rejects ethics. The key to this argument rests on the idea that holding a person morally responsible requires them to make a choice between two, or more, truly possible alternatives. If choice is indeed impossible, then it would be incorrect to hold anyone morally responsible for his or her actions. If this argument holds, hard determinists are restricted to moral nihilism.
This feature, however, is tenable only as far as hard determinists discard responsibility. In a necessitarian world, recourse to merit and blameworthiness is toned down while adherence to ethical and legal values is not ruined. Persons may be appreciated as carriers, executors, and defenders of morality. Alternatively, the choice to be regretful of past misdeeds becomes unreasonable. Nevertheless, one can admonish oneself for one&#x27;s lapses and resolve to avoid similar behavior in the future.
Those hard determinists who defend ethical realism would object to the premise that contra-causal free will is necessary for ethics. Those who are also ethically naturalistic may also point out that there are good reasons to punish criminals: it is a chance to modify their behaviour, or their punishment can act as a deterrent for others who would otherwise act in the same manner. The hard determinist could even argue that this understanding of the true and various causes of a psychopath&#x27;s behaviour, for instance, allow them to respond even more reasonably or compassionately.

Hard determinists acknowledge that humans do, in some sense, &quot;choose,&quot; or deliberate—although in a way that obeys natural laws. For example, a hard determinist might see humans as a sort of thinking machines, but believe it is inaccurate to say they &quot;came to a decision&quot; or &quot;chose&quot;.
Generalization of event causation should circumvent overstatement of external impulses. Autotelic personalities show a high rate of activities all by themselves. The capacity to resist psychological assault is impressive evidence of autarkic resources. Determinists even admit that with corresponding knowledge, changes in the genetic depository and consequently behavior are possible.

Up to now, the concepts and terminology of legal affairs follow the pre-reflexive belief in alternative possibilities. As scientific insight advances, the juridical attitude becomes increasingly &quot;external&quot;: there should be fewer emotions about offender&#x27;s will and more concern about the effects of offenses on society. The retributive function of punishment should be rejected as irrational and unjustified. &quot;Lex talionis&quot; is discarded already because of deficient correlation between crime and penalty. If the inveterate notion of &quot;mens rea&quot; is used at all, then only to distinguish intentional actions from inadvertent ones and not to designate an autonomous undertaking of the lawbreaker. At the same time, it is justified to require the perpetrator to critically reconsider his intentions and character, to demand apology and compensation in victims&#x27; favor. The rehabilitation service should be used to train the risky circle for keeping the norms of social life.

== Psychological effects of belief in hard determinism ==
Research on the psychological effects of a belief in hard determinism, including attitudes towards causal determinism, is ongoing and presents mixed results. While some studies suggest that certain perspectives on free will and determinism can influence moral decision-making, the direct impact of such beliefs on specific behaviors, such as aggressiveness, compliance, or helpfulness, remains a complex and open area of study. The relationship between these philosophical beliefs and changes in self-assessment or behavior is not yet fully understood and requires further empirical investigation.

William James was an American pragmatist philosopher who coined the terms &quot;soft determinist&quot; and &quot;hard determinist&quot; in an influential essay titled &quot;The Dilemma of Determinism&quot;. He argued against determinism, holding that the important issue is not personal responsibility, but hope. He believed that thorough-going determinism leads either to a bleak pessimism or to a degenerate subjectivism in moral judgment. He proposed the way to escape the dilemma is to allow a role for chance. James was careful to explain that he would rather &quot;debate about objects than words&quot;, which indicates he did not insist on saying that replacing determinism with a model including chance had to mean we had &quot;free will.&quot;

The determinist would counter-argue that there is still reason for hope. Whether or not the universe is determined does not change the fact that the future is unknown, and might very well always be. From a naturalist point of view, a person&#x27;s actions still play a role in the shape of that future. Founder and director of the Center of Naturalism, Thomas W. Clark, explains that humans are not merely the playthings of patterned, natural forces in the universe—but rather we are ourselves examples of those forces.
The deterministic view aligns our representations with the faculties and possibilities we actually possess but it should avoid misleading introspection. Admitting agents&#x27; dependence on a drastic background can enhance insight, moderate severity and spare unproductive suffering. Insofar as the mind comprehends universal necessity, the power of emotions is diminished.

<text>An afterimage, or after-image, is an image that continues to appear in the eyes after a period of exposure to the original image. An afterimage may be a normal phenomenon (physiological afterimage) or may be pathological (palinopsia). Illusory palinopsia may be a pathological exaggeration of physiological afterimages. Afterimages occur because photochemical activity in the retina continues even when the eyes are no longer experiencing the original stimulus.

The remainder of this article refers to physiological afterimages. A common physiological afterimage is the dim area that seems to float before one&#x27;s eyes after briefly looking into a light source, such as a camera flash. Palinopsia is a common symptom of visual snow.

==Negative afterimages==
Negative afterimages are generated in the retina but may be modified like other retinal signals by neural adaptation of the retinal ganglion cells that carry signals from the retina of the eye to the rest of the brain.

Normally, any image is moved over the retina by small eye movements known as microsaccades before much adaptation can occur. However, if the image is very intense and brief, or if the image is large, or if the eye remains very steady, these small movements cannot keep the image on unadapted parts of the retina.

Afterimages can be seen when moving from a bright environment to a dim one, like walking indoors on a bright snowy day. They are accompanied by neural adaptation in the occipital lobe of the brain that function similar to color balance adjustments in photography. These adaptations attempt to keep vision consistent in dynamic lighting. Viewing a uniform background while adaptation is still occurring will allow an individual to see the afterimage because localized areas of vision are still being processed by the brain using adaptations that are no longer needed.

The Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory of color vision postulated that there were three types of photoreceptors in the eye, each sensitive to a particular range of visible light: short-wavelength cones, medium-wavelength cones, and long-wavelength cones. Trichromatic theory, however, cannot explain all afterimage phenomena. Specifically, afterimages are the complementary hue of the adapting stimulus, and trichromatic theory fails to account for this fact.

The failure of trichromatic theory to account for afterimages indicates the need for an opponent-process theory such as that articulated by Ewald Hering (1878) and further developed by Hurvich and Jameson (1957). The opponent process theory states that the human visual system interprets color information by processing signals from cones and rods in an antagonistic manner. The opponent color theory is that there are four opponent channels: red versus cyan, green vs magenta, blue versus yellow, and black versus white. Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those of the other color. Therefore, a green image will produce a magenta afterimage. The green color adapts the green channel, so they produce a weaker signal. Anything resulting in less green is interpreted as its paired primary color, which is magenta (an equal mixture of red and blue).

==Positive afterimages==
Positive afterimages, by contrast, appear the same color as the original image. They are often very brief, lasting less than half a second. The cause of positive afterimages is not well known, but possibly reflects persisting activity in the brain when the retinal photoreceptor cells continue to send neural impulses to the occipital lobe.

A stimulus which elicits a positive image will usually trigger a negative afterimage quickly via the adaptation process. To experience this phenomenon, one can look at a bright source of light and then look away to a dark area, such as by closing the eyes. At first one should see a fading positive afterimage, likely followed by a negative afterimage that may last for much longer. It is also possible to see afterimages of random objects that are not bright, only these last for a split second and go unnoticed by most people. 

==On empty shape==
An afterimage in general is an optical illusion that refers to an image continuing to appear after exposure to the original image has ceased. Prolonged viewing of the colored patch induces an afterimage of the complementary color (for example, yellow color induces a bluish afterimage). The &quot;afterimage on empty shape&quot; effect is related to a class of effects referred to as contrast effects.

In this effect, an empty (white) shape is presented on a colored background for several seconds. When the background color disappears (becomes white), an illusionary color similar to the original background is perceived within the shape. The mechanism of the effect is still unclear, and may be produced by one or two of the following mechanisms:

*During the presentation of the empty shape on a colored background, the colored background induces an illusory complementary color (&quot;induced color&quot;) inside the empty shape. After the disappearance of the colored background an afterimage of the &quot;induced color&quot; might appear inside the &quot;empty shape&quot;. Thus, the expected color of the shape will be complementary to the &quot;induced color&quot;, and therefore similar to the color of the original background.
*After the disappearance of the colored background, an afterimage of the background is induced. This induced color has a complementary color to that of the original background. It is possible that this background afterimage induces simultaneous contrast on the &quot;empty shape&quot;. Simultaneous contrast is a psychophysical phenomenon of the change in the appearance of a color (or an achromatic stimulus) caused by the presence of a surrounding average color (or luminance).

<doc id="495154" wikidata="Q7499826" url="?curid=495154" title="Shock (musical)">
<text>is a series of musical works starring Koichi Domoto (from the duo KinKi Kids), who is also in charge of the planning, music, story, and production under Johnny Kitagawa’s direction. &quot;Shock&quot; was originally based on the musical &quot;1991 Playzone &#x27;91 Shock&quot; (1991, starring Shonentai), and premiered at the Imperial Theater in November 2000 under the title &quot;Millenium Shock&quot;. It has been performed at the same theater every year since, with different modifications in the title, cast, plot and programs each year. In 2005, it was revamped entirely as &quot;Endless Shock&quot;, which has been its title until now. &quot;Shock&quot;&#x27;s annual performances are greatly anticipated, and it is dubbed “the stage of which tickets are the hardest to get in Japan” by the media.

&quot;Shock&quot; reached its 400th performance in 2006, and its 499th performance in 2007, attracting more than 80,000 audiences up until that point. &quot;Shock&quot; is the solo-starring stage play to achieve this feat in the shortest time at the Imperial Theater.

April 2008, &quot;Endless Shock&quot; received the Grand Prize Award at the 33rd &quot;Kikuta Kazuo Theater Award&quot; for high achievements in stage performance. This was the first time a musical starring an idol from Johnny &amp; Associates won such an honor.

March 2009, Koichi Domoto set a new record for the highest number of solo-starring musical performances at the Imperial Theater.

March 21, 2013, 12 years 5 months after its premiere, &quot;Shock&quot; reached its 1,000th performance, became the solo-starring musical play to achieve this in the shortest time in Japan.

In April 2020, Koichi Domoto alone was awarded the Grand Prize of the 45th Kazuo Kikuta Theater Awards for his achievement for leading &quot;Shock&quot; series for twenty years, becoming the youngest single winner of this award.

Until 2021, &quot;Shock&quot; has been performed for more than 1,800 times, becoming the 2nd most-performed musical with the same leading actor in Japan, after Mitsuko Mori&#x27;s &quot;Hourouki&quot; (performed 2,017 times).

==Overview==
&quot;Shock&quot; is about the conflicts happening in a theater company, interspersed with the shows performed by said company - a &quot;play within a play&quot;. The series focuses on the theme &quot;Show must go on&quot; with Koichi, the company&#x27;s leader as the protagonist. Through his collaborations, conflicts, and reconciliations with the company members, the musical portrays a &quot;stage of life&quot; where even life is sacrificed for the ultimate performances. Koichi Domoto said “I&#x27;m completely different from Koichi”, but they both share an unyielding, uncompromising attitude to the stage, even when facing injuries or accidents. Koichi Domoto himself also stated that he was able to cultivate such mindset thanks to continuously performing this play.

The play has a diverse combination of famous musical numbers and original songs in various style, from New York Broadway to traditional Japanese. Aside from difficult choreographies, &quot;Shock&quot; also includes numerous flashy, dangerous acts such as flying, falling down an 8-metre high staircase... , and is said to be able to “surprise the audience every 5 minutes”.

Under Johnny Kitagawa&#x27;s production, &quot;Shock&quot; was originally intended to be a play that can impress the audiences even if they don&#x27;t understand the speech. However, as an actor, Koichi Domoto wanted the stage to convey deeper meaning, and asked Kitagawa to make thorough changes, including the plot. With Kitagawa&#x27;s approval (“Just do what you like.”), Koichi started taking a substantial role in screenwriting, music composing and producing since 2005.

After &quot;Endless Shock&quot; 2006, there were plans to end the &quot;Shock&quot; series and start a new play in 2007, also with Koichi Domoto as the producer and lead actor. However, due to high demand (demand for tickets was 14 times higher than supply), it was decided that the play would be performed again in 2007. Shock continues to be performed every year since, and is said to be “the stage of which tickets are the hardest to get in Japan”.

During the noon performance on January 23, 2008, due to electricity failure, the play was cancelled and moved to another date (February 17, 2008) for the first time. Koichi Domoto deeply regretted this, and wrote on the official site: &quot;It is truly regrettable that the performance couldn&#x27;t continue like the theme &#x27;Show must go on&#x27;. To the audiences who was looking forward to the stage, I sincerely apologize.&quot; After the cancellation decision was made, all the cast came out to see the audiences off to the last one. The night performance that day still went on as scheduled.

March 11, 2011, the Great Tohoku earthquake occurred during the noon performance&#x27;s intermission. The audiences and some of the cast were evacuated to Koukyogaien, and the performance - incidentally, also Shock&#x27;s 800th performance - was cancelled. Due to aftershocks and planned power outage, performances could not resume as planned, and the rest of the performances that year were also cancelled. Cancellation announcement was made before the performance on the 13th by Koichi Domoto himself. He then shook hand with and saw all the audiences off.

During the noon performance on March 19, 2015, a LED panel used in stage setting collapsed, injured 6 people: trainees Takayoshi Kishi, 2 dancers, 2 acrobat actors, and 1 staff member. The two performances that day were cancelled, and Koichi Domoto came out in full stage costume to apologize to the audiences for the accident and the cancellation. Performance restarted the next day without the use of LED panel and part of the program changed. There were mixed opinions about restarting performances so soon after such a serious accident, but the decision was made with support from the cast and staff, even the injured ones, to convey the theme of the play: continue to move forward despite unfavorable circumstances. May 20, 2015, Toho announced that the accident was caused by an inclination due to partial failure of the stage floor, and that reinforcement work was planned to correct this. Toho also officially prohibit future use of mobile LED panels on its stage for caution&#x27;s sake.

On September 17 of the same year, during the Osaka tour, the actress who played the owner role, Bibari Maeda, fell and broke her left shoulder while walking to Umeda Arts Theatre from her hotel. She still acted in two performances on the 17th, but was hospitalized after the night performance and was told to rest for 1.5 month for the break to heal. Katsuhide Uekusa from Shonentai, who played the owner during 2009 - 2012, stepped in for Maeda from the performance on the 18th until the last one in 2015. Uekusa received direct appeal from Johnny Kitagawa and Koichi Domoto on the evening of the 17th, arrived in Osaka around noon on the 18th, and only had 4 hours to practice with all the cast. Nevertheless, the performances went on smoothly as usual.

In April 2020, Koichi alone was awarded the Grand Prize of the 45th Kazuo Kikuta Theater Awards for his achievement for leading &quot;Shock&quot; series for twenty years, becoming the youngest single winner of this award.

In 2021, &quot;Endless Shock&quot; was made into a movie.

It was announced that the &quot;Shock&quot; series starring Koichi would end after the 2024 performance. The reasons given were that the Imperial Theatre will be closed for reconstruction in February 2025, and since Koichi created it around the age of 25 and the age setting was about the same, he thought that 2024, when he would be 45, would be a good time.

On April 22, 2024, the play reached 2000 performances and on May 9, 2018. It broke the record of 2017 times that Mitsuko Mori had accumulated between 1961 and 2009 with &quot;Hourouki&quot; and also became the single largest single starring role record in a domestic play.

<doc id="495163" wikidata="Q1149531" url="?curid=495163" title="Bonnet (headgear)">
<text>Bonnet has been used as the name for a wide variety of headgear for females-from the Middle Ages to the present. As with &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;cap&quot;, it is impossible to generalize as to the styles for which the word has been used, but there is for both sexes a tendency to use the word for styles in soft material and lacking a brim, or at least one all the way round, rather than just at the front. Yet the term has also been used, for example, for steel helmets. This was from Scotland (in 1505), where the term has long been especially popular.

Headgear tied under the chin with a string was especially likely to be called a bonnet. Other features associated with bonnets as opposed to hats was that the forehead was not covered, and the back of the head often was. The outdoor headgear of female servants and workers was more likely to be called a bonnet. It was often worn outside over a thinner everyday head covering, which was worn at all times. Hats were often stiffer, worn on the top of the head with the crown and brim roughly horizontal, while bonnets were pushed back, covering the back of the head, with any brim often approaching the vertical at the front. Other types of bonnet might otherwise be called &quot;caps&quot;, for example the Scottish blue bonnet worn by working-class men and women, a kind of large floppy beret.

&quot;Bonnet&quot; derives from the same word in French, where it originally indicated a type of material. From the 18th century bonnet forms of headgear, previously mostly worn by elite women in informal contexts at home (as well as more generally by working women), became adopted by high fashion, and until at least the late 19th century, bonnet was the dominant term used for female hats. In the 21st century, only a few specialized kinds of headgear are still called bonnets, most commonly those worn by babies and the feather bonnets of Scottish Highland regiments, as well as perhaps the war bonnets of North American Plains Indians. In addition, types of headgear called bonnets are worn by women as an outer Christian headcovering in some denominations such as the Amish, Mennonite and Brethren churches among the Anabaptist branch of Christianity, and with Conservative Quakers, mainly in the Americas.

==Women==

Until the late 19th century &quot;bonnet&quot; seems to have been the preferred term for most types of hats worn by women, while &quot;hat&quot; was more reserved for male headgear, and female styles that resembled them, typically either in much smaller versions perched on top of the head, or versions with very wide brims all the way round. In the mid-17th and 18th century &quot;house bonnets&quot; worn by women and girls were generally brimless headcoverings which were secured by tying under the chin, and which covered no part of the forehead. They were worn both indoors and outdoors, to keep the hair tidy, to keep dust or flour out of the hair while working, and in accordance with the Christian Bible passage 1 Corinthians 11. With society hairstyles becoming increasingly elaborate after 1770, the &quot;calash&quot; was worn outdoors to protect hair from wind and weather: a hood of silk stiffened with whalebone or arched cane battens, collapsible like a fan or the calash top of a carriage, they were fitted with ribbons to allow them to be held secure in a gale.

From Waterloo, increasingly structured and fashionable bonnets made by milliners grew larger and less functional among the upper classes. A plate in &quot;La Belle Assemblée&quot; 1817 showed a
This was specified as a &quot;carriage dress&quot;, with the understanding that when &quot;taking the air&quot; in an open carriage, the bonnet provided some privacy—such a bonnet was called an &quot;invisible&quot; in Paris—and prevent wind-chapping, with its connotations of countrified &quot;rude&quot; health. Straw was available again after 1815: the best straw bonnets came from Leghorn. As a bonnet developed a peak, it would extend from the entire front of the bonnet, from the chin over the forehead and down the other side of the face. Some styles of bonnets between ca 1817 and 1845 had a large peak which effectively prevented women from looking right or left without turning their heads: a &quot;coal-scuttle&quot; or &quot;poke&quot; bonnet. Others had a wide peak which was angled out to frame the face. In the 1840s it might be crimped at the top to frame the face in a heart shape. As the bonnet became more complicated, under it might be worn a lace &quot;cornette&quot; to hold the hair in place.

The lack of a clear distinction between hats and bonnets can be seen in these extracts from &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 1874: (On &quot;Paris Fashions&quot;, by Emmeline Raymond, 11 April) &quot;There is no change in bonnets. So long as the hair is piled on top of the head, the little device which takes the place of a dress cap must remain as it is. The brims are generally flattened at the sides, swelling above the front, and turned up behind in order to make room for the hair, which would not find room whereon to lodge if the precaution were not taken, here and there, to punch out what is called a brim of what is called a bonnet. It is said, however, that straw hats of the Pamela shape are in preparation, that is, turned up behind, but shading the forehead. It would be so very sensible to wear a bonnet that would protect the face from the sun that I give this news with due caution. For my part, I can not believe it, as little of practical, functional purpose remains in bonnet design.&quot; A week before, (&quot;New York Fashions&quot;, 4 April): &quot;Strings are now seldom seen, and this does away with the last distinguishing feature between bonnets and round hats; the same head-covering now serves for each, as it is a bonnet when worn far back on the head, and a hat when tilted forward.&quot;

Bonnets remained one of the most common types of headgear worn by women throughout most of the 19th century. Especially for a widow, a bonnet was &quot;de rigueur&quot;. Silk bonnets, elaborately pleated and ruched, were worn outdoors, or in public places like shops, galleries, churches, and during visits to acquaintances. Women would cover their heads with caps simply to keep their hair from getting dirty and perhaps out of modesty, as informed by Christian religious norms. In addition, women in wedlock would wear caps and bonnets during the day, to further demonstrate their status as married women. 
Under the French Second Empire, parasols took the place of headgear for protection from sun, and bonnets became smaller and smaller, until they could only be held on the head with hatpins. As hats came back into style, bonnets were increasingly worn by women who wanted to appear modest in public, with the result that bonnets accumulated connotations of dowager wear and were dropped from fashion, except out on the prairies or country wear.
Most middle-class women in the 19th century would have had at least two bonnets, one suitable for summer weather, often made from straw, and one made from heavier fabric for winter wear. This is where the tradition of an Easter bonnet originated, when women would switch from their winter bonnet to their summer bonnet. Wealthier women would have many bonnets, suitable for different occasions.

Women of some religious groups have continued to wear bonnets for worship or everyday clothing. This is especially the case among Anabaptist Christianity (Old Order Mennonites, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren, Amish) and other plain people, such as plain-dressing Conservative Friends (Quakers). Bonnets were adopted by the Salvation Army based on 1 Corinthians 11, as part of uniform for women. Initially, Salvation Army bonnets were introduced as symbolic and representative protection for women and were reinforced with black tar to turn them into physical helmets to protect against the projectiles thrown by pagans. Later versions were smaller when there was no longer any need for protection. The bonnet has now been replaced with a bowler hat.

In France, single women wore elaborate yellow and green bonnets to honor St. Catherine&#x27;s Day on November 25. The French expression &quot;coiffer Sainte-Catherine&quot; (&#x27;don St. Catherine&#x27;s bonnet&#x27;), an idiom that describes an unmarried woman of 25 years or older, derives from this custom.

Slave women shipped from Africa, who traditionally wore African head dress in their native countries, were given European styles of bonnets. Slaves working household tasks they were often given bonnets of a traditional European maid style, while slaves in the field wore hand-tied sunbonnets. These head bonnets were preferred by the masters for hygiene, while also offering protection from the sun.

==Men==
The word &quot;bonnet&quot; for male headgear was generally replaced in English by cap before 1700, except in Scotland, where &quot;bonnet&quot; and the Scots language version &quot;bunnet&quot; remained in use, originally for the widely worn blue bonnet, and now especially for military headgear, like the feather bonnet (not to be confused with those worn by Native Americans, for which &quot;bonnet&quot; was also used), Glengarry, Kilmarnock and Balmoral. The Tudor bonnet remains a term for a component of the academic regalia of some universities, and is not unlike the common male bonnet of the 16th century.

&quot;Bonnet&quot; is also the term for the puffy velvet fabric inside the coronet of some male ranks of nobility, and &quot;the affair of the bonnets&quot; was a furious controversy in the France of Louis XIV over the mutual courtesies due between the magistrates of the Parliament de Paris and the Dukes of France.

The Scotch bonnet pepper was named for its resemblance to a bonnet worn by men in Scotland in the past, as it had a pom pom at the top which indicates the difference form the men&#x27;s bonnet and women&#x27;s bonnet.

==Babies==

The most common kind of bonnet worn today is a soft headcovering for babies. Its shape is similar to that of some kinds of bonnets that women used to wear: it covers the hair and ears, but not the forehead. While a bonnet may be a fashion choice by caregivers for a baby&#x27;s headgear, it may also be used for sun protection, since an infant&#x27;s skin is more vulnerable to sunburn than an adult&#x27;s.

==Modern times==
Modern bonnets are often made of silk or satin to preserve one’s hairstyle while asleep or lying down. They maintain a similar shape to bonnets that were popular in the 1960s. But it is more likely that these styles of headdress originated from the use of shower caps due to their appearance and application in salons.

It can also be worn with French maid costumes.

Bonnets are also used in alternative fashion communities such as lolita fashion.

<doc id="495166" wikidata="Q2079507" url="?curid=495166" title="Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle">
<text>Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle (28 May 1748 – 4 September 1825) was a British statesman, diplomat and author.

==Life==

He was the son of Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle and his second wife Isabella Byron. His mother was a daughter of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and his wife Frances Berkeley, a descendant of John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. She was also a sister of William Byron, 5th Baron Byron and a great-aunt of George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, the poet. In 1798, Carlisle was appointed guardian to Lord Byron who later lampooned him in &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;.

During his youth Carlisle was mentored by George Selwyn and was chiefly known as a man of pleasure and fashion. He was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1767, and entered the House of Lords in 1770. After he had reached thirty years of age, his appointment on a Commission sent out by Frederick North, Lord North, to attempt a reconciliation with the Thirteen Colonies during the American War of Independence was received with sneers by the opposition. The failure of the embassy was not due to any incapacity on the part of the earl, but to the unpopularity of the government from which it received its authority. He was considered to have displayed so much ability that he was entrusted with the viceroyalty of Ireland in 1780.

The time was one of the greatest difficulty; for while the calm of the country was disturbed by the American War of Independence, it was drained of regular troops, and large bands of volunteers not under the control of the government had been formed. Nevertheless, the two years of Carlisle&#x27;s rule passed in quietness and prosperity, and the institution of a national bank and other measures which he effected left permanently beneficial results upon the commerce of the island. In 1789, in the discussions as to the regency, Carlisle took a prominent part on the side of the prince of Wales.

In 1791 he opposed William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s policy of resistance to the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empire; but on the outbreak of the French Revolution he left the opposition and vigorously maintained the cause of war. He resigned from the Order of the Thistle and was created a Knight of the Garter in 1793. In 1815 he opposed the enactment of the Corn Laws; but from this time till his death, he took no important part in public life.

In 1798 he was one of the syndicate who bought the Orleans Collection of paintings, which were housed in Castle Howard.

==Family==
On 22 March 1770, Frederick married Lady Margaret Caroline Leveson-Gower (died 27 January 1824), daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford and his wife, Lady Louisa Egerton, herself the daughter of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater.

They had ten children:
*Lady Isabella Caroline Howard (1771–1848), who married John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor, on 27 July 1789 and had issue
*George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle (17 September 1773–1848), who married and had issue
*Lady Charlotte Howard (15 November 1774–1774)
*Lady Susan Maria Howard (26 February 1776–1783)
*Lady Louisa Howard (27 March 1778–1781)
*Lady Elizabeth Howard (13 November 1780 – 29 November 1825), who married John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, on 22 April 1799 and had issue
*William Howard (1781–1843), Member of Parliament
*Lady Gertrude Howard (1783–1870), who married William Sloane-Stanley on 23 June 1806 and had issue
*Maj. Frederick Howard (6 December 1785 – 18 June 1815), killed in action at Waterloo, who married Frances Susan Lambton and had two sons, including Frederick John Howard
*Henry Edward John Howard (1795–1868), who married and had issue

The 5th Earl was also reputedly the natural father of Howard Staunton (1810–1874), an English chess master regarded as having been the world&#x27;s strongest player from 1843 to 1851, according to information &quot;gleaned&quot; by chess historian H. J. R. Murray from various sources, although record of Staunton&#x27;s birth or baptism has never been found.

Carlisle was the author of some political tracts, a number of poems, and two tragedies:

* &quot;Poems&quot;, London, 1773

<doc id="495170" wikidata="Q850298" url="?curid=495170" title="Hood (headgear)">
<text>A hood is a type of headgear or headwear that covers most of the head and neck, and sometimes the face. It may be either a separate item of dress or part of a piece of clothing that may be pulled up to cover the head. Hoods that cover mainly the sides and top of the head, and leave the face mostly or partly open may be worn for protection from the environment (typically cold weather or rain), for fashion, as a form of traditional dress or uniform, or in the case of knights, an armoured hood is used for protection against bladed weapons. In some cases, hoods are used to prevent the wearer from seeing where they are going (e.g., in cases where a prisoner is hooded). Hoods with eye holes may be used for religious purposes to prevent the wearer from being seen. In the case of Ku Klux Klan members, terrorists, or criminals such as robbers, a hood with eye holes helps prevent identification.

==Etymology==

The word traces back to Old English &quot;hod&quot; &quot;hood,&quot; from Proto-Germanic *&quot;hodaz&quot; (cf. Old Saxon, Old Frisian &quot;hod&quot; &quot;hood,&quot; Middle Dutch &quot;hoet&quot;, Dutch &quot;hoed&quot; &quot;hat,&quot; Old High German &quot;huot&quot; &quot;helmet, hat, Gugel&quot;, German &quot;Hut&quot; &quot;hat,&quot; Old Frisian &quot;hode&quot; &quot;guard, protection&quot;), from PIE *&quot;kadh&quot;- &quot;cover&quot;. The modern spelling was developed in the 15th century to indicate a &quot;long&quot; vowel which is no longer pronounced as such. 
==History and description==
Historically, hoods were either similar to modern hoods, often forming part of a cloak or cape, or a separate form of headgear. Hoods with short capes, called chaperons in French, were extremely common in medieval Europe, and later evolved into big hats. Soft hoods were worn by men under hats. Hoods have also been used as part of uniforms for organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.

A hood to hide or control the wearer often covers the whole head, with the result that the wearer can see little or nothing, like a blindfold, or it can be to prevent identification of the wearer. It may be used on or by a person who has been arrested or kidnapped, or about to suffer judicial execution; this practice is known as hooding. The hood may be simply a bag; it may be intended to be, and/or experienced as, humiliating (see hood event).

Traditional women&#x27;s hoods varied from close-fitting, soft headgear (e.g. snood) to stiffened, structured hoods (e.g. gable hood) or very large coverings made of material over a frame which fashionable women wore over towering wigs or hairstyles to protect them from the elements (e.g. calash).

Today, fashion hoods are generally soft headcoverings which form part of a larger garment (e.g. an overcoat, shirt or cloak; an exception is a rain hood which is not part of a larger garment). They can be pulled up over the head when needed, or left to hang down the back when not. They may also be detachable to turn a winter overcoat into a summer one, or may be designed to be folded or rolled into a small pocket in the neck of the garment when not in use. A familiar type of soft and smooth fashion hood is the visored bubble rainhood, which consists of a 3-sectioned bucket-style bubble hood with its 2 side sections extending frontwards towards the front center of the neck. The distinguishing feature is a curvy, wavy swerve U-bowl shaped duckbill pouf visor, which serves as a shield to guard the eyes, so that rain water or snow does not get in contact with the face. The rainhood visor is sometimes flipped slightly upwards, or cupped upwards into a pouf; the outermost swoop curve may then dip downwards towards the wearer’s eyes for added protection. Small clips are affixed to the sides along the hood next to the visor to help it keep its pouffed shape.

==Types==
The Inuit peoples of the Arctic are expert clothing manufacturers, and the women&#x27;s anorak, technically called an &quot;amauti&quot;, features a large hood used to shelter an infant on its mother&#x27;s back.

In Japan hoods covered with chainmail or armour plates were worn by samurai warriors and their retainers.

Scuba divers who dive in cold water often wear neoprene wetsuit hoods for thermal insulation or watertight latex rubber drysuit hoods to prevent water ingress. They cover the whole head and neck except the face.

===Academic dress===

An &quot;academic hood&quot; is a component of academic dress that is an often bright and decorative garment worn over a gown and used only at graduations or on other special occasions. The shape of hoods of universities and colleges in the UK and in many Commonwealth countries have been derived from those prescribed at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Oxford bachelors and masters use a &#x27;simple&#x27; (or &#x27;Burgon&#x27; shape) consisting of hood with a cowl (headcovering) but without a cape, whereas the University of Cambridge uses a &#x27;full&#x27; shape, with both cowl and square cape and substantial liripipe for all hoods. Other English universities use one of these patterns or adapt them; for example, the University of London uses the full Cambridge shape but with rounded corners to the cape. Newer universities, such as the University of Kent use a hood with triangular cape but with no cowl, and with a distinctive V-shaped segment denoting the faculty. The hoods of the University of Aberdeen have a rounded flat cape but no cowl.

The pattern of hoods in the US largely follow an intercollegiate code. The length of the hood and the width of its velvet trim indicate the academic achievement level of the wearer; the color of the trim indicates the discipline/field in which the degree is held; and the lining of hoods in academic dress represents the particular institution from which the degree was earned.

<text>Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle (162824 February 1685) was an English military leader and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1653 and 1660 and was created Earl of Carlisle in 1661.

==Biography==
Howard was the son and heir of Sir William Howard of Naworth in Cumberland, by Mary, daughter of William Eure, 4th Baron Eure and great-grandson of Lord William Howard, &quot;Belted Will&quot; (1563–1640), the third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. In 1645 he conformed to the Church of England and supported the government of the Commonwealth, being appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1650. He bought Carlisle Castle and became governor of the town. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Worcester on Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s side and made a member of the council of state in 1653, chosen captain of the protector&#x27;s bodyguard and selected to carry out various public duties. In 1653 he was nominated as Member of Parliament for the Four Northern Counties in the Barebones Parliament. He was elected MP for Cumberland in 1654.

In 1655 Howard was given a regiment, was appointed a commissioner to try the northern rebels, and a deputy major-general of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland. He was re-elected MP for Cumberland in 1656. In 1657 he was included in Cromwell&#x27;s House of Lords and voted for the protector&#x27;s assumption of the royal title the same year. In 1659 he urged Richard Cromwell to defend his government by force against the army leaders, but his advice being refused he used his influence in favour of a restoration of the monarchy, and after Richard&#x27;s fall he was imprisoned. In April 1660 he sat again in parliament for Cumberland, and at the Restoration was made custos rotulorum and Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland and Lord Lieutenant of Westmorland.

On 20 April 1661 Howard was created Baron Dacre of Gillesland, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Earl of Carlisle; the same year he was made Vice-Admiral of Northumberland, Cumberland and Durham, and in 1662 joint commissioner for the office of Earl Marshal. In 1663 he was appointed ambassador to Russia, Sweden and Denmark, and in 1668 he carried the Garter to Charles XI of Sweden.

In 1667 Howard was made lieutenant-general of the forces and joint commander-in-chief of the four northernmost counties. In 1672 he became one of the commissioners for the office of Lord Lieutenant of Durham, and in 1673 deputy earl marshal. He commanded a regiment in the fresh-raised Blackheath Army of 1673, which was intended to see action against the Dutch. Following the Treaty of Westminster the regiment was disbanded.

In 1678 he was appointed governor of Jamaica, but his instructions to introduce Poynings&#x27; Law to the island were successfully opposed by planters elected to the Jamaican Assembly. Calling the elected members &quot;fools, asses, beggars and cowards&quot;, the governor arrested their leaders, William Beeston (governor) and Samuel Long, father of Jamaican planter-historian Edward Long. However, when they were deported back to England, Beeston and Long successfully argued their case, and the governor&#x27;s instructions were cancelled. He was reappointed governor of Carlisle. He died in 1685, and was buried in York Minster.

==Family==
He married Anne (died 1696), daughter of Edward Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Escrick and great-granddaughter of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by whom he had six children:
*Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle (c. 1646–1692)
*Lady Katherine Howard (29 July 1662March 1682)
*Frederick Christian Howard (5 November 1664October 1684), killed at the Siege of Luxembourg
*Charles Howard (5 September 16683 April 1670)
*Lady Mary Howard (died 27 October 1708), married Sir John Fenwick, 3rd Baronet
*Lady Anne Howard, married Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston

Colonel Thomas Howard (died 1678), notorious for the 1662 duel where he left Henry Jermyn, 1st Baron Dover for dead (they were rivals for the affections of Anna Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury), was his younger brother. He was pardoned and soon afterwards married as her third husband Mary Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.

<text>George William Frederick Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle (18 April 1802– 5 December 1864), styled Viscount Morpeth from 1825 to 1848, was a British statesman, orator, and writer.
==Life==
Carlisle was born in Westminster, London, the eldest son of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle by his wife Lady Georgiana Cavendish, eldest daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. Lord Lanerton and Charles Howard were his younger brothers. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he earned a reputation as a scholar and writer of graceful verse, obtaining in 1821 both the chancellor&#x27;s and the Newdigate prizes for a Latin poem, &quot;Paestum&quot;, and an English one. He maintained his interest in poetry throughout his life, exchanging sonnets with William Wordsworth. In 1826 he accompanied his maternal uncle, the Duke of Devonshire, to the Russian Empire, to attend the coronation of Tsar Nicholas I, and became a great favourite in society at St Petersburg.

At the general election in 1826 Carlisle was returned to parliament as member for the family borough of Morpeth (in Northumberland), a seat he held until 1830, and then represented Yorkshire until 1832 and the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1832 to 1841 and from 1846 to 1848. The latter year he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords.

Carlisle served under Lord Melbourne as Chief Secretary for Ireland between 1835 and 1841, under Lord John Russell as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests from 1846 to 1850 and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1850 to 1852 and under Lord Palmerston as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1855 to 1858 and again from 1859 to 1864. In 1835 he was appointed to the Privy Councils of the United Kingdom and Ireland. He served as a Lord in Waiting to the Queen&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of Kent at the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. 
On 2 April 1853, he was given the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh, and in 1855, he was made a Knight of the Garter.

In the six weeks after he stepped down as Chief Secretary of Ireland in 1841, the signatures of 160,000 men and women who appreciated his service were gathered on 652 sheets of paper and stuck together, creating the Morpeth Roll, a continuous roll measuring 420 metres. 

Lord Carlisle died unmarried at Castle Howard in December 1864, aged 62, and was buried in the family mausoleum. He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, Reverend William George Howard.

==Legacy==
On Bulmer Hill, about a mile from Bulmer village in North Yorkshire, is the Carlisle Memorial Column, erected by public subscription to his memory in 1869–70. It is inscribed:
Statues of him by the Irish sculptor John Henry Foley were also erected in Phoenix Park, Dublin, and in Brampton, Carlisle in Cumbria, both in 1870. The statue in Brampton stands on Brampton motte and depicts him in the robes of a Knight of the Garter. The statue in Phoenix Park stood in the Peoples&#x27; Garden until 1956, when it was blown off its plinth in an explosion, and subsequently removed to Castle Howard in Yorkshire. The plinth it once stood on remains in place.

<text>Boniface Alexandre (; 31 July 1936 – 4 August 2023) was a Haitian politician. Alexandre served as the provisional president of Haiti following the 2004 coup d&#x27;état that removed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from office. He served until May 2006.

==Biography==
Alexandre was raised by his uncle, Martial Célestin, Haiti&#x27;s first prime minister. Trained as a lawyer, he worked for a law firm in Port-au-Prince for 25 years before being appointed to the Supreme Court in 1992. Aristide appointed him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 2002.

Alexandre, as the Chief Justice and therefore next in the presidential line of succession, assumed the office of president after the coup. During Alexandre&#x27;s acting presidency, Amnesty International reported &quot;excessive use of force by police officers&quot;, extrajudicial executions, a lack of investigations into these, escalation of &quot;unlawful killings and kidnappings by illegal armed groups&quot;, failure of officials to prevent and punish violence against women, dysfunctionality of the justice system, and forty or more people imprisoned without charge or trial.

Alexandre left office on 14 May 2006, when René Préval, winner of the February 2006 presidential election, was sworn in as president. 

Boniface Alexandre died at his home in Port-au-Prince, on 4 August 2023, four days after his 87th birthday.

<doc id="495185" wikidata="Q7988482" url="?curid=495185" title="Western esotericism">
<text>Western esotericism, also known as Western mystery tradition, is a term scholars use to classify a wide range of loosely related ideas and movements that developed within Western society. These ideas and currents are united since they are largely distinct both from orthodox Judeo-Christian religion and Age of Enlightenment rationalism. It has influenced, or contributed to, various forms of Western philosophy, mysticism, religion, science, pseudoscience, art, literature, and music.

The idea of grouping a wide range of Western traditions and philosophies together under the term &quot;esotericism&quot; developed in 17th-century Europe. Various academics have debated numerous definitions of Western esotericism. One view adopts a definition from certain esotericist schools of thought themselves, treating &quot;esotericism&quot; as a perennial hidden inner tradition. A second perspective sees esotericism as a category of movements that embrace an &quot;enchanted&quot; worldview in the face of increasing disenchantment. A third views Western esotericism as encompassing all of Western culture&#x27;s &quot;rejected knowledge&quot; that is accepted neither by the scientific establishment nor orthodox religious authorities.

The earliest traditions of Western esotericism emerged in the Eastern Mediterranean during Late Antiquity, where Hermeticism, Gnosticism and Neoplatonism developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity. Renaissance Europe saw increasing interest in many of these older ideas, with various intellectuals combining pagan philosophies with the Kabbalah and Christian philosophy, resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like Christian Kabbalah and Christian theosophy. The 17th century saw the development of initiatory societies professing esoteric knowledge such as Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, while the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century led to the development of new forms of esoteric thought. The 19th century saw the emergence of new trends of esoteric thought now known as occultism. Significant groups in this century included the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Also important in this connection is Martinus Thomsen&#x27;s &quot;spiritual science&quot;. Modern paganism developed within occultism and includes religious movements such as Wicca. Esoteric ideas permeated the counterculture of the 1960s and later cultural tendencies, which led to the New Age phenomenon in the 1970s.

The idea that these disparate movements could be classified as &quot;Western esotericism&quot; developed in the late 18th century, but these esoteric currents were largely ignored as a subject of academic enquiry. The academic study of Western esotericism only emerged in the late 20th century, pioneered by scholars like Frances Yates and Antoine Faivre.

==Etymology==
The concept of the &quot;esoteric&quot; originated in the 2nd century
with the coining of the Ancient Greek adjective (&quot;belonging to an inner circle&quot;); the earliest known example of the word appeared in a satire authored by Lucian of Samosata ( – after 180).

In the 15th and 16th centuries, differentiations in Latin between &quot;exotericus&quot; and &quot;esotericus&quot; (along with &quot;internus&quot; and &quot;externus&quot;) were common in the scholar discourse on ancient philosophy. The categories of &quot;doctrina vulgaris&quot; and &quot;doctrina arcana&quot; are found among Cambridge Platonists. Perhaps for the first time in English, Thomas Stanley, between 1655 and 1660, would refer to the Pythagorean &quot;exoterick&quot; and &quot;esoterick&quot;. John Toland in 1720 would state that the so-called nowadays &quot;esoteric distinction&quot; was a universal phenomenon, present in both the West and the East. As for the noun &quot;esotericism&quot;, probably the first mention in German of &quot;Esoterismus&quot; appeared in a 1779 work by Johann Georg Hamann, and the use of &quot;Esoterik&quot; in 1790 by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. But the word &quot;esoterisch&quot; had already existed at least since 1731–1736, as found in the works of Johann Jakob Brucker; this author rejected everything that is characterized today as an &quot;esoteric corpus&quot;. In this 18th century context, these terms referred to Pythagoreanism or Neoplatonic theurgy, but the concept was particularly sedimentated by two streams of discourses: speculations about the influences of the Egyptians on ancient philosophy and religion, and their associations with Masonic discourses and other secret societies, who claimed to keep such ancient secrets until the Enlightenment; and the emergence of orientalist academic studies, which since the 17th century identified the presence of mysteries, secrets or esoteric &quot;ancient wisdom&quot; in Persian, Arab, Indian and Far Eastern texts and practices (see also Early Western reception of Eastern esotericism).

The noun &quot;esotericism&quot;, in its French form &quot;ésotérisme&quot;, first appeared in 1828 in the work by Protestant historian of gnosticism Jacques Matter (1791–1864), (3 vols.).
The term &quot;esotericism&quot; thus came into use in the wake of the Age of Enlightenment and of its critique of institutionalised religion, during which alternative religious groups such as the Rosicrucians began to disassociate themselves from the dominant Christianity in Western Europe. During the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars increasingly saw the term &quot;esotericism&quot; as meaning something distinct from Christianity—as a subculture at odds with the Christian mainstream from at least the time of the Renaissance. After being introduced by Jacques Matter in French, the occultist and ceremonial magician Eliphas Lévi (1810–1875) popularized the term in the 1850s. Lévi also introduced the term , a notion that he developed against the background of contemporary socialist and Catholic discourses. &quot;Esotericism&quot; and &quot;occultism&quot; were often employed as synonyms until later scholars distinguished the concepts.

=== Philosophical usage ===
In the context of Ancient Greek philosophy, the terms &quot;esoteric&quot; and &quot;exoteric&quot; were sometimes used by scholars not to denote that there was secrecy, but to distinguish two procedures of research and education: the first reserved for teachings that were developed &quot;within the walls&quot; of the philosophical school, among a circle of thinkers (&quot;eso-&quot; indicating what is unseen, as in the classes internal to the institution), and the second referring to those whose works were disseminated to the public in speeches and published (&quot;exo-&quot;: outside). The initial meaning of this last word is implied when Aristotle coined the term &quot;exoteric speeches&quot; (), perhaps to refer to the speeches he gave outside his school. 

However, Aristotle never employed the term &quot;esoteric&quot; and there is no evidence that he dealt with specialized secrets; there is a dubious report by Aulus Gellius, according to which Aristotle disclosed the exoteric subjects of politics, rhetoric and ethics to the general public in the afternoon, while he reserved the morning for &quot;akroatika&quot; (acroamatics), referring to natural philosophy and logic, taught during a walk with his students. Furthermore, the term &quot;exoteric&quot; for Aristotle could have another meaning, hypothetically referring to an extracosmic reality, &quot;ta exo&quot;, superior to and beyond Heaven, requiring abstraction and logic. This reality stood in contrast to what he called &quot;enkyklioi logoi,&quot; knowledge &quot;from within the circle&quot;, involving the intracosmic physics that surrounds everyday life. There is a report by Strabo and Plutarch, however, which states that the Lyceum&#x27;s school texts were circulated internally, their publication was more controlled than the exoteric ones, and that these &quot;esoteric&quot; texts were rediscovered and compiled only with the efforts of Andronicus of Rhodes.

Plato would have orally transmitted intramural teachings to his disciples, the supposed &quot;esoteric&quot; content of which regarding the First Principles is particularly highlighted by the Tübingen School as distinct from the apparent written teachings conveyed in his books or public lectures. Hegel commented on the analysis of this distinction in the modern hermeneutics of Plato and Aristotle:

To express an external object not much is required, but to communicate an idea a capacity must be present, and this always remains something esoteric, so that there has never been anything purely exoteric about what philosophers say.
In any case, drawing from the tradition of discourses that supposedly revealed a vision of the absolute and truth present in mythology and initiatory rites of mystery religions, Plato and his philosophy began the Western perception of esotericism, to the point that Kocku von Stuckrad stated &quot;esoteric ontology and anthropology would hardly exist without Platonic philosophy.&quot; In his dialogues, he uses expressions that refer to cultic secrecy (for example, , , one of the Ancient Greek expressions referring to the prohibition of revealing a secret, in the context of mysteries). In &quot;Theaetetus&quot; 152c, there is an example of this concealment strategy:

Can it be, then, that Protagoras was a very ingenious person who threw out this obscure utterance for the unwashed like us but reserved the truth as a secret doctrine (ἐν ἀπορρήτῳ τὴν ἀλήθειαν) to be revealed to his disciples?

The Neoplatonists intensified the search for a &quot;hidden truth&quot; under the surface of teachings, myths and texts, developing the hermeneutics and allegorical exegesis of Plato, Homer, Orpheus and others. Plutarch, for example, developed the justification of a theological esotericism, and Numenius wrote &quot;On the Secrets of Plato&quot; (&quot;Peri tôn para Platoni aporrhèta&quot;).

Probably based on the &quot;exôtikos/esôtikos&quot; dichotomy, the Hellenic world developed the classical distinction between exoteric/esoteric, stimulated by criticism from various currents such as the Patristics. According to examples in Lucian, Galen and Clement of Alexandria, at that time it was a common practice among philosophers to keep secret writings and teachings. A parallel secrecy and reserved elite was also found in the contemporary environment of Gnosticism. Later, Iamblichus would present his definition (close to the modern one), as he classified the ancient Pythagoreans as either &quot;exoteric&quot; mathematicians or &quot;esoteric&quot; acousmatics, the latter being those who disseminated enigmatic teachings and hidden allegorical meanings.

==Conceptual development==

The concept of &quot;Western esotericism&quot; represents a modern scholarly construct rather than a pre-existing, self-defined tradition of thought. In the late 17th century, several European Christian thinkers presented the argument that one could categorise certain traditions of Western philosophy and thought together, thus establishing the category now labelled &quot;Western esotericism&quot;. The first to do so, (1659–1698), a German Lutheran theologian, wrote &quot;Platonisch-Hermetisches Christianity&quot; (1690–91). A hostile critic of various currents of Western thought that had emerged since the Renaissance—among them Paracelsianism, Weigelianism, and Christian theosophy—in his book he labelled all of these traditions under the category of &quot;Platonic–Hermetic Christianity&quot;, portraying them as heretical to what he saw as &quot;true&quot; Christianity. Despite his hostile attitude toward these traditions of thought, Colberg became the first to connect these disparate philosophies and to study them under one rubric, also recognising that these ideas linked back to earlier philosophies from late antiquity.

In 18th-century Europe, during the Age of Enlightenment, these esoteric traditions came to be regularly categorised under the labels of &quot;superstition&quot;, &quot;magic&quot;, and &quot;the occult&quot;—terms often used interchangeably. The modern academy, then in the process of developing, consistently rejected and ignored topics coming under &quot;the occult&quot;, thus leaving research into them largely to enthusiasts outside of academia. Indeed, according to historian of esotericism Wouter J. Hanegraaff (born 1961), rejection of &quot;occult&quot; topics was seen as a &quot;crucial identity marker&quot; for any intellectuals seeking to affiliate themselves with the academy.

Scholars established this category in the late 18th century after identifying &quot;structural similarities&quot; between &quot;the ideas and world views of a wide variety of thinkers and movements&quot; that, previously, had not been in the same analytical grouping. According to the scholar of esotericism Wouter J. Hanegraaff, the term provided a &quot;useful generic label&quot; for &quot;a large and complicated group of historical phenomena that had long been perceived as sharing an &quot;air de famille&quot;.&quot;

Various academics have emphasised that esotericism is a phenomenon unique to the Western world. As Faivre stated, an &quot;empirical perspective&quot; would hold that &quot;esotericism is a Western notion.&quot; As scholars such as Faivre and Hanegraaff have pointed out, there is no comparable category of &quot;Eastern&quot; or &quot;Oriental&quot; esotericism. The emphasis on &quot;Western&quot; esotericism was nevertheless primarily devised to distinguish the field from a &quot;universal&quot; esotericism. Hanegraaff has characterised these as &quot;recognisable world views and approaches to knowledge that have played an important though always controversial role in the history of Western culture&quot;. Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan asserted that Western esotericism constituted &quot;a third pillar of Western culture&quot; alongside &quot;doctrinal faith and rationality&quot;, being deemed heretical by the former and irrational by the latter. Scholars nevertheless recognise that various non-Western traditions have exerted &quot;a profound influence&quot; over Western esotericism, citing the example of the Theosophical Society&#x27;s incorporation of Hindu and Buddhist concepts like reincarnation into its doctrines. Given these influences and the imprecise nature of the term &quot;Western&quot;, the scholar of esotericism Kennet Granholm has argued that academics should cease referring to &quot;&quot;Western&quot; esotericism&quot; altogether, instead simply favouring &quot;esotericism&quot; as a descriptor of this phenomenon. Egil Asprem has endorsed this approach.

==Definition==
The historian of esotericism Antoine Faivre noted that &quot;never a precise term, [esotericism] has begun to overflow its boundaries on all sides&quot;, with both Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss stating that Western esotericism consists of &quot;a vast spectrum of authors, trends, works of philosophy, religion, art, literature, and music&quot;.
Scholars broadly agree on which currents of thought fall within a category of &quot;esotericism&quot;—ranging from ancient Gnosticism and Hermeticism through to Rosicrucianism and the Kabbalah and on to more recent phenomenon such as the New Age movement. Nevertheless, &quot;esotericism&quot; itself remains a controversial term, with scholars specialising in the subject disagreeing as to how best to define it.

===As a universal secret inner tradition===
Some scholars have used &quot;Western esotericism&quot; to refer to &quot;inner traditions&quot; concerned with a &quot;universal spiritual dimension of reality, as opposed to the merely external (&#x27;exoteric&#x27;) religious institutions and dogmatic systems of established religions.&quot; This approach views Western esotericism as just one variant of a worldwide esotericism at the heart of all world religions and cultures, reflecting a hidden esoteric reality. This use is closest to the original meaning of the word in late antiquity, where it applied to secret spiritual teachings that were reserved for a specific elite and hidden from the masses. This definition was popularised in the published work of 19th-century esotericists like A.E. Waite, who sought to combine their own mystical beliefs with a historical interpretation of esotericism. It subsequently became a popular approach within several esoteric movements, most notably Martinism and Traditionalism.

This definition, originally developed by esotericists themselves, became popular among French academics during the 1980s, exerting a strong influence over the scholars Mircea Eliade, Henry Corbin, and the early work of Faivre. Within the academic field of religious studies, those who study different religions in search of an inner universal dimension to them all are termed &quot;religionists&quot;. Such religionist ideas also exerted an influence on more recent scholars like Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke and Arthur Versluis.
Versluis for instance defined &quot;Western esotericism&quot; as &quot;inner or hidden spiritual knowledge transmitted through Western European historical currents that in turn feed into North American and other non-European settings&quot;. He added that these Western esoteric currents all shared a core characteristic, &quot;a claim to gnosis, or direct spiritual insight into cosmology or spiritual insight&quot;, and accordingly he suggested that these currents could be referred to as &quot;Western gnostic&quot; just as much as &quot;Western esoteric&quot;.

There are various problems with this model for understanding Western esotericism. The most significant is that it rests upon the conviction that there really is a &quot;universal, hidden, esoteric dimension of reality&quot; that objectively exists. The existence of this universal inner tradition has not been discovered through scientific or scholarly enquiry; this had led some to claim that it does not exist, though Hanegraaff thought it better to adopt a view based in methodological agnosticism by stating that &quot;we simply do not know—and cannot know&quot; if it exists or not. He noted that, even if such a true and absolute nature of reality really existed, it would only be accessible through &quot;esoteric&quot; spiritual practices, and could not be discovered or measured by the &quot;exoteric&quot; tools of scientific and scholarly enquiry. Hanegraaff pointed out that an approach that seeks a common inner hidden core of all esoteric currents masks that such groups often differ greatly, being rooted in their own historical and social contexts and expressing mutually exclusive ideas and agendas. A third issue was that many of those currents widely recognised as esoteric never concealed their teachings, and in the 20th century came to permeate popular culture, thus problematizing the claim that esotericism could be defined by its hidden and secretive nature. He noted that when scholars adopt this definition, it shows that they subscribe to the religious doctrines espoused by the very groups they are studying.

===As an enchanted world view===
Another approach to Western esotericism treats it as a world view that embraces &quot;enchantment&quot; in contrast to world views influenced by post-Cartesian, post-Newtonian, and positivist science that sought to &quot;dis-enchant&quot; the world. That approach understands esotericism as comprising those world views that eschew a belief in instrumental causality and instead adopt a belief that all parts of the universe are interrelated without a need for causal chains. It stands as a radical alternative to the disenchanted world views that have dominated Western culture since the scientific revolution, and must therefore always be at odds with secular culture.

An early exponent of this definition was the historian of Renaissance thought Frances Yates in her discussions of a &quot;Hermetic Tradition&quot;, which she saw as an &quot;enchanted&quot; alternative to established religion and rationalistic science. The primary exponent of this view was Faivre, who published a series of criteria for how to define &quot;Western esotericism&quot; in 1992. Faivre claimed that esotericism was &quot;identifiable by the presence of six fundamental characteristics or components&quot;, four of which were &quot;intrinsic&quot; and thus vital to defining something as being esoteric, while the other two were &quot;secondary&quot; and thus not necessarily present in every form of esotericism. He listed these characteristics as follows:

# &quot;Correspondences&quot;: This is the idea that there are both real and symbolic correspondences existing between all things within the universe. As examples for this, Faivre pointed to the esoteric concept of the macrocosm and microcosm, often presented as the dictum of &quot;as above, so below&quot;, as well as the astrological idea that the actions of the planets have a direct corresponding influence on the behaviour of human beings.
# &quot;Living Nature&quot;: Faivre argued that all esotericists envision the natural universe as being imbued with its own life force, and that as such they understand it as being &quot;complex, plural, hierarchical&quot;.
# &quot;Imagination and Mediations&quot;: Faivre believed that all esotericists place great emphasis on both the human imagination, and mediations—&quot;such as rituals, symbolic images, mandalas, intermediary spirits&quot;—and mantras as tools that provide access to worlds and levels of reality existing between the material world and the divine.
# &quot;Experience of Transmutation&quot;: Faivre&#x27;s fourth intrinsic characteristic of esotericism was the emphasis that esotericists place on fundamentally transforming themselves through their practice, for instance through the spiritual transformation that is alleged to accompany the attainment of gnosis.
# &quot;Practice of Concordance&quot;: The first of Faivre&#x27;s secondary characteristics of esotericism was the belief—held by many esotericists, such as those in the Traditionalist School—that there is a fundamental unifying principle or root from which all world religions and spiritual practices emerge. The common esoteric principle is that attaining this unifying principle can bring the world&#x27;s different belief systems together in unity.
# &quot;Transmission&quot;: Faivre&#x27;s second secondary characteristic was the emphasis on the transmission of esoteric teachings and secrets from a master to their disciple, through a process of initiation.

Faivre&#x27;s form of categorisation has been endorsed by scholars like Goodrick-Clarke, and by 2007 Bogdan could note that Faivre&#x27;s had become &quot;the standard definition&quot; of Western esotericism in use among scholars. In 2013 the scholar Kennet Granholm stated only that Faivre&#x27;s definition had been &quot;the dominating paradigm for a long while&quot; and that it &quot;still exerts influence among scholars outside the study of Western esotericism&quot;. The advantage of Faivre&#x27;s system is that it facilitates comparing varying esoteric traditions &quot;with one another in a systematic fashion.&quot; Other scholars criticised his theory, pointing out various weaknesses. Hanegraaff claimed that Faivre&#x27;s approach entailed &quot;reasoning by prototype&quot; in that it relied upon already having a &quot;best example&quot; of what Western esotericism should look like, against which other phenomena then had to be compared. The scholar of esotericism Kocku von Stuckrad (born 1966) noted that Faivre&#x27;s taxonomy was based on his own areas of specialism—Renaissance Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, and Protestant Theosophy—and that it was thus not based on a wider understanding of esotericism as it has existed throughout history, from the ancient world to the contemporary period. Accordingly, Von Stuckrad suggested that it was a good typology for understanding &quot;Christian esotericism in the early modern period&quot; but lacked utility beyond that.

===As higher knowledge===
As an alternative to Faivre&#x27;s framework, Kocku von Stuckrad developed his own variant, though he argued that this did not represent a &quot;definition&quot; but rather &quot;a framework of analysis&quot; for scholarly usage. He stated that &quot;on the most general level of analysis&quot;, esotericism represented &quot;the claim of higher knowledge&quot;, a claim to possessing &quot;wisdom that is superior to other interpretations of cosmos and history&quot; that serves as a &quot;master key for answering all questions of humankind.&quot; Accordingly, he believed that esoteric groups placed a great emphasis on secrecy, not because they were inherently rooted in elite groups but because the idea of concealed secrets that can be revealed was central to their discourse. Examining the means of accessing higher knowledge, he highlighted two themes that he believed could be found within esotericism, that of mediation through contact with non-human entities, and individual experience. Accordingly, for Von Stuckrad, esotericism could be best understood as &quot;a structural element of Western culture&quot; rather than as a selection of different schools of thought.

===As rejected knowledge===
Hanegraaff proposed an additional definition that &quot;Western esotericism&quot; is a category that represents &quot;the academy&#x27;s dustbin of rejected knowledge.&quot; In this respect, it contains all of the theories and world views rejected by the mainstream intellectual community because they do not accord with &quot;normative conceptions of religion, rationality and science.&quot; His approach is rooted within the field of the history of ideas, and stresses the role of change and transformation over time.

Goodrick-Clarke was critical of this approach, believing that it relegated Western esotericism to the position of &quot;a casualty of positivist and materialist perspectives in the nineteenth-century&quot; and thus reinforces the idea that Western esoteric traditions were of little historical importance. Bogdan similarly expressed concern regarding Hanegraaff&#x27;s definition, believing that it made the category of Western esotericism &quot;all inclusive&quot; and thus analytically useless.

==History==

===Late Antiquity===

The origins of Western esotericism are in the Hellenistic Eastern Mediterranean, then part of the Roman Empire, during Late Antiquity. This was a milieu that mixed religious and intellectual traditions from Greece, Egypt, the Levant, Babylon, and Persia—in which globalisation, urbanisation, and multiculturalism were bringing about socio-cultural change.

One component of this was Hermeticism, an Egyptian Hellenistic school of thought that takes its name from the legendary Egyptian wise man, Hermes Trismegistus. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, a number of texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus appeared, including the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, &quot;Asclepius&quot;, and &quot;The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth&quot;. Some still debate whether Hermeticism was a purely literary phenomenon or had communities of practitioners who acted on these ideas, but it has been established that these texts discuss the true nature of God, emphasising that humans must transcend rational thought and worldly desires to find salvation and be reborn into a spiritual body of immaterial light, thereby achieving spiritual unity with divinity.

Another tradition of esoteric thought in Late Antiquity was Gnosticism. Various Gnostic sects existed, and they broadly believed that the divine light had been imprisoned within the material world by a malevolent entity known as the Demiurge, who was served by demonic helpers, the Archons. It was the Gnostic belief that people, who were imbued with the divine light, should seek to attain gnosis and thus escape from the world of matter and rejoin the divine source.

A third form of esotericism in Late Antiquity was Neoplatonism, a school of thought influenced by the ideas of the philosopher Plato. Advocated by such figures as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus, Neoplatonism held that the human soul had fallen from its divine origins into the material world, but that it could progress, through a number of hierarchical spheres of being, to return to its divine origins once more. The later Neoplatonists performed theurgy, a ritual practice attested in such sources as the &quot;Chaldean Oracles&quot;. Scholars are still unsure of precisely what theurgy involved, but know it involved a practice designed to make gods appear, who could then raise the theurgist&#x27;s mind to the reality of the divine.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of Rome, alchemy and philosophy and other aspects of the tradition were largely preserved in the Arab and Near Eastern world and reintroduced into Western Europe by Jews and by the cultural contact between Christians and Muslims in Sicily and southern Italy. The 12th century saw the development of the Kabbalah in southern Italy and medieval Spain.

The medieval period also saw the publication of grimoires, which offered often elaborate formulas for theurgy and thaumaturgy. Many of the grimoires seem to have kabbalistic influence. Figures in alchemy from this period seem to also have authored or used grimoires. Medieval sects deemed heretical such as the Waldensians were thought to have utilized esoteric concepts.

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
During the Renaissance, a number of European thinkers began to synthesize &quot;pagan&quot; (that is, not Christian) philosophies, which were then being made available through Arabic translations, with Christian thought and the Jewish kabbalah. The earliest of these individuals was the Byzantine philosopher Plethon (1355/60–1452?), who argued that the &quot;Chaldean Oracles&quot; represented an example of a superior religion of ancient humanity that had been passed down by the Platonists.

Plethon&#x27;s ideas interested the ruler of Florence, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, who employed Florentine thinker Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) to translate Plato&#x27;s works into Latin. Ficino went on to translate and publish the works of various Platonic figures, arguing that their philosophies were compatible with Christianity, and allowing for the emergence of a wider movement in Renaissance Platonism, or Platonic Orientalism. Ficino also translated part of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, though the rest was translated by his contemporary, Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500).

Another core figure in this intellectual milieu was Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), who achieved notability in 1486 by inviting scholars from across Europe to come and debate with him 900 theses that he had written. Pico della Mirandola argued that all of these philosophies reflected a grand universal wisdom. Pope Innocent VIII condemned these ideas, criticising him for attempting to mix pagan and Jewish ideas with Christianity.

Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s increased interest in Jewish kabbalah led to his development of a distinct form of Christian Kabbalah. His work was built on by the German Johannes Reuchlin (1455–1522) who authored an influential text on the subject, &quot;De Arte Cabalistica&quot;. Christian Kabbalah was expanded in the work of the German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535/36), who used it as a framework to explore the philosophical and scientific traditions of Antiquity in his work &quot;De occulta philosophia libri tres&quot;. The work of Agrippa and other esoteric philosophers had been based in a pre-Copernican worldview, but following the arguments of Copernicus, a more accurate understanding of the cosmos was established. Copernicus&#x27; theories were adopted into esoteric strains of thought by Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), whose ideas were deemed heresy by the Roman Catholic Church, which eventually publicly executed him.
A distinct strain of esoteric thought developed in Germany, where it became known as &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;. Though influenced by traditions from Late Antiquity and medieval Kabbalah, it only acknowledged two main sources of authority: Biblical scripture and the natural world. The primary exponent of this approach was Paracelsus (1493/94–1541), who took inspiration from alchemy and folk magic to argue against the mainstream medical establishment of his time—which, as in Antiquity, still based its approach on the ideas of the second-century physician and philosopher, Galen, a Greek in the Roman Empire. Instead, Paracelsus urged doctors to learn medicine through an observation of the natural world, though in later work he also began to focus on overtly religious questions. His work gained significant support in both areas over the following centuries.

One of those influenced by Paracelsus was the German cobbler Jakob Böhme (1575–1624), who sparked the Christian theosophy movement through his attempts to solve the problem of evil. Böhme argued that God had been created out of an unfathomable mystery, the &quot;Ungrund&quot;, and that God himself was composed of a wrathful core, surrounded by the forces of light and love. Though condemned by Germany&#x27;s Lutheran authorities, Böhme&#x27;s ideas spread and formed the basis for a number of small religious communities, such as Johann Georg Gichtel&#x27;s Angelic Brethren in Amsterdam, and John Pordage and Jane Leade&#x27;s Philadelphian Society in England.

From 1614 to 1616, the three &quot;Rosicrucian Manifestos&quot; were published in Germany. These texts purported to represent a secret, initiatory brotherhood founded centuries before by a German adept named Christian Rosenkreutz. There is no evidence that Rosenkreutz was a genuine historical figure, nor that a Rosicrucian Order had ever existed before then. Instead, the manifestos are likely literary creations of Lutheran theologian Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654). They interested the public, so several people described themselves as &quot;Rosicrucian&quot;, claiming access to secret esoteric knowledge.

A real initiatory brotherhood was established in late 16th-century Scotland through the transformation of Medieval stonemason guilds to include non-craftsmen: Freemasonry. Soon spreading into other parts of Europe, in England it largely rejected its esoteric character and embraced humanism and rationalism, while in France it embraced new esoteric concepts, particularly those from Christian theosophy.

===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===


The Age of Enlightenment witnessed a process of increasing secularisation of European governments and an embrace of modern science and rationality within intellectual circles. In turn, a &quot;modernist occult&quot; emerged that reflected varied ways esoteric thinkers came to terms with these developments. One of the esotericists of this period was the Swedish naturalist Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), who attempted to reconcile science and religion after experiencing a vision of Jesus Christ. His writings focused on his visionary travels to heaven and hell and his communications with angels, claiming that the visible, materialist world parallels an invisible spiritual world, with correspondences between the two that do not reflect causal relations. Following his death, followers founded the Swedenborgian New Church—though his writings influenced a wider array of esoteric philosophies. Another major figure within the esoteric movement of this period was the German physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1814), who developed the theory of &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;, which later became known more commonly as &quot;Mesmerism&quot;. Mesmer claimed that a universal life force permeated everything, including the human body, and that illnesses were caused by a disturbance or block in this force&#x27;s flow; he developed techniques he claimed cleansed such blockages and restored the patient to full health. One of Mesmer&#x27;s followers, the Marquis de Puységur, discovered that mesmeric treatment could induce a state of somnumbulic trance in which they claimed to enter visionary states and communicate with spirit beings.

These somnambulic trance-states heavily influenced the esoteric religion of Spiritualism, which emerged in the United States in the 1840s and spread throughout North America and Europe. Spiritualism was based on the concept that individuals could communicate with spirits of the deceased during séances. Most forms of Spiritualism had little theoretical depth, being largely practical affairs—but full theological worldviews based on the movement were articulated by Andrew Jackson Davis (1826–1910) and Allan Kardec (1804–1869). Scientific interest in the claims of Spiritualism resulted in the development of the field of psychical research. Somnambulism also exerted a strong influence on the early disciplines of psychology and psychiatry; esoteric ideas pervade the work of many early figures in this field, most notably Carl Gustav Jung—though with the rise of psychoanalysis and behaviourism in the 20th century, these disciplines distanced themselves from esotericism. Also influenced by artificial somnambulism was the religion of New Thought, founded by the American mesmerist Phineas P. Quimby (1802–1866). It revolved around the concept of &quot;mind over matter&quot;—believing that illness and other negative conditions could be cured through the power of belief.
In Europe, a movement usually termed &quot;occultism&quot; emerged as various figures attempted to find a &quot;third way&quot; between Christianity and positivist science while building on the ancient, medieval, and Renaissance traditions of esoteric thought. In France, following the social upheaval of the 1789 Revolution, various figures emerged in this occultist milieu who were heavily influenced by traditional Catholicism, the most notable of whom were Éliphas Lévi (1810–1875) and Papus (1865–1916). Also significant was René Guénon (1886–1951), whose concern with tradition led him to develop an occult viewpoint termed Traditionalism; it espoused the idea of an original, universal tradition, and thus a rejection of modernity. His Traditionalist ideas strongly influenced later esotericists like Julius Evola (1898–1974), founder of the UR Group, and Frithjof Schuon (1907–1998).

In the Anglophone world, the burgeoning occult movement owed more to Enlightenment libertines, and thus was more often of an anti-Christian bent that saw wisdom as emanating from the pre-Christian pagan religions of Europe. Various Spiritualist mediums came to be disillusioned with the esoteric thought available, and sought inspiration in pre-Swedenborgian currents, including Emma Hardinge Britten (1823–1899) and Helena Blavatsky (1831–1891), the latter of whom called for the revival of the &quot;occult science&quot; of the ancients, which could be found in both the East and West. Authoring the influential &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; (1877) and &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; (1888), she co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. Subsequent leaders of the Society, namely Annie Besant (1847–1933) and Charles Webster Leadbeater (1854–1934) interpreted modern theosophy as a form of ecumenical esoteric Christianity, resulting in their proclamation of Indian Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986) as world messiah. In rejection of this was the breakaway Anthroposophical Society founded by Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925). According to Maria Carlson, &quot;&quot;Both turned out to be &#x27;positivistic religions,&#x27; offering a seemingly logical theology based on pseudoscience.&quot; Another form of esoteric Christianity is the spiritual science of the Danish mystic Martinus (1890-1981) who is popular in Scandinavia.

New esoteric understandings of magic also developed in the latter part of the 19th century. One of the pioneers of this was American Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875), who argued that sexual energy and psychoactive drugs could be used for magical purposes. In England, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn—an initiatory order devoted to magic based on kabbalah—was founded in the latter years of the century. One of the members of that order was Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), who went on to proclaim the religion of Thelema and become a member of Ordo Templi Orientis. Some of their contemporaries developed esoteric schools of thought that did not entail magic, namely the Greco-Armenian teacher George Gurdjieff (1866–1949) and his Russian pupil P.D. Ouspensky (1878–1947).

Emergent occult and esoteric systems found increasing popularity in the early 20th century, especially in Western Europe. Occult lodges and secret societies flowered among European intellectuals of this era who had largely abandoned traditional forms of Christianity. The spreading of secret teachings and magical practices found enthusiastic adherents in the chaos of Germany during the interwar years. Notable writers such as Guido von List spread neo-pagan, nationalist ideas, based on Wotanism and the Kabbalah. Many influential and wealthy Germans were drawn to secret societies such as the Thule Society. Thule Society activist Karl Harrer was one of the founders of the German Workers&#x27; Party, which later became the Nazi Party; some Nazi Party members like Alfred Rosenberg and Rudolf Hess were listed as &quot;guests&quot; of the Thule Society, as was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s mentor Dietrich Eckart. After their rise to power, the Nazis persecuted occultists. While many Nazi Party leaders like Hitler and Joseph Goebbels were hostile to occultism, Heinrich Himmler used Karl Maria Wiligut as a clairvoyant &quot;and was regularly consulting for help in setting up the symbolic and ceremonial aspects of the SS&quot; but not for important political decisions. By 1939, Wiligut was &quot;forcibly retired from the SS&quot; due to being institutionalised for insanity. On the other hand, the German hermetic magic order Fraternitas Saturni was founded on Easter 1928 and it is one of the oldest continuously running magical groups in Germany. In 1936, the Fraternitas Saturni was prohibited by the Nazi regime. The leaders of the lodge emigrated to avoid imprisonment, but in the course of the war Eugen Grosche, one of their main leaders, was arrested for a year by the Nazi government. After World War II they reformed the Fraternitas Saturni.

===Later 20th century===

In the 1960s and 1970s, esotericism came to be increasingly associated with the growing counter-culture in the West, whose adherents understood themselves in participating in a spiritual revolution that marked the Age of Aquarius. By the 1980s, these millenarian currents had come to be widely known as the New Age movement, and it became increasingly commercialised as business entrepreneurs exploited a growth in the spiritual market. Conversely, other forms of esoteric thought retained the anti-commercial and counter-cultural sentiment of the 1960s and 1970s, namely the techno-shamanic movement promoted by figures such as Terence McKenna and Daniel Pinchbeck, which built on the work of anthropologist Carlos Castaneda.

This trend was accompanied by the increased growth of modern paganism, a movement initially dominated by Wicca, the religion propagated by Gerald Gardner. Wicca was adopted by members of the second-wave feminist movement, most notably Starhawk, and developing into the Goddess movement. Wicca also greatly influenced the development of Pagan neo-druidry and other forms of Celtic revivalism. In response to Wicca there has also appeared literature and groups who label themselves followers of traditional witchcraft in opposition to the growing visibility of Wicca and these claim older roots than the system proposed by Gardner. Other trends that emerged in western occultism in the later 20th century included satanism, as exposed by groups such as the Church of Satan and Temple of Set, as well as chaos magick through the Illuminates of Thanateros group.

Additionally, since the start of the 1990s, countries inside of the former Iron Curtain have undergone a radiative and varied religious revival, with a large number of occult and new religious movements gaining popularity. Gnostic revivalists, New Age organizations, and Scientology splinter groups have found their way into much of the former Soviet bloc since the cultural and political shift resulting from the dissolution of the USSR. In Hungary, a significant number of citizens (relative to the size of the country&#x27;s population and compared to its neighbors) practice or adhere to new currents of Western Esotericism. In April 1997, the Fifth Esoteric Spiritual Forum was held for two days in the country and was attended at-capacity; In August of the same year, the International Shaman Expo began, being broadcast on live TV and ultimately taking place for two months wherein various neo-Shamanist, Millenarian, mystic, neo-Pagan, and even UFO religion congregations and figures were among the attendees.

==Academic study==


The academic study of Western esotericism was pioneered in the early 20th century by historians of the ancient world and the European Renaissance, who came to recognise that—even though previous scholarship had ignored it—the effect of pre-Christian and non-rational schools of thought on European society and culture was worthy of academic attention. One of the key centres for this was the Warburg Institute in London, where scholars like Frances Yates, Edgar Wind, Ernst Cassirer, and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater effect on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted. The work of Yates in particular, most notably her 1964 book &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot;, has been cited as &quot;an important starting-point for modern scholarship on esotericism&quot;, succeeding &quot;at one fell swoop in bringing scholarship onto a new track&quot; by bringing wider awareness of the effect that esoteric ideas had on modern science.

In 1965, at the instigation of the scholar Henry Corbin, École pratique des hautes études in the Sorbonne established the world&#x27;s first academic post in the study of esotericism, with a chair in the History of Christian Esotericism. Its first holder was François Secret, a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah, though he had little interest in developing the wider study of esotericism as a field of research. In 1979 Faivre assumed Secret&#x27;s chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the &quot;History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe&quot;. Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field, with his 1992 work &quot;L&#x27;ésotérisme&quot; having been cited as marking &quot;the beginning of the study of Western esotericism as an academic field of research&quot;. He remained in the chair until 2002, when he was succeeded by Jean-Pierre Brach.

Faivre noted two significant obstacles to establishing the field. One was an ingrained prejudice toward esotericism within academia, resulting in the widespread perception that the history of esotericism was not worthy of academic research. The other was esotericism&#x27;s status as a trans-disciplinary field, the study of which did not fit clearly within any particular discipline. As Hanegraaff noted, Western esotericism had to be studied as a separate field to religion, philosophy, science, and the arts, because while it &quot;participates in all these fields&quot; it does not squarely fit into any of them. Elsewhere, he noted that there was &quot;probably no other domain in the humanities that has been so seriously neglected&quot; as Western esotericism.

In 1980, the U.S.-based Hermetic Academy was founded by Robert A. McDermott as an outlet for American scholars interested in Western esotericism. From 1986 to 1990 members of the Hermetic Academy participated in panels at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion under the rubric of the &quot;Esotericism and Perennialism Group&quot;. By 1994, Faivre could comment that the academic study of Western esotericism had taken off in France, Italy, England, and the United States, but he lamented that it had not done so in Germany.

In 1999, the University of Amsterdam established a chair in the &quot;History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents&quot;, which was occupied by Hanegraaff, while in 2005 the University of Exeter created a chair in &quot;Western Esotericism&quot;, which was taken by Goodrick-Clarke, who headed the Exeter Center for the Study of Esotericism. Thus, by 2008 there were three dedicated university chairs in the subject, with Amsterdam and Exeter also offering master&#x27;s degree programs in it. Several conferences on the subject were held at the quintennial meetings of the International Association for the History of Religions, while a peer-reviewed journal, &quot;Aries: Journal for the Study of Western Esotericism&quot; began publication in 2001. 2001 also saw the foundation of the North American Association for the Study of Esotericism (ASE), with the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (ESSWE) being established shortly after.
Within a few years, Michael Bergunder expressed the view that it had become an established field within religious studies, with Asprem and Granholm observing that scholars within other sub-disciplines of religious studies had begun to take an interest in the work of scholars of esotericism.

Asprem and Granholm noted that the study of esotericism had been dominated by historians and thus lacked the perspective of social scientists examining contemporary forms of esotericism, a situation that they were attempting to correct through building links with scholars operating in Pagan studies and the study of new religious movements.
On the basis that &quot;English culture and literature have been traditional strongholds of Western esotericism&quot;, in 2011 Pia Brînzeu and György Szönyi urged that English studies also have a role in this interdisciplinary field.

===Emic and etic divisions===
Emic and etic refer to two kinds of field research done and viewpoints obtained, emic, from within the social group (from the perspective of the subject) and etic, from outside (from the perspective of the observer). Wouter Hanegraaff follows a distinction between an emic and an etic approach to religious studies.

The emic approach is that of the alchemist or theosopher. The etic approach is that of the scholar as an historian, a researcher, with a critical view. An empirical study of esotericism needs &quot;emic material and etic interpretation&quot;:

Arthur Versluis proposes approaching esotericism through an &quot;imaginative participation&quot;:
Many scholars of esotericism have come to be regarded as respected intellectual authorities by practitioners of various esoteric traditions. Many esotericism scholars have sought to emphasise that esotericism is not a single object, but practitioners who read this scholarship have begun to regard it and think of it as a singular object, with which they affiliate themselves. Thus, Asprem and Granholm noted that the use of the term &quot;esotericism&quot; among scholars &quot;significantly contributes to the reification of the category for the general audience—&quot;despite&quot; the explicated contrary intentions of most scholars in the field.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In 2013, Asprem and Granholm highlighted that &quot;contemporary esotericism is intimately, and increasingly, connected with popular culture and new media.&quot;

Granholm noted that esoteric ideas and images appear in many aspects of Western popular media, citing such examples as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. Granholm has argued that there are problems with the field in that it draws a distinction between esotericism and non-esoteric elements of culture that draw upon esotericism. He cites extreme metal as an example, noting that it is extremely difficult to differentiate between artists who were &quot;properly occult&quot; and those who superficially referenced occult themes and aesthetics.

Writers interested in occult themes have adopted three different strategies for dealing with the subject: those who are knowledgeable on the subject including attractive images of the occult and occultists in their work, those who disguise occultism within &quot;a web of intertextuality&quot;, and those who oppose it and seek to deconstruct it.

<text>Nana (stylized as NANA) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa. First published as a two-part prologue in Shueisha&#x27;s monthly manga magazine &quot;Cookie&quot; in 1999, &quot;Nana&quot; was later serialized in the same magazine from May 2000 to May 2009, before going on indefinite hiatus. Its chapters have been collected in 21 volumes. The series centers on Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu, two women who move to Tokyo at the age of 20, with the story focused on Nana O.&#x27;s pursuit for fame and Nana K.&#x27;s pursuit for romance, all while struggling to maintain their friendship.

The manga was adapted into a live-action film in 2005, with a sequel released in 2006. A 47-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse and directed by Morio Asaka, aired on Nippon TV between April 2006 and March 2007. All &quot;Nana&quot; media has been licensed for English language release in North America by Viz Media, which serialized the manga in their &quot;Shojo Beat&quot; magazine until the August 2007 issue, while also publishing it in the format. They released both films in 2008, and their English dub of the anime was broadcast on the Funimation Channel beginning in 2009. The anime series was later re-licensed by Sentai Filmworks in 2021.

&quot;Nana&quot; won the 48th Shogakukan Manga Award for the category in 2003. By 2019, the manga had over 50 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.

==Plot==

On March 5, 2001, Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu (nicknamed Hachi) cross paths when they both move to Tokyo after turning 20 years old: Nana O. to pursue a professional music career with her band, Black Stones, on her own merit; and Nana K. to join her friends and move in with her boyfriend. Despite having different personalities and ambitions, the two women find commonalities with each other and, by coincidence, move into the same apartment. However, as they follow their dreams, troubles of fame and love begin to test their friendship.

As the two women continue their lives in Tokyo, Nana K. breaks up with her boyfriend after he cheats on her, while Nana O. reunites with her ex-boyfriend Ren, the guitarist of Japan&#x27;s current top band, Trapnest. Nana O.&#x27;s relationship with Ren eventually leads Nana K. into starting an on-and-off relationship with Trapnest&#x27;s bassist, Takumi, causing her friendship with Nana O. to become awkward, while falling in love with Black Stones&#x27; guitarist, Nobu, at the same time. Ultimately, when Nana K. becomes pregnant, she chooses to marry Takumi instead. Nana O. begins to suffer from panic attacks at the thought of losing Nana K., but she later resolves to win her back from Trapnest by using the popularity and success of Black Stones.

When a tabloid magazine exposes Nana O. and Ren&#x27;s relationship, this causes Black Stones to skyrocket in popularity and formally debut. Nana O. and Ren, however, start facing troubles in their relationship due to Nana O.&#x27;s jealousy of Trapnest and Ren&#x27;s drug addiction, even as they become engaged. As the tabloids continue to target Black Stones and Trapnest, Nana K. begins to learn secrets behind Nana O.&#x27;s family history, including her birth mother. Shortly before Black Stones begin their first tour, their bassist, Shin, is arrested, causing Nana O. to embark on a solo career in the meantime. As she begins to make a name for herself, Ren dies in a car accident. While recovering from his death, Nana O. begins to question her dependency on Nana K. as well as the change in their relationship.

Starting with volume 12, scenes that take place years later are interspersed in the series, showing that in the present, Nana O. is rumored to have died, but Nana K. and her friends learn that she fled to England and try to find her.

Written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa, &quot;Nana&quot; first appeared as a two-part prologue in 1999 in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Cookie&quot; manga magazine (volumes 1 and 2), a sister magazine of &quot;Ribon&quot;. Initially, Yazawa was asked to create two one-shots to accompany the launch of &quot;Cookie&quot;, and she decided to make both stories related to each other so that they would be easier to read in case they were picked up for serialization. Yazawa stated that while creating &quot;Tenshi Nanka ja Nai&quot; in the early 1990s, she had wanted to draw a story centered on a rockabilly band. For &quot;Nana&quot;, she decided to focus on a punk band instead because she had already drawn one of the main characters for &quot;Tenshi Nanka ja Nai&quot; with a pompadour.

&quot;Nana&quot; was later serialized in &quot;Cookie&quot;, starting on May 26, 2000 (July 2000 issue), when it was relaunched as a monthly magazine. &quot;Nana&quot; ran in the magazine for 84 chapters, until May 26, 2009 (July 2009 issue), and in June of that same year it was announced that the series would be put on hiatus due to Yazawa falling ill. Yazawa returned from the hospital in early April 2010, but it was not specified when or if she would resume the manga. During Yazawa&#x27;s 2022 art exhibition, she expressed interest in continuing the series once she is able to.

The individual chapters of &quot;Nana&quot; have been collected by Shueisha into 21 volumes, published under the Ribon Mascot Comics Cookie imprint, between May 15, 2000, and March 13, 2009. Its latest four chapters have not been published in a volume. In addition to &quot;Nana&quot;, each volume features a short bonus comic called , featuring Junko as the owner of a bar, with characters from Yazawa&#x27;s works making guest appearances.

&quot;Nana&quot; is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media. It was serialized in Viz Media&#x27;s manga anthology &quot;Shojo Beat&quot;, premiering in the July 2005 debut issue and continuing until the August 2007 issue. The 21 volumes were published between December 6, 2005, and July 6, 2010. Viz Media added the series to its &quot;Viz Manga&quot; digital service in May 2023. On January 24, 2025, Viz Media announced that it will publish the series in a 2-in-1 omnibus edition starting in Q4 of the same year.

&quot;Nana&quot; prominently features the brand Vivienne Westwood, as Yazawa herself is a fan of the brand. Some outfits featured in the series are clothing from her personal collection.

===Films===
Two live-action film adaptations have been made for &quot;Nana&quot;. The first, &quot;Nana&quot;, was released on September 3, 2005. The film stars Mika Nakashima as the punk star Nana Oosaki, Aoi Miyazaki as Hachi (Nana Komatsu), Ryuhei Matsuda as Ren Honjou, Tetsuji Tamayama as Takumi Ichinose, Hiroki Narimiya as Nobuo Terashima, and Kenichi Matsuyama as Shinichi Okazaki. The DVD edition was released on March 3, 2006. The film did quite well at the Japanese box office, grossing more than 4 billion yen, and staying in the top 10 for several weeks.
A sequel, &quot;Nana 2&quot;, was announced right after the first film debuted. However, on August 4, 2006, Toho stated that shooting would begin mid-September and that the film was to be released on December 9, 2006. Miyazaki, Matsuda and Matsuyama would not be reprising their respective roles as Hachi, Ren and Shin; as such, their roles were assigned to Yui Ichikawa, Nobuo Kyo and Kanata Hongō, respectively. Some locations from the manga had been changed for the film, and many plot differences were introduced as well.

===Anime===

An anime television series adaptation of &quot;Nana&quot; was produced by Nippon Television, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse and directed by Morio Asaka, with Tomoko Konparu handling series composition, Kunihiko Hamada designing the characters and Tomoki Hasegawa composing the music. The series aired on Nippon TV from April 5, 2006, to March 28, 2007. The first and third opening song, &quot;Rose&quot; and &quot;Lucy&quot;, respectively, and the third ending song, , were performed by Anna Tsuchiya (credited as Anna inspi&#x27; Nana), who provided the singing voice for Nana Osaki; Tsuchiya also performed the ending song &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (for episodes 45 and 46). The second opening song, &quot;Wish&quot;, and the first two ending songs, &quot;A Litte Pain&quot; and &quot;Starless Night&quot;, were performed by Olivia Lufkin (credited as Olivia inspi&#x27; Reira), who provided the singing voice for Reira Serizawa; Lufkin also performed the ending song &quot;Winter Sleep&quot; (for episodes 43 and 44). The episodes were collected and distributed on 17 DVD volumes by VAP from July 7, 2006, to November 21, 2007.

In 2007, Viz Media licensed the anime for release in North America, and released it on four DVD box sets between September 9, 2009, and April 13, 2010, including an English dub. Funimation acquired the broadcast rights to Viz Media&#x27;s dub and it premiered on the Funimation Channel in 2009. After Viz Media lost the rights, Sentai Filmworks re-licensed the series in 2021 and premiered on its Hidive service on April 22 that same year. Sentai Filmworks released the series on a SteelBook Blu-ray edition on February 22, 2022, and on a regular Blu-ray edition on May 17 of that same year.

The anime was intended to be equal to the manga, and adapted up to the first chapter of volume 12 to avoid filler. In April 2007, when asked about a continuation of the anime, Junko Koseki (editor of &quot;Nana&quot; in Shueisha) and Masao Maruyama (the then managing director of Madhouse) stated that they had decided to wait until the manga&#x27;s conclusion before producing more material.

===Image and tribute albums===
&quot;Nana&quot; inspired two image albums; &quot;Punk Night: From Nana&quot;, released by King Records on September 26, 2003; and &quot;Nana&#x27;s Song is My Song&quot;, released by Momo &amp; Grapes on November 6 of that same year. A tribute album, &quot;Love for Nana: Only 1 Tribute&quot;, was released by EMI Music Japan on March 16, 2005; several famous artists contributed to it, including English musician Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols, Canadian singer-songwriter Skye Sweetnam, and various Japanese artists.

===Video games===
A &quot;Nana&quot; video game for the PlayStation 2 platform was produced by Konami and released on March 17, 2005. A PlayStation Portable game, was released on July 6, 2006. A Nintendo DS game, was released by Konami on June 21, 2007.

==Reception==
Along with &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot;, &quot;Nana&quot; won the 48th Shogakukan Manga Award in the category in 2003. &quot;Nana&quot; was the top favorite manga for Oricon Style in 2005. It was nominated for the 10th Osamu Tezuka Cultural Award in 2006.

The Young Adult Library Services Association in the United States listed the series in its &quot;Great Graphic Novels for Teens&quot; in 2007. Deb Aoki of About.com ranked &quot;Nana&quot; as the fifth &quot;Must-Read&quot; shōjo manga series in its &quot;Top shojo Manga Must-Reads&quot; list, with Aoki stating the manga is &quot;a beautifully-drawn series that is filled with heartfelt drama, big city glamor, fabulous fashion, rock and roll sass and many unexpected twists.&quot; She also ranked the manga in its &quot;50 Essential Manga for Libraries&quot; list, noting its mature themes and &quot;demonstrates the need for an adult collection.&quot; In a survey conducted by &quot;Goo&quot; in 2012 among 1,939 people, &quot;Nana&quot; was among the top favorite manga for women. &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that part of the appeal of &quot;Nana&quot; in Japan was how it was centered on the juxtaposition between a rebellious character and a character aligned to traditional values.

The 18th volume was the second highest-selling manga volume of 2007. During 2008, the 19th volume was the third highest-selling manga volume, and the 20th was the fifth highest-selling one in Japan, selling 1,645,128 and 1,431,335 copies respectively. In the first half of 2009, the 21st ranked as the third best-selling manga volume, having sold 1.4 million copies. By the end of 2009, &quot;Nana&quot; was the sixth best-selling manga series, with 3,122,146 copies sold. The first twelve volumes of the manga had cumulatively sold over 22 million copies by 2005. By 2008, the manga had sold over 43.6 million copies. By 2019, the manga had over 50 million copies in circulation. In the United States, the 21st volume debuted ninth on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Graphic Books list for the week of July 10.

The highest average TV ratings for the anime television series adaptation was 6.3% in the Kanto region, which was unusually high for a late night anime; the record was broken by &quot;Nodame Cantabile&quot; at 6.6% in November 2008.

<doc id="495189" wikidata="Q5358002" url="?curid=495189" title="Electrodynamic suspension">
<text>Electrodynamic suspension (EDS) is a form of magnetic levitation in which there are conductors which are exposed to time-varying magnetic fields. This induces eddy currents in the conductors that creates a repulsive magnetic field which holds the two objects apart.

These time-varying magnetic fields can be caused by relative motion between two objects. In many cases, one magnetic field is a permanent field, such as a permanent magnet or a superconducting magnet, and the other magnetic field is induced from the changes of the field that occur as the magnet moves relative to a conductor in the other object.

Electrodynamic suspension can also occur when an electromagnet driven by an AC electrical source produces the changing magnetic field, in some cases, a linear induction motor generates the field.

EDS is used for maglev trains, such as the Japanese SCMaglev. It is also used for some classes of magnetically levitated bearings.

==Types==
Many examples of this have been used over the years.

===Bedford levitator===

In this early configuration by Bedford, Peer, and Tonks from 1939, an aluminum plate is placed on two concentric cylindrical coils, and driven with an AC current. When the parameters are correct, the plate exhibits 6-axis stable levitation.

===Levitation melting===

In the 1950s, a technique was developed where small quantities of metal were levitated and melted by a magnetic field of a few tens of kHz. The coil was a metal pipe, allowing coolant to be circulated through it. The overall form was generally conical, with a flat top. This permitted an inert atmosphere to be employed and was commercially successful.

===Linear induction motor===
Eric Laithwaite and colleagues took the Bedford levitator, and by stages developed and improved it.

First they made the levitator longer along one axis and were able to make a levitator that was neutrally stable along one axis, and stable along all other axes.

Further development included replacing the single-phase energising current with a linear induction motor which combined levitation and thrust.

Later &quot;traverse-flux&quot; systems at his Imperial College laboratory, such as Magnetic river avoided most of the problems of needing to have long, thick iron backing plates when having very long poles, by closing the flux path laterally by arranging the two opposite long poles side by side. They were also able to break the levitator primary into convenient sections which made it easier to build and transport.

===Null flux===
Null flux systems work by having coils that are exposed to a magnetic field but are wound in figure of 8 and similar configurations such that when there is relative movement between the magnet and coils, but centered, no current flows since the potential cancels out. When they are displaced off-center, current flows and a strong field is generated by the coil which tends to restore the spacing.

These schemes were proposed by Powell and Danby in the 1960s, and they suggested that superconducting magnets could be used to generate the high magnetic pressure needed.

===Inductrack===

Inductrack is a passive, fail-safe magnetic levitation system, using only unpowered loops of wire in the track and permanent magnets (arranged into Halbach arrays) on the vehicle to achieve magnetic levitation. The track can be in one of two configurations, a &quot;ladder track&quot; and a &quot;laminated track&quot;. The ladder track is made of unpowered Litz wire cables, and the laminated track is made out of stacked copper or aluminium sheets.

There are two designs: the Inductrack I, which is optimized for high-speed operation, and the Inductrack II, which is more efficient at lower speeds.

===Electrodynamic bearing===
Electrodynamic bearings (EDB) are a novel type of bearing that is a passive magnetic technology. EDBs do not require any control electronics to operate. They work by the electrical currents generated by motion causing a restoring force.

==Uses==

===Maglev===

In EDS maglev trains, both the rail and the train exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive force between these magnetic fields. The magnetic field in the train is produced by either superconducting magnets (as in SCMaglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in Inductrack). The repulsive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track. A major advantage of the repulsive maglev systems is that they are naturally stable - minor &quot;narrowing&quot; in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to repel the magnets back to their original position, while a slight increase in distance greatly reduces the force and again returns the vehicle to the right separation. No feedback control is necessarily needed.

Repulsive systems have a major downside as well. At slow speeds, the current induced in these coils by the slow change in magnetic flux with respect to time is not large enough to produce a repulsive electromagnetic force sufficient to support the weight of the train. Moreover, the energy efficiency for EDS at low speed is low. For this reason the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches a speed that can sustain levitation. Since a train may stop at any location, due to equipment problems for instance, the entire track must be able to support both low-speed and high-speed operation. Another downside is that the repulsive system naturally creates a field in the track in front and to the rear of the lift magnets, which act against the magnets and create a form of drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds; at higher speeds the effect does not have time to build to its full potential and other forms of drag dominate.

The drag force can be used to the electrodynamic system&#x27;s advantage, however, as it creates a varying force in the rails that can be used as a reactionary system to drive the train, without the need for a separate reaction plate, as in most linear motor systems.

Alternatively, propulsion coils on the guideway are used to exert a force on the magnets in the train and make the train move forward. The propulsion coils that exert a force on the train are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current flowing through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of the train. The offset between the field exerted by magnets on the train and the applied field creates a force moving the train forward.

==Principles==

When a conductive loop experiences a changing magnetic field, from Lenz&#x27;s law and Faraday&#x27;s law, the changing magnetic field generates an electromotive force (EMF) around the circuit. For a sinusoidal excitation, this EMF is 90 degrees phased ahead of the field, peaking where the changes are most rapid (rather than when it is strongest):

:formula_1

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of turns of wire (for a simple loop this is 1) and Φ&quot;B&quot; is the magnetic flux in webers through a &quot;single&quot; loop.

Since the field and potentials are out of phase, both attractive and repulsive forces are produced, and it might be expected that no net lift would be generated. However, although the EMF is at 90 degrees to the applied magnetic field, the loop inevitably has inductance. This inductive impedance tends to delay the peak current, by a phase angle dependent on the frequency (since the inductive impedance of any loop increases with frequency).

:formula_2

where K is the impedance of the coil, L is the inductance and R is the resistance, the actual phase lead being derivable as the inverse tangent of the product ωL/R, &quot;viz.&quot;, the standard phase lead evidence in a single-loop RL circuit.

But:

:formula_3

where I is the current.

Thus at low frequencies, the phases are largely orthogonal and the currents lower, and no significant lift is generated. But at sufficiently high frequency, the inductive impedance dominates and the current and the applied field are virtually in line, and this current generates a magnetic field that is opposed to the applied one, and this permits levitation.

However, since the inductive impedance increases proportionally with frequency, so does the EMF, so the current tends to a limit when the resistance is small relative to the inductive impedance. This also limits the lift force. Power used for levitation is therefore largely constant with frequency. However, there are also eddy currents due to the finite size of conductors used in the coils, and these continue to grow with frequency.

Since the energy stored in the air gap can be calculated from HB/2 (or μ0H2/2) times air-gap volume, the force applied across the air gap in the direction perpendicular to the load (&quot;viz.&quot;, the force that directly counteracts gravity) is given by the spatial derivative (= gradient) of that energy. The air-gap volume equals the cross-sectional area multiplied by the width of the air gap, so the width cancels out and we are left with a suspensive force of μ0H2/2 times air-gap cross-sectional area, which means that maximum bearable load varies as the square of the magnetic field density of the magnet, permanent or otherwise and varies directly as the cross-sectional area.

==Stability==

===Static===
Unlike configurations of simple permanent magnets, electrodynamic levitation can be made stable. Electrodynamic levitation with metallic conductors exhibits a form of diamagnetism, and relative permeabilities of around 0.7 can be achieved (depending on the frequency and conductor configuration). Given the details of the applicable hysteresis loop, frequency-dependent variability of behavior should be of minimal importance for those magnetic materials that are likely to be deployed.

===Dynamic===
This form of maglev can cause the levitated object to be subject to a drag-induced oscillation, and this oscillation always occurs at a sufficiently high speed. These oscillations can be quite serious and can cause the suspension to fail.

However, inherent system-level damping can frequently avoid this from occurring, particularly on large-scale systems.

Alternatively, addition of lightweight tuned mass dampers can prevent oscillations from being problematic.

Electronic stabilization can also be employed.

<text>Nothofagus, also known as the southern beeches, is a genus of 43 species of trees and shrubs native to the Southern Hemisphere in southern South America (Chile, Argentina) and east and southeast Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. The species are ecological dominants in many temperate forests in these regions. Some species are reportedly naturalised in Germany and Great Britain. The genus has a rich fossil record of leaves, cupules, and pollen, with fossils extending into the late Cretaceous period and occurring in Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and South America.

==Description==
The leaves are toothed or entire, evergreen or deciduous. The fruit is a small, flattened or triangular nut, borne in cupules containing one to seven nuts.

==Reproduction==
Many individual trees are extremely old, and at one time, some populations were thought to be unable to reproduce in present-day conditions where they were growing, except by suckering (clonal reproduction), being remnant forest from a cooler time. Sexual reproduction has since been shown to be possible.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Nothofagus&quot; was first formally described in 1850 by Carl Ludwig Blume who published the description in his book &quot;Museum botanicum Lugduno-Batavum, sive, Stirpium exoticarum novarum vel minus cognitarum ex vivis aut siccis brevis expositio et descriptio&quot;. &quot;Nothofagus&quot; means &quot;false beech&quot;, which Blume chose to indicate that &quot;Nothofagus&quot; species were different from beeches in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the past, they were included in the family Fagaceae, but genetic tests revealed them to be genetically distinct, and they are now included in their own family, Nothofagaceae.

===Subgenera===
Four subgenera are recognized, based on morphology and DNA analysis:
* Subgenus &quot;Fuscospora&quot;, six species (&quot;N. alessandri, N. cliffortioides, N. fusca, N. gunnii, N. solandri&quot;, and &quot;N. truncata&quot;) in New Zealand, Tasmania, and southern South America.
* Subgenus &quot;Lophozonia&quot;, seven species (&quot;N. alpina, N. cunninghamii, N. glauca, N. macrocarpa, N. menziesii, N. moorei&quot;, and &quot;N. obliqua&quot;) in New Zealand, Australia, and southern South America.
* Subgenus &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, five species (&quot;N. antarctica, N. betuloides, N. dombeyi, N. nitida&quot;, and &quot;N. pumilio&quot;) in southern South America. 
* Subgenus &quot;Brassospora&quot; (or &quot;Trisyngyne&quot;), 20 accepted species (&quot;N. aequilateralis, N. balansae, N. baumanniae, N. brassii, N. carrii, N. codonandra, N. crenata, N. discoidea, N. flaviramea, N. grandis, N. nuda, N. perryi, N. pseudoresinosa, N, pullei, N. recurva, N. resinosa, N. rubra, N. starkenborghiorum, N. stylosa&quot;, and &quot;N. womersleyi&quot;) in New Guinea and New Caledonia.

In 2013, Peter Brian Heenan and Rob D. Smissen proposed splitting the genus into four, turning the four recognized subgenera into the new genera &quot;Fuscospora&quot;, &quot;Lophozonia&quot; and &quot;Trisyngyne&quot;, with the five South American species of subgenus &quot;Nothofagus&quot; remaining in genus &quot;Nothofagus&quot;. The proposed new genera are not accepted at the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

==Distribution==
The pattern of distribution around the southern Pacific Rim suggests the dissemination of the genus dates to the time when Antarctica, Australia, and South America were connected in a common land-mass or supercontinent referred to as Gondwana. However, genetic evidence using molecular dating methods has been used to argue that the species in New Zealand and New Caledonia evolved from species that arrived in these landmasses by dispersal across oceans. Uncertainty exists in molecular dates and controversy rages as to whether the distribution of &quot;Nothofagus&quot; derives from the break-up of Gondwana (i.e. vicariance), or if long-distance dispersal has occurred across oceans. In South America, the northern limit of the genus can be construed as La Campana National Park and the Vizcachas Mountains in the central part of Chile.

== Evolutionary history ==
&quot;Nothofagus&quot; first appeared in Antarctica during the early Campanian stage (83.6 to 72.1 million years ago) of the Late Cretaceous. During the Campanian &quot;Nothofagus&quot; diversified and became dominant within Antarctic ecosystems, with the appearance of all four modern subgenera by the end of the stage. &quot;Nothofagus&quot; shows a progressive decline in the Antarctic pollen record through the Maastrichtian, before substantially recovering after the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. &quot;Nothofagus&quot; persisted in Antarctica deep into the Cenozoic, despite the increasingly inhospitable conditions, with the final records from the late Neogene, around 15-5 million years old, which were small tundra-adapted prostrate shrubs, similar to &quot;Salix arctica&quot; (Arctic willow).

&quot;Nothofagus&quot; first appeared in southern South America during the late Campanian. During the Paleocene and Eocene they were mostly restricted to southern Patagonia, before reaching a peak abundance during the Miocene. Their distribution contracted westwards during the late Miocene due to the aridification of Patagonia.

Although the genus now mostly occurs in cool, isolated, high-altitude environments at temperate and tropical latitudes, the fossil record shows that it survived in climates that appear to be much warmer than those that &quot;Nothofagus&quot; now occupies.

==Ecology==
&quot;Nothofagus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus &quot;Aenetus&quot;, including &quot;A. eximia&quot; and &quot;A. virescens&quot;. &quot;Zelopsis nothofagi&quot; is a leaf hopper, endemic to New Zealand, which is found on &quot;Nothofagus&quot;.

&quot;Cyttaria&quot; is genus of ascomycete fungi found on or associated with &quot;Nothofagus&quot; in Australia and South America. &quot;Misodendrum&quot; are specialist parasitic plants found on various species of &quot;Nothofagus&quot; in South America. Additionally, the beetle, Brachysternus prasinus, has been known to live in &quot;Nothofagus&quot; in Chile and in parts of Argentina. The geographic range of B. prasinus is highly dependent on the availability and distribution of Nothofagus on which B. prasinus is believed to feed. B. prasinus have been observed in the Nothofagus forests near the cities of Coquimbo and Llanquihue in Chile as well as the areas of Neuquén and Chubut in Western Argentina.&quot;

The species of subgenus &quot;Brassospora&quot; are evergreen, and distributed in the tropics of New Guinea, New Britain, and New Caledonia. In New Guinea and New Britain &quot;Nothofagus&quot; is characteristic of lower montane rain forests between 1000 and 2500 meters elevation, occurring infrequently at elevations as low as 600 meters, and in upper montane forests between 2500 and 3150 meters elevation. &quot;Nothofagus&quot; is most commonly found above the &quot;Castanopsis-Lithocarpus&quot; zone in the lower montane forests, and below the conifer-dominated upper montane forests. &quot;Nothofagus&quot; grows in mixed stands with trees of other species or in pure stands, particularly on ridge crests and upper slopes. The Central Range has the greatest diversity of species, with fewer species distributed among the mountains of western and northern New Guinea, New Britain, and Goodenough and Normanby islands.

The New Caledonian species are endemic to the main island (Grand Terre), most commonly on soils derived from ultramafic rocks between 150 and 1350 meters elevation. They occur in isolated stands, forming a low or stunted and irregular and fairly open canopy. The conifers &quot;Agathis&quot; and &quot;Araucaria&quot; are sometimes present as emergents, rising 10 to 20 meters above the &quot;Nothofagus&quot; canopy.

==Beech mast==
Every four to six years or so, &quot;Nothofagus&quot; produces a heavier crop of seeds and is known as the beech mast. In New Zealand, the beech mast causes an increase in the population of introduced mammals such as mice, rats, and stoats. When the rodent population collapses, the stoats begin to prey on native bird species, many of which are threatened with extinction. This phenomenon is covered in more detail in the article on stoats in New Zealand.

<text>Adrian Keith Goldsworthy (; born 1969) is a British historian and novelist who specialises in ancient Roman history.

==Education==
Adrian Goldsworthy attended Westbourne School, Penarth. He then read Ancient and Modern History at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, completing a D.Phil. in ancient military history from the University of Oxford in 1994. That dissertation laid the foundation of his first book, &quot;The Roman Army at War 100 BC – AD 200&quot;.

==Career==
Goldsworthy was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at Cardiff University for two years, taught briefly at King&#x27;s College London and was an assistant professor on the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s London programme for six years. His expertise is in Roman history, but he has also taught a course on the military history of the Second World War.

Goldsworthy has appeared on History Channel documentaries and the television game show &quot;Time Commanders&quot;, serving as an expert on battles being fought by the contestants, and he gave a speech about Roman history and politics to the cast of a 2010 Liverpool production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

In 2010 Goldsworthy began writing a series of military novels - based not in Roman times but in the Napoleonic era and concentrating on Wellington&#x27;s redcoat army, another period in which he has great interest. His first novel, &quot;True Soldier Gentlemen&quot;, was published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 2011 and was followed by &quot;Beat the Drums Slowly&quot; and &quot;Send Me Safely Back Again&quot;. The titles of each of his novels are taken from the lyrics of popular military songs of the period.

Asked about his philosophy of life, Goldsworthy responded that he was &quot;English, so obviously do not have a philosophy. I am a Christian, though, if you want to know about important beliefs.&quot; Goldsworthy lives in South Wales.

==Works==
Goldsworthy has written several historical works on ancient Rome, especially the Roman army, and nine novels.

* &quot;Callimorpha dominula philippsi&quot; (Talysh Mountains, northern Iran, southern Turkmenistan)
* &quot;Callimorpha dominula kurdistanica&quot; (south-eastern Turkey, possibly Iraq)

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is present in most of Europe and in the Near East (Turkey, South Caucasus and northern Iran). These moths prefer damp areas (wet meadows, river banks, fens and marshes), but they also can be found on rocky cliffs close to the sea.

==Description==
&quot;Callimorpha dominula&quot; has a wingspan of . Adults of this species are quite variable in color. The forewings usually have a metallic-green sheen on the blackish areas, with white and yellow or orange markings. Hindwings are red with three large and irregular black markings. These moths may also occur in rare color forms, one with yellow hindwings and body and one with extended black on hindwings. The thorax is black glossed with green and shows two longitudinal short yellow stripes. The abdomen is black. The scarlet tiger moth has developed mouthparts, that allow it to feed on nectar. The caterpillars can reach a length of about . They are dark gray with yellow stripes and small white dots.

==Biology==
The imagines are active during the day in May and June. This species has a single generation. The caterpillars are polyphagous. They mainly feed on comfrey (&quot;Symphytum officinale&quot;), but also on a number of other plants (&quot;Urtica&quot;, &quot;Cynoglossum&quot;, &quot;Fragaria&quot;, &quot;Fraxinus&quot;, &quot;Geranium&quot;, &quot;Lamium&quot;, &quot;Lonicera&quot;, &quot;Myosotis&quot;, &quot;Populus&quot;, &quot;Prunus&quot;, &quot;Ranunculus&quot;, &quot;Rubus&quot;, &quot;Salix&quot; and &quot;Ulmus&quot; species).

The three morphs occurring in the population at the Cothill reserve in Oxfordshire, Britain, have been the subject of considerable genetic study (McNamara 1998), including research by E. B. Ford, Ronald Fisher and Denis Owen. Don McNamara (1998) describes how amateurs can rear this species.

<text>Ogre () is the state city in the Ogre Municipality (and previously Ogre District) in the Vidzeme region of Latvia, east of the capital Riga, and is situated at the confluence of the Daugava and Ogre rivers. It has been a city since 1928. The population in 2020 was 23,273.

Ogre is composed of three parts: Jaunogre (meaning &quot;New Ogre&quot;), Ogre (the center of the city), and Pārogre (meaning &quot;Ogre across [the river]&quot; though not all the named region is across the river).

The name of the city comes from the Ogre river. The Ogre village was first mentioned in 1206, called &quot;Oger&quot; in German.
In 1861, when a railway Riga–Daugavpils was built, Riga&#x27;s residents started to build summer cottages here. In 1862 Ogre became a health resort.

The city&#x27;s coat of arms was granted in 1938, and shows the river and pinewoods of Ogre.
There is a cultural centre, an art school and a music school in Ogre. It has three Latvian language schools, and one Russian language school — Jaunogre Secondary School.

The city also has a cemetery with the remains of German soldiers who died during the First and Second World Wars, or died in captivity between 1944 and 1951.

Ogre is the home city for the 2016–2017 Latvian ice hockey champions HK Kurbads.
== Etymology ==
There are three main versions of the etymology of Ogre&#x27;s name (both town and river). The first states that the name of the river from which this city derives its name is of Russian origin (угри, &quot;ugri&quot;, meaning &quot;eels&quot;) because there used to be many eels in the river Ogre. A popular folk legend says that Catherine the Great of Russia was the one who gave the river this name because there were a lot of eels in the river; however, this lacks any evidence.
Whereas Estonian linguist Paul Alvre takes into consideration an older form of the Ogre river&#x27;s name (&quot;Wogene, Woga&quot;) first found in Livonian Chronicle of Henry (1180–1227), and argues that it cognates with Estonian word &quot;voog&quot; (with possible meanings: &quot;stream, flow, waves&quot;), therefore showing connection with Finno-Ugric languages, most probably early Livonian language.

A third etymology gives a reconstructed form *&quot;Vingrē&quot;, related to Lithuanian &quot;vingrùs&quot;, &quot;meandering, curly&quot; or Latvian &quot;vingrs&quot;, &quot;nimble;&quot; thus meaning &quot;the meandering river&quot;; the village of Engure has the same root.

==Sports==
Ice hockey, basketball and handball are the most popular sports in Ogre.

Ice hockey club Essamika won the only Latvian Hockey Higher League championship title up to this day. In later years, Ogre had acquired 8 silver medals: 5 with ASK/Ogre and 3 with HK Kurbads.

Ogre has a Latvian Basketball League and Baltic Basketball League team, the BK Ogre/Kumho Tyre, which entered the Latvian highest league after winning the gold in Latvian second league.

Ogre&#x27;s handball team HK Ogre/Miandum has won multiple medals in the Latvian Handball Higher League and won the silver medal at the 2013–14 season as the highest achievement.

FK Ogre, the city&#x27;s main association football club, plays in the Latvian First League.

<doc id="495221" wikidata="Q655316" url="?curid=495221" title="Arctiinae">
<text>The Arctiinae (formerly called the family Arctiidae) are a large and diverse subfamily of moths with around 11,000 species found all over the world, including 6,000 neotropical species. This subfamily includes the groups commonly known as tiger moths (or tigers), which usually have bright colours, footmen, which are usually much drabber, lichen moths, and wasp moths. Many species have &quot;hairy&quot; caterpillars that are popularly known as woolly bears or woolly worms. The scientific name Arctiinae refers to this hairiness (Gk. αρκτος = a bear). Some species within the Arctiinae have the word &quot;tussock&quot;&#x27; in their common names because they have been misidentified as members of the Lymantriinae subfamily based on the characteristics of the larvae.

==Taxonomy==
The subfamily was previously classified as the family Arctiidae of the superfamily Noctuoidea and is a monophyletic group. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown that the group is most closely related to litter moths Herminiinae and the Old World Aganainae, which are subfamilies of the family Erebidae. The Arctiidae as a whole have been reclassified to represent this relationship. The family was lowered to subfamily status as the Arctiinae within the Erebidae. The subfamilies and tribes of Arctiidae were lowered to tribes and subtribes, respectively, of this new Arctiinae to preserve the internal structure of the group.

==Tribes (former subfamilies)==
Many genera are classified into these tribes, while others remain unclassified (&quot;incertae sedis&quot;).
*Arctiini
*Lithosiini
*Syntomini

== Description ==

The most distinctive feature of the subfamily is a tymbal organ on the metathorax. This organ has membranes that are vibrated to produce ultrasonic sounds. They also have thoracic tympanal organs for hearing, a trait with a fairly broad distribution in the Lepidoptera, but the location and structure is distinctive to the subfamily. Other distinctive traits are particular setae (hairs) on the larvae, wing venation, and a pair of glands near the ovipositor. The sounds are used in mating and for defense against predators. Another good distinguishing character of the subfamily is presence of anal glands in females.

== Aposematism ==
Many species retain distasteful or poisonous chemicals acquired from their host plants. Some species also have the ability to make their own defenses. Common defenses include cardiac glycosides (or cardenolides), pyrrolizidine alkaloids, pyrazines, and histamines. Larvae usually acquire these chemicals, and may retain them in the adult stage, but adults can acquire them, too, by regurgitating decomposing plants containing the compounds and sucking up the fluid. Adults can transfer the defenses to their eggs, and males sometimes transfer them to females to help with defense of the eggs. Larval &quot;hairs&quot; may be stinging in some species, due to histamines their caterpillars make.

The insects advertise these defenses with aposematic bright coloration, unusual postures, odours, or in adults, ultrasonic vibrations. Some mimic moths that are poisonous or wasps that sting. The ultrasound signals help nocturnal predators to learn to avoid the moths, and for some species can jam bat echolocation.

== Behavior and life cycle ==

Many of the caterpillars and adults are active during the daytime, but most species of this taxon are night-flying. Moths are attracted by light, but one species, &quot;Borearctia menetriesii,&quot; never comes to the light. Basking to accelerate digestion is common in the larval stages, and social behaviour may range from solitary to gregarious. Like most Lepidoptera, larvae produce a small silk pad before each moult, in which their prolegs are engaged.

If disturbed, woolly bear caterpillars roll into a tight spiral or drop from their perch suspended by a strand of silk. Isabella tiger moths (&quot;Pyrrharctia isabella&quot;) overwinter in the caterpillar stage. They can survive freezing at moderate subzero temperatures by producing a cryoprotectant chemical. The larvae of another species, &quot;Phragmatobia fuliginosa&quot;, may be found on snow seeking a place to pupate. Species in Arctic and temperate belts overwinter in the larval stage.

Some tiger moths produce ultrasonic clicks in response to the echolocation of bats to protect themselves.

Many species are polyphagous in the larval stage. Monophagous species, such as the cinnabar moth (&quot;Tyria jacobaeae&quot;), are scarce.

Although abundant, few species in this subfamily are of economic importance. Even the fall webworm, an abundant and highly polyphagous tree-feeding species that has spread from North America to Asia and Europe, does not do lasting damage to healthy hosts.

== Folklore ==
Local folklore of the American Northeast and South hold that &quot;woolly bears&quot; (or &quot;woolly worms&quot; in the South) help humans predict the weather, similar to the groundhog. The forthcoming severity of a winter may be indicated by the amount of black on the Isabella tiger moth&#x27;s caterpillar—the most familiar woolly bear in North America. More brown than black is said to mean a mild winter, while more black than brown is supposed to mean a harsh winter. However, the relative width of the black band varies among instars, not according to weather. The mythical qualities attributed to woolly bears in America have led to such things as the Woollybear Festival in Ohio, the Woolly Worm Festival in Beattyville, Kentucky and the Woolly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, North Carolina.

<text>A japamala, , or simply mala (; , meaning &#x27;garland&#x27;) is a loop of prayer beads commonly used in Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. It is used for counting recitations (&quot;japa&quot;) of mantras, prayers or other sacred phrases. It is also worn to ward off evil, to count repetitions within some other form of &quot;sadhana&quot; (spiritual practice) such as prostrations before a holy icon. They are also used as symbols of religious identification.

The main body of a mala usually consists of 108 beads of roughly the same size and material as each other, although smaller versions, often factors of 108 such as 54 or 27, exist. A distinctive 109th &quot;guru bead&quot; or mother bead, which is not counted, is very common.

Mala beads have traditionally been made of a variety of materials such as wood, stone, gems, seeds, bone and precious metals—with various religions often favouring certain materials—and strung with natural fibres such as cotton, silk, or animal hair. In the modern era, synthetic materials can also be used, such as plastic or glass beads, and nylon cords. Malas are similar to other forms of prayer beads used in various world religions, such as the misbaha in Islam and the rosary in Christianity.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The specific origin of the mala is unknown, with the use of beads for counting being a widespread practice in ancient cultures. No references to malas occur in Chinese literature before the introduction of Buddhism during the Han dynasty, suggesting that the practice may have originated in India, and then spread to China. No mention of a mala occurs in the Buddhist Agamas or Pali Nikayas, generally regarded as the oldest Buddhist literature, and it is unclear if their use originated with Buddhists or with Brahmins, Jains, or some other Indian religious community.

=== Early attestations ===

Malas may appear in early Hindu art as part of the garb of deities or worshippers, but are difficult to distinguish from decorative necklaces or garlands. The earliest clear depiction of a mala being used as a tool for recitation, rather than as a (possible) decorative necklace, comes from a bodhisattva image created during the Northern Wei dynasty (4th - 6th century) in China; the mala is held in the hand, rather than worn.

The first literary reference to the use of a mala for the recitation of mantras comes from the &quot;Mu Huanzi Jing&quot; ( or , &quot;Aristaka/Soap-Berry Seed Scripture/Classic&quot;, Taishō Tripiṭaka volume 17, number 786), a Mahayana Buddhist text purported to have been translated into Chinese during the Eastern Jin era, sometime in the 4th - 5th century CE.

No mention of this text occurs in standard bibliographies before the 6th century, but an independent translation in the 8th century suggests an origin as a Sanskrit text transmitted from Central Asia, rather than a Chinese composition. According to this text, a king asks the Buddha for &quot;an essential method that will allow me during the day or night to engage easily in a practice for freeing us from all sufferings in the world in the future.&quot; The Buddha instructs the king to make a mala from the seeds of a soapberry tree (likely the aristaka, the Indian soapberry tree) and recite an homage to the three jewels while passing the mala through his fingers. The text also states the mala should be worn at all times, and that if a million recitations were completed, the king would end the one hundred and eight passions.

Another Mahayana Buddhist source which teaches the use of a mala is found in the Chinese canon in &quot;The Sutra on the Yoga Rosaries of the Diamond Peak&quot; (金剛頂瑜伽念珠経, Ch.: &quot;Chin-kang-ting yü-ch’ieh nien-chu ch’ing&quot;, Taisho 789) which was translated by the Buddhist vajracarya Amoghavajra (705–774). The text states that the mala should be worn around the neck and that this purifies bad karma.

Rudraksha japamalas are discussed in some Hindu sources, such as in the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; (9th-14th century) which explains how to make a &quot;rudraksha&quot; garland, and in the &quot;Rudrakṣajābāla upaniṣad&quot;. The &quot;Rudrakṣajābāla upaniṣad&quot; states that the rudrakshas are tears of Shiva, and as such, they should always be worn by devotees of Shiva. It discusses various ways of wearing them, and which mantras to use with them.

Regarding Vaishnava sources, the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; both teach the use and wear of a mala made from tulasi wood (tulasi kanthi mala). The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; explains that by wearing this mala, Hari (Vishnu) will always be with the devotee. It also states that wearing a tulasi mala will multiply the benefit of doing good karmic deeds, as well as providing magical protection from harm. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; says one should always wear the tulasi mala, whether one is pure or impure, even while bathing, eating or going to the toilet.

=== China ===

While the earliest Buddhist story about the mala is associated with lay practice, in China it was initially primarily associated with monastic practice. The first Chinese Buddhist author to promote the use of malas was the Pure Land patriarch Daochuo (562–645). Images of monks with malas began to appear in China in the 7th century CE and the mala seems to have been regarded as a common piece of monastic equipment by around this era. While there are relatively few pre-Song dynasty depictions or references to the mala, this may be due to its use in private religious practice rather than public ceremony. Chinese authors criticized monks who recited mantras on their malas in public, as monks were generally expected to remain silent while on public alms rounds.

By the Ming dynasty-era, malas increasingly began to be valued for their aesthetic qualities as much or more than their spiritual use and were often worn by royals and high officials. Malas of expensive or rare materials became common as gifts given among the wealthy, and the materials allowed to different grades of wives and concubines was regulated by sumptuary laws. Depictions of Qing dynasty court officials often include malas, intended to show their status and wealth rather than as an indication of spirituality.

== Materials ==


Common materials are wood from the sandalwood tree, along with the seeds of various trees, and precious or semiprecious stones.

Strings may be made from practically any fibre, traditionally silk or wool or cotton though synthetic monofilaments or cords such as nylon can now be found and are favoured for their low cost and good wear resistance. Elastic cords, such as milliner&#x27;s elastic, may be used and have the advantage that they can stretch to fit over the wearer&#x27;s hand if worn on the wrist whereas other material may not wrap a sufficient number of times to prevent the mala from slipping off. Beads may also be joined by metal chains.

=== Hinduism ===
Beads made from the fruitstones of the rudraksha tree (&quot;Elaeocarpus ganitrus&quot;) are considered sacred by Saivas, devotees of Siva, and its use is taught in the &quot;Rudrakshajabala Upanishad&quot;. It is believed that the Rudraksha Japa Mala epitomizes ancient wisdom and mystical energies, offering seekers a conduit to inner peace and spiritual harmony. Beads made from the wood of the tulsi plant are used and revered by Vaishnavas, followers of Vishnu.

=== Mahayana Buddhism ===
A very popular type of mala among Mahayana Buddhists are those made of bodhi seeds, which are actually made from various species belonging to &quot;Arecaceae&quot; and &quot;Fabaceae&quot; rather than of the seeds of the bodhi tree. The most common bead types in China and Tibet are:

* &quot;Phoenix eye&quot; beads, made from &quot;Ziziphus abyssinica&quot; or &quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot;
* &quot;Moon and Stars&quot; beads, made from &quot;Calamus jenkinsianus&quot;
* &quot;Bodhi root&quot; beads, made from &quot;Corypha umbraculifera&quot;
* &quot;King Kong&quot; beads (i.e. Rudraksha), made from &quot;Elaeocarpus angustifolius&quot;

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====
Various types of malas (Tibetan: trengwa) are used in Tibetan Buddhism, including &quot;Bodhi seed&quot; (commonly made from seeds of a &quot;Ziziphus&quot; tree), wood (such as sandalwood), bone and precious stones. Tibetan Buddhists generally consider malas made from precious stones as the best kind. Some popular stones are agate, sapphire or lapis lazuli. Semiprecious stones such as carnelian and amethyst may be used, as well.

Some common general-purpose malas in Tibetan Buddhism are made from rattan seeds (especially &quot;Calamus jenkinsianus&quot;). These beads are called &quot;moon and stars&quot; by Tibetans, and variously called &quot;lotus root&quot;, &quot;lotus seed&quot; and &quot;linden nut&quot; by various retailers (though it does not come from any &quot;Nelumbo&quot; plants). The bead itself is very hard and dense, ivory-coloured (which gradually turns a deep golden brown with long use), and has small holes (moons) and tiny black dots (stars) covering its surface.

Tibetan Buddhists also teach that certain types of malas can enhance specific practices or bring specific benefits. For example:

* malas made of wood (sandalwood or bodhi tree wood), bodhi seeds, various jewels, or ivory are all purpose malas and are said to be good for all kinds of mantras and practices
* crystal, pearl, conch, nacre, wood, seeds, or other clear or white in colour beads may be used to count mantras used for peaceful deity yoga practices and for purification practices. For these types of practices, white colored beads and a white colored thread is preferred.
* beads made of precious metals like gold or silver may be used for increasing practices, such as increasing lifespan, knowledge, or merit; For these types of practices, yellow colors and colored thread are preferred.
* Red Coral is for magnetizing / power practices, and red color is used for the threads. The colour red is also associated with the Padma family of buddhas (who are highly revered in Tibet).
* Rudraksha, bone, iron, steel and turquoise is preferred for subjugating malicious spirits or for the tantric transformation of powerful afflictions like anger (this is sometimes called &quot;wrathful practice&quot;). For these types of practices, black is the preferred colour.

One type of wooden mala bead has a shallow trench engraved around their equator into which tiny pieces of red coral and turquoise are affixed. Due to the cost of already harvested or fossilized red coral and its conservation status, as well as the cost of turquoise, plastic or glass may be used instead.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, mala beads are made from the natural seeds of &quot;Ziziphus budhensis&quot;, a plant in the family Rhamnaceae endemic to the Temal region of Kavrepalanchok in Bagmati Province.

The Government of Nepal&#x27;s Ministry of Forestry has established a committee and begun to distribute seedlings of these plant so as to uplift the economic status of the people living in this area.

=== Japanese Buddhism ===


In Buddhism in Japan, Buddhist prayer beads are known as or , where the &quot;o&quot; is the honorific &quot;o-&quot;. Different Buddhist sects in Japan have different shaped prayer beads, and use them differently. Most Japanese Buddhist malas are made out of various types of wood, such as rosewood, plumwood, and lignum vitae.

For example, the Shingon and Tendai generally use longer prayer beads (108 beads) with counter strands on both ends for recording multiple rounds of recitation (Tendai malas have 2 recorder bead strands, Shingon malas have four). These recorder strands usually end in decorative tassels.

During devotional services, the beads may be rubbed together with both hands to create a soft grinding noise, which is considered to have a purifying and reverential effect. A notable feature of Tendai school&#x27;s prayer beads is the use of flat beads called &quot;soroban beads&quot; for the main beads (while most of the other sects use spherical beads). For the Shingon school, they use a red string as the main string for the 108 beads and white tassels for the counter beads.

Nichiren schools generally use long 108 bead nenjus with five counter strands with ornamental tassels.

The Japanese Zen schools use long 108 bead nenjus without counter / recorder bead strands.

Meanwhile, in Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land), prayer beads are typically shorter and held draped over both hands and are not ground together, as this is forbidden.

Jōdo-shū is somewhat unusual because of the use of a double-ringed prayer beads, called , which are used for counting nenbutsu recitations (i.e. recitation of the name of Amitabha Buddha): one ring contains single beads used to count a single recitation while the other ring is used to count full revolutions of the first ring. Additionally, other beads hang from the strings, which can count full revolutions of the second ring (flat beads), or full revolutions of the first string of beads. In all, it is possible to count up to 120,000 recitations using these beads. The design is credited to a follower of Hōnen named Awanosuke.

=== Theravada Buddhism ===
Theravada Buddhists in Myanmar use prayer beads called &quot;seik badi&quot; ( ), shortened to &quot;badi&quot;. 108 beads are strung on a garland, with the beads typically made of fragrant wood like sandalwood, and series of brightly coloured strings at the end of the garland. It is commonly used in samatha meditation, to keep track of the number of mantras chanted during meditation.

Mantra recitation with malas is also common in the various forms of Southern Esoteric Buddhism, a class of esoteric traditions within Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhism.

== Number of beads ==


There are numerous explanations why there are typically 108 beads, with the number 108 bearing special religious significance in a number of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.

For example, in traditional Buddhist thought, people are said to have 108 afflictions or kleshas. In another reckoning, 108 is the number of possible dharmas or phenomena. In East Asian Buddhism, 108 can also represent 108 meditations, or the Buddhist 108 deities in the Diamond Realm Mandala. Despite the varying explanations for the use of this number, the number itself has been kept consistent over centuries of practice.

Smaller malas are also known, most commonly with a factor of 108 beads (such as 54, 42, 27, 21, 18 and 14), and may be worn on the wrist or used to more conveniently keep count of prostrations. The 54, whether in a 54 bead mala or the first 54 beads in a full 108 bead mala, is often interpreted as signifying the first 54 stages of the bodhisattva path (as understood in East Asian Buddhism). One source even mentions a mala with 1080 beads.

Many malas will have a 109th bead which is variously called the guru bead, mother bead (Japanese: boju), parent bead, Buddha bead, Sumeru bead, or bindu bead. It is often larger, more elaborate, or of a distinctive material or colour. Some malas also have a secondary larger or more ornate bead halfway through the mala, marking the halfway point. These are sometimes called middle beads (Japanese: &quot;nakadama&quot;).&quot;&quot;

In some Buddhist traditions, the guru bead represents The Buddha, Buddha Amitabha or Avalokitesvara. The &quot;Sūtra on the Rosary of the Vajraśekhara Yoga&quot; states that the mother bead is Amitabha, the string is Avalokiteshvara and the other beads are the fruits of the bodhisattva path&quot;.&quot; Tibetan Buddhist malas may have three extra beads as the guru beads, instead of just one. These symbolize the three vajras (the Buddha&#x27;s body, speech and mind).

It is common to find prayer beads in Japan that contain a small image inside the guru bead, usually something associated with the particular temple or sect. When held up to the light the image is clearly visible.

=== Additional beads ===
Mala may have extra beads hanging from the guru/mother bead or middle bead. These may be decorative elements, especially when unable to move along the cord because knots hold them in place. They may or may not have religious symbolism (for example, three beads representing the Buddhist Triple Gem of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) but are not used for counting recitations in any way.

=== Counting markers and cords ===
Vajrayana Buddhism can require that a practitioner complete a particular number of repetitions of an activity as a foundational practice or to become eligible for initiation into an esoteric teaching, for example, one may need to complete 100,000 recitations of Vajrasattva mantra.

To aid this, some Buddhist malas can be made with additional functional beads over and above the 108 main beads. These beads take two main forms serving two different purposes: three marker beads inline with the 108 beads; two short cords of ten beads each hanging from the main loop which are used as counters.

Japanese malas may also contain tassels (房, fusa) with counter beads, also known as recorder beads (記子珠, kishi- or kisu-dama). They are seen as symbolizing the ten pāramitās.&quot;&quot;

==== Inline marker beads ====
In some more complex malas, three distinctive, often smaller, beads are placed so that, with the guru bead, they divide the regular beads into four sections of 27 beads each. They allow quick estimation of the fraction of a round completed. Their presence raises the number of beads (not counting the guru bead) to 111.

Japanese malas may also contain a set of four inline marker beads which often differ in size, color, or material. These are called four points beads (shiten 四天) or “Four Heavenly Kings” (四天王, shitennō). These are usually located after the seventh and the twenty-first beads on either side of the mother bead. In the Shingon school, these four symbolize four bodhisattvas: Fugen (Skt. Samantabhadra), Kannon, Monju (Skt. Mañjuśrī), and Miroku (Skt. Maitreya)&quot;.&quot;

==== Beads on separate cords ====
The short cords may either be permanently attached to the mala or they may be obtained separately; they do not need to match the main beads. These short cords may either be attached individually to the main loop or they may be joined at their common top. The cords end in small charms, usually a different charm on each, with a dorje and a bell shape being common. Their cord is thicker than normal so that the beads on them will not slide under their own weight but can be moved by the chanter.

After a single round of chanting, the user will slide up one bead on the cord with the dorje which represents 108 (or 111) recitations. After ten rounds all ten dorje beads have been moved up, one bead on the bell cord is raised representing 1080 (or 1110) recitations and the dorje beads are all reset to their low position.

To keep track of more recitations, the chanter may use a small metal charm called a &quot;bhum&quot; counter. (&quot;Bhum&quot;, approximately pronounced &quot;boom&quot;, is Tibetan for &quot;one hundred thousand&quot;.) The &quot;bhum&quot; counter starts next to the guru bead and is attached to the main string by a clip or a slip knot. When the tenth bell bead has been raised (10 800 or 11 100 recitations), the chanter moves the &quot;bhum&quot; counter to the next space between beads (and resets the beads on the bell cord). By consistently moving the &quot;bhum&quot; counter in the same direction about 1.2 million recitations can be counted.

== Religious usage ==
The main use of a mala is to repeat mantras or other important religious phrases and prayers (like the Pure Land Buddhist nianfo). Mantras are typically repeated hundreds or even thousands of times. The mala is used so that those who are trying to achieve an exact number of repetitions can focus on the meaning or sound of the mantra rather than counting its repetitions.

In addition to their practical use as an aide in recitation, malas have traditionally been ascribed to have additional spiritual qualities. Different materials may be ascribed the power to help with different practical or spiritual problems, and the mala itself may be ascribed talismanic, magical, and apotropaic characteristics. Buddhist sources such as the &quot;Sutra of Mañjuśrï’s Fundamental Ritual&quot; state that wearing a mala can purify bad karma and ward off evil spirits. In East Asian Buddhism, some malas are made specifically to be worn for warding off evil and for attracting good fortune.

In some traditions, malas are consecrated before use in a manner similar to images of deities, through the use of mantras, dharani, or the application of some substance or pigment like saffron water.

In Tibetan Buddhism, malas are often blessed by lamas. They are also often consecrated with a fragrant substance like sandalwood oil. Some lamas teach that before using a new mala, the practitioner should wash the mala (and his hands as well) and then scent it with oil. A practitioner can then consecrate the mala by holding it and practicing a tantric visualization and reciting a mantra. This is believed to empower the mala and multiply one&#x27;s mantra recitations.

Malas purchased from temples and monasteries may have been blessed by the residents of that institution. Mala may also be blessed after purchase. Popular folk tales may describe malas as becoming imbued with the power of the many recitations it has been used for, or a mala given by a respected monk may be said to have the power to cure illnesses or to restore fertility to barren individuals.

Furthermore, wearing a distinctive mala can also serve as a symbol of religious identification, marking its wearer as a member of a specific religious community and as &quot;physical evidence of faith, devotion, and practice.&quot;

A mala used by a particular holy figure may then serve as a relic after their death.

=== Carrying and storing ===
A mala may be worn by practitioners in several ways:

* Wrapped several times to fit on the wrist
* As a necklace, especially if made from large, consequently heavy, beads
* Suspended from a belt

However they are worn the wearer is supposed to keep the mala from making contact with the floor or ground.

In Chinese Buddhism, mala bracelets are worn by monks and laypeople as a symbol of the Buddha. Malas are often given to laypersons during refuge ceremonies and they are instructed to wear them at all times, as a representation of the Buddha which is present in one&#x27;s life at all times (except when bathing or using the toilet).

Some Tibetan Buddhist teachers teach that it is a root samaya (tantric commitment) that a consecrated and blessed mala should always be kept on one&#x27;s person. For Tibetan Buddhists, the mala is a symbol of their yidam meditation deity and a reminder of their main mantra and tantric commitments (samayas).

Mala may be carried in small pouches from which they are removed before use. Some practitioners, such as the Vaishanava members of ISKCON, may carry their malas in larger pouches which hang from the back of the hand and allow the mala to be manipulated while it is being used without it being significantly exposed to public view or risking contact with the ground.

In the home, mala may be stored in a pouch or not. Some practitioners may store their malas in jewelry boxes or similar containers.

Practitioners who have an altar or shrine in their homes may additionally choose to keep their malas on the altar when not being used or carried.

=== Method of use ===
In Hinduism, the loop is draped over the index finger of the right hand and held in place by the right thumb of the first bead next to the guru bead. As each recitation is completed the loop is advanced by one bead. Some practitioners will hold their other three fingers next to their index finger so that all four fingers are inside the loop. Other practitioners will have only their index finger inside the loop, separating this finger from the other three (for similar reasons as in the next paragraph).

Some practitioners will drape the loop over their second finger (with their third and fourth fingers also inside) and use their index finger to move the beads towards the thumb. This is said to be symbolic of the atma (represented by the index finger) moving towards Paramatma (represented by the thumb) by the vehicle of the mantra (the beads) overcoming elements of the material world (the three other fingers).

In Buddhism, there are numerous ways of holding a mala and using it during recitation. This differs across traditions. It is commonly taught that the left hand is used to hold a mala. However, sometimes both hands are involved in the recitation and counting process. In Chinese Buddhism it is common for monks to wear it around their necks when not in use. In other traditions, the mala is left on one&#x27;s altar or placed in a pouch when not in use. In Tibetan Buddhism, malas used for esoteric (mantrayana) practices are often kept private and should not be shown to anyone.

Tibetan Buddhists generally teach the use of the left hand for counting mantras. Different methods of holding it and moving the beads are taught in Tibetan Buddhism, depending on the type of practice. For example, for peaceful deity practices, one moves the beads towards the body over the forefinger and one holds the mala at the heart. For increasing practices meanwhile, one moves the beads over the middle finger and holds the mala at the navel.

A common taboo is that the guru bead is not used for counting repetitions; counting for each round begins and ends with either of the beads next to the guru bead. In the Hindu tradition and some Buddhist traditions, practitioners who undertake more than one round at a time will, rather than moving their fingers across the guru bead, turn the mala around so that the same bead which was used at the end of the previous round becomes the first bead use for the next round.

While there are typically 108 regular beads, some practitioners will count a round as only 100 repetitions to allow for an accidentally skipped bead or an imperfect recitation.

=== Aesthetic usage ===
In recent years, it has become common for non-religious individuals to wear such beads as a fashion accessory with the beads having no religious connotation whatsoever.

Similar practices have been noted since the Ming dynasty, when malas began to be used as fashionable accessories by members of the Chinese court. Sumptuary laws regulated the materials of malas in Qing dynasty-era China.

Opinion is divided as to whether a mala that is worn as decoration can also be used for the practise of japa or if two separate malas are required.

<text>Michael Praetorius (probably 28 September 1571 – 15 February 1621) was a German composer, organist, and music theorist. He was one of the most versatile composers of his age, being particularly significant in the development of musical forms based on Protestant hymns.

==Life==
Praetorius was born Michael Schultze, the youngest son of a Lutheran pastor, in Creuzburg, in present-day Thuringia. After attending school in Torgau and Zerbst, he studied divinity and philosophy at the University of Frankfurt (Oder). He was fluent in a number of languages. After receiving his musical education, from 1587 he served as organist at the Marienkirche in Frankfurt. From 1592/3 he served at the court in Wolfenbüttel, under the employ of Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. He served in the duke&#x27;s State Orchestra, first as organist and later (from 1604) as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; (court music director).

His first compositions appeared around 1602/3. Their publication primarily reflects the care for music at the court of Gröningen. The motets of this collection were the first in Germany to make use of the new Italian performance practices; as a result, they established him as a proficient composer.

These &quot;modern&quot; pieces mark the end of his middle creative period. The nine parts of his &quot;Musae Sioniae&quot; (1605–10) and the 1611 published collections of liturgical music (masses, hymns, magnificats) follow the German Protestant chorale style. With these, at the behest of a circle of orthodox Lutherans, he followed the Duchess Elizabeth, who ruled the duchy in the duke&#x27;s absence.

When the duke died in 1613 and was succeeded by Frederick Ulrich, Praetorius retained his post in Wolfenbüttel. But he also began working at the court of John George I, Elector of Saxony at Dresden as &quot;Kapellmeister von Haus aus&quot; (nonresident music director). There he was responsible for festive music and was exposed to the latest Italian music, including the polychoral works of the Venetian School. His subsequent development of the form of the chorale concerto, particularly the polychoral variety, resulted directly from his familiarity with the music of such Venetians as Giovanni Gabrieli. The solo-voice, polychoral, and instrumental compositions Praetorius prepared for these events mark the high period of his artistic creativity. Gottfried Staffel&#x27;s detailed eyewitness account of Praetorius&#x27;s music directing at the 1614 Princes’ Convention (&quot;Fürstentag&quot;) in Naumburg and Matthias Hoë von Hoënegg’s epigram describing the impression Praetorius&#x27;s music made on Emperor Matthias and other princes during a visit to Dresden in the summer of 1617 provide some sense of Praetorius&#x27;s fame at the time. In Dresden Praetorius also worked and consulted with Heinrich Schütz from 1615 to 1619.

It seems that Praetorius&#x27;s appointment in Wolfenbüttel was no longer being renewed by Trinity Sunday of 1620. He was probably already lying sick in bed in Wolfenbüttel by that time. There he died on 15 February, 1621, at age forty-nine. His body was entombed in a vault beneath the organ of the Marienkirche on 23 February.

==Name==
His family name in German appears in various forms including Schultze, Schulte, Schultheiss, Schulz and Schulteis. Praetorius was the conventional Latinized form of this family name, &quot;Schultze&quot; meaning &quot;village judge &quot;or&quot; magistrate&quot; in German. The Latin &quot;Praetorius&quot; means &quot;magistrate-related &quot;or&quot; one with the rank of a magistrate.&quot;

==Works==

Praetorius was a prolific composer; his compositions show the influence of Italian composers and his younger contemporary Heinrich Schütz. His works include the 17 volumes of music published during his time as Kapellmeister to Duke Heinrich Julius of Wolfenbüttel, between 1605 and 1613. His nine-part &quot;Musae Sioniae&quot; (1605–10) was a collection of chorales and vernacular music for the Lutheran service for 2 to 16 voices; he also published an extensive collection of Latin music for the church service (&quot;Liturgodiae Sioniae&quot;). &quot;Terpsichore&quot;, a compendium of more than 300 instrumental dances is his most widely known and recorded work today; it is his sole surviving secular work from a projected multi-volume collection (&quot;Musae Aioniae&quot;).

Many of Praetorius&#x27; choral compositions were scored for several smaller choirs situated in several locations in the church, in the style of the Venetian polychoral music of Gabrieli.

Praetorius composed the familiar harmonization of &quot;Es ist ein Ros entsprungen&quot; (&quot;Lo, How a Rose E&#x27;er Blooming&quot;) and the motet &quot;En natus est Emanuel&quot;, both published in 1609 in Musae Sioniae VI.

==Musical writings==
Praetorius was a music academic whose writings were well known to other 17th-century musicians. Although his original theoretical contributions were relatively few compared to other 17th-century German writers, like Johannes Lippius, Christoph Bernhard or Joachim Burmeister, he compiled an encyclopedic record of contemporary musical practices. While Praetorius made some refinements to figured-bass practice and tuning practice, his importance to scholars of the 17th century derives from his discussions of the normal use of instruments and voices in ensembles, the standard pitch of the time, and the state of modal, metrical, and fugal theory. His meticulous documentation of 17th-century practice was of inestimable value to the early-music revival of the 20th century.

His expansive but unfinished treatise, &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot;, appeared in three volumes (with appendix) between 1614 and 1620. The first volume (1614), titled &quot;Musicae Artis Analecta&quot;, was written mostly in Latin, and regarded the music of the ancients and of the church. The second (&quot;De Organographia&quot;, 1618) regarded the musical instruments of the day, especially the organ; it was one of the first theoretical treatises written in the vernacular. The third (&quot;Termini Musicali&quot;, 1618), also in German, regarded the genres of composition and the technical essentials for professional musicians. An appendix to the second volume (&quot;Theatrum Instrumentorum seu Sciagraphia&quot;, 1620) consisted of 42 woodcuts depicting instruments of the early 17th century, all grouped in families and shown to scale. A fourth volume on composition was planned, with the help of Baryphonus, but was left incomplete at his death. Gustave Reese, an American musicologist specializing in medieval and Renaissance music, said that the &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot; was one of the most important sources of seventeenth century musical history.

Praetorius wrote in a florid style, replete with long asides, polemics, and word-puzzles – all typical of 17th-century scholarly prose. As a lifelong committed Christian, he often regretted not taking holy orders but did write several theological tracts, which are now lost. As a devout Lutheran, he contributed greatly to the development of the vernacular liturgy, but also favored Italian compositional methods, performance practice
and figured-bass notation.

<doc id="495227" wikidata="Q308035" url="?curid=495227" title="XxxHolic">
<text>xxxHolic (stylized as ×××HOLiC; pronounced &quot;Holic&quot;) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by the manga group Clamp. The series, which crosses over with another Clamp work, &quot;&quot;, revolves around Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school student who is disturbed by his ability to see the supernatural, and Yūko Ichihara, a powerful witch who owns a wish-granting shop. When Watanuki asks Ichihara to remove his ability to see spirits, she grants it on the condition that he pay for his wish by working for her. Clamp created &quot;xxxHolic&quot; to link the supernatural and fantasy series.

&quot;xxxHolic&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot; periodically from February 2003 until March 2010. It then moved to the manga magazine &quot;Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine&quot; in June 2010, where it ended serialization in February 2011; its chapters were collected in 19 volumes. A sequel, &quot;xxxHolic: Rei&quot;, started in 2013. It was first published in the United States by Del Rey Manga and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi in 2004, then was later published in a series of omnibuses by Kodansha Comics as of 2014. In 2005, Production I.G adapted the manga into an animated film, which was followed by two anime television series, and various original video animations (OVAs). Funimation licensed the film and the first TV series in North America, and released both of them in DVD as well as Blu-ray Disc. A light novel and a video game have also been released based on the series.

The manga has been well received by both Japanese and English readers and has appeared in various rankings of bestselling books. Critics have generally praised the series for its illustrations and its portrayal of supernatural elements.

==Plot==

Kimihiro Watanuki is a high school student plagued by ayakashi spirits which are invisible to everyone else but him. The series begins when Watanuki stumbles, seemingly by chance, into a shop that grants wishes. The shop is owned by Yūko Ichihara, a mysterious witch of many names and esoteric renown. For a price, she offers to grant Watanuki&#x27;s wish to be rid of the spirits. The price, according to Yūko, must be of equal value; so, as payment, he must become Yūko&#x27;s temporary, part-time cook and housekeeper. While his established job consists of household chores, Yūko increasingly sends him on errands of a supernatural or spiritual nature as the series develops. Himawari Kunogi, Watanuki&#x27;s love interest, and Shizuka Dōmeki, a classmate whom Watanuki initially detests, occasionally join him in his work as per Yūko&#x27;s request. The three become increasingly close, and though Watanuki is often annoyed with Dōmeki, he grows to value the new friendships he makes and his life at the wish shop. At the same time, though, he begins to worry about Yūko, wondering if she who grants wishes to others ever has anything to wish for herself. Eventually, he makes a promise to try and grant her a wish, should she have one.

With each supernatural encounter, Watanuki becomes more familiar with and connected to the spiritual world. A crossing plotline with the concurrent series &quot;&quot; reveals that Yūko is actually on the verge of death, and she is only alive now because her personal time was accidentally frozen long ago by the powerful wizard Clow Reed. As the magic binding her in time begins to dissolve, Yūko&#x27;s ability to maintain the shop&#x27;s magical existence fades, and she eventually passes on, telling Watanuki that he will finally be free of his ability to see demons. However, Watanuki chooses to retain his ability to see spirits in order to maintain Yūko&#x27;s shop and take over her role of shopkeeper. Further cross-over plotlines reveal that Watanuki was born as a result of a wish to turn back time by a shop client, Syaoran of &quot;Tsubasa&quot;. Since Syaoran was able to go back in time (at the cost of being removed from his timeline and becoming imprisoned by the sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed), Watanuki was born to replace the void in timespace Syaoran left behind, and thus while they are different people, they share an &quot;existence&quot;. As the series reaches its conclusion, Syaoran and Watanuki become trapped in a void by Fei-Wang and must pay a price to become free and continue existing. While Syaoran decides to keep traveling through dimensions, never stopping in a single place, Watanuki chooses to stay inside the shop and act as its owner, granting wishes until the day he sees Yūko again. As time progresses, Watanuki continues working in the shop without aging. Dōmeki, his assistant, frequently visits him, and the tradition continues with Dōmeki&#x27;s descendants. After 100 years pass, Watanuki has a dream of Yūko, who tells him that he has finally become powerful enough to leave the shop. Despite this, he decides to continue waiting inside the shop for the day that they meet again.

==Background==
&quot;xxxHolic&quot; was conceived when the group Clamp wanted to link the supernatural and fantasy series they made with a realistic one. This idea was further worked with the creation of the character of Yūko Ichihara who would bridge the stories from &quot;xxxHolic&quot; and &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot;. Clamp proposed the idea of writing &quot;xxxHolic&quot; to &quot;Young Magazine&quot; after &quot;Chobits&quot;. In the end they decided to publish both &quot;xxxHolic&quot; and &quot;Tsubasa&quot; in weekly magazines to make serialization easier. The manga&#x27;s title was originally going to be &quot;addicted&quot; but it was changed for the less ambiguous &quot;holic.&quot; Like Clamp&#x27;s previous work &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, &quot;xxxHolic&quot; focuses on social pathologies but with a more esoteric tone.
The &quot;xxx&quot; before the holic is the Japanese way of saying of &quot;fill in the blank.&quot; Therefore, the title itself gives a hint about what the series are about. It is talking about the people with the problems such as an alcoholic, or a workaholic. Being a fantastical series, these &quot;---holics &quot; can have very different pathologies.

The art style of the manga draws on the influence of ukiyo-e wood prints. When making a chapter composed of about twenty pages, Clamp takes around two days to make the artwork, the time differing with the ones from other series they made. The script of the series made by Nanase Ohkawa, who the other Clamp members ask her about any confusion they have before starting drawing the chapters. The illustrations and character designs are mainly done by Tsubaki Nekoi with assistance from Mokona, although Satsuki Igarashi also draws various parts. For the series, they decided to use Japanese and Chinese themes, but avoided using tones. Mokona is mainly in charge of designing the female characters, while Nekoi draws the male ones and all the spirits featured. The artwork is also inspired by Alphonse Mucha who Mokona is a fan of. This leads to all the &quot;tankobon&quot; covers being gold or silver and then color printed over it. The series was retitled &quot;xxxHolic Rō&quot; ever since volume 16 because of how Watanuki replaced Yuko as the shop&#x27;s owner.

When first presenting the idea of running &quot;xxxHolic&quot; linked with &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot;, although Ohkawa expressed concerns for the strain the weekly pace of such a series would place on the artists, she whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa&#x27;s desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The reasons for linking these two series was because Clamp wanted to have two protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and design, yet during the ending they would be stated to be same person, and had to go on different paths. Because &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot; was more focused on action scenes, Clamp sometimes took breaks from &quot;xxxHolic&quot; or create autoconclusive stories so that the storyline between the two series would always be linked. In April 2010, Clamp stated that the &quot;xxxHolic&quot; was taking longer than what they expected, causing delays to some of their other works. When the manga finished serialization, Clamp felt it was more the ending from &quot;xxxHolic Rō&quot;, pointing that &quot;xxxHolic&quot; had already ended. Regarding the series&#x27; finale, Clamp wanted to express that while Watanuki&#x27;s decision to stay in the shop may seem sad for readers, for Watanuki it was his happiness. Clamp was satisfied with people&#x27;s reaction to the last chapter, as when discussing Watanuki&#x27;s fate, they were also thinking what is happiness for them.

==Themes==
Clamp places emphasis on the importance of words when writing the manga. Yuko&#x27;s dialogues always affect the other characters due to how direct and secure she is when speaking. In early chapters, while she worries a woman addicted to the internet by labeling her husband and child as &quot;other people,&quot; Yuko is transmitting the philosophy of individualism and the power her client has. In contrast to Yuko, another client has a tendency to lie which brings her misfortunes.

In Mania Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Best Manga Awards For 2005&quot;, &quot;xxxHolic&quot; was the winner in the category &quot;Best Mature&quot;.

===Manga===
The &quot;xxxHolic&quot; manga series has also been well received by various publications with Mania Entertainment&#x27;s Megan Lavey praising its focus on the people&#x27;s thoughts, as well as its comedy. She also found its connection with &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot; appealing due to events being depicted from different points of view, persuading readers to read both series. Michael Aronson from Manga Life stated the series&#x27; introduction had potential to be worth reading due to its episodic nature and found some of its characters to be &quot;gripping&quot;, though Dan Polley, also from Manga Life, commenting that Watanuki &quot;does seem a little bit weak to be the lead character&quot;. On the other hand, Matthew Alexander from Mania Entertainment stated that Watanuki&#x27;s character was well developed across the series, becoming more appealing. Joy Kim, another writer from Manga Life, praised how despite its episodic nature, the narrative brought by Watanuki&#x27;s interactions with other characters made every panel &quot;loaded with significance&quot;. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network liked how later volumes of the series &quot;[outdid] itself by breaking into the world of dreams&quot;, compared to initial volumes that focused on the interaction between humans and spirit. Active Anime found its emotional tension as well as its connection with &quot;Tsubasa&quot; some of the main reason why the series is worth reading. Not having read &quot;Tsubasa&quot;, Matthew Alexander felt that the addition of elements from the series into &quot;xxxHolic&quot; was well-made, as it started to suggest a connection between the two series&#x27; protagonists. However, Santos found the series&#x27; connection with &quot;Tsubasa&quot; to be confusing to the point that only readers from both series would understand some explanations.

Regarding events happening from volume 15 onwards, Active Anime&#x27;s Holly Ellingwood called them &quot;tragic, inspiring, and beautifully, breathtakingly sad&quot;, enjoying the way Yuko&#x27;s fate was revealed, but wondering how it would continue. Carlo Santos stated that although the series lost its &quot;star performer&quot;, it kept being appealing due to the fact that Watanuki replaced her and found most of volume 16 as &quot;an exercise in getting back on one&#x27;s feet after a heartbreaking loss, and it is all the more inspirational for that.&quot; Matthew Alexander from Mania was more critical to these events due to the how it became &quot;an ultra serious downer&quot; due to Yuko&#x27;s loss and the lack of its recurring comedy. Additionally, he cited the events regarding Yuko&#x27;s disappearance and later death were not explained in &quot;xxxHolic&quot;, stating that only readers from &quot;Tsubasa&quot; would understand such events. The artwork has been praised because of its &quot;striking designs and patterns built into the images&quot;, various notable traits from Clamp, as well as for being &quot;equally memorable and evocative&quot;. On the other hand, it has also been criticized for being &quot;less visually busy than Tsubasa&quot; due to some pages lacking backgrounds, though critic Michael Aronson for Manga Life stated that the panels&#x27; composition is able to make up for such issues. Rebecca Silverman review the opening volume of &quot;xxxHolic: Rei&quot; gave the sequel a B+ rating, praising the way the story now flowed and the artwork, but said that the story was, &quot;a little too mysterious in places&quot;.

===Anime===
The anime adaptation of &quot;xxxHolic&quot; has received mixed reception from different publications, with Anime News Network&#x27;s Casey Brienza liking how its first season is faithful to the original material. However, she found that some of Funimation&#x27;s subtitles in its first episodes to be confusing, advising people to watch the English dubbed version instead. In a bigger overview of the first season, Carlo Santos found issues with the animation&#x27;s unintentional &quot;super deformed&quot; moments in which the characters&#x27; limbs became notably longer. He also criticized some of its episodes&#x27; storytelling as it &quot;falls flat&quot; due to trivial issues discussed. Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime called the series &quot;one of the most distinctly imaginative&quot; because of the combination of supernatural elements and comedy. Pointing to the animation quality, Ellingwood found each character distinctive and the animation issues to be comical. DVD Talk&#x27;s Todd Douglass Jr. gave praise to the themes touched upon in the anime series. Despite giving disapproval to its episodic nature, Douglass found the characters appealing due to their development over the series. IGN writer Jeff Harris found its start &quot;tolerable&quot;, stating that fans from action series may not be interested by &quot;xxxHolic&quot; despite its potential. Like Santos, he commented on its animation, citing similar issues with the design, noting some moments lacked the fluidity seen in other parts of the series. He also criticized the blank background choices, questioning if they were truly artistic decisions or done to save on animation costs. Chris Beveridge of Mania gave a mixed review for the animation, agreeing with Santos and Harris, but still enjoyed the animation style, concluding that &quot;everything about the visual design of the show is very appealing.&quot; Analyzing its episodic nature, Beveridge enjoyed the format, and praised the series&#x27; ability to strike a balance between light and dark parts of its stories.

<text>A ρ factor (Rho factor) is a bacterial protein involved in the termination of transcription. Rho factor binds to the transcription terminator pause site, an exposed region of single stranded RNA (a stretch of 72 nucleotides) after the open reading frame at C-rich/G-poor sequences that lack obvious secondary structure.

Rho factor is an essential transcription protein in bacteria. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, it is a ~274.6 kD hexamer of identical subunits. Each subunit has an RNA-binding domain and an ATP-hydrolysis domain. Rho is a member of the RecA/SF5 family of ATP-dependent hexameric helicases that function by wrapping nucleic acids around a single cleft extending around the entire hexamer. Rho functions as an ancillary factor for RNA polymerase.

There are two types of transcriptional termination in bacteria, rho-dependent termination and intrinsic termination (also called Rho-independent termination). Rho-dependent terminators account for about half of the &quot;E. coli&quot; factor-dependent terminators. Other termination factors discovered in &quot;E. coli&quot; include Tau and nusA. Rho-dependent terminators were first discovered in bacteriophage genomes.

== Function ==

A Rho factor acts on an RNA substrate. Rho&#x27;s key function is its helicase activity, for which energy is provided by an RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. The initial binding site for Rho is an extended (~70 nucleotides, sometimes 80–100 nucleotides) single-stranded region, rich in cytosine and poor in guanine, called the rho utilisation site (rut), in the RNA being synthesised, upstream of the actual terminator sequence. Several rho binding sequences have been discovered. No consensus is found among these, but the different sequences each seem specific, as small mutations in the sequence disrupts its function. Rho binds to RNA and then uses its ATPase activity to provide the energy to translocate along the RNA until it reaches the RNA–DNA helical region, where it unwinds the hybrid duplex structure. RNA polymerase pauses at the termination sequence, which is because there is a specific site around 100 nt away from the Rho binding site called the Rho-sensitive pause site. So, even though the RNA polymerase is about 40 nt per second faster than Rho, it does not pose a problem for the Rho termination mechanism as the RNA polymerase allows Rho factor to catch up.

In short, Rho factor acts as an ATP-dependent unwinding enzyme, moving along the newly forming RNA molecule towards its 3′ end and unwinding it from the DNA template as it proceeds.

== Mutations ==

A nonsense mutation in one gene of an operon prevents the translation of subsequent genes in the unit. This effect is called mutational polarity. A common cause is the absence of the mRNA corresponding to the subsequent (distal) parts of the unit. Suppose that there are Rho-dependent terminators within the transcription unit, that is, before the terminator that usually is used. Normally these earlier terminators are not used, because the ribosome prevents Rho from reaching RNA polymerase. But a nonsense mutation releases the ribosome, so that Rho is free to attach to and/or move along the RNA, enabling it to act on RNA polymerase at the terminator. As a result, the enzyme is released, and the distal regions of the transcription unit are never transcribed.

== Evolution ==
Rho factor has not been found in Archaea.

<doc id="495239" wikidata="Q672169" url="?curid=495239" title="Dharma &amp; Greg">
<text>Dharma &amp; Greg is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC for five seasons from September 24, 1997, to April 30, 2002, with a total of 119 episodes.

The show starred Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson as Dharma and Greg Montgomery, a couple who married on their first date despite being polar opposites. The series was co-produced by Chuck Lorre Productions, More-Medavoy Productions and 4 to 6 Foot Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. The show&#x27;s theme song was written and performed by composer Dennis C. Brown.

Created by executive producers Dottie Dartland and Chuck Lorre, the comedy took much of its inspiration from culture-clash &quot;fish out of water&quot; situations. The show earned eight Golden Globe nominations, six Emmy Award nominations, and six Satellite Award nominations. Elfman earned a Golden Globe in 1999 for Best Actress.

== Show summary ==
Free-spirited yoga instructor/dog trainer Dharma Finkelstein and strait-laced lawyer Greg Montgomery marry on their first date despite being complete opposites. Their conflicting views lead to comical situations. Greg is an Ivy League graduate who was raised by wealthy, conservative parents. After graduation from Harvard and Stanford, he went to work with the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office as a federal prosecutor in San Francisco. He then meets Dharma, who was raised by hippie parents. They fall in love immediately and elope. Despite being totally different, their parents eventually learn to tolerate each other.

== Cast ==

=== Main ===
* Jenna Elfman as Dharma Freedom Montgomery, née Finkelstein, Greg&#x27;s wife, a flower child and somewhat hippie. She is overly cheerful and sensitive, and more compassionate and forgiving than many people. Despite her trust in the goodness of people and persistent good intentions, Dharma is not naive. She understands the real world, employs sarcasm and receives it well. Dharma perseveres in expressing her personality and her identity even in the sometimes opposing world. Dharma encourages Greg to seek happiness rather than fret about practical issues like money. She was named after the concept of dharma in Indian philosophy. A Native American friend of her father gave her the name &quot;Crazy Man&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. She addresses both of her parents by their first names. A somewhat darker side of her personality is revealed during episodes in which she plays pranks on people without appearing to show any concern for how her behavior might be affecting them. According to Chuck Lorre&#x27;s eleventh vanity card (see below), he and Dottie Dartland originally conceived &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; as &quot;a series revolving around a woman whose personality is not a neurotic product of societal and parental conditioning, but of her own free-flowing, compassionate mind&quot;.
* Thomas Gibson as lawyer Gregory Clifford &quot;Greg&quot; Montgomery, Dharma&#x27;s husband. He is somewhat uptight, decent, though surprisingly open-minded at times. Greg grew up in a conservative Republican family. Greg&#x27;s life was hopelessly banal before he met Dharma, and married her on their first date. Since then, he has played the straight man to the antics of his eccentric wife. Though his relationship with Dharma has its challenging moments, Greg has never regretted his marriage to Dharma. He is also very educated; an alumnus of elite schools Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, and Stanford Law School. Mostly in season 1 he was a federal prosecutor aka US attorney in California justice department.
* Susan Sullivan as Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Montgomery, Greg&#x27;s extravagant mother. In the beginning of the first season, Kitty was generally represented as a manipulative, controlling woman who only had high aspirations for her son Greg. As an elite socialite, Kitty was initially displeased to have Dharma and her parents join the family, but over the course of the series, Kitty broadens her world to become part of a larger family, becoming a major part of Dharma&#x27;s life, while remaining lovingly manipulative. Despite their vast differences, she recognizes Dharma&#x27;s place in their family&#x27;s life, once telling her &quot;We both know you&#x27;re not the girl I would have picked for Greg. What matters is that you &quot;are&quot; the girl that Greg did pick.&quot;
* Mitchell Ryan as Edward Montgomery, Greg&#x27;s eccentric father. His philosophy for dealing with his wife Kitty involves remaining as uninvolved as possible. Head of Montgomery Industries (though he keeps working only because he can see little tugboats through the window) and at odds with Dharma&#x27;s father, who calls him &quot;Ed&quot;, but whom in return he calls &quot;Finkelstein&quot;. Edward is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, of which he is fiercely proud, and partially resents Greg for considering Notre Dame to not be &quot;good enough&quot; for him. Ed is often seen drinking martinis and Scotch. Edward was formerly a US Senator.
* Mimi Kennedy as Abigail Kathleen &quot;Abby&quot; O&#x27;Neil, Dharma&#x27;s free-spirited, caring mother, who encourages her daughter and son-in-law to produce children, stating, &quot;Feel free to have sex anywhere.&quot; Although they have a grown daughter (Dharma) and later a son, Abby and Dharma&#x27;s father Larry are not married. She and Larry were engaged and held the wedding ceremony, but still did not marry to &quot;stay under the radar&quot;. Unlike her &quot;lifemate&quot; Larry, she immediately accepted Greg, though she still constantly annoys and conflicts with his parents. She is a militant vegan, which is a never-ending source of trouble. During her pregnancy in season 4, however, she did make exceptions because of her food cravings. It is mentioned in the episode &quot;Invasion of the Buddy Snatcher&quot; that she has a degree in ornithological psychology from Berkeley.
* Alan Rachins as Myron Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Finkelstein, Dharma&#x27;s hippie father. He is a stereotypical 1960s radical who frequently rants about various conspiracies, a lot of which revolve around Richard Nixon. He also thinks he&#x27;s wanted by the FBI, but when Greg discovers he&#x27;s not, his family goes to great lengths to prove to him that he still is because this is a source of great pride to him. Despite this, he manages to get along with Edward, often when both are sick of dealing with their wives. He homeschooled Dharma in American history, passing on his conspiracy theories, such as the latest Apollo mission secretly burying the missing minutes of the Watergate tapes on the moon. It is often alluded to that Larry is a chronic user of marijuana, though never shown. In the season 4 episode &quot;Mother Daughter Reunion&quot;, Dharma mentions that Larry has a resistance against most drugs after frequent use. In the pilot episode Abby introduces his usual cluelessness with &quot;he blew out his short term memory back in 1972&quot;. He sometimes becomes a &quot;pothead savant&quot; and reveals skills such as his talent for carpentry and his music.
* Shae D&#x27;lyn as Jane Deaux (seasons 1–4; guest season 5), Dharma&#x27;s friend, a Canadian who frequently changes her hair color, going from black to red to blonde over the course of the show. Jane often joins Dharma in playing pranks on people around them, including their neighbors and clerks at shopping malls. She considers all men more or less evil, yet she married Pete Cavanaugh in Season 2, attempting to divorce him after only six weeks. They eventually divorced in the premiere of the fourth season. D&#x27;lyn, while still listed in the opening credits of the show, began making fewer and fewer appearances as Jane in the second half of the fourth season, appearing in only 5 of that season&#x27;s final 13 episodes. D&#x27;lyn was then dropped from the starring cast, and made only one appearance in season five (during the second episode of the season). After that, the character of Jane disappeared without explanation.
* Joel Murray as Peter James &quot;Pete&quot; Cavanaugh, Greg&#x27;s friend and colleague at the Justice Department. A particularly bad, lazy lawyer, he was married to Jane for a time. His entire life can be summed up by the interior of his apartment: a massage chair surrounded by empty take-out containers, next to which is a small refrigerator and a stack of porno tapes. A high-class entertainment center is in front of this. It is said he wears adult diapers to football games. Greg once said of his friend: &quot;Pete went to law school in Barbados; he failed the Bar eight times. The last time because he threw up on the exam.&quot; In season 1, he mentions that he worked as a plumber&#x27;s assistant during college. Pete marries Jane in the second season because neither of them wants to be alone on Valentine&#x27;s Day.
* Helen Greenberg as Marcie (season 5; guest seasons 3–4), one of Dharma&#x27;s co-op friends. Marcie is a good-hearted, nasal-voiced and somewhat nervously mousy receptionist whose vocabulary seems to primarily consist of the words &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot;. Marcie was seen on a sporadically recurring basis starting near the end of season 3. In season five, Greenberg&#x27;s name was added to the main cast list for episodes in which she appeared, although she was only seen in about a third of the season&#x27;s episodes. Greenberg also played a different character in the episode &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;.
* Susan Chuang as Susan Wong (season 5; guest seasons 3–4), another one of Dharma&#x27;s friends from the co-op, often (though not always) seen in tandem with Marcie. Unlike Marcie, Susan is much more self-confident and take-charge—sometimes to excess. Susan also pulls a &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; with a lawyer, Darrell Gottlieb, hired by Kitty in a community garden spat (her wedding, along with Dharma&#x27;s accident, was the Season 4 finale). The character of Susan was seen on a sporadically recurring basis starting near the end of season 3. In season five, Chuang&#x27;s name was added to the main cast list for episodes in which she appeared—but like Greenberg, she was only seen in about a third of the season&#x27;s episodes. Also like Greenberg, Chuang debuted on &quot;D&amp;G&quot; playing a different character, in this case in the episode &quot;Looking for the Goodbars&quot;.

=== Recurring ===
* Lillian Hurst as Celia: Kitty and Edward&#x27;s Hispanic maid. She is given constant support from Larry, who views her as &quot;oppressed&quot;. When Kitty and Edward are out of town, Celia and her family move into the Montgomerys&#x27; mansion and invite their friends over, pretending it is their house.
* Yeardley Smith as Marlene: Greg&#x27;s legal secretary whom he fired and then re-hired. She is snide, rude, and a bad secretary in general, though a better &quot;lawyer&quot; than Pete.
* Floyd Westerman as George Littlefox: an elderly Native American, who came to live with Dharma and Greg in the episode &quot;Indian Summer&quot;; he died at the end of the episode, but his ghost sometimes appears to Dharma to offer her advice.
* Kathryn Joosten as Claire: an elderly woman who works in Dharma&#x27;s co-op, along with Susan and Marcie. Seen only in seasons 3 and 4.
* J. D. Walsh as Donald: a high school (later college) student who lives in Dharma and Greg&#x27;s building. He is often given (occasionally unsolicited) advice from Dharma, and sometimes Greg. Seen in seasons 2–5.
* Kevin Sorbo as Charlie: a university professor going through a divorce who falls in love with Dharma. His affections, particularly a love letter and offering to drive Dharma home on a rainy day, causes Greg to briefly move in with Pete. The season 4 story-line was considered a risk and creator Lorre said that &quot;while they won&#x27;t destroy the marriage, they will threaten it&quot;, possibly alienating fans and destroying the show.

== Episodes ==

== Awards and nominations ==
In 1998, the Online Film &amp; Television Association Awards nominated Elfman for Best Actress in a Comedy Series and the series itself as Best New Comedy Series.

Jenna Elfman was nominated three times for Best Television Actress – Musical/Comedy Series at the Golden Globes and won in 1999. Thomas Gibson and Susan Sullivan were both nominated for Golden Globes but neither ever won the award. The show itself was nominated for Best Best Musical/Comedy Series in 1998 and 1999.

== Ratings and cancellation ==

The series was a top-25 fixture in the US during its first three seasons, first airing Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., then at 8:00. It was moved to Tuesdays at 9 p.m. during its third season where it experienced a dramatic ratings lift thanks to a lead-in of the then red-hot &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. As ratings for that series waned in 2000/2001, &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; suffered a similar fate, compounded by NBC moving &quot;Frasier&quot; into the same time slot. As &quot;Millionaire&quot; fell even further and was moved off the night in the fall of 2001, ABC tried to rebuild a Tuesday night comedy block consisting of &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, &quot;What About Joan?&quot;, &quot;Bob Patterson&quot;, and &quot;Spin City&quot;. &quot;Bob Patterson&quot; and &quot;What About Joan?&quot; were quickly cancelled while &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; and &quot;Spin City&quot; shared the 8 p.m. hour for the rest of the season.

The final episode aired on April 30, 2002, to 6.8 million viewers, compared to the 20 million the series had peaked two years previously. Along with &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; was one of the last three surviving shows to debut during the 1997–98 season (&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; would remain for one more season in 2002–03).

==Home media==
Season 2 was released in Australia as a Region 4 PAL on January 22, 2008, with a picture of Dharma and Greg dancing on the cover. It is available in Japan as a Region 2 NTSC format with a picture of them sitting down for the cover art. In the spring of 2008, the second season was released in Europe (Netherlands) as a Region 2 PAL as well. All countries have different covers, and all are using the &quot;dance shot&quot;.

On November 11, 2014, 20th Century Fox released season 2 in Region 1 via Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace program. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Amazon.com.

== Vanity cards ==
The vanity card for Chuck Lorre Productions at the end of each episode included a message written by producer and show co-creator Chuck Lorre, expressing his personal views on a variety of subjects. Because the card only appeared on the screen for a brief moment, it was usually readable only by those who recorded the program and paused it (although the complete collection of cards has now been posted on Lorre&#x27;s website).

Messages were also included on the vanity cards for later Chuck Lorre Productions shows, such as &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;.

== Crossovers ==
Elfman and Gibson had a cameo appearance in the ninth season premiere of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt&quot;. Their characters are not named either in the dialogue or the credits (possibly for legal reasons due to &quot;Men&quot;s being produced by a different studio), but they appear to be based on Dharma and Greg. While the couple remain married, Greg seems overly tired of his responsibilities and marriage, even going so far as to sarcastically hint at divorce to Evelyn Harper (along with a self-inflicted gunshot gesture) when leaving. Joel Murray also makes a cameo appearance in the episode, although not as Pete but as a character named &quot;Doug&quot;. Elfman had also previously appeared on that show in its first season as the free-spirited Frankie in the two-part episodes &quot;Round One to the Hot Crazy Chick&quot; and &quot;That Was Saliva, Alan.&quot;

<doc id="495245" wikidata="Q92395" url="?curid=495245" title="Jimmy Ernst">
<text>Hans-Ulrich Ernst (June 24, 1920 – February 6, 1984), known as Jimmy Ernst, was an American painter born in Germany.

==Early life==
Jimmy Ernst was born in 1920 in Cologne, Germany, the son of German Surrealist painter Max Ernst and Luise Straus-Ernst, a well-known art historian and journalist. His parents separated in 1922 and divorced in 1926 and Ernst remained with his mother in Cologne. He visited his father in France in 1930, where he met many artists, including Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí, Alberto Giacometti, André Masson, Joan Miró, Man Ray and Yves Tanguy, as well as his father&#x27;s lover Leonora Carrington. In February 1933, a month after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, the SS searched Luise Straus&#x27; apartment. As a noted intellectual and a Jew she was regarded as suspect by the new regime. Ernst was sent to live with his grandfather, Luise&#x27;s father, while his mother moved to Paris. In June 1938, Jimmy sailed to New York from Le Havre on the liner SS &quot;Manhattan&quot;.

There he met many European exiles and the city&#x27;s avant-garde. In 1940, he petitioned the Emergency Rescue Committee (ERC) to secure the release of his father from internment. The ERC secured his release in 1941 and Max Ernst arrived in New York from Nazi occupied France. In 1944, unknown to Jimmy, his mother was killed in Auschwitz concentration camp after being sent there from the Drancy internment camp in France.

==Career==
In 1941 Jimmy Ernst became the assistant/secretary to Peggy Guggenheim (who was also his stepmother). Shortly afterwards Ernst became director of The Art of This Century Gallery in 1942. A year later he had his first one-person exhibition.

During the late 1940s he became a member of The Irascible Eighteen, a group of abstract painters who protested against the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s policy towards American painting of the 1940s, and who posed for a famous picture in 1950. Members of the group included: Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt, Hedda Sterne, Richard Pousette-Dart, William Baziotes, Jimmy Ernst, Jackson Pollock, James Brooks, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Theodoros Stamos, Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko. These artists are part of the New York School they were referred to as The Irascibles in an article featured in an issue of &quot;Life&quot; where the infamous Nina Leen photograph was published.

In 1951 Jimmy was granted the post of an instructor at Department of Design, Brooklyn College.

In 1969 he moved to East Hampton. He also built a winter home in Florida in 1980.

Awarded Guggenheim Fellowship in 1961, a Carnegie Foundation grant in 1967, and an honorary degree by the Long Island University (Southampton College) in 1982. Also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1977, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

==Personal life==
Ernst married Edith Dallas Bauman Brody (known as Dallas), a talent scout for Warner Brothers, on January 3, 1947. They had two children, Amy Louise (1953) and Eric Max (1956), both of whom are artists.

His memoir, &quot;A Not-So-Still Life&quot;, dealing with his youth and early years in the United States, was published shortly before his death in 1984.

Dallas Ernst established the Jimmy Ernst Award in memory of her husband. The award of $10,000 is given to a painter or sculptor &quot;whose lifetime contribution to his or her vision has been both consistent and dedicated&quot;. The American Academy of Arts and Letters has presented the award annually since 1990.

<text>Francis James Westbrook Pegler (August 2, 1894 – June 24, 1969) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. journalist described as &quot;one of the godfathers of right-wing populism&quot;. He was a newspaper columnist popular in the 1930s and 1940s for his opposition to the New Deal, labor unions, and anti-lynching legislation.

As an ardent proponent of States&#x27; rights, Pegler criticized a variety of targets whom he saw as extending the reach of the federal government, including Herbert Hoover, FDR (&quot;moosejaw&quot;), Harry Truman (&quot;a thin-lipped hater&quot;), and John F. Kennedy. He also criticized the Supreme Court, the tax system, labor unions, and any federal intervention on the issue of civil rights. In 1962, he lost his contract with King Features Syndicate, owned by the Hearst Corporation, after he started criticizing Hearst executives. His late writing appeared sporadically in publications that included the John Birch Society&#x27;s &quot;American Opinion&quot;.

==Background==
James Westbrook Pegler was born on August 2, 1894, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Frances A. (Nicholson) and Arthur James Pegler, a local newspaper editor.

==Career==
===Journalism career===
Westbrook Pegler was the youngest American war correspondent during World War I, working for United Press Service. In 1918, he joined the United States Navy. In 1919, he became a sports writer for United News (New York).

In 1925, Pegler joined the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In 1933, he joined the Scripps Howard syndicate (through 1944), with his inaugural column opposing the passage of an anti-lynching bill that was before Congress, in which he first coined the term &quot;bleeding heart liberal&quot; to describe the proponents of the bill attempting to outlaw lynching at the federal level.

Pegler worked closely with his friend Roy Howard. He built up a large readership for his column &quot;Mister Pegler&quot; and elicited this observation by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in its October 10, 1938 issue: At the age of 44, Mr. Mister Pegler&#x27;s place as the great dissenter for the common man is unchallenged. Six days a week, for an estimated $65,000 a year, in 116 papers reaching nearly 6,000,000 readers, Mister Pegler is invariably irritated, inexhaustibly scornful. Unhampered by coordinated convictions of his own, Pegler applies himself to presidents and peanut vendors with equal zeal and skill. Dissension is his philosophy. In 1941, he won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing criminal racketeering in labor unions. The same year, he finished third (behind Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin) for &quot;Time&quot;‘s &quot;Man of the Year.&quot;

In 1944, Pegler moved his syndicated column to the Hearst&#x27;s King Features Syndicate. He continued there to 1962.

===Contempt for Franklin Roosevelt===
Pegler supported President Franklin Roosevelt initially but, after seeing the rise of fascism in Europe, he warned against the dangers of dictatorship in America and became one of the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s sharpest critics for what he saw as its abuse of power. Thereafter he rarely missed an opportunity to criticize Roosevelt; his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt; or Vice President Henry A. Wallace. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated in his obituary that Pegler lamented the failure of the would-be assassin Giuseppe Zangara, whose shot missed FDR and killed the mayor of Chicago instead. He &quot;hit the wrong man&quot; when gunning for Franklin Roosevelt.

Pegler&#x27;s views became more conservative in general. He was outraged by the New Deal&#x27;s support for labor unions, which he considered morally and politically corrupt.

===Opposition to New Deal===
At his peak in the 1930s and the 1940s, Pegler was a leading figure in the movement against the New Deal and its allies in the labor movement, such as the National Maritime Union. He compared union advocates of the closed shop to Hitler&#x27;s &quot;goose-steppers.&quot; The NMU sued Hearst and Associated Press for an article by Pegler, settled out of court for $10,000. In Pegler&#x27;s view, the corrupt labor boss was the greatest threat to the country.

By the 1950s, Pegler was advocating the government dissolution of the AFL–CIO federation of unions. Admitting that while such an act would be fascistic in nature, he could, in his words, &quot;see advantages in such fascism.&quot;

===Support and recantion for removal of Japanese-Americans===
At the beginning of World War II, Pegler expressed support for moving Japanese-Americans and Japanese citizens out of California: &quot;The Japanese in California should be under guard to the last man and woman right now and to hell with &quot;habeas corpus&quot; until the danger is over.&quot;
 However, Pegler went on to recant his views and, in a column responding to the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, denounced Chief Justice Hugo Black as a deceitful political hack who had started his career by joining the Ku Klux Klan &quot;a murderous... gang of night riding racial and religious terrorists&quot; to win votes and had never ceased violating the civil liberties of Americans such as the ethnic Japanese.

===Feud with Eleanor Roosevelt===
After 1942 Pegler assailed Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt regularly, calling Mrs. Roosevelt &quot;La boca grande&quot;, or &quot;the big mouth&quot;. The Roosevelts ignored his writings, at least in public.

Recent scholars (including Kenneth O&#x27;Reilly, Betty Houchin Winfield, and Richard W. Steele) have reported that Franklin Roosevelt used the FBI for the purposes of wartime security, and ordered sedition investigations of isolationist and anti-New Deal newspaper publishers (such as William Randolph Hearst and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Robert R. McCormick). On December 10, 1942, Roosevelt, citing evidence Eleanor Roosevelt had gathered, asked the FBI&#x27;s J. Edgar Hoover to investigate Pegler, which it did; the bureau eventually reported that it had found no sedition. In the end, nothing came of it except Pegler&#x27;s lifelong distaste for Eleanor Roosevelt, often expressed in his column.

===Pulitzer Prize and anti-union activism===
In 1941 Pegler became the first columnist to win a Pulitzer Prize for reporting, for his work in exposing racketeering in Hollywood labor unions, focusing on the criminal career of Willie Bioff and the link between organized crime and unions. Pegler&#x27;s reporting led to the conviction of George Scalise, the president of the Building Service Employees International Union who had ties to organized crime. Scalise was indicted by New York District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey, charged with extorting $100,000 from employers from three years. Convicted of labor racketeering, Scalise was sentenced to 10–20 years in prison.

As historian David Witwer has concluded about Pegler, &quot;He depicted a world where a conspiracy of criminals, corrupt union officials, Communists, and their political allies in the New Deal threatened the economic freedom of working Americans.&quot;

In the winter of 1947, Pegler started a campaign to draw public attention to the &quot;Guru Letters&quot; of former Vice-President Henry A. Wallace, claiming they showed Wallace&#x27;s unfitness for the office of President he had announced he would seek in 1948. Pegler characterized Wallace as a &quot;messianic fumbler&quot;, and &quot;off-center mentally.&quot; There was a personal confrontation between the two men on the subject at a public meeting in Philadelphia in July 1948. Several reporters, including H. L. Mencken, joined in the increasingly aggressive questioning. Wallace declined to comment on the letters, while labelling some of the reporters &quot;stooges&quot; for Pegler. At the conclusion of the meeting, H. L. Mencken acidly suggested that every person named &quot;Henry&quot; should be put to death, offering to commit suicide if Wallace was executed first.

===Controversy in later career===

In the 1950s and 1960s, as Pegler&#x27;s conservative views became more extreme and his writing increasingly shrill, he earned the tag of &quot;the stuck whistle of journalism.&quot; Despite having earlier called for the desegregation of baseball, Pegler denounced the civil rights movement and in the early 1960s wrote for the John Birch Society. He aligned himself with the white supremacist White Citizens Council. He was ultimately expelled from the John Birch Society because of his extreme views. However, the Society did put his picture on the cover of its magazine, &quot;American Opinion&quot;, when he died.

President Harry S. Truman in his famous letter to Paul Hume, music critic for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, referred to Pegler as a guttersnipe, and yet a gentleman compared to Hume, for the latter&#x27;s criticizing his daughter Margaret&#x27;s singing.

His attack on writer Quentin Reynolds led to a costly libel suit against him and his publishers, as a jury awarded Reynolds $175,001 in damages. In 1962, he lost his contract with King Features Syndicate, owned by Hearst, after he criticized Hearst executives. His late writing appeared sporadically in various publications.

In 1965, referring to Robert F. Kennedy, Pegler wrote: &quot;Some white patriot of the Southern tier will spatter his spoonful of brains in public premises before the snow flies.&quot; Kennedy was assassinated three years later, though by a Palestinian Arab.

==Personal life and death==
On August 28, 1922, Pegler, a Roman Catholic, married Julia Harpman, a onetime &quot;New York Daily News&quot; crime reporter, who was from a Jewish family in Tennessee. She died on November 8, 1955. In 1961, he married his secretary Maude Wettje.

Pegler died age 74 on June 24, 1969, in Tucson, Arizona of stomach cancer. He is interred in the Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne, New York.

* 1941: Pulitzer Prize for coverage of labor racketeers

==Legacy==

===Parodies===
Pegler&#x27;s distinctive writing style was often the subject of parody. In 1949, Wolcott Gibbs of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; imagined a Peglerian tirade to a little girl asking whether there was a Santa Claus (parodying the famous &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot; letter). In the Gibbs/Pegler version, &quot;Santa Claus&quot; was actually Sammy Klein of Red Hook, Brooklyn, and had raped a six-year-old as a deliberate strategy to avoid being drafted into World War I. After joining the Communist Party, he adopted his alias and began his Christmas racket by hijacking trucks with toy shipments. Gibbs&#x27; parody opens: You&#x27;re damn right there is a Santa Claus, Virginia. He lives down the road a piece from me, and my name for him is Comrade Jelly Belly, after a poem composed about him once by an admiring fellow-traveller now happily under the sod. &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; ran a Pegler parody in its February 1957 issue (#31), using the actual title of Pegler&#x27;s own column from 1944 on, &quot;As Pegler Sees It&quot;. Starting with a report on a little kid stealing a bike, it devolved into a long tirade against, among other targets, Roosevelt, Truman, the Falange, organized labor, municipal corruption and Abeline&#x27;s Boy Scout Troop 18 (AKA the Abraham Lincoln Brigade). Every third sentence or so ended with some variation on “And you know what I think of Eleanor Roosevelt”. The mock column concluded with: ... which brought together such Commie-loving cronies as you know what I think of Eleanor Roosevelt. It stinks. The whole thing stinks. You stink. &quot;Mad&quot; also parodied him as &quot;Westbank Piglet&quot; in one panel (p. 2) of its first comic book parody Superduperman (issue #4).

===Quotes===
Interest in Pegler was briefly revived when a line originally written by him appeared in Republican Vice-Presidential nominee Sarah Palin&#x27;s acceptance speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. &quot;We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty and sincerity and dignity&quot;, she said, attributing it to &quot;a writer.&quot; The speech was written by Matthew Scully, a senior speech writer for George W. Bush.

In a column about Palin&#x27;s use of the quote, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; columnist Thomas Frank described Pegler as &quot;the all-time champion of fake populism&quot;.

==Writings==
Pegler&#x27;s literary agent was George T. Bye, who was also Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s agent.

Pegler published three volumes of his collected writings:
*&quot;T&#x27;ain&#x27;t Right&quot;, 1936
*&quot;The Dissenting Opinions of Mister Westbrook Pegler&quot;, 1938
*&quot;George Spelvin, American and Fireside Chats&quot;, 1942

<doc id="495248" wikidata="Q1477230" url="?curid=495248" title="Ostiarius">
<text>An ostiarius, a Latin word sometimes anglicized as ostiary but often literally translated as porter or [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]], originally was an enslaved person or guard posted at the entrance of a building, similarly to a gatekeeper.

In the Roman Catholic Church, this &quot;porter&quot; became the lowest of the four minor orders prescribed by the Council of Trent. This was the first order a seminarian was admitted to after receiving the tonsure. The porter had in ancient times the duty of opening and closing the church-door and of guarding the church, especially to ensure no unbaptised persons would enter during the Eucharist. Later on, the porter would also guard, open and close the doors of the sacristy, baptistry and elsewhere in the church.

The porter was not a part of holy orders administering sacraments but simply a preparatory job on the way to the major orders: subdiaconate (until its suppression, after the Second Vatican Council by Pope Paul VI), diaconate and the priesthood. Like the other minor orders and the subdiaconate, it is retained in societies such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter.

==History==
In the Roman period, an &quot;ostiarius&quot; was an enslaved person whose duty was to guard the entrance of an upper-class citizen&#x27;s house, sometimes being chained to the doorway to prevent flight. A basilica originally served as a Roman court of law, and it was the duty of the ostiarius to regulate the approach of litigants to the judge.

When, from the end of the second century, the Christian communities began to own houses for holding church services and for purposes of administration, church ostiaries are soon mentioned, at least for the larger cities. They are first referred to in the letter of Pope Cornelius to Bishop Fabius of Antioch written in 251, where it is said that there were then at Rome 46 priests, 7 deacons, 7 subdeacons, 42 acolytes, and 52 exorcists, lectors, and ostiaries, or doorkeepers. According to the statement of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, an ostiary named Romanus suffered martyrdom in 258 at the same time as St. Lawrence.

In Western Europe the office of the ostiary was the lowest grade of the minor clergy. In a law of 377 of the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; intended for the Vicariate of Italy, the ostiaries are also mentioned among the clergy who have a right to personal immunity. In his letter of 11 March 494, to the bishops of southern Italy and Sicily, Pope Gelasius says that for admission into the clergy it was necessary that the candidate could read (must, therefore, have a certain amount of education), for without this prerequisite an applicant could, at the most, only fill the office of an ostiary.

In Rome itself this office attained to no particular development, as a large part of these duties, namely the physical work necessary in the church building, what is now probably the duty of the sexton, was at Rome performed by the mansionarii. The clergy of the three lower grades (minor orders) were united at Rome into the &quot;Schola cantorum&quot; (choir) and as such took part in the church ceremonies. There are no special prayers or ceremonies for the ordination of the lower clergy in the oldest liturgical books of the Roman Church.

For the Gallican Rite, short statements concerning the ordination of the lower orders, among them that of the ostiaries, are found in the &quot;Statuta ecclesiæ antiqua&quot; a collection of canons which appeared at Arles about the beginning of the sixth century. The &quot;Sacramentarium Gelasianum&quot; and the &quot;Missale Francorum&quot; contain the same rite with the prayers used on this occasion.

According to these the ostiaries are first instructed in their duties by the archdeacon; after this he brings them before the bishop who takes the keys of the church from the altar and hands them to the candidate for ordination with the words: &quot;Fulfil thine office to show that thou knowest that thou wilt give account to God concerning the things that are locked away under these keys.&quot; Then follows a prayer for the candidate and a prayer for the occasion that the bishop pronounces over him. This ceremony was also at a later date adopted by the Roman Church in its liturgy.

In Latin Western Europe, outside of Rome, in the late Roman era and the one following, the ostiaries were still actually employed as guardians of the church buildings and of their contents. This is shown by the epitaph of one Ursatius, an ostiary of Trier. An ostiary of the church of Salona is also mentioned in an epitaph. Later, however, in the Latin Church the office of ostiary universally remained only one of the degrees of ordination and the actual work of the ostiary was transferred to the laity (sacristans, sextons, etc.).

In the ordination of ostiaries their duties are thus enumerated in the Pontifical: &quot;Percutere cymbalum et campanam, aperire ecclesiam et sacrarium, et librum ei aperire qui prædicat&quot; (to ring the bell, to open the church and sacristy, to open the book for the preacher). The forms of prayer for the ordination are similar to those in the old Gallican Rite.

In the East there were also doorkeepers in the service of the Church. They are enumerated as ecclesiastical persons by the Council of Laodicea (c. 343–381). Like the acolytes and exorcists, they were only appointed to serve the church, but received no actual ordination and were not regarded as belonging to the ecclesiastical hierarchy. According to the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; belonging to the end of the fourth century the guarding of the door of the church during the service was the duty of the deacons and subdeacons. Thus the doorkeepers exercised their office only when service was not being held.

The minor order no longer exists officially in the Eastern Catholic Churches and was abolished in the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Paul VI in his apostolic letter, &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; of August 15, 1972.

<text>African Lion Safari is a family-owned safari park in Southern Ontario, Canada, located between the cities of Hamilton and Cambridge, located west of Toronto. Guests may tour seven game reserves, with a total area of about , on tour buses or in visitors&#x27; own vehicles, where animals roam freely in contained areas. Accompanying the game reserves is a walking section where exotic birds and primates, as well as the park&#x27;s herd of Asian elephants, are on display.

African Lion Safari is an accredited member of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and is also a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), the International Elephant Foundation (IEF) as well as the International Association of Avian Trainers and Educators (IAATE).

==History==
This safari park was founded by Gordon Debenham &quot;Don&quot; Dailley, a retired Canadian Army colonel, and opened its doors on August 21, 1969. Dailley initially partnered with the Chipperfield family from England to purchase four farms in the Rockton, Ontario area totaling . He bought out the Chipperfields in the early 1970s. It remains privately owned, and the only significant feature was the drive-through reserve. In 1971, the park began working with Asian elephants, and in 1985 they started to make a concentrated effort to breed Asian elephants. Over the years, successful breeding of 30 endangered species and 20 threatened species has occurred in the park.

==Exhibits==

===Reserves===
On any of the seven reserves, visitors are caged in their car and the animals roam in large enclosures that range from .
In the Nairobi Sanctuary, visitors can see Ankole-Watusi cattle, llamas, European white storks, Egyptian geese, and grey crowned cranes on a large open field with a pond.

Between the Nairobi Sanctuary and the Simba Lion Country is the cheetah breeding centre, which is home to cheetahs. There are several enclosures in the preserve where the cheetahs live either separately or grouped.

Simba Lion Country is home to African lions. In it exists a structure made out of rocks for the lions to rest or play on.

Timbavati Lion Country is home to white lions, also known as Timbavati lions. Much like Simba Lion Country, it too has a rock structure.

Wankie Bushland Trail is home to olive baboons, bongo, zebu, and Malayan tapirs. The baboons&#x27; tower is a house and a playground for them.
The Rocky Ridge Veldt includes Rothschild&#x27;s giraffes, Grant&#x27;s zebras, wildebeest, Common eland, Barbary sheep, ostrich, white rhinoceroses, addax, and scimitar oryx. Inside this open field are shelters, shade structures, and several piles of rocks for animals to climb on.

The Australasia reserve includes Himalayan tahr, yak, nilgai, Indian rhinoceroses, western grey kangaroos, red kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, and Sicilian donkeys. In smaller fenced areas on the periphery of this reserve are enclosures for Turkmenian (Bukharan) markhor and Sichuan takin. This reserve is a mix of trees, grass and pond.

The North America reserve is home to American Bison, Elk, Fallow Deer, and Markhor. There are two feeding areas on this large open field.

==Breeding programs==

The park is involved in the International Species Survival Plans for Asian elephants, cheetahs, White rhinos, and Cinereous vultures. It has provided captive bred Barn owls, Burrowing owls, Trumpeter swans, Ferruginous Hawks, and a Bald eagle to reintroduction programs for release into the wild.

The park currently claims to have the most successful Asian elephant breeding program in North America, and in 2008 became home to the first third generation Asian elephant in North America. It has received several CAZA awards, including those recognizing outstanding achievements in the care of both cheetahs and giraffes.

In 2010, &quot;Jake&quot; became African Lion Safari&#x27;s first successful Asian elephant birth from an artificial insemination, and the first birth of this kind in Canada.

== Controversies ==
A demonstration was held at African Lion Safari on Saturday, May 4, 2013. Animal rights activists from the Grassroots Ontario Animal Liberation Network staged a protest during the Safari&#x27;s opening day to raise awareness about issues surrounding the use of exotic animals for entertainment and to expose the park as a for-profit business based on animal exploitation. Activists also claimed that the use of bull hooks during elephant shows at the park were cruel and archaic.

In March 2021, animal protection organization In Defense of Animals named African Lion Safari as the worst zoo for elephants in its annual report, citing cruel training methods, exposure to Hamilton&#x27;s harsh winter climate, constant zoo transfers, and breeding processes. Concerns were also expressed towards a plan to sell two elephants to Fort Worth Zoo - which ranked second on the said report - for $2,000,000.

==Incidents==
In November 1989, Omar Norton, a 21-year-old part-time employee and biology student at McMaster University was crushed to death by a five-tonne bull elephant named Tusko while trying to break up a fight between it and another elephant.

In April 1996, a couple driving through the game reserve were mauled by a Bengal tiger (which the zoo no longer exhibits). They later launched a lawsuit against the park which took several years to resolve. Finally in January 2005, a court awarded them and their families $2.5 million.

In June 2019, a trainer was airlifted to hospital after being attacked by one of the safari&#x27;s elephants.

<text>Penza (, ) is the largest city and administrative center of Penza Oblast, Russia. It is located on the Sura River, southeast of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, Penza had a population of 517,311, making it the 36th-largest city in Russia.

== Etymology ==
The city name is a hydronym and means in () from &quot;pen&quot; &#x27;end of (genitive)&#x27; and &quot;sa(ra)&quot; &#x27;swampy river&#x27;.

==Geography==
===Urban layout===

This central quarter occupies the territory on which the wooden fortress Penza was once located, therefore it is sometimes called the Serf. The architectural concept of the old fortress, erected on the eastern slope of the mountain above the river, predetermined the direction of the first streets. The direction and location of the first streets were set by the passage towers of the fortress and the orientation of its walls. This is how the first six streets of the city were formed. Subsequently, the names were fixed to them: Governor&#x27;s, Lekarskaya, Moscow, Nikolskaya, Sadovaya and Teatralnaya.

An important element of the urban development of the city is that the square of the fortress created a network of streets converging at right angles. Initially, there was no proper harmony in them. Often the difficult terrain of the area forced the direction and width of the road to change. Here and there, spontaneous development took shape. Nevertheless, the urban planning matrix was created and predetermined the development of the city for several centuries. During the reign of Empress Catherine the Great, the first general plan of Penza was drawn up, it was approved on 6 October 1785. The city was rebuilt anew in accordance with the rectilinear structure of St. Petersburg. The plan of the city, in its central part practically did not change, as it fully complied with the new norms of Russian urban planning. The mutually perpendicular orientation of the streets and the accompanying division of the urban environment into standard quarters was the original and distinctive feature of Penza. Perhaps Penza owes this to its first builders, who are well acquainted with the European urban planning trends of the 17th century - the German Joseph von Sommer (Lieutenant Colonel of the Moscow Service Osip Zumerovsky) and the Polish nobleman Yuri Kotransky. At the end of the next 18th century, in the process of implementing Catherine&#x27;s master plan for Penza, only some sections of the old streets were straightened, the standard width of the roadway and sidewalks was set. The redevelopment of the city was preceded by the resettlement of the serving suburban population from the center to suburban villages and wastelands. Newly carved quarters of the Upland part of the city, more comfortable for living, were inhabited by the nobility and eminent merchants.
Initially, the fortress was not only a defense complex, but also the administrative center of a vast region. On that place the governor, archives, treasury, prison, arsenal and other instruments of the regional statehood were settled. In the fortress there was the main cathedral of the region – Spassky and the main square of the city – Cathedral. In accordance with the General Plan of 1785, the dilapidated fortress, trading rows and philistine buildings adjacent to its walls were dismantled. As a result of clearing, the posadskaya Nikolskaya church came out of the environment of spontaneous buildings and acquired a harmonious look, becoming a true decoration of the city.

For several years, on the territory of the central quarter and adjacent streets, state-owned stone buildings were complexly erected: the bishop&#x27;s courtyard, the governor&#x27;s residence, the assembly of the nobility and two buildings of public places (7.1 and 7.4).) By the beginning of the 20th century, private residential There are no buildings left in the Fortress Quarter of the city. In the Fortress Quarter there is also a special administrative street of the city – the Line of Public Places, passing from Sadovaya to Moskovskaya, bypassing the Spassky Cathedral. It has never had and still does not have residential buildings. the eastern earthen rampart of the old Penza fortress The ancient defensive rampart runs along the western side of Kirov Street (on this section, Kirov Street was formerly called Teatralnaya Street).

The Cathedral was destroyed by the Communists in 1934, and rebuilt between 2010 and 2022.

==Paleontology==
In 1927, a fragmentary skull of the giant marine reptile &quot;Mosasaurus hoffmanni&quot; was found in the Late Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) deposits near Mironositskoe cemetery, within Penza. This specimen became the first unequivocal record of this species in Russia. The exact place where fossil was collected is unknown, but, most likely, Prolomnaya Street is located there now. Belemnites &quot;Belemnitella lanceolata&quot; and &quot;B. americana&quot; were also collected from Maastrichtian layers along the banks of the Sura River in Penza area. Tsaregradskii (1926) reports about the oyster &quot;Ostrea praesinzowi&quot; from the same deposits. In addition, these layers contain a mixed complex of microfaunal characteristics of the Turonian (&quot;Bolivinita couvigeriniformis&quot;), Santonian (&quot;Reussia subrotundata&quot;) and Maastrichtian (&quot;Bolivina incrassata&quot;) ages, indicating that all of these deposits were eroded and redeposited.

==History==

Penza was founded as a Russian frontier fortress-city, and to this day, remnants of the Lomovskaya sentry line built in 1640 have been preserved at the western edge of the city, and remains of earth ramparts dating from the mid-16th century are preserved in the city center. Until 1663, Penza was a wooden stockade with only a small settlement. In May 1663, the architect Yuri Kontransky arrived in Penza on the Tsar&#x27;s orders to direct the construction of a fortress city, as part of a wider fortress building program to protect Russia from attacks by Crimean Tatars. The initial construction consisted of a wooden Kremlin, a village, and quarters for the nobility, small tradesmen, and merchants. The Muscovite government placed the Cossacks here, who constructed a fortress and called it &quot;Cherkassy Ostroh&quot;, from which the regional city of Penza has developed, thanks to the arrival of new settlers, particularly Russians. The Cossack roots of the city and its first settlers are now remembered in the names of Cherkasskaya street, along with the &quot;Cherkassy&quot; historical district.

In 1774, the insurgent army led by Yemelyan Pugachev occupied Penza after the citizens of the city welcomed the rebellious Cossacks. The first stone houses started to appear after 1801, and by 1809 Penza&#x27;s population had grown to more than 13,000 people.

In 1918, Vladimir Lenin sent a telegram to communists in the Penza area, complaining about the &quot;insurrection of five kulak districts&quot;. He urged the public hanging of 100 &quot;landlords, richmen, bloodsuckers&quot;, grain seizure, and hostage-liberation. This telegram has been used in several historical works on the period and on Lenin. During the Russian Civil War, the Czechoslovak Legions launched an anti-Bolshevik uprising in Penza.

During the Soviet period, the city developed as a regional industrial center. The Ural mainframe was made here between 1959 and 1964.

Due to the vast landmass, the summer is much warmer than its 53°N latitude would suggest. The same factors also result in very cold winters by upper mid-latitude European standards. A heat wave in the months of June, July, and August 2010, raised temperatures from previous norms often by in Penza. Some of the higher fluctuations in temperatures were recorded with seven straight days of temperatures and higher compared to the previous year where the higher temperatures for the same period were, on average, lower.

<text>Schachdorf Ströbeck is a village in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, which since 1 January 2010 is part of the town of Halberstadt in the Harz district, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Located about west of the city centre, the &quot;Schachdorf&quot; (&quot;chess village&quot;) is known for its long historic connection with chess.

==History==

The first mention of &quot;Strebechi&quot; dates back to 995, when King Otto III of Germany dedicated the estate in the Eastphalian Harzgau to his sister Abbess Adelaide of Quedlinburg. In 1004 his successor King Henry II granted it to Drübeck Abbey. Ströbeck was a fief of the Bishopric of Halberstadt, later held by the comital House of Regenstein, from 1343 by the Counts of Wernigerode.

===Chess===
The main activity for which the village is known, occurred possibly in 1011. According to legend, Bishop Arnulf of Halberstadt had imprisoned Gunzelin of Kuckenburg, the deposed Margrave of Meissen, in the &quot;Wartturm&quot;, a tower in Ströbeck, and ordered the local farmers to guard him. Due to the boredom in his prison, Gunzelin created a chess set and taught his guards the game.

The game was first mentioned in a 1515 deed, when it had become a tradition among the local people, even though at that time chess was only played elsewhere by nobles and clerics. The Ströbeck tradition was described by Duke Augustus II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel &quot;alias&quot; Gustavus Selenus in his 1616 book &quot;Chess or the King&#x27;s Game&quot;. Ströbeck is also mentioned in H. J. R. Murray&#x27;s 1913 work &quot;A History of Chess&quot;.

In 1651, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg awarded a chess board to the townspeople for their proficiency in the game. It is preserved in a local museum.

Chess continued to be a strong part of Ströbeck&#x27;s culture and when they village issued its own currency (&quot;Notgeld&quot;) during the First World War, it featured images of chessboards.

==Chess traditions==

An international chess tournament is annually held. Since the late 17th century, famous chess matches are regularly illustrated by human chess performances with actors in the guise of pieces. The local elementary school, named after Emanuel Lasker, is the only public school in Germany which teaches chess as part of the curriculum, and it had done so since 1823; just as the Ströbeck secondary school, which was closed in 2004, due to too few pupils.

A local chess museum opened in 1991. Among the exhibits are an elaborate chess set, donated by the &quot;Great Elector&quot; Frederick William of Brandenburg in 1651, as well as several 12 x 8 boards for Courier Chess.

==Notable residents==
*Edward Salomon (1827–1909), politician. governor of Wisconsin
*Frederick Salomon, general in the American Civil War

<doc id="495256" wikidata="Q2371831" url="?curid=495256" title="Culture of Mongolia">
<text>The culture of Mongolia has been shaped by the country&#x27;s nomadic tradition and its position at the crossroads of various empires and civilizations. Mongolian culture is influenced by the cultures of the Mongolic, Turkic, and East Asian peoples, as well as by the country&#x27;s geography and its history of political and economic interactions with other nations.

One of the most distinctive aspects of Mongolian culture is its nomadic pastoral economy, which has shaped the traditional way of life for the Mongols for centuries. The nomadic lifestyle is centered around the family and the community, and involves the herding of 5 main animals including sheep, goat, horse, cow, camel and some yaks. This way of life has had a significant impact on Mongolian culture, influencing everything from the country&#x27;s social relationships and family structures to its art, music, and literature.

Mongolian culture is also well known for its traditional arts, which include music, dance, and literature. The country&#x27;s music and dance traditions are closely connected to its nomadic past and are an important part of its cultural heritage. Mongolian literature, on the other hand, has a long and varied history, and includes both oral and written traditions.

Mongolian culture is also known for its distinctive architectural style, which reflects the country&#x27;s nomadic tradition and its harsh weather during the winter months and rugged landscape. Mongolian homes or known as &quot;ger&quot; circular in shape and are constructed using a variety of materials including felt and wooden parts. The interior of a traditional Mongolian &quot;ger&quot; is portable and can be easily dismantled and reassembled, making them well-suited to the nomadic lifestyle.

In addition to its traditional architecture, Mongolian culture is also known for its handicrafts and folk art. Mongolian folk art includes a wide range of crafts and decorative arts, such as woodcarving, metalworking, embroidery, and weaving. These crafts are often passed down from generation to generation and are an important part of the country&#x27;s cultural heritage. Mongolian handicrafts and folk art are often sold as souvenirs to tourists and are an important source of income for many Mongolian families.

Mongolian culture is also strongly influenced by its equestrian and wrestling traditions, which have played a central role in the country&#x27;s history and continue to be an important part of its cultural identity today. In addition to these cultural traditions, Mongolia is home to a number of festivals and celebrations that reflect the country&#x27;s rich cultural heritage, including the Naadam Festival and Tsagaan Sar, which is a national holidays that celebrates Mongolian culture and history.

==Material tradition==

===Clothing===
Mongolian traditional clothing has changed little since the days of the empire because it is supremely well-adapted to the conditions of life on the steppe and the daily activities of pastoral nomads. However, there have been some changes in styles which distinguish modern Mongolian dress from historic costume. The deel, or kaftan, is the Mongolian traditional garment worn on workdays and special days. It is a long, loose gown cut in one piece with the sleeves; it has a high collar and widely overlaps at the front. The deel is girdled with a sash. Mongolian deels always close on the wearer&#x27;s right and traditionally have five fastenings. Modern deels often have decoratively cut overflaps, small round necklines, and sometimes contain a Mandarin collar.

Depictions of Mongols during the time of the empire, however, show deels with more open necklines, no collars, and very simply cut overlaps, similar to the deels still worn by lamas in modern Mongolia. In addition to the deel, men and women might wear loose trousers beneath, and men may have worn skirts during the later Buddhist period, and women might wear underskirts, but in fact it appears on some Mongol paintings women wore wide trousers gathered at ankle, similar to shalwar or Turkish trousers. Skirts of the same style are still worn in part of Mongolia and China today; they have plain front and back panels with closely pleated side panels. Paintings of Mongols from Persian and Chinese sources depict men, and often women, wearing their hair in braids. The hair would be divided into two pigtails, each of which would be divided into three braids. The ends of the braids would then be looped up and bound to the top of the braid behind the ears. Men shaved the tops and sides of their heads, usually leaving only a short &quot;forelock&quot; in front and the long hair behind. The famous bogtag headdress worn by women seems to have been restricted to married women of very high rank.

Each ethnic group living in Mongolia has its own deel design distinguished by cut, color, and trimming. Before the revolution, all social strata in Mongolia had their own manner of dressing. Livestock breeders, for example, wore plain deels, which served them both summer and winter. The priests wore yellow deels with a cape or khimj thrown over it. Secular feudal lords put on smart hats and silk waistcoats.

===Cuisine===

Traditional Mongolian cuisine is primarily based on meat and dairies, with some regional variations. The most common meat local people consume is mutton, in the southern region local people also consume camel meat, and in the other parts mutton, beef, goat, horse and yak meat. Dairy products are made from mostly cow&#x27;s milk and some from yak and goat including cheese, curds, creams and other dessert type dairies. There is also a traditional alcohol drink made from fermented mare&#x27;s milk called (Airag). Popular dishes include buuz (meat dumpling), khuushuur (a meat pastry), khorkhog (a meat stew, usually a special meal for guests), and boortsog (a sweet biscuit). However, being a country wrapped in China and Russia for a long time, the current Mongolian cuisine has its evolution that adapted from both Chinese and Russian dishes that turned into Mongolian style including goulash (slow cooked meat with gravy and vegetables served with rice and mashed potato), tsuivan (stir fried noodle with meat, potatoes and carrots), various stir-fried dishes and soups with veggies and meat. 

===Cultural artifact controversy===
On May 20, 2012, a rare skeleton of a &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;, also known as &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot;, was sold to an undisclosed buyer for $1,052,500 at an auction in New York City, United States, despite efforts by Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia to stop the sale. The Mongolian government is concerned about maintaining control over fossils and cultural relics while scientists worry about such items disappearing into private collections. A smuggler was convicted in a New York court in December 2012 for looting &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot; skeletons originating from Mongolia and transporting them to the United States for sale.

===Ger (yurts)===

The ger (yurts) is part of the Mongolian national identity. The &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot; mentions Genghis Khan as the leader of all people who live in felt tents, called gers, and even today a large share of Mongolia&#x27;s population lives in ger, even in Ulaanbaatar. &quot;Ger&quot; also means &quot;home&quot; in a broad sense, and other words are derived from its word stem. For example, &quot;gerlekh&quot; is a verb that means (&quot;to &quot;ger&quot;, to make a home&quot; &gt;) &quot;to marry.&quot;

==Literary tradition==

===Traditional values===
Among the topics that are mentioned from the oldest works of Mongolian literature to modern soft pop songs are love for mothers, parents and homesickness, a longing for the place where one grew up. Horses have always played an important role in daily life as well as in the arts. Mongolians have a lot of epic heroes from ancient times. Hospitality is so important in the steppes that it is traditionally taken for granted. The Mongolian word for hero, &quot;baatar&quot;, appears frequently in personal names, and even in the name of Mongolia&#x27;s capital, Ulaanbaatar, means &quot;red hero&quot; (, &quot;Ulan Bator&quot;). The word was introduced in the Middle Ages to many non-Mongolic languages by conquering Mongol-speaking nomads, and now exists in different forms such as the Bulgarian language, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Persian, North Indian and Georgian. Traditional words such as &quot;temuuleh&quot; signified a way to describe creativity and passion; &quot;temuuleh&quot; was used in several Mongol words and had the meaning: &quot;to rush headlong, to be inspired or to have a sense of creative thought, and even to take a flight of fancy.&quot; It can be seen from Mongolian perspective as &quot;the look in the eye of a horse that is racing where it wants to go, no matter what the rider wants.&quot;

===Literature===

The oldest completely passed down work of Mongolian literature is probably also the most well-known abroad: &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;. It does, however, contain passages of older poetry. Otherwise, few examples of Mongolian literature from the time of the Mongol Empire have come down in written form: about the mother and the area where one grew up were found in a soldier&#x27;s grave at the Volga river in 1930, 25 manuscript and block print fragments were found in Turpan in 1902/03, Pyotr Kozlov brought some fragments from Khara-Khoto in 1909.

Other pieces of literature have long been orally traded and typically consist of alliterative verses, and are known as Üligers, literally meaning tales. They include the proverbs attributed to Genghis Khan, and the epics around the Khan&#x27;s life, or the one about his two white horses. Other well-known epics deal with Geser Khan. Famous Oirad epics are Jangar, Khan Kharangui, Bum Erdene, and more.

Beginning from the 17th century, a number of chronicles have been preserved. They also contain long alliterative passages. Notable examples are the Altan Tovch by Luvsandanzan and another anonymous work of the same title, Sagang Sechen&#x27;s Erdeniin Tovch, Lomi&#x27;s History of the Borjigin clan (&quot;Mongol Borjigin ovgiin tüükh&quot;), and many more.

Already at the time of the Mongol empire, samples of Buddhist and Indian literature became known in Mongolia. Another wave of translations of Indian/Tibetan texts came with Mongolia&#x27;s conversion to Tibetan Buddhism in the late 16th/ early 17th centuries. Beginning in the 1650s, copies of religious texts like the Kanjur and Tanjur and also of epics like Geser Khan began to appear as block prints. These prints were mainly produced in Beijing, but also in some Mongolian monasteries.

In Mongolia&#x27;s time under the Qing dynasty, a number of Chinese novels were translated into Mongolian. At the same time, social discontent and an awakening Mongol nationalism lead to the creation of works like Injanash&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Blue Chronicle&quot; or the stories about &quot;Crazy&quot; Shagdar.

Beginning with the works of Tseveen Jamsrano and other Buryats in the 1910s, many important works of Russian and European literature, or at least those that were not politically incorrect, were translated into Mongolian in the 20th century.

Religious theatre plays about the Tibetan hermit Milarepa were already performed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest Mongolian drama known today, &quot;Moon Cuckoo&quot; (&quot;Saran khökhöö&quot;) was created by Danzanravjaa around 1831. The play got lost in the early 20th century, but in the meantime other theatre groups had developed. The first professional Mongolian theatre was founded in Ulaanbaatar in 1930. In the socialist period, every aimag got its own theatre. Since the 1990s, a number of small privately owned theatre companies, like &quot;Mask&quot; or &quot;Shine üe prodakshn&quot; have been founded. They heavily focus on light comedies and skits, and also regularly produce clips that are distributed on DVD or the internet.

=== Oral traditions and oral literature ===
The spoken storytelling traditions that led to Mongolian literature include &quot;heroic epics, legends, tales, yörööl (the poetry of good wishes), and magtaal (the poetry of praise)&quot;.

==Fine arts==
Before the 20th century, most works of the fine arts in Mongolia had a religious function, and therefore Mongolian fine arts were heavily influenced by religious texts. Thangkas were usually painted or made in applique technique. Bronze sculptures usually showed Buddhist deities. A number of great works are attributed to the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Zanabazar.

In the late 19th century, painters like &quot;Marzan&quot; Sharav turned to more realistic painting styles. Under the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, socialist realism was the dominant painting style, however traditional &quot;thangka&quot;-like paintings dealing with secular, nationalist themes were also popular, a genre known as &quot;Mongol &quot;zurag&quot;&quot;.

Among the first attempts to introduce modernism into the fine arts of Mongolia was the painting &quot;Ehiin setgel&quot; (&quot;Mother&#x27;s love&quot;) created by Tsevegjav in the 1960s. The artist was purged as his work was censored.

All forms of fine arts flourished only after &quot;Perestroika&quot; in the late 1980s. Otgonbayar Ershuu is an important painter of the time, he was portrayed in the film &quot;ZURAG&quot; by Tobias Wulff.

==Religion==

Since ancient times Tengrism and Shamanism have been the dominant belief systems of the Mongols and still retain significant importance in their mythology. During the era of the Great Khans, Mongolia practiced freedom of worship which is still a defining element of the Mongol character. In the 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism became the dominant religion in Mongolia. Traditional Shamanism was, except in some remote regions, suppressed and marginalized. On the other hand, a number of shamanic practices, like ovoo worshiping, were incorporated into Buddhist liturgy.

Tibetan Buddhism is a ritualistic religion with a large number of deities. This inspired the creation of religious objects including images in paintings and sculptures.

After the Stalinist purges in the 1930s, both Buddhism and Shamanism were virtually outlawed in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. In Inner Mongolia, traditional religion was heavily affected by the Cultural Revolution. Since the 1990s, a number of Christian sects are trying to gain a foothold in Mongolia. About 4% of the Mongolian population is Muslim. Mongolians have also been known to live in some Latvian and Lithuanian regions because they are so close to the Russian border

==Customs and superstitions==
Mongolians traditionally were afraid of misfortunes and believe in good and evil omens. Misfortune might be attracted by talking about negative things or by persons that are often talked about. They might also be sent by some malicious shaman enraged by breaking some taboo, like stepping on a yurt&#x27;s threshold, desecrating waters or mountains, etc.

The most endangered family members were children. They are sometimes given non-names like &quot;Nergui&quot; () or &quot;Enebish&quot; (), or boys would be dressed up as girls. &quot;Since people of the steppe received only one name in life, its selection carried much symbolism, often on several levels; the name imparted to the child its character, fate and destiny.&quot; Before going out at night, young children&#x27;s foreheads are sometimes painted with charcoal or soot to deceive evil spirits that this is not a child but a rabbit with black hair on the forehead.

When passing ovoos (cairns) on a journey, they are often circumambulated and sweets or the like are sacrificed to have a safe trip. Certain ovoos, especially those on high mountains, are sacrificed to obtain good weather, ward off misfortune, and the like.

For a child, the first big celebration is the first haircut, usually at an age between three and five. Birthdays were not celebrated in the past, but today, birthday parties are popular. Wedding ceremonies traditionally include the hand-over of a new yurt (&quot;ger&quot;) to the marrying couple. Deceased relatives were usually put to rest in the open, where the bodies were eaten by animals and birds. Nowadays, bodies are usually buried.

==Festivities==

The most important public festivals are the Naadam (). The biggest one is held each year on July 11–13 in Ulaanbaatar, but there are also smaller ones on aimag and sum levels. A Naadam involves horse racing, wrestling, and archery competitions.

For families, the most important festival is Tsagaan Sar (), which is roughly equivalent to the Chinese New Year, but has nothing similar to Chinese New Year, and usually falls into January or February. Family members and friends visit each other, exchange presents - very popular presents for all opportunities are the khadag - and eat huge quantities of buuz.

Under the Soviet influence, New Year became a big holiday, and it is one of the biggest celebrations, comparable to Christmas in the West.

==Entertainment==
===Music===

Mongolia has a very old musical tradition. Key traditional elements are throat-singing, the Morin Khuur (horse headed fiddle) and other string instruments, and several types of songs. Mongolian melodies are typically characterized by pentatonic harmonies and long end notes.

In the 20th century, western style classical music has been introduced, and mixed with traditional elements by some composers. Later on the full palette of Pop and Rock music has also been adopted by younger musicians.

The Mongolian Waltz is a dance unique to Mongolia. Typically, one mounted horseman and one mounted horsewoman circle each other in time to a traditional song, which speeds up as it progresses. The three step gait of the horses, as they circle, gives the dance its name.

===Cinema===

In socialist times, movies were treated as a propaganda instrument by the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. The first topics were popular legends and revolutionary heroes like in Sükhbaatar. In the 1950s, the focus shifted to working class heroes, as in New Year. The 1970s saw many documentaries and everyday life stories as in The Clear Tamir.

After democratization, film makers turned to international partners for support, as in the Japanese-Mongolian co-production Genghis Khan. Independent directors like Dorjkhandyn Turmunkh and Byambasuren Davaa created movies that connected ancient traditions and mythology, and how they may relate to life in a modern world. Byambasuren&#x27;s The Story of the Weeping Camel was nominated for an Academy Award as foreign documentary in 2005.

===Games===

Popular board games are chess and checkers. The chess figures are &quot;noyon&quot; (noble = king), &quot;bers&quot; (cp. &quot;bars&quot; &quot;tiger&quot; = queen), &quot;temee&quot; (camel = bishop), &quot;mori&quot; (horse = knight), &quot;tereg&quot; (cart = castle), &quot;khüü&quot; (boy = pawn). The rules used today are the same as in European chess, although there are differing versions called &#x27;Mongolian Chess&#x27; (shatar) and &#x27;Daur Chess&#x27;.

Dominoes are played widely. Indigenous card games existed in the 19th century but are now lost. One of the popular card games that is played is Muushig and various other modern card games are very popular among the younger generations such as 13 (similar to poker). 

Sheep anklebones, or shagai, are used in games, as dice or as token. Not only they use anklebones as a token, but also they have number of games only using “shagai” itself. Rock, paper, scissors and morra-like games are also played. Wood knots and disentanglement puzzles have traditionally been popular.

Mongolian children were known to have played an ice game on frozen rivers that is similar to curling.

<text>Royal Air Force Menwith Hill (RAF Menwith Hill) is a Royal Air Force station near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England, which provides communications and intelligence support services to the United Kingdom and the United States. The site contains an extensive satellite ground station and is a communications intercept and missile warning site. It has been described as the largest electronic monitoring station in the world.

RAF Menwith Hill is owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), but made available to the US Department of Defense (DoD) under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement 1951 and other, undisclosed agreements between the US and British governments. His Majesty&#x27;s Government (HMG) is entitled to possession of the site and retains control over its use and its facilities, though the administration of the base is the responsibility of the US authorities, with support provided by around 400 staff from Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), in addition to United States Air Force (USAF) and US National Security Agency (NSA) personnel. In 2014, the number of American personnel was reduced as part of a streamlining of operations due to improvements in technology.

The site acts as a ground station for a number of satellites operated by the US National Reconnaissance Office, on behalf of the NSA, with antennas contained in numerous distinctive white radomes, locally referred to as &quot;the golf balls&quot;, and is alleged to be an element of the ECHELON system.

The site is one of three main sites operated by the United States across the globe as a major satellite monitoring station and intelligence gathering location. The other two sites are located in America and Australia, having similar roles and working together with RAF Menwith Hill to develop knowledge around American, British and Australian interests. The Australian site is known as the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap.

==History==

=== Establishment of station (1954–1959) ===
In 1954, the British War Office purchased of land at Nessfield Farm, located approximately west of Harrogate, North Yorkshire. The area purchased soon increased to and were made available by the British Government to the United States Department of Defense. The site was considered by the US as suitable for gathering signals intelligence from the northern parts of Western Europe and Eastern Europe, specifically the Soviet Union and its associated Warsaw Pact countries. The Yorkshire Dales&#x27; low level of background radio noise made it an especially good location for the task. The UK provided assurances to the US that the site would be available to them for at least 21 years.

Construction of the station on behalf of the United States Army Security Agency (USASA) began in April 1956. Building costs at the time were $6.8 million as well as a further $1.2 million for personnel housing. Initially named Field Station 8613, the site was renamed 13th USASA Field Station on 1 January 1957 and again renamed on 1 January 1959, as Menwith Hill Station. Due to adverse ground conditions and weather, there were delays to the construction programme, with the station finally becoming operational during June 1959.

=== Early years (1960–1966) ===
Operationally, Menwith Hill was assigned to the USASA Headquarters in Frankfurt, West Germany, whereas for logistical support it was attached to the US Air Force&#x27;s Third Air Force, which at the time had its headquarters in the UK. Security at the station was provided by a US Army military police detachment and the British Air Ministry Constabulary. However, if the site was compromised during an invasion, three earth-covered bunkers contained ammunition and thermite charges which could be used to destroy classified equipment and material.

The station initially comprised a headquarters building, barracks, dependent housing and support facilities such as a cinema and social clubs. The operations building was located inside a secure compound, within a large antenna field, approximately from the main site. It was equipped with large high frequency (HF) directional rhombic antennas that could detect signals from around the globe. Over two-hundred Collins R-390A HF communications receivers were used to collect a vast range of signal in the HF band, including carrier waves, voice signals, and burst transmissions. Within the operations centre was the communications centre which was staffed by cryptographers using deciphering equipment, however a large amount of the signals collected were encrypted before being forwarded for processing to the US National Security Agency&#x27;s Fort Meade facility in Maryland.

=== Transfer to the National Security Agency (1966–1996) ===
In the 1960s, as a result of developments in digital technology and the increased use of satellites for signals intelligence, the specialist skills of engineers and technicians within the National Security Agency (NSA) and their contractors became increasingly important. Therefore, on 1 August 1966, with the agreement of the British Government, control of Menwith Hill Station was handed from the US Army to the NSA when it became a field element of the agency. The NSA expanded the station during the 1970s and 1980s, with the operations centre extended and new buildings erected. The first two radomes, designed to protect satellite receiver and transmission dishes (colloquially known as &#x27;golf balls&#x27; and now synonymous with the station) were installed in 1974, at which point around 800 personnel were believed to work there.

In 1976, 21 years after the initial tenure arrangements were agreed with the US, the British Government renewed assurances that the site would continue to be available for a further 21 years.

Menwith Hill came to public attention in 1980 when British magazine the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published an article which suggested that the station was the world&#x27;s largest phone tapping facility and highlighted the secrecy afforded to it by the British and US governments. Investigations found that during the early 1960s, Menwith Hill was integrated into the General Post Office&#x27;s microwave relay network known as &#x27;Backbone&#x27;, via a high-capacity underground cable link to the Hunters Stones communications tower, located approximately to the south of the station. It was alleged the link allowed mass interception of civilian telephone and telex communications between the United States, UK and Europe. At the time, eight radomes were now present at Menwith Hill, connecting it with other sites in the NSA&#x27;s satellite communications network and alleged to allow the surveillance of communications in foreign countries. In response to the article the NSA said &quot;We do radio relays - material comes in from a variety of places and is rerouted. It is a switching operation. We route it sometimes to the UK and sometimes to the US&quot;. The suggestion that national and international communications were monitored was denied.

A detachment of the US Army 704th Military Intelligence (MI) Brigade was established at Menwith Hill in 1985. In 1992, the detachment became A Company of the 743rd Military Intelligence Battalion, 704th MI Brigade.

The US Air Force&#x27;s 6951st Electronic Security Squadron was formed at Menwith Hill on 1 May 1991. It was later re-designated as the 451st Intelligence Squadron on 1 October 1993.

In 1995, the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) became the executive agent for Menwith Hill on behalf of the National Security Agency. INSCOM transformed A Company, 743rd Military Intelligence Battalion into the 713th Military Intelligence Group. In 2000, the group added a second company and was re-designated as the 109th Military Intelligence Group.

On 19 February 1996, the station was renamed RAF Menwith Hill, an administrative change to align the base with other sites made available to the United States by the United Kingdom.

During a 1997 court case, British Telecom revealed that in 1975, its predecessor, the Post Office, installed two cables between Menwith Hill and a coaxial cable that connected to the microwave radio station at Hunters Stones, which was part of the long-distance telephone network. This connection was replaced in 1992 by a new high capacity fibre-optic cable. Later, two additional cables were added over which telephone and other communications could go to and from the base. These cables were capable of transmitting over 100,000 phone calls simultaneously.

On 1 October 2000, the 451st Intelligence Squadron was re-designated as the 451st Information Operations Squadron, before reverting to the 451st Intelligence Squadron on 1April 2007.

On 19July 2002, US Army INSCOM transferred responsibility for administrative and logistical support for Menwith Hill to the US Air Force, to bring the site in-line with other facilities in the UK made available to the US. Notwithstanding, the US Army retained a presence and in place of the 109th Military Intelligence Group, INSCOM formed a provisional battalion designated as the Menwith Hill Battalion (Provisional). On 18 October 2008 the unit, under the command of a lieutenant colonel, was re-designated as the 307th Military Intelligence Battalion, subordinate to the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade headquartered at Wiesbaden, Germany. On 16 October 2009, the battalion was re-designated as the 709th Military Intelligence Battalion.

According to an article in a 2003 issue of an internal NSA newsletter, &quot;Menwith is a large site (several hundred NSA civilians)&quot;. In March 2012 researcher Steve Schofield of BASIC produced a 65-page report called &quot;Lifting the Lid on Menwith Hill&quot;, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and commissioned and published by the Yorkshire Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Menwith Hill&#x27;s primary mission is to provide &quot;intelligence support for UK, US and allied interests&quot;. The base&#x27;s multimillion-pound expansion, Project Phoenix, is &quot;one of the largest and most sophisticated high technology programs carried out anywhere in the UK over the last 10 years&quot;. Of the 1,800 employees in 2012, 400 were British and 1,200 were American employees of the NSA.

During the 2009 G-20 London Summit NSA intercept specialists based at Menwith Hill attempted to target and decode the encrypted telephone calls of the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.

The 451st Intelligence Squadron, was inactivated on 24 June 2015.

In November 2017, the site had 627 US staff and 578 UK staff.

== Facilities ==
Planning permission was granted in August 2019 for the construction of three new radomes at the site, bringing the total number to thirty-seven. The three new radomes would be in diameter and located in the southern part of the site.

Extension of the site means that it now covers .

== Role and operations ==

=== Ownership and administration ===
RAF Menwith Hill is owned by the British Ministry of Defence (MOD). Although designated as an RAF station, it is made available to the United States Department of Defense (DOD) under the 1951 NATO Status of Forces Agreement and other classified arrangements. The MOD retains control over the site&#x27;s use and facilities, however the administration of the site is the responsibility of the US authorities.

The US Air Force&#x27;s 421st Air Base Squadron provides Menwith Hill with base and mission support services. The squadron is part of the 423rd Air Base Group which in turn is part of the 501st Combat Support Wing, both of which have their headquarters at RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire.

=== Mission ===
According to the Royal Air Force &quot;RAF Menwith Hill is an integral part of the US DOD world-wide defence communications network. Its primary mission is to provide intelligence support for UK, US and allied interests.&quot; The site is a field station of the US National Security Agency (NSA), with personnel from other parts of the DOD also present. UK personnel from the MOD and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) are integrated into both the operational and administrative elements of the site.

In November 2017, the British Government advised that 1,205 personnel worked at the station, comprising 33 staff from the US military, 344 US contractors, 250 US civilians, 7 UK military (5 Royal Navy and 2 RAF), 85 UK contractors and 486 UK civilians (including those employed by GCHQ).

== Security ==
Site security is provided by the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP). One of three MDP Central Support Group units is based at Menwith Hill, providing armed officers who can be deployed regionally at short notice, to support wider MDP operations.

On 1 April 2006, RAF Menwith Hill was designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the station.

==ECHELON Interception System==

In 1988, investigative journalist Duncan Campbell revealed, in an article entitled &quot;Somebody&#x27;s listening&quot; and published in &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the existence of the ECHELON surveillance program, an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence Sigint. He also detailed how the eavesdropping operations worked. Duncan Campbell presented a report commissioned by STOA concerning the ECHELON system, at a &quot;hearing of the Committee on Citizens Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the subject the European Union and data protection&quot; which prompted the European Union to set up the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System.

On 5 July 2000, the European Union set up the European Parliament&#x27;s Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System stated that the global system for the interception of private and commercial communications was operating by means of &quot;cooperation proportionate to their capabilities&quot; among the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under the UKUSA. ... It seems likely ... that its name is in fact ECHELON.&quot; The Committee raised concerns about the incompatibility of the interception of private and commercial communications with the fundamental right to respect for private life (Article 8 of the ECHR). They were also concerned that interception of commercial communications could be used for &quot;competitive intelligence-gathering rather than combating corruption.&quot; During the early 1970s, the first of what became more than eight large satellite communications dishes were installed at Menwith Hill.

In 1999 he wrote a report on COMINT entitled &quot;Interception Capabilities 2000&quot; for the European Parliament.

In 1996 author and investigative journalist, Nicky Hager in his book entitled &quot;Secret Power: New Zealand&#x27;s Role in the International Spy Network&quot;, provided a detailed account of ECHELON, the worldwide electronic surveillance system used by an intelligence alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

On 3 November 1999, the BBC reported that they had confirmation from the Australian Government of the existence of a powerful &quot;global spying network&quot; codenamed Echelon, that can eavesdrop on every single phone call, fax or e-mail, anywhere on the planet&quot; with Britain and the United States as the chief protagonists. They confirmed that Menwith Hill was &quot;linked directly to the headquarters of the US National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade in Maryland.&quot;

==Demonstrations==
Between 1984 and 1995 a number of peace camps were established in close proximity to the station. A number of other individual protests have also taken place, predominantly related to nuclear proliferation and strategic missile defense. Protests also occurred at other US military locations in the UK such as Greenham Common.

Objections to the Strategic Defense Initiative have led to demonstrators storming the perimeter fence, and to demands in 2007 from Labour MPs for a full debate about missile defence and Menwith Hill. Actions continue into 2006.

One particular local activist, Lindis Percy, was prosecuted, over a protracted period, under a number of different laws.

In April 2012 activists affiliated with the global Occupy Movement held a four-day campsite at Menwith Hill. Protesters said they hoped the camp would &quot;reignite the debate locally, nationally and globally about whether the subversive and undemocratic nature of activities at the base are acceptable, or indeed accountable, to the British public. This debate however, never happened outside of the fringe elements of society.&quot;

<doc id="495262" wikidata="Q166877" url="?curid=495262" title="Emperor of Austria">
<text>The emperor of Austria (, ) was the ruler of the Austrian Empire and later the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The hereditary imperial title and office was proclaimed in 1804 by Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and continually held by him and his heirs until Charles I relinquished power in 1918.

The emperors retained the title of Archduke of Austria. The wives of the emperors held the title empress, while other members of the family held the titles of archduke or archduchess.

==Predecessors==
Members of the House of Austria, the Habsburg dynasty, had been the elected Holy Roman Emperors since 1438 (except for a five-year break from 1740 to 1745) and mostly resided in Vienna. Thus the term &quot;Austrian emperor&quot; may occur in texts dealing with the time before 1804, when no Austrian Empire existed. In these cases the word Austria means the composite monarchy ruled by the dynasty, not the country. A special case was Maria Theresa; she bore the imperial title as the consort of Francis I (r. 1745–1765), but she herself was the monarch of the Austrian hereditary lands including Bohemia and Hungary.

==The emperor==
In the face of aggressions by Napoleon I, who had been proclaimed Emperor of the French (French: &quot;Empereur des Français&quot;), by the Constitution of the Year XII on 18 May 1804, Francis II feared for the future of the Holy Roman Empire and wished to maintain his and his family&#x27;s imperial status in case the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved. Therefore, on 11 August 1804 he created the new title of &quot;Emperor of Austria&quot; for himself and his successors as heads of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. For two years, Francis carried two imperial titles: being Holy Roman Emperor Francis II and &quot;by the Grace of God&quot; (&quot;Von Gottes Gnaden&quot;) Emperor Francis I of Austria.

In 1805, an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz and the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old &quot;Reich&quot; (which at this time was only a powerless confederation) by motivating or pressuring several German princes to enter the separate Confederation of the Rhine with their lands in July. This led Francis II/I on 6 August 1806 to declare the Reich dissolved and to lay down the Imperial Crown created in the second half of the 10th century (today displayed at the Treasury of Hofburg Palace in Vienna).

From 1806 onwards, Francis was Emperor of Austria only. He had three successors—Ferdinand I, Francis Joseph I and Charles I—before the empire broke apart in 1918. A coronation ceremony was never established; the heir to the throne became emperor the moment his predecessor died or abdicated. The symbol of the Austrian emperor was the dynasty&#x27;s private crown dating back to Rudolf II (), (called &quot;Rudolfinische Hauskrone&quot; by the experts).

==Titles of the emperor==
The Austrian emperors had an extensive list of titles and claims that reflected the geographic expanse and diversity of the lands ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs. The grand title of the emperor of Austria had been changed several times: by a patent of 1 August 1804, by a court office decree from 22 August 1836, by an Imperial court ministry decree of 6 January 1867 and finally by a letter of 12 December 1867. Shorter versions were recommended for official documents and international treaties: &quot;Emperor of Austria, King of Bohemia etc. and Apostolic King of Hungary&quot;, &quot;Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary&quot;, &quot;His Majesty the Emperor and King&quot; and &quot;His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty&quot;.

The full list (after the loss of the Lombardy in 1859 and Venetia in 1866):

&quot;Emperor of Austria,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Apostolic King of Hungary,&quot;&lt;br&gt;

==House and court==
The function of the emperor was styled like a secular papacy. Therefore, it was the overall goal to demonstrate the all-highest (&quot;allerhöchste&quot;) majesty and dignity of the monarch to his subjects and to other monarchs and countries. His and his entourage&#x27;s life was governed by very strict rules all the time.

===The Imperial House===

The members of the House of Habsburg were ranked as princes and princesses of the blood imperial, with the honorary title of &quot;Erzherzog&quot; or &quot;Erzherzogin&quot; (archduke or archduchess). Their permanent address and their travels abroad had to be agreed to by the Emperor.

Whoever wanted to marry an archduke or archduchess of the Habsburg dynasty had to originate from a ruling or formerly ruling house, as was stipulated by the &quot;Familienstatut des Allerhöchsten Herrscherhauses&quot;, the Family Statute of the Highest Monarch&#x27;s House, issued by Ferdinand I in 1839. Otherwise the marriage would be one &quot;to the left hand&quot;, called a morganatic marriage, excluding the offspring of the couple from any right the House of Habsburg possessed. (The problems of such a situation were encountered when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the throne, married a simple countess in 1900).

To manage the political implications of the Imperial house after 1867 the Emperor and King appointed the &quot;k.u.k. Minister des kaiserlichen und königlichen Hauses und des Äußeren&quot; (the I.&amp; R. Minister of the Imperial and Royal House and of the Exterior), one of the three ministers common to Austria and Hungary. Under Francis I, Klemens von Metternich had covered these and many other agenda, bearing the title &quot;Haus-, Hof- und Staatskanzler&quot; (Chancellor of the House, the Court and the State).

===The Imperial Court===

The Emperor&#x27;s household, his personal officers and the premises where they worked were called &quot;Hof&quot; (&quot;court&quot;).&lt;br&gt; 
The four highest officials managing the Imperial Court, who were drawn from among the highest noblemen of the Empire, were 
*the Grand Master (&quot;Obersthofmeister&quot;), 
*the Grand Marshal (&quot;Obersthofmarschall&quot;), 
*the Grand Chamberlain (&quot;Oberstkämmerer&quot;), 
*the Master of the Stables (&quot;Oberststallmeister&quot;).

Whoever sought an audience with the Emperor himself had to apply at the Office of the Grand Master (&quot;Obersthofmeisteramt&quot;). Francis I used to wear civilian clothes of the Biedermeier era, while Francis Joseph I and Charles I mostly were seen in the uniform of an Austrian field marshal to underline the importance of the army to the throne. Francis Joseph I expected soldiers to appear in uniform at his court and civilians to appear in tails. He never shook hands with visitors; in letters he never addressed his subjects as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Mr.&quot; (&quot;Herr&quot;).

The Emperor&#x27;s court managed the following institutions:
* the Imperial Palace in Vienna (&quot;Hofburg&quot;); each of the four Emperors of Austria chose his living and working rooms in another part of this huge palace;
* the Imperial Treasury at Hofburg, where the Habsburgs&#x27; crown insignia were kept;
* the Imperial Court Library, today Austrian National Library
* Imperial residences outside Vienna, like Schönbrunn Palace (the area was included into the Vienna city area in 1892) and Laxenburg Palace;
* the court&#x27;s collection of carriages (today &quot;Wagenburg&quot; at Schönbrunn Palace Gardens);
* the I.R. &quot;Hofburgtheater&quot; and the I.R. &quot;Hofoperntheater&quot;;
* the Imperial Crypt below the Capuchin Church and Monastery in Vienna, where three of the four emperors of Austria have been buried (Charles I was buried on Madeira, his last exile).

==Austrian Empire==
The Austrian Empire (&quot;Kaisertum Österreich&quot;) from 1804 to 1867 consisted of the Habsburg lands as a whole, leaving each land its special definition as kingdom (e.g., Bohemia, Hungary), archduchy (Lower and Upper Austria), duchy (e.g., Carniola) or princely county (e.g., Tyrol), however the Kingdom of Hungary—as Regnum Independens—was administered by its own institutions separately from the rest of the empire. &quot;Kaisertum&quot; might literally be translated as &quot;emperordom&quot; on analogy with &quot;kingdom&quot; or &quot;emperor-ship&quot;; the term denotes specifically &quot;the territory ruled by an emperor&quot;. Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially between 1848 and 1859.

In 1866, Austria lost the war with Prussia and Italy. Francis Joseph I was urged to solve the internal problems of his realm and was well-advised to provide a substantial concession to the Hungarian nobility, which had stayed in passive resistance to him after the crushed Hungarian revolution of 1848- 1849. By the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (&quot;Ausgleich&quot;), the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria, as two separate entities, joined on an equal basis to form the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Thus the former Habsburg-ruled lands were restructured into a dual union which shared a monarch and a common army, navy and foreign policy. Transylvania became again an integral part of Hungary while Croatia-Slavonia were acknowledged as part of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, which were called Transleithania by government officials to distinguish them from Cisleithania, the Austrian part of the empire from 1867 onwards. The latter were known in the internal administration as the &quot;Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council&quot; (&quot;Die im Reichsrat vertretenen Königreiche und Länder&quot;). Unofficially ever since, these territories officially were called &quot;Austria&quot; from 1915 to 1918 only, despite the fact that all the citizens held the common Austrian citizenship since 1867.

Austria-Hungary disintegrated at the end of World War I in 1918, when the Austrian lands established their independence. Bohemia and Moravia in the newly created Czechoslovakia, Galicia joined Poland, while Bukovina became a part of Romania. Carniola and Dalmatia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Other territories were annexed by Italy (South Tyrol, Trieste and Istria). Yet the last Emperor, Charles I, used his imperial title until the end of his life. The Kingdom of Hungary, due to measures enacted during peace proceedings after the Great War and having terminated the 1867 compromise by 31 October 1918, similarly broke apart.

==Abbreviations of common and non common institutions==
The term &quot;Kaiserlich und Königlich&quot; (&quot;k.u.k.&quot;, spoken , meaning &quot;Imperial and Royal&quot;) was decreed in a letter of 17 October 1889 for the army, the navy and the institutions shared by both parts of the monarchy. Institutions of Cisleithania used the term &quot;Kaiserlich-Königlich&quot; (&quot;K.K.&quot;, meaning &quot;Imperial Royal&quot;, e.g. &quot;K.K. österreichische Staatsbahnen&quot;, Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways).

==List of emperors of Austria (1804–1918)==
==Succession to the throne==

The heir apparent to the throne bore the title of Crown Prince (&quot;Kronprinz&quot;); heirs presumptive were called &quot;Thronfolger&quot;, in addition to their title of archduke. Francis I was followed by Ferdinand Charles, (later Ferdinand I). In the wake of the 1848 revolutions, the empire&#x27;s existence was in danger. The Habsburg family tried a new start with a new emperor: Ferdinand I was urged to hand over government on 2 December 1848. He then moved to Prague Castle and, without laying down his imperial title, lived there privately until his death in 1875.

As Ferdinand I had no sons, his brother Francis Charles would have become emperor, but was persuaded by his wife Princess Sophie of Bavaria to pass over the right of succession to their son, Francis Joseph. He accepted the duty of the Emperor of Austria without having been Crown Prince or &quot;Thronfolger&quot; before. Francis Joseph&#x27;s only son Rudolf committed suicide in 1889, Francis Joseph&#x27;s brother Karl Ludwig died in 1896. Karl Ludwig&#x27;s son Franz Ferdinand became heir presumptive to the throne. He was assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia in 1914; due to his morganatic marriage, his son had no rights to the throne. At this time his younger brother Otto Franz had already died, which made Otto&#x27;s son Charles the new heir presumptive to the throne, to which he acceded in 1916 as Charles I, upon the death of Francis Joseph I. In this moment Charles I&#x27;s son, four-year-old Otto became the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. He declared himself a loyal citizen of the Republic of Austria in 1961.

==Heads of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (since 1918)==
Karl I did not see himself as a pretender but as the monarch of Austria, while the Habsburg Law of the Republic of Austria of 1919 called him &quot;the former bearer of the crown&quot; (&quot;der ehemalige Träger der Krone&quot;). His son Otto von Habsburg, who had used the title Archduke of Austria in his earlier life outside of Austria, declared himself a loyal citizen of the Republic in order to be allowed to enter Austria; from 1961 onwards he no longer considered himself pretender. Otto&#x27;s son Karl von Habsburg has never pretended to be the rightful monarch of Austria.

* Karl I of Austria (11 November 1918 – 1 April 1922)
* Otto von Habsburg (1 April 1922 – 1 January 2007)
* Karl von Habsburg (1 January 2007 – present)
** Heir apparent: Ferdinand Zvonimir von Habsburg
