<text>Manerplaw (; ) was a village in Kayin State, Myanmar (Burma), on the Moei River. It was the proposed capital of an independent state governed by the Karen people, known locally as Kawthoolei. Manerplaw was established in 1975 and had a population of around 3,000 in 1992 until its evacuation following military offensives by the government.

The headquarters of several opposition groups were located in Manerplaw, including those of the Karen National Union (KNU), the All Burma Students&#x27; Democratic Front (ABSDF), the Democratic Party for a New Society (DPNS), and the National Democratic Front (NDF). The National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) was established in Manerplaw in December 1990.

Manerplaw was captured and occupied by Tatmadaw and Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) troops on 27 January 1995 and later abandoned.

On December 17th 2024, Karen National Union ,Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), and allied forces recaptured Manerplaw from the State Administration Council (SAC) Tatmadaw.

<text>LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc. is an educational entertainment and electronics company based in Emeryville, California. LeapFrog designs, develops, and markets technology-based learning products and related content for the education of children from infancy through grade school. The company was founded by Michael Wood and Robert Lally in 1994. John Barbour is the chief executive officer of LeapFrog.

== History ==
=== 1990–1997: Founding ===
The history of LeapFrog traces back to the late 1980s when LeapFrog founder Michael Wood, an attorney at Cooley LLP, had difficulties teaching his son how to read. He began researching phonics and marketing while continuing as a partner at Cooley. By 1994, Wood had developed the first prototype of what would become Phonics Desk, LeapFrog&#x27;s first product. The prototype utilized a Texas Instruments chip that was previously used by one of Wood&#x27;s clients to develop talking greeting cards. Wood solicited feedback on his prototype from the late Robert Calfee, an expert on children&#x27;s reading development and a professor of education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education.

Wood began manufacturing the Phonics Desk in 1995. That year, Wood resigned as a partner at Cooley LLP and founded LeapFrog Enterprises with Robert Lally. The company received $800,000 in seed funding from friends, family, and former clients of Wood. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us became the first major retailer to carry the Phonics Desk shortly before Christmas 1995. Other retailers such as FAO Schwarz, Walmart and Target later began carrying the toy.

=== 1998–2002: Expansion and acquisition by Knowledge Universe ===
LeapFrog had distribution in over 10 countries and a number of major clients in the US by early 1997. In March of that year, the company hired Brad Crawford, who formerly worked for Little Tikes, to oversee sales and manufacturing. Knowledge Universe acquired a majority stake in LeapFrog in October 1997. Knowledge Universe is an education company founded by brothers Lowell Milken and Michael Milken, Larry Ellison, and Tom Kalinske. LeapFrog subsequently merged with Knowledge Universe&#x27;s Knowledge Kids division. Kalinske, a former executive at Mattel, became LeapFrog chief executive officer as a result of the merger.

LeapFrog acquired Explore Technologies in August 1998. Explore Technologies produced the Odyssey Globe, an interactive globe that could call out the names of countries when users touched the globe with a specially designed stylus. Explore Technologies&#x27; stylus technology was later used in LeapFrog&#x27;s LeapPad, a learning tablet that sounds out words when users drag a stylus across a word in LeapPad books. The LeapPad launched in 1999 and became Leapfrog&#x27;s flagship product. It was the top-selling toy in the US for 2001 and 2002, and books and accessories for the device were the best-selling toy in the US in 2003. LeapFrog opened its LeapFrog Schoolhouse division, which markets LeapFrog products directly to schools, in 1999.

=== 2003–present: Going public and acquisition by VTech ===
LeapFrog co-founder Michael Wood became the company&#x27;s chief executive officer in early 2002. In July, LeapFrog went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LF. Knowledge Universe retained majority control of the company following the initial public offering. Sega Toys and Benesse also began producing LeapFrog toys localized for the Japanese market in 2002. The Leapster was released in October 2003. LeapFrog products were sold in more than 25 countries by that year. Tom Kalinske was appointed LeapFrog chief executive officer following Michael Wood&#x27;s retirement in February 2004. Kalinske had previously served as LeapFrog&#x27;s chief executive officer from the company&#x27;s acquisition by Knowledge Universe in 1997 until early 2002. Wood was retained as the company&#x27;s chief creative officer. Jeffrey G. Katz replaced Kalinske as LeapFrog chief executive officer in 2006. Katz was previously the founding chairman and chief executive officer of Orbitz and had served on the LeapFrog board for a year prior to becoming the chief executive officer of LeapFrog. Kalinske remained vice chairman of LeapFrog.

LeapFrog discontinued the LeapPad and released its Tag Reading System in June 2008. Tag became LeapFrog&#x27;s flagship product and was a successor to the 10-year-old LeapPad. The company released its Leapster2 portable learning system and its Didj educational handheld game console in August 2008.

William &quot;Bill&quot; Chiasson replaced Jeffrey Katz as LeapFrog president and chief executive officer in March 2010. Chiasson had most recently served as LeapFrog chief financial officer. Katz was appointed to the newly created position of executive chairman of the board. LeapFrog also released the Leapster Explorer educational handheld game console in 2010. The Leapster Explorer was the successor to the Leapster2 and was targeted toward older children. The console supports online gameplay as well as learning apps, e-books, and videos. John Barbour was named the chief executive officer of LeapFrog in March 2011. Barbour previously served as an executive for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and RealNetworks.

LeapFrog released the LeapPad Explorer educational tablet computer in 2011. The LeapPad Explorer was designed for children aged four to nine and contained a five-inch touchscreen, camera, microphone, and both downloadable apps and cartridge-based games. In 2012, LeapFrog released its updated LeapPad2 and LeapsterGS. The LeapPad Ultra tablet computer and LeapReader were launched in 2013. The LeapReader is an electronic reading and writing system that succeeded the Tag Reading System which only taught reading skills.

The company released LeapBand, its first wearable activity tracker for children, in 2014. LeapFrog also released its LeapPad3 and LeapPad Ultra XDi tablet devices in 2014. In July 2014, the company announced the release of 
LeapTV. They also got net loss for $124million and had net sales of $145million. In August 2015, the company announced LeapFrog Epic, its new Android-based tablet for children, which was released in September 2015.

On April 4, 2016, VTech completed its $72million acquisition of LeapFrog.

== Products ==

LeapFrog&#x27;s product portfolio focuses on three main families of products: reading solutions, educational gaming, and grade school products and learning toys. Notable products include:
* LeapFrog Epic – An Android-based tablet for children aged 39. The tablet runs on the Android KitKat operating system, with a quad-core MediaTek MT8127 processor, 7&quot; multi-touch capacitive screen, front and back camera, video recorder, 16GB of memory and a battery that lasts for six hours. The product was released in September 2015 and its MSRP is US$139.99. An updated variant of the Epic called &quot;Academy Edition&quot; was released in 2017, with a redesigned silicone protective bumper and access to the LeapFrog Academy program. Another updated variant called the &quot;LeapPad Academy&quot; was released in 2019; like the Epic Academy Edition before it, this came with access to the LeapFrog Academy program and a silicone bumper with a built-in kickstand.
* LeapTV – A TV connected video game console that uses motion control. The console has a TV connected camera that tracks motion control of both the controller and the player&#x27;s body. Like any other current video game console, it has games available in cartridge or download form. The console&#x27;s release was announced in July 2014 and it was launched two months later in September. LeapTV is aimed at children aged 38.
* LeapBand – A wearable activity tracker for children aged 47. LeapBand is a wristband that gives commands such as &quot;wiggle like a worm&quot; or &quot;pop like popcorn.&quot; Children earn joules of energy gems by completing challenges, playing the built-in games, moving around in Move Mode, and using the stopwatch. Once they earn enough joules, they receive rewards, such as new toys and favorite foods for their pet, getting a new pet, and leveling up their pets.
* LeapReader – A specially designed stylus that reads audio books aloud and teaches basic writing skills. The device is similar to LeapFrog&#x27;s Tag Reading System, although the Tag system did not teach writing skills as does LeapReader. LeapReader was released in July 2013. 
* LeapStart – A newer family of products including the LeapStart was announced in 2016; the LeapStart 3D was released in 2018, and the LeapStart Go was released in 2019. These also include a stylus for reading content on specially patterned books but the LeapStart system is not compatible with the earlier Tag and LeapReader books.
* LeapPad Explorer/LeapPad2/Ultra/LeapPad3/Ultra XDi – The second line of LeapPad products are personalized learning tablets designed for children aged 49. When children set up the LeapPad, they enter their grade level and LeapPad automatically adjusts its games and applications to suit the given grade level. The existing library of Leapster Explorer game cartridges and apps is cross-compatible with LeapPad. LeapPad Explorer was released in August 2011, the LeapPad2 was released in August 2012, and the LeapPad3 and LeapPad Ultra XDi were released in 2014. 
* Leapster/Leapster L-Max/Leapster2/Leapster Explorer/LeapsterGS Explorer – Portable learning systems for children aged 410 with a large library of cartridge games and downloadable learning apps, including e-books, videos, games, and flashcards. The original Leapster was released in 2003. The company subsequently released the Leapster2 in 2008 and Leapster Explorer in 2010. The LeapsterGS Explorer was released in 2012. 
* Tag Reading System – A specially designed stylus that has a small infrared camera at the tip that &quot;reads&quot; letters, words and symbols printed on the special dot-patterned pages of books in the Tag library. The system is designed to help children aged 48 learn to read. In 2009, the company released Tag Junior, a system designed for children aged 14. 
* My Pal Scout – A customizable plush toy that can be programmed with various songs and the owner&#x27;s name and preferences. Additionally, LeapFrog produced various other toys, including toy vehicles, interactive plushes, and toys for the infant market. LeapFrog later released Read with Me Scout, a plush toy that can read aloud books from its product line.
* The original LeapPad – A series of now-discontinued educational devices. The products in this family varied in design, but all accepted an insertion cartridge to be used with a book that was placed in the device. The cartridge was activated when a child used a specially designed stylus to touch pictures, words, and shapes in the book. The device would then sound out the touched word, name the shape, or relay information about the picture. The LeapPad was LeapFrog&#x27;s flagship product from 1999 until it was discontinued in late 2007 (early to mid-2008 outside the US). It was replaced as LeapFrog&#x27;s flagship product by the Tag reading system.
* Tad&#x27;s Subtraction Sheet – A discontinued subtraction sheet released in 2013. Used with dry-erase markers.

== Smartphone applications ==
Leapfrog also develops educational applications for smartphones. These apps include:

* &#x27;Scout&#x27;s ABC Garden&#x27; App – An iOS application that was released in April 2011. The app encourages children to explore letter names and sounds step-by-step, and each child&#x27;s experience can be customized based on his or her name, favorite food, favorite color and favorite animal. 
* Creativity Camera – An iOS application that allows children to take and edit pictures. The application also contains an augmented reality game where users can take pictures of imaginary fairies. Creativity Camera comes with a child-friendly phone case that is shaped like a camera. The app and phone case were launched in 2013. 
* Mr. Pencil: Learn to Write – An iOS application that works with a stylus accessory to teach users basic writing skills. It requires iOS 5.0 or later. The app was released in 2013.

== Licensing and partnerships ==
In addition to producing their own toys, LeapFrog also licenses their characters (the Leapfrog Learning Friends) to third parties:

* Kiddieland Limited produces ride-on toys, tricycles, and scooters
* Masterpieces Puzzles produces jigsaw puzzles
* Learning Horizons produces books and various stationeries

LeapFrog also has partnerships with various companies:
* Sega Toys and Benesse produce localized versions of the toys for the Japanese market.
* Macromedia co-developed the Leapster handheld gaming console. 
* Lionsgate Home Entertainment has released Leapfrog Learning DVDs series of educational DVDs since 2009, beginning with &quot;Let&#x27;s Go To School&quot;. Warner Home Video released LeapFrog Learning VHSs and DVDs from 2003 until 2005. PorchLight Entertainment produced all LeapFrog Learning DVDs prior to 2008.

== LeapFrog Learning Friends ==
LeapFrog has developed various characters for use in-house, and eventually licensed the characters for use in third party products. These characters are collectively known as the Leapfrog Learning Friends. LeapFrog continues to develop new characters and has expanded character placement across products and content. Characters include Leap, Lily, Tad, Della, Dan, Dot, Casey, Parker, Tim, Mr. Frog, Mrs. Frog, Mr. Websley, Professor Quigley, and Edison. Most of the characters have been discontinued since 2008, but continued to appear on the LeapFrog Tag Learning System, the LeapFrog eBooks, the Leapster Explorer, the LeapPad Explorer, and re-released DVDs. Scout the Puppy first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park&quot; and &quot;Numbers Ahoy&quot; in 2009, and later characters from his series include Violet the Puppy, Penny the Hamster and Eli the Cat, along with their sentient car Axle.

== Animated videos ==
In 2003, LeapFrog began releasing animated content based on the LeapFrog characters onto home video. Over the course of more than a decade, various interpretations of the LeapFrog franchise have been used, and sixteen videos total have been produced. Similar to other preschool content from PBS Kids, Nick Jr., and Playhouse Disney, &quot;LeapFrog&quot; is an early educational program designed for children in the age group of 2–7 years. The videos and DVDs were originally distributed by PorchLight Home Entertainment and Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The original wave of videos starred the Frog family; consisting of siblings Tad, Leap, and Lily, and their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frog. Other major characters include Professor Quigley, an eccentric professor who usually helps the Frog children learn educational concepts, and Mr. Websley, the boss of Quigley and Mr. Frog who runs the factories. This wave of videos teach basic early learning skills that would become recurring features in future videos, including the alphabet, reading, spelling, numbers, and addition, and subtraction. The second wave phased out most of the &quot;Learning Friends&quot; characters, only leaving Tad, Leap, and Lily as the main characters. However, these videos would see the addition of two new major characters: Edison (a firefly previously seen in &quot;A Tad of Christmas Cheer&quot;) and Scout (a green dog introduced in 2007 as the company&#x27;s mascot). Scout would be spun-off into his own series in 2011, which introduced a new cast of characters that included Violet, Penny, Eli, and Axle. The final wave of videos revived the Letter Factory, a location from the company&#x27;s earliest videos, and were animated using CGI.

<text>Porte de la Villette () is a station of the Paris Métro. The origin of the commune of the Villette was a Gallo-Roman village, which grew up on the Roman road that led to eastern Flanders. About 1198, it became &quot;Ville Neuve Saint-Ladre&quot; and by 1426 it was called &quot;Villette-Saint-Miser-lez-Paris&quot;. The commune became a part of Paris in 1860. The nearby gate in Paris&#x27; 19th century walls hence became known as the &quot;Porte de la Villette&quot;.

The nearby Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie, located in the Parc de la Villette, is the biggest science museum in Europe. The glass and steel building was designed by Peter Rice and it was opened in 1986.

The station is featured in Battlefield 3, in which it is featured in a multiplayer map.

== History ==
Porte de la Villette opened on 5 November 1910 with the commissioning of the first section of line 7 from Opéra with service provided by all trains on the line until 18 January 1911, when a branch opened from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais, resulting in 1 of every 2 trains serving this branch. It was once again served by all trains on the line when the branch from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais was split to form an independent line, line 7bis, on 3 December 1967 as a result of an imbalance in traffic between the two branches – the branch to Porte de la Villette having significantly higher traffic due to its role as an important terminus for many suburban buses. It served as the northern terminus of line 7 until 1979 when it was extended to Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers. As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 16 January 2002.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,209,252 passengers, making it the 110th busiest of the Métro network, out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,981,878 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 123rd busiest of the Métro network, out of 305 stations.

An interchange with Paris tramway Line 3b opened on 15 December 2012, serving as its western terminus until its extension to Porte d&#x27;Asnières—Marguerite Long on 24 November 2018.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has 5 entrances:
* Access 1: avenue Corentin Cariou
* Access 2: boulevard Macdonald - &quot;Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie&quot;
* Access 3: rue du Chemin-de-Fer - &quot;Centre d&#x27;Événements&quot;
* Access 4: avenue de la Porte-de-la-Villette
* Access 5: Parvis de la Cité - &quot;Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie - Centre de Loisirs et de Commerce&quot;

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has, as does Porte de Pantin located on the same line, a particular arrangement specific to the stations serving or had served as a terminus. It has 2 identical half-stations each with an island platform surrounded by two tracks, the same layout as Château de Vincennes on line 1 and Porte de Champerret on line 3. As it was a former terminus, a turning loop is provided beyond the station towards La Courneuve–8 mai 1945. It is also where the sole connection to the La Villette workshops is in the métro, where equipment used to maintain the network (sleepers, switches, rails, etc.) are stored.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 71, 139, 150, and 152 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N42 and N140 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Corentin Cariou () is a station of the Paris Métro.

== History ==
Corentin Cariou opened on 5 November 1910 with the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette with service provided by all trains on the line until 18 January 1911, when a branch opened from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais, resulting in 1 of every 2 trains serving this branch. It was once again served by all trains on the line when the branch from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais was split to form an independent line, line 7bis, on 3 December 1967.

It was originally named &quot;Pont de Flandre&quot;, after the nearby bridge spanning the &quot;Canal de Saint-Denis&quot; on which the rue de Flandre ran on, the main road in La Villette. On 10 February 1946, the station was renamed after Corentin Cariou (1898–1942) who was a member of the municipal council of the 19th arrondissement and was shot by the Nazis during the occupation as a hostage. It is one of 8 stations which were renamed after resistance fighters who had died for France, the others being Charles Michels (line 10), Colonel Fabien (line 2), Corentin Celton (line 12), Guy Môquet (line 13), Jacques Bonsergent (line 5), Marx Dormoy (line 12), and Trinité - d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves (line 12).

In 1982, the station was decorated with an artwork by the French artist Hervé Mathieu-Bachelot, &quot;De la verticale à l&#x27;oblique&quot;, consisting of a fresco that line the sides of the corridors.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 23 November 2001.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,766,678 passengers, making it the 191st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,329,810 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 196th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has 2 entrances:
* Entrance 1: rue Benjamin-Constant
* Entrance 2: Avenue Corentin-Cariou - &quot;Cité des sciences et de l&#x27;industrie&quot;

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Corentin Cariou has a standard configuration with two tracks surrounded by two side platforms, although the lower part of the walls are vertical instead of a typical elliptical shape. The decoration is in the style used for the majority of metro stations. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, vault and tunnel exits, and lighting canopy is provided by two tube bands. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are white &#x27;Motte&#x27; style.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 60 and 71 of the RATP bus network and at night, by N42 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Crimée () is a station of the Paris Métro and is located in the 19th arrondissement of Paris under avenue de Flandre. The station is named after the nearby rue de Crimée, the longest road in the arrondissement, whose name commemorates the Crimean War (1855–56), on the Crimean Peninsula of the Russian Empire on the Black Sea, where a coalition of Turkey, the United Kingdom, France, and Piedmont faced Russia. It was notable for the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) and the Charge of the Light Brigade. The conflict ended in the Treaty of Paris (1856), with the Russian Empire&#x27;s defeat.

== History ==
The station opened on 5 November 1910 with the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette with service provided by all trains on the line until 18 January 1911, when a branch opened from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais, resulting in 1 of every 2 trains serving this branch. It was once again served by all trains on the line when the branch from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais was split to form an independent line, line 7bis, on 3 December 1967. As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 25 July 2003.

On 27 May 1978, the Guimard entrance on Rue Mathis was listed as a historical monument.

On 1 April 2016 , half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP as part of April Fool&#x27;s Day, along with 12 other stations. It was humorously renamed &quot;Châtiment&quot; (punishment), a reference to &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,431,969 passengers, making it the 74th busiest of the Métro network, out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,688,758 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 65th busiest of the Métro network, out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has 3 entrances:

* Entrance 1: Avenue de Flandre &quot;Centre Commercial&quot;
* Entrance 2: Caisse Nationale d&#x27;Assurance Vieillesse
* Entrance 3: Rue Mathis (with a Guimard entrance)

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Crimée has a standard configuration with two tracks surrounded by two side platforms and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in yellow &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style. The lighting canopies, of the same colour, are supported by curved supports in the shape of a scythe. The direct lighting is white while the indirect lighting, projected on the vault, is multicolored. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, vault and tunnel exits. The advertising frames are yellow and cylindrical and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The platforms are equipped with silver &quot;sit-stand&quot; benches as well as &quot;hull&quot; seats, typical of the &quot;Motte&quot; style, whose hue, changed from yellow to blue, breaking the colorimetric uniformity of the decoration.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 54, 60, and 71 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by line N42 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="504404" wikidata="Q1783746" url="?curid=504404" title="Concyclic points">
<text>In geometry, a set of points are said to be concyclic (or cocyclic) if they lie on a common circle. A polygon whose vertices are concyclic is called a cyclic polygon, and the circle is called its &quot;circumscribing circle&quot; or &quot;circumcircle&quot;. All concyclic points are equidistant from the center of the circle.

Three points in the plane that do not all fall on a straight line are concyclic, so every triangle is a cyclic polygon, with a well-defined circumcircle. However, four or more points in the plane are not necessarily concyclic. After triangles, the special case of cyclic quadrilaterals has been most extensively studied.

== Perpendicular bisectors ==
In general the centre &quot;O&quot; of a circle on which points &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; lie must be such that &quot;OP&quot; and &quot;OQ&quot; are equal distances. Therefore &quot;O&quot; must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment &quot;PQ&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; distinct points there are &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2 bisectors, and the concyclic condition is that they all meet in a single point, the centre &quot;O&quot;.

== Triangles ==
The vertices of every triangle fall on a circle called the circumcircle. (Because of this, some authors define &quot;concyclic&quot; only in the context of four or more points on a circle.) Several other sets of points defined from a triangle are also concyclic, with different circles; see Nine-point circle and Lester&#x27;s theorem.

The radius of the circle on which lie a set of points is, by definition, the radius of the circumcircle of any triangle with vertices at any three of those points. If the pairwise distances among three of the points are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;, then the circle&#x27;s radius is

:formula_1

The equation of the circumcircle of a triangle, and expressions for the radius and the coordinates of the circle&#x27;s center, in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are given here.

=== Other concyclic points ===

In any triangle all of the following nine points are concyclic on what is called the nine-point circle: the midpoints of the three edges, the feet of the three altitudes, and the points halfway between the orthocenter and each of the three vertices.

Lester&#x27;s theorem states that in any scalene triangle, the two Fermat points, the nine-point center, and the circumcenter are concyclic.

If lines are drawn through the Lemoine point parallel to the sides of a triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, in what is called the Lemoine circle.

The van Lamoen circle associated with any given triangle formula_2 contains the circumcenters of the six triangles that are defined inside formula_2 by its three medians.

A triangle&#x27;s circumcenter, its Lemoine point, and its first two Brocard points are concyclic, with the segment from the circumcenter to the Lemoine point being a diameter.

== Cyclic quadrilaterals ==


A quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with concyclic vertices is called a cyclic quadrilateral; this happens if and only if formula_4 (the inscribed angle theorem) which is true if and only if the opposite angles inside the quadrilateral are supplementary. A cyclic quadrilateral with successive sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and semiperimeter &quot;s&quot; = (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;) / 2 has its circumradius given by
:formula_5
an expression that was derived by the Indian mathematician Vatasseri Parameshvara in the 15th century.

By Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem, if a quadrilateral is given by the pairwise distances between its four vertices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; in order, then it is cyclic if and only if the product of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of opposite sides: 

: formula_6

If two lines, one containing segment &quot;AC&quot; and the other containing segment &quot;BD&quot;, intersect at &quot;X&quot;, then the four points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; are concyclic if and only if
:formula_7

The intersection &quot;X&quot; may be internal or external to the circle. This theorem is known as power of a point.

A convex quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (has perpendicular diagonals) if and only if the midpoints of the sides and the feet of the four altitudes are eight concyclic points, on what is called the eight-point circle.

== Cyclic polygons ==
More generally, a polygon in which all vertices are concyclic is called a &quot;cyclic polygon&quot;. A polygon is cyclic if and only if the perpendicular bisectors of its edges are concurrent. Every regular polygon is a cyclic polygon.

For a cyclic polygon with an odd number of sides, all angles are equal if and only if the polygon is regular. A cyclic polygon with an even number of sides has all angles equal if and only if the alternate sides are equal (that is, sides are equal, and sides are equal).

A cyclic pentagon with rational sides and area is known as a Robbins pentagon. In all known cases, its diagonals also have rational lengths, though whether this is true for all possible Robbins pentagons is an unsolved problem.

In any cyclic -gon with even , the sum of one set of alternate angles (the first, third, fifth, etc.) equals the sum of the other set of alternate angles. This can be proven by induction from the case, in each case replacing a side with three more sides and noting that these three new sides together with the old side form a quadrilateral which itself has this property; the alternate angles of the latter quadrilateral represent the additions to the alternate angle sums of the previous -gon.

A tangential polygon is one having an inscribed circle tangent to each side of the polygon; these tangency points are thus concyclic on the inscribed circle. Let one -gon be inscribed in a circle, and let another -gon be tangential to that circle at the vertices of the first -gon. Then from any point on the circle, the product of the perpendicular distances from to the sides of the first -gon equals the product of the perpendicular distances from to the sides of the second -gon.

===Point on the circumcircle===

Let a cyclic -gon have vertices on the unit circle. Then for any point on the minor arc , the distances from to the vertices satisfy

:formula_8

For a regular -gon, if formula_9 are the distances from any point on the circumcircle to the vertices , then 

:formula_10

===Polygon circumscribing constant===
Any regular polygon is cyclic. Consider a unit circle, then circumscribe a regular triangle such that each side touches the circle. Circumscribe a circle, then circumscribe a square. Again circumscribe a circle, then circumscribe a regular pentagon, and so on. The radii of the circumscribed circles converge to the so-called &quot;polygon circumscribing constant&quot;

:formula_11

. The reciprocal of this constant is the Kepler–Bouwkamp constant.

==Variations==

In contexts where lines are taken to be a type of generalised circle with infinite radius, collinear points (points along a single line) are considered to be concyclic. This point of view is helpful, for instance, when studying inversion through a circle or more generally Möbius transformations (geometric transformations generated by reflections and circle inversions), as these transformations preserve the concyclicity of points only in this extended sense.

In the complex plane (formed by viewing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; Cartesian coordinates of the plane), concyclicity has a particularly simple formulation: four points in the complex plane are either concyclic or collinear if and only if their cross-ratio is a real number.

==Integer area and side lengths==
Some cyclic polygons have the property that their area and all of their side lengths are positive integers. Triangles with this property are called Heronian triangles; cyclic quadrilaterals with this property (and that the diagonals that connect opposite vertices have integer length) are called Brahmagupta quadrilaterals; cyclic pentagons with this property are called Robbins pentagons. More generally, versions of these cyclic polygons scaled by a rational number will have area and side lengths that are rational numbers.

Let be the angle spanned by one side of the cyclic polygon as viewed from the center of the circumscribing circle. Similarly define the central angles for the remaining sides. Every Heronian triangle and every Brahmagupta quadrilateral has a rational value for the tangent of the quarter angle, , for every value of . Every known Robbins pentagon (has diagonals that have rational length and) has this property, though it is an unsolved problem whether every possible Robbins pentagon has this property.

The reverse is true for all cyclic polygons with any number of sides; if all such central angles have rational tangents for their quarter angles then the implied cyclic polygon circumscribed by the unit circle will simultaneously have rational side lengths and rational area. Additionally, each diagonal that connects two vertices, whether or not the two vertices are adjacent, will have a rational length. Such a cyclic polygon can be scaled so that its area and lengths are all integers.

This reverse relationship gives a way to generate cyclic polygons with integer area, sides, and diagonals. For a polygon with sides, let be rational numbers. These are the tangents of one quarter of the cumulative angles , , ..., . Let , let , and let for . These rational numbers are the tangents of the individual quarter angles, using the formula for the tangent of the difference of angles. Rational side lengths for the polygon circumscribed by the unit circle are thus obtained as . The rational area is . These can be made into integers by scaling the side lengths by a shared constant.

==Other properties==
A set of five or more points is concyclic if and only if every four-point subset is concyclic. This property can be thought of as an analogue for concyclicity of the Helly property of convex sets.

== Minimum bounding circle ==

A related notion is the one of a minimum bounding circle, which is the smallest circle that completely contains a set of points. Every set of points in the plane has a unique minimum bounding circle, which may be constructed by a linear time algorithm.

Even if a set of points are concyclic, their circumscribing circle may be different from their minimum bounding circle. For example, for an obtuse triangle, the minimum bounding circle has the longest side as diameter and does not pass through the opposite vertex.

<text>Heavens Gate was a German power metal band from Wolfsburg. They were, together with German bands Helloween, Gamma Ray, Grave Digger, Running Wild, and Rage, the pioneers in German power metal, taking their influences mainly from Helloween as well as from Judas Priest.

They started out as a band called Steeltower in 1982, releasing their first record &quot;Night of the Dog&quot; in 1984.

Before signing with No Remorse records, they were known under the name of Carrion and several of their songs ended up re-worked on their debut album &quot;In Control&quot;. They changed their name to Heavens Gate in 1987. Their first record as Heavens Gate was released in 1989.

Heavens Gate were taken under the wing of Frank Bornemann (Eloy) and soon after releasing &quot;In Control&quot;, they were embraced by the German metal audience and had an enthusiastic response in Japan.

They also did a metal cover of &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; by Monty Python, from the movie &quot;The Life of Brian&quot;, for the &quot;Hell for Sale!&quot; album.

<text>Riquet () is a station of the Paris Métro and located in the 19th arrondissement of Paris.

== History ==

Riquet opened on 5 November 1910 with the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette with service provided by all trains on the line until 18 January 1911, when a branch opened from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais, resulting in 1 of every 2 trains serving this branch. It was once again served by all trains on the line when the branch from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais was split to form an independent line, line 7bis, on 3 December 1967. As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 28 January 2003.

It was named after French engineer Pierre-Paul Riquet (born Béziers, 1609; died Toulouse, 1680), who conceived and carried out the construction of the Canal du Midi from 1666. This work was completed by his sons in 1681.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,312,581 passengers, making it the 223rd busiest of the Métro network, out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,226,397 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 210th busiest of the Métro network, out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has 2 entrances:
* Entrance 1: Rue Riquet
* Entrance 2: Avenue de Flandre

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Riquet has a standard configuration with two tracks surrounded by two side platforms, although the lower part of the walls are vertical instead of a typical elliptical shape. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two red luminous lighting canopies and &quot;Motte&quot; seats whose colour, changed from red to blue, breaking the colorimetric uniformity of said style. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the wall, vault, tunnel exits and outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by line 45 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by line N42 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Louis Blanc () is a Paris Métro station on line 7 and 7bis (serving as the western terminus of Paris Métro Line 7bis). The station is named after &quot;rue Louis Blanc&quot;, which honours Louis Blanc (1811–1882), who published political works, which led to the foundation of the French Socialist Party. He was a member of the Provisional Government of 1848 and had exiled himself to London during the Second Empire from 1848 to 1870. He was then elected to the French National Assembly in 1870.

The station has two island platforms and two side platforms, a layout rarely found elsewhere in the Métro.

== History ==

Louis Blanc opened on 23 November 1910, 18 days after the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette with the branch from &quot;Louis Blanc&quot; to Pré Saint-Gervais only opening on 18 January 1911 due to difficulties during its construction. On 3 December 1967 the branch to &quot;Pré Saint-Gervais&quot; was separated as &quot;7bis&quot;, terminating at this station, with &quot;Louis Blanc&quot; becoming its western terminus as a result of an imbalance in traffic between the two branches – the branch to Porte de la Villette having significantly higher traffic due to its role as an important terminus for many suburban buses. This enabled a higher frequency of trains services that could run on the branch to Porte de la Villette than before where 1 of every 2 trains went to each branch.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 11 July 2014.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,272,326 passengers, making it the 228th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.
In 2020, the station was used by 1,226,441 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 209th busiest of the Métro network, out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
Louis Blanc has a single entrance with a Guimard kiosk, registered as a historical monument since 29 May 1978, at the intersection of Rue La Fayette and Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin.
=== Station layout ===

*Note: The northbound and southbound platforms run under different streets that intersect at the station&#x27;s northern end.

=== Platforms ===
Louis Blanc consists of two underground stations built on different levels. The shallowest is nicknamed the upper station, the other the lower station. They have the same particular configuration with a side platform, described as &quot;dead&quot; because of its non-use, and an island platform bordered on both sides by the subway tracks. One of the two tracks is therefore framed by the two platforms, while the other runs along the right wall. The upper station is served, from the central track, by the trains of line 7 running to &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Ivry&quot; or &quot;Villejuif - Louis Aragon&quot; and, from the side track, by the trains of line 7 bis from or to &quot;Pré-Saint-Gervais&quot;, of which it previously provided only arrivals. The lower station is served, from the side track, by the trains of line 7 to La Courneuve, while its central track, previously ensuring the departure of trains of line 7 bis towards Pré-Saint-Gervais, is no longer used in normal service.

Both stations are decorated in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style, yellow for the upper station and in green for the lower station. Thus, the lighting canopies are supported by curved hangers in the form of a scythe are yellow and green respectively. The direct lighting is white while the indirect lighting, projected on the vault, is multi-coloured. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the right wall, vault and tunnel exits, but the technical room at the western end of the upper station is treated with classic bevelled white tiles. The advertising frames are yellow or green (matching the lighting banners) and cylindrical, while the name of the station is inscribed on enamelled plates with the Parisine font for the upper station, and in capital letters as in Parisine typography for the lower station. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are yellow in the upper station and grey in the lower station.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 26, 46, and 54 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N13, N41, N42, and N45 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Cadet () is a station on Line 7 of the Paris Métro. It is named after rue Cadet, itself named after M. Cadet de Chambine, owner of much of the land through which the street passes. The street was called rue de la Voirie before being renamed.

== History ==
Cadet opened on 5 November 1910 with the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette. In 1982, a mosaic by the French artist, Hervé Mathieu-Bachelot, &quot;Lumière en éclats&quot;, was installed in the corridor leading to the platform towards &quot;La Courneuve–8 mai 1945&quot;. As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 28 May 2003.

On 12 February 2016, the Guimard entrance on Rue Mathis was listed as a historical monument.

On 1 April 2016, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP as part of April Fool&#x27;s Day, along with 12 other stations. It was humorously renamed &quot;Rousselle&quot;, a nod to the nursery rhyme by Cadet Rousselle (1743-1807) to evoke a sense of childhood.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,042,484 passengers, making it the 168th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,240,692 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 204th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
Cadet has a single entrance along rue Cadet with a Guimard entrance.
=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Cadet has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The platforms are decorated using the colours and patterns of the flag of the United States, due to its location under rue La Fayette, which pays homage to the general who had fought alongside the Americans during the American Revolutionary War. Hence, white, blue, and red beveled ceramic tiles line the walls of the vault, the ceilings, and at the ends of the platforms.
=== Other connections ===
The station is served by lines 26, 32, 43, 45, 48, and 85 of the RATP bus network.

<text>Le Peletier () is a station on Line 7 of the Paris Métro. Located in the 9th arrondissement, it was belatedly opened on June 6, 1911, seven months after the inauguration of Line 7. It is named after the nearby Rue le Peletier, which was named after Louis Peletier, who was the last but one &quot;Prévôt des marchands de Paris&quot; (provost of the merchants of Paris) between 1784 and 1789. This feudal position was abolished in the French Revolution.

The Opéra National de Paris was located in the Salle Le Peletier, on Rue le Peletier, between 1821 and 1873, when it was destroyed by fire. It was the first theatre to use gas lighting to illuminate the stage. The station is located a short walk from Notre-Dame-de-Lorette station on Line 12, but no free transfer is permitted.

<doc id="504418" wikidata="Q181847" url="?curid=504418" title="Cover band">
<text>A cover band (or covers band) is a band that plays songs recorded by someone else, sometimes mimicking the original as accurately as possible, and sometimes re-interpreting or changing the original. These remade songs are known as cover songs. New or unknown bands often find the format marketable for smaller venues, such as pubs, clubs or parks. The bands also perform at private events, for example, weddings and birthday parties, and may be known as a wedding band, party band, function band or band-for-hire. A band whose covers consist mainly of songs that were chart hits is often called a top 40 band. Some bands, however, start as cover bands, then grow to perform original material. For example, the Rolling Stones released three albums consisting primarily of covers and then recorded one with their own original material.

Cover bands play several types of venues. When a band is starting out, they might play private parties and fundraisers, often for little or no money, or in return for food and bar privileges, although many professional musicians refuse to do this. With enough experience, a band will begin to &quot;play out&quot; professionally at bars and night clubs. Some cover bands are made up of full-time professional musicians. These bands are usually represented by an entertainment agency.

When cover bands consist of professional musicians, they often do not have a fixed lineup; rather, they are often made up of a flexible lineup of session musicians, utilizing &quot;dep&quot; (deputy, that is, stand-in) musicians where necessary. The music industry is considered by many musicians as a relatively difficult industry to make an income in, and cover bands can be a good source of income for professional musicians alongside other work.

==Music==
Cover bands play songs written and recorded by other artists, usually well-known songs (as compared to &quot;original&quot; bands which play music they themselves have written). There are a wide variety of cover bands – some cover bands play material from particular decades, for example, a 1980s cover band. Others focus exclusively on the music of a particular group, usually iconic groups, and are called tribute bands. It is not uncommon to find tribute bands performing the songs of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Oasis, Duran Duran, Aerosmith, or U2. Some cover bands will play a variety of song styles, from different artists, genres, and decades. Another type of cover band is one that plays songs in a different genre or style than that of the original composition (e.g., jazz versions of what were originally hard rock songs).

Some cover bands perform covers that are of a different musical genre from the originals. For instance:

* Richard Cheese covers rock and rap songs in the style of lounge music.
* Gregorian covers pop and rock songs in the style of Gregorian chant.
* Gabba covers the pop songs of ABBA in the punk style of the Ramones (the name is also a reference to the chant &quot;Gabba Gabba Hey&quot; from the Ramones&#x27; song &quot;Pinhead&quot; from their &quot;Leave Home&quot; album).
* Nouvelle Vague covers new wave-era bands with a bossa nova twist.
* Me First and the Gimme Gimmes is known for punk covers of other artists, with each album picking a different genre or era (i.e. hits of the 1970s, showtunes, etc.)
* Dread Zeppelin specialized in reggae versions of Led Zeppelin songs, with an Elvis impersonator on lead vocals.
* Hayseed Dixie started as a &quot;hillbilly tribute to AC/DC&quot; and has become a bluegrass tribute band covering many well-known rock bands in their own &quot;rockgrass&quot; style.
* Run C&amp;W performed bluegrass arrangements of 1960s soul music, primarily classics from the Motown catalog.
* Turetsky&#x27;s Choir, a former synagogue choir from Moscow is famous for its remakes of music pieces from different styles, ranging from opera classic to pop hits. The band&#x27;s repertoire usually includes covers only. Some of them are arranged into medleys.
* The Baseballs are a German band, known for doing rockabilly covers of 2000s pop songs, like &quot;Bleeding Love&quot; and &quot;Umbrella&quot;.
* UB40 were an English band best known for reggae versions of 1950s and 1960s pop songs.
* Mallavoodoo, a Brazilian band from Recife, plays instrumental covers of hard rock with keyboards and saxophone.
* DMK, a Colombian band featuring Dicken Schrader and his children Milah and Korben, plays Depeche Mode songs using an old keyboard, toys and various household items as instruments.
* Taco is most famous for his Great American Songbook show tune covers, rearranged as synthpop.
* Ray Charles, particularly from the 1960s onward, devoted much of his recording career to soul covers of pop, jazz and country music.
* The Mike Flowers Pops rearranges popular music into easy listening, with their most famous cover being that of &quot;Wonderwall,&quot; originally by Oasis.
* Postmodern Jukebox reimagines popular music in classic pre-rock era styles such as jazz, gospel and rhythm and blues.

The Belsen trials took place in Lüneburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, in 1945 and the defendants were men and women of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; as well as prisoner functionaries who had worked at various concentration camps, notably Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.

The first trial generated considerable interest around the world, as the public heard for the first time from some of those responsible for the mass murder in the eastern extermination camps. Some later trials are also referred to as Belsen trials.

==First trial==


Officially called the &quot;Trial of Josef Kramer and 44 others&quot;, the trial began in a Lüneburg gymnasium on 17 September 1945, within the British occupation zone.

The defendants were 45 former SS men, women and &quot;kapos&quot; (prisoner functionaries) from the Bergen-Belsen and Auschwitz concentration camps. Josef Kramer had been camp commandant at Bergen-Belsen and before that at Auschwitz. Of the other defendants, 12 were kapos, 16 female SS members and 16 male SS members. Although the SS was an all-male organisation, women were able to enlist as members of the &quot;SS-Gefolge&quot;, a form of civilian employee. One prisoner functionary, Ladisław Gura, who was also an SS member under arrest, was found to be too ill to stand trial after the trial had started. Three others had been excluded from the list of indicted for the same reason before the trial began. Three SS members had been shot trying to escape after the British took over the camp and one had committed suicide. Out of a total of 77 SS men and women arrested by the British in April, another 17 had died of typhus by 1 June 1945.

Next to Kramer, the most high-profile defendants were Fritz Klein, who had been camp doctor at Belsen, and Franz Hössler, deputy camp commandant. Elisabeth Volkenrath had been &quot;Oberaufseherin&quot; (head warden or supervising wardress) at Auschwitz before she came to Belsen. Many of the defendants had arrived in Bergen-Belsen only after February 1945, some as late as two days before liberation. However, most had been active in similar functions in other concentration camps before that.
The trial took place before a British military tribunal. The judges were Major-General H.M.P. Berney-Ficklin (presiding), Brigadier A. de L. Casonove, Colonel G.J. Richards, Lt.-Colonel R.B. Moriush and Lt.-Colonel R. McLay. C.L. Stirling was Judge Advocate. Colonel T.M. Backhouse, Major H.G. Murton-Neale, Capt. S.M. Stewart and Lt.-Col. L.J. Genn were Counsel for the Prosecution. Counsel for the Defence were also members of the British Army — in the case of the five Polish defendants a Polish officer, Lt. Jedrezejowicz.

As this was a military court, it was legally based on the &quot;Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals made under Royal Warrant&quot; of 14 June 1945.
All the charges related to international law, which applied at the time the crimes were committed, so this was not a case of retroactive justice. Due to the nature of the court, the only charges that could be brought were war crimes and crimes against citizens of the Allied countries. &quot;Crimes against humanity&quot; and &quot;crimes against peace&quot;, which featured in the later trials at Nuremberg, were not among the charges at Lüneburg.

===Charges===
The official charges were grouped into crimes committed at Auschwitz and Belsen and were as follows:At Bergen-Belsen, Germany, between 1st October, 1942, and 30th April, 1945, when members of the staff of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp responsible for the well-being of the persons interned there, in violation of the law and usages of war, were together concerned as parties to the ill-treatment of certain of such persons, causing the deaths of Keith Meyer (a British national), Anna Kis, Sara Kohn (both Hungarian nationals), Heimech Glinovjechy and Maria Konatkevicz (both Polish nationals) and Marcel Freson de Montigny (a French national), Maurice Van Eijnsbergen (a Dutch national), Maurice Van Mevlenaar (a Belgian national), Jan Markowski and Georgej Ferenz (both Polish nationals), Salvatore Verdura (an Italian national), and Therese Klee (a British national of Honduras), Allied nationals, and other Allied nationals whose names are unknown, and physical suffering to other persons interned there, Allied nationals and particularly to Harold Osmund le Druillenec (a British national), Benec Zuchermann, a female internee surnamed Korperova, a female internee named Hoffmann, Luba Rormann, Isa Frydmann (all Polish nationals) and Alexandra Siwidowa, a Russian national and other Allied nationals whose names are unknown.

and

...at Auschwitz, Poland, between 1st October, 1942, and 30th April, 1945, when members of the staff of Auschwitz Concentration Camp responsible for the well-being of the persons interned there, in violation of the law and usages of war, were together concerned as parties to ill-treatment of certain of such persons, causing the deaths of Rachella Silberstein (a Polish national), Allied nationals, and other Allied nationals whose names are unknown, and physical suffering to other persons interned there, Allied nationals, and particularly to Ewa Gryka and Hanka Rosenwayg (both Polish nationals) and other Allied nationals whose names are unknown.

All of the defendants pleaded not guilty.

===Overview of the trial===

The trial lasted 54 days in court. It began on 17 September with the indictment and the opening speech for the prosecution. Brigadier Glyn Hughes was the first witness for the prosecution on 18–19 September.

On 20 September, the British Army screened a film they had made of the conditions at Belsen immediately after liberation. On 21 September, the court visited Bergen-Belsen. Evidence for the defence began on 8 October with the opening speech for the defendant, Kramer, who also testified. Closing speeches were made from 7–12 November, followed by the closing arguments by the prosecution on 13 November. Sentencing took place four days later, on 17 November 1945.

Since the trial was conducted in English, translations into German and Polish were necessary. This was one of the factors which prolonged the trial, which had initially been expected to last for two to four weeks. In retrospect, the prosecution has been criticised as hasty and ill-prepared. None of the SS guards who had fled the camp after the ceasefire on 13 April had been searched for. Instead of eyewitness testimony, in some cases only affidavits were available at the trial. Some witnesses contradicted themselves on cross-examination, while others failed to identify the defendants as the perpetrators of the crimes in question. One former inmate, Oskar Schmitz, was erroneously charged as an SS man, and had no chance to clarify this before the trial began.

The defence claimed that the arrest of the defendants had been illegal, as it contravened the promise of free withdrawal contained in the ceasefire agreement. However, the wording on this point was only clear for members of the Wehrmacht at Belsen. Moreover, according to the prosecution, the burning of the camp files by the SS and the firing of shots on 15 April had voided the agreement. In fact, the relevant section of the ceasefire agreement read: 
SS guard personnel [...] will be treated as PW. SS Adj personnel will [...] remain at their posts and carry on with their duties (cooking, supplies, etc) and will hand over records. When their services can be dispensed with, their disposal is left by the Wehrmacht to the British authorities.

On 17 November, the court sentenced 11 of the defendants to death by hanging. Another 18 were found guilty and sentenced to prison sentences of one to 15 years. One defendant, Erich Zoddel, was sentenced to life in prison, but was then executed 13 days later. Zoddel had been sentenced to death in a separate military trial in August 1945 for murdering a female prisoner after the liberation. None of the sentenced were only found guilty of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; of working within the concentration camp system, but rather all of them were sentenced for individually committed crimes. 14 defendants were acquitted (the final defendant was too sick to stand trial). Due to clemency pleas and appeals, many prison sentences were eventually shortened considerably. By mid-1955, all those sentenced to prison had been released.

===Individual defendants and sentences===

===Public reaction===
The Belsen Trial attracted substantial national and international media interest. Significantly, more than 100 representatives of the news media reported at length on the trial&#x27;s progress.

Through them, the world learned not just about the thousands of deaths by hunger and disease at Belsen, communicated especially forcefully by the film and photo evidence produced by the British Army. Possibly even more importantly, the Belsen trial also was the first time that the organised mass murder at Auschwitz Birkenau received a public airing, with some of those responsible describing the selection process, the use of the gas chambers and the crematoria. In Great Britain, the trial was mostly viewed positively, as a triumph of the rule of law, given the fairness and meticulousness with which it had been conducted. However, in some other countries, notably the Soviet Union and France, the verdicts were criticised as too mild. Many survivors also felt this way.

===Executions===
All the executions were carried out on 13 December 1945 by hanging at Hamelin Prison. The executioner was Albert Pierrepoint, aided by an assistant.

==Second trial==
A second Belsen trial was conducted at Lüneburg from 13 to 18 June 1946 by a British military tribunal.
== Third trial ==
The British held a third Belsen trial in April 1948. There was only one defendant, Ernst Julius Curt Meyer. Meyer had been arrested in May 1945, but was erroneously released in September 1947. He was re-arrested in February 1948. Meyer was found guilty of war crimes for non-fatal abuse and sentenced to life in prison. His sentence was reduced to 21 years in 1950, and he was released from prison on 24 December 1954.

<text>Pyramides station () is a station on lines 7 and 14 of the Paris Métro.

==Location==
The Pyramides metro station is located halfway between the Palais Garnier and the Comédie-Française theatre. The line passes under Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra and under the tunnel of line 7.

==History==
The station was opened on 1 July 1916 during the extension of line 7 from Opéra to Palais-Royal. Due to the shortage of earthenware linked to the First World War, the station was temporarily equipped with a simple masonry coating.

In the 1990s, the secondary station became a transfer station as part of the Line 14 project. A new connection hall was set up on the south side, above the tracks of line 7. The station for line 14 opened with the rest of the line on 15 October 1998.

It is named after the Rue des Pyramides, which commemorates the victory in 1798 of Napoleon&#x27;s Armée d&#x27;Orient over the Mamluks of Murad Bey in the Battle of the Pyramids in Egypt.

In 2020, with the COVID-19 crisis, 3,048,580 passengers entered this station, which places it in 55th position among metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
* Access 1 - Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra, a staircase;
* Access 2 - Rue de l&#x27;Échelle, a staircase and an elevator;
* Access 3 - Rue des Pyramides, a staircase.

=== Station layout ===
===Platforms===
The platforms of line 7 are of standard configuration. Two in number, they are separated by the tracks located in the centre, and the vault is elliptical. They are equipped with benches made of slats. Lighting is provided by two tube strips. The vault is covered with flat white tiling and the advertising frames are made of cylindrical white ceramic of the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; type. The name of the station is inscribed on enamel plates in Parisine font.

The platforms of line 14 are also of standard configuration. The fittings are those specific to this line. The vault is equipped with a work by the French artist Jacques Tissinier created at the same time as the station: &quot;Tissignalisation no. 14&quot;. This is an installation using a thousand embedded discs in coloured enamelled steel. Each disc measures 16 cm in diameter and represents a stylized papyrus sheet coloured in red, white, blue and orange. The same work is present at the Madeleine station on the same line.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 27, 68 and 95 of the RATP Bus Network.

<doc id="504428" wikidata="Q1458421" url="?curid=504428" title="Pont Neuf station">
<text>Pont Neuf () is a station on Line 7 of the Paris Métro. Located in the heart of old Paris, it is connected to the Île de la Cité by the nearby Pont Neuf after which it is named. It opened in 1926 with the line&#x27;s extension from Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre to Pont Marie.

==Location==
The station is located under the start of the Quai du Louvre, on the right bank of the Seine, at the level of the Pont Neuf. Oriented roughly along an east/west axis, it is located between the &quot;Palais-Royal - Musée du Louvre&quot; and &quot;Châtelet&quot; metro stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 16 April 1926 with the commissioning of the extension of line 7 from Palais-Royal (now Palais-Royal - Musée du Louvre) to Pont Marie.
It owes its name to the Pont Neuf, to the north of which it is established and which, despite its name, is the oldest existing bridge in Paris. Built at the end of the sixteenth century and completed in the early seventeenth century, it was then a revolutionary bridge, hence its name, being the first without houses and equipped with sidewalks protecting pedestrians from mud and the passage of horses.

The station bears as a subtitle La Monnaie, because of its immediate proximity to the Rue de la Monnaie, where the Hôtel de la Monnaie was located before its reconstruction in 1776 on the left bank of the Seine at 11 Quai de Conti. The current building, which gave its name to the Monnaie district (6th arrondissement), houses the Monnaie de Paris as well as the Musée de la Monnaie (renamed The Musée du 11 Conti since its reopening in 2017).

The station is with &quot;Ledru-Rollin&quot; on line 8 and &quot;Voltaire&quot; on line 9 one of the three stopping points chosen as prototypes of the decorative style &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot;, which was tested there in 1974. It is the model of those of orange colour.
As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; renovation programme, its corridors were renovated on 18 August 2004.

Since 2005 and the closure of the La Samaritaine department store for long renovation and reconstruction works, the number of visitors to the metro station has decreased from 1.68 million admissions, before the closure (from September 2004 to June 2005), to 1.32 million admissions, after it (from September 2005 to June 2006).

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 605,030 passengers entered this station, which places it in the 283rd position out of 304 metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three accesses, each consisting of a fixed staircase with a Dervaux-type balustrade:
* access 1 - &quot;Rue de la Monnaie&quot;, decorated with a Dervaux candelabrum, leading to the Quai du Louvre at the corner with Rue de la Monnaie, opposite the department store La Samaritaine;
* access 2 - &quot;Quai du Louvre&quot; located opposite the previous one on the said quay, on the Seine side at the corner with the Pont Neuf;
* access 3 - &quot;Pont Neuf&quot;, also decorated with a Dervaux mast, located at the same angle in the immediate vicinity of access 2.
===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Pont-Neuf is a station with a standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two orange light strips. The benches and tunnel exits are covered in flat orange tiles as well as &quot;Motte&quot; seats in the same colour. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the side walls, the vault and the outlets of the corridors, at the eastern end. The advertising frames are in earthenware in a honey colour and the name of the station is also in earthenware in the style of the original CMP.
This decoration is complemented by a cultural arrangement on the theme of the Monnaie de Paris. In the centre of the platforms are presented reproductions of different coins of large dimensions. These representations begin on one side of the platform and reach the other via the vault. The platforms also include an old monetary pendulum as well as two showcases displaying real coins.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 27, 58, 67, 69, 70, 72, 74 and 85 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N11, N15, N16 and N24 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Pont Marie () is a station of the Paris Métro opened in 1926 with the extension of Line 7 from Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre. It is named after the nearby bridge over the Seine, the Pont Marie, which connects to Île Saint-Louis.

==Location==
The station is located on the banks of the Seine, on the Quai de l&#x27;Hôtel-de-Ville, near the Place du Bataillon-Français-de-l&#x27;ONU-en-Korea, west of the Pont Marie and the Rue des Nonnains-d&#x27;Hyères. Oriented along an east-west axis, it is located between the Châtelet and Sully-Morland stations.

==History==
The station opened on April 16, 1926. It was until 3 June 1930, the southern terminus of line 7 from Porte de la Villette and Pré-Saint-Gervais, replacing the previous terminus at &quot;Palais Royal&quot; (now Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre station), when the line was extended with an additional station at &quot;Pont Sully&quot; (which soon became Sully - Morland).

It takes its name from its proximity to the Marie Bridge, built in 1614 on the initiative of the engineer-entrepreneur Christophe Marie, who gave it its name.

The subtitle of the station is Cité des Arts because of its proximity to one of the two sites of the Cité internationale des arts, an artistic residence inaugurated in 1965, welcoming artists of all specialties and nationalities.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; programme, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and inaugurated on 25 March 2008.

In 2021, 1,101,482 passengers entering this station, which placed it in 275th position among metro stations for ridership out of 304.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances made up of fixed stairs built back-to-back, each embellished with a Dervaux-type balustrade and leading to the central embankment of the Place du Bataillon-Français-de-l&#x27;ONU-en-Korea, opposite the Cité des Arts:
* Access 1 - &quot;Quai de l&#x27;Hôtel-de-Ville&quot;, adorned with a Dervaux candelabra, located at 18 Rue de l&#x27;Hôtel-de-Ville;
* Access 2 - &quot;Pont Marie - Île Saint-Louis&quot; is located slightly further east, to the right of Square Albert-Schweitzer.
===Station layout===

===Platform===
Pont Marie is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used in most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the corridor openings. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware and the name of the station is also made of earthenware in the style of the original CMP, while the subtitle underneath is inscribed in Parisine font on small, enamelled plates. The &quot;Akiko&quot; style seats are yellow in colour.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 67 and 72 of the RATP Bus Network.

<doc id="504437" wikidata="Q1463644" url="?curid=504437" title="Jussieu station">
<text>Jussieu () is a station on lines 7 and 10 of the Paris Métro in the eastern part of the Latin Quarter in the 5th arrondissement.

==History==
The station was opened on 26 April 1931 with the extension of line 7 from Pont de Sully to Place Monge and its incorporation of part of Line 10 from Place Monge to Porte de Choisy. At the same time the remaining section of line 10 was extended from the new station of Cardinal Lemoine to &quot;Jussieu&quot;.

It was formerly called Jussieu - Halle-aux-vins, but today only the name of Jussieu remains, because the small Halle aux Vins, created by Napoleon I, has disappeared and in its location is now (since 1957) the Jussieu Campus (now Campus Pierre-et-Marie-Curie). The station is under and named after the Place Jussieu, which was named after the De Jussieu family of famous botanists and historians of the natural world, several of whom have been associated with the nearby Jardin des Plantes.

The platforms for the two lines were renovated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in 1975, but for the first time with flat tiling instead of the traditional bevelled tiling.

During the first half of 2020, work was undertaken to provide the station with a second escalator to exit the station. This was parallel to the main entrance and directly connects the ticket hall to the road network. The operation was accompanied with a redevelopment of Place Jussieu.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 1,891,986 travellers entered this station, which places it in 127th position among metro stations for its usage.

In 2021, attendance is gradually increasing, with 2,889,642 travellers entering this station, which places it in 114th position among metro stations for usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances all located on Place Jussieu. The first two lead to Rue Linné, one of which has an escalator only for entering, the other a staircase. The third, also equipped with an escalator, is used as an exit only from the station.

=== Station layout ===


===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. Two platforms per stopping point ar separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical. The two stations are positioned at the same level in parallel and in a slight curve on the east side. However, the platforms of line 10 are 75 meters long while those of line 7 are 105 meters long. Access corridors in the right wall common to the two stations allow a direct connection between the platform of line 10 in the direction of Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz and that of line 7 in the direction of Mairie d&#x27;Ivry or Villejuif - Louis Aragon. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two light canopies, with the tunnel exits covered with flat coloured tiling and &quot;Motte&quot; seats are in orange for line 7 and blue for line 10. This layout is combined in the two cases with the flat white ceramic tiles that cover the side walls, the vault and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamel plates.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by the 67 and 89 lines of the RATP Bus Network (towards Gare de Vanves only) as well as by line 87 (from the Jussieu - Minéraux stop located approximately 200 meters away and serving as the terminus and departure point for partial services specific to this line from Monday to Friday at peak times and at the start of the evening).

<doc id="504440" wikidata="Q177476" url="?curid=504440" title="Place Monge station">
<text>Place Monge () is a station on Line 7 of the Paris Métro and located in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located in the middle of the 5th arrondissement of Paris, under the Rue Monge to the north-east of the Place Monge. Oriented along a north-south axis, it is interspersed between the &quot;Jussieu&quot; and &quot;Censier - Daubenton&quot; metro stations. In the direction of &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Ivry&quot; and &quot;Villejuif - Louis Aragon&quot;, it was preceded by a connection with line 10, which was in commercial service for a year, from 1930 to 1931, when this line had as its terminus &quot;Porte de Choisy&quot;.

==History==
It opened on 15 February 1930 as part of a planned section of the line, which was temporarily operated as part of Line 10 until the completion of the under-Seine crossing of Line 7 from Pont de Sully. This former arrangement can still be seen at the north of the station where a non-revenue track diverges on the left, leading to Cardinal Lemoine (now on Line 10). The station was integrated into Line 7 on 26 April 1931.

It serves Place Monge, named after Gaspard Monge (1746–1818), a French mathematician who is best known as the inventor of descriptive geometry. The station is located in the eastern part of the Latin Quarter. Nearby are the Jardin des Plantes (botanical garden), the Roman remains of the Arènes de Lutèce and the Rue Mouffetard, a street with restaurants and a lively street market.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two accesses divided into three metro entrances:
* access 1 - &quot;Place Monge&quot; consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with a balustrade and a Dervaux-type candelabrum, located to the north-east of the square, and an exit with an entourage designed by Joseph Cassien-Bernard comprising two escalators leading to the southeast of said square;
* access 2 - &quot;Rue de Navarre&quot;, with an original kiosk with two entrances whose architecture echoes that of the Arènes de Lutèce, located on the even sidewalk of Rue de Navarre, adjoining the Square des Arènes de Lutèce and Square Capitan.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Place Monge is a station with a standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte &quot;style with two brown light canopies, benches covered in flat brown tiles and orange &quot;Motte&quot; seats. These fittings are combined with the bevelled white ceramic tiles that cover the side walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are in honey-coloured earthenware with plant motifs and the name of the station is also in earthenware in the Interwar period of the original CMP.

The platforms were designed to accommodate trains 105 meters long, but only 75 meters are actually used. A track device is located at the north end of the station in the unused part of the platforms, a very rare case on the network that was also found at the Saint-Lazare station on line 14.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 47 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N15 and N22 of the Noctilien network.

<doc id="504444" wikidata="Q894624" url="?curid=504444" title="Botafogo">
<text>Botafogo ( ) is a beachfront neighborhood (&quot;bairro&quot;) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is a mostly upper middle class and small commerce community, and is located between the hills of Mundo Novo, Dona Marta (which separates it from Laranjeiras) and São João (which separates it from Copacabana). The word Botafogo also refers to a Latin American ballroom dance move that originated in this area.

== Etymology ==

Botafogo was named after João Pereira de Sousa Botafogo (1540–1627), who was responsible for the galleon &quot;Botafogo&quot;&#x27;s artillery. Because of that, he received the nickname &quot;Botafogo&quot; and included it in his family name. When he went to live in Brazil, the Portuguese Crown granted him the land known today as Botafogo. The name literally means &quot;set it on fire&quot; in Portuguese (a reference to the &quot;Botafogo&quot; galleon&#x27;s artillery power). In the mid-19th century, English language speakers also called it Boto Fogo.

== History ==
The neighborhood dates back to 1702, when the process of distributing lands began with the establishment of three large farms on the outskirts of newly-minted Rio. By 1808, the city&#x27;s elite had begun to build mansions in the parish of Botafogo, giving rise to a small collective of nobles, merchants, and court officials. By 1820 several roads through the swampy area had been established that remain to this day, including Rua Marquês de Abrantes, São Clemente, Rua da Passagem, Rua General Polidoro, and the eponymous Praia de Botafogo. With the establishment of a ferry and animal-drawn trams in the 1867 and 1871 respectively, the neighborhood began expanding inland and becoming more dense alongside the introduction of amenities like running water and gas lighting. 

In 1903 the last of the original farmland was turned over to build a new home for St. Ignatius School as Botafogo completed its transformation from elite hideaway to mostly-middleclass stronghold. In this time the construction of the New and Old Tunnels also marked a new chapter in the city&#x27;s expansion, as Botafogo became the connective tissue between the old city center and new developments in Ipanema and Copacabana.

== Attractions and amenities ==
Botafogo&#x27;s beach is within Guanabara Bay, sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by the Urca peninsula and Sugarloaf Mountain. Attractions include the Home of Ruy Barbosa, the Museu do Índio—which explores the culture and history of the major indigenous peoples of Brazil—and the Villa-Lobos Museum. The Public Archive for the State of Rio de Janeiro (APERJ) is also located in Botafogo. Another iconic construction in Botafogo was the Pavilhão Mourisco, built in 1907 in an Arab style on Praia de Botafogo. It featured five golden domes, resembling the Al Askari Mosque in Iraq, and an interior with marble staircases and Arabic inscriptions. Originally a music hall, it later thrived as a restaurant-bar, especially at night when fully illuminated.

Demolished in 1952, the site was later occupied by the Clube de Regatas Botafogo. In the early 21st century, it was replaced by the Centro Empresarial Mourisco, a modern glass office building.

==Sports==
Botafogo is the home of Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, a multi-sport club whose football team is one of Brazil&#x27;s biggest.

==Infrastructure==
The neighborhood is served by Botafogo Station on the Rio de Janeiro Metro.

==Education==

The Deutsche Schule Rio de Janeiro (Escola Alemã Corcovado) is located in Botafogo.

<doc id="504454" wikidata="Q333683" url="?curid=504454" title="F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead">
<text>Frederick Edwin Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead, (12 July 1872 – 30 September 1930) was a British Conservative politician and barrister who attained high office in the early 20th century, in particular as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. He was a skilled orator, noted for his staunch opposition to Irish nationalism, his wit, pugnacious views, and hard living and drinking. He is perhaps best remembered today as Winston Churchill&#x27;s greatest personal and political friend until Birkenhead&#x27;s death aged 58 from pneumonia caused by cirrhosis of the liver.

==Early life and schooling==
Smith was born at 38 Pilgrim Street, Birkenhead in Cheshire, the eldest son and second of five surviving children of Frederick Smith (1845–1888), a barrister-at-law, and Elizabeth (1842–1928), daughter of Edwin Taylor a rate collector, of Birkenhead. His father had joined the family business as an estate agent, later becoming a barrister and local Tory politician. Frederick Smith senior died at the age of forty-three, only a month after being elected mayor of Birkenhead.

Smith was educated first at a dame school in Birkenhead, then at Sandringham School in Southport (where he announced, at the age of ten, his ambition to become lord chancellor), and then, having failed the entrance exam for Harrow School, at Birkenhead School (1887–1889).

==Oxford==
Smith won a scholarship to University College, Liverpool, where he spent four terms (a fact he subsequently suppressed).

He won a scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1891. Smith made his name as an Oxford &quot;swell&quot;, distinguishing himself by his dark good looks, his energy, his unashamed ambition and his scathing wit. He was the dominant figure of a group of Wadham contemporaries including the athlete C. B. Fry, the future Liberal politician John Simon, and the Liberal economist Francis Hirst. Between them they dominated both the rugby field and the Oxford Union Society.

Smith was already active in national politics as a Tory speaker in the July 1892 general election. Announced initially as his father&#x27;s son, he spoke all over Lancashire, stirring up Orange opinion against the Liberal policy of Irish home rule.

He obtained a Second Class in Classical Mods before switching to Law. He often debated against Hilaire Belloc at the Oxford Union, where a bust of him now stands, and became President in Trinity term 1894. By massive last-minute cramming he graduated with a first class BA degree in law in 1895.

To his disappointment, he only obtained a Second in his Bachelor of Civil Law degree. In 1896 he won the Vinerian law scholarship and was elected a fellow of Merton College (1896–9), and also a lecturership at Oriel College. The F. E. Smith Memorial Mooting Prizes nowadays commemorate him at Merton. In later life his depth of legal learning often surprised critics.

Smith added to his Oxford reputation in May 1897, when he went to see the Prince of Wales open the new Oxford Town Hall. A detachment of the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch had been drafted in to reinforce the small Oxford City Police force against a large demonstration of university undergraduates. The Metropolitan police, who were unused to boisterous Oxford undergraduates, attacked them with batons, causing several serious injuries. The crowd unhorsed and trampled one policeman. Smith took no part in the disorder, but was arrested when he tried to rescue his college servant, who was being manhandled by the police. Smith became the first prisoner in the police station in the new Town Hall. Before being locked in, Smith raised his hands for silence and declared &quot;I have great pleasure in declaring this cell open&quot;. He was tried for obstructing the police in the lawful execution of their duty, but was found not guilty after defending himself in court.

==Career as a barrister==
Having eaten his dinners at Gray&#x27;s Inn and passed his bar finals with distinction in the summer of 1899, Smith was called to the Bar and finally left Oxford, and quickly built up a brilliant and lucrative practice on the Northern Circuit, initially basing himself in Liverpool.

===Formidable style and high-profile court cases===

Smith rapidly acquired a reputation as a formidable advocate, first in Liverpool and then, after his election to Parliament in 1906, in London. He was junior counsel during the prosecution of John McKeever tried at Liverpool Assizes for the murder of the Protestant activist John Kensit. Although McKeever was acquitted, Smith kept the weapon, a file or chisel and a photograph of where the incident took place in his chambers.

In 1907 he was asked to give an opinion on a proposed libel action by the Lever Brothers against newspapers owned by Lord Northcliffe concerning the latter&#x27;s allegations of a conspiracy to raise the price of soap by means of a &#x27;soap trust&#x27;. He checked into the Savoy and, after working all night reading a pile of papers nearly four feet thick and consuming a bottle of champagne and two dozen oysters, Smith wrote a one-sentence opinion: &quot;There is no answer to this action in libel, and the damages must be enormous&quot;. The newspapers subsequently paid Lever £50,000, more than four times the previous record for a defamation action or out-of-court published settlement in the country.

In February 1908, Smith was made a King&#x27;s Counsel by Lord Loreburn, on the same day as his friend and rival from Wadham College, future Home Secretary Sir John Simon. At the Bar, he became one of the best known and most highly paid barristers in the country, making over £10,000 per year before the First World War. His spending was commensurate with this income even after he took less well-paid government positions in later years, something of which he would bitterly complain. Part of his income funded the purchase of a country house, The Cottage at Charlton, Northamptonshire, in 1907. The house was greatly enlarged in 1911–1912.

In one of the best-known cases in which Smith was involved he successfully defended Ethel le Neve, mistress of Hawley Harvey Crippen (&quot;Dr. Crippen&quot;), against a charge of murder. Le Neve was accused of killing Crippen&#x27;s wife. Crippen was tried separately and convicted.

==Member of Parliament==

Ambitious to enter Parliament, Smith cultivated the local Tory boss Archibald Salvidge.

In 1903, Smith gave a dazzling speech in Liverpool in support of Joseph Chamberlain, who was campaigning for Tariff Reform. On the strength of this, he was selected three months later as candidate for the working-class constituency of Walton division. He campaigned as the champion of hard-drinking, patriotic working men (Liberals tended to favour temperance and more pacific foreign policy) and in the 1906 election he narrowly held the seat despite the national Liberal landslide. He held the seat until the redrawing of boundaries in 1918.

He attracted attention by a brilliant maiden speech, &quot;I Warn the Government...&quot; After this speech, Tim Healy, the Irish Nationalist, a master of parliamentary invective, sent Smith a note, &quot;I am old, and you are young, but you have beaten me at my own game.&quot; In his maiden speech he argued that advocating tariffs had not hurt the Tories at the recent election. Smith also opposed the Trade Disputes Act 1906 arguing that intimidatory picketing should not be allowed. The Conservative leadership, unwilling to antagonise organised labour, did not oppose the Act very hard.

Smith did not support restriction on the powers of the House of Lords, fearing that tyranny could result from an unchecked unicameral parliament.

He was soon a prominent leader of the Unionist wing of the Conservative Party, especially in the planned Ulster resistance to Irish Home Rule. He attended the Blenheim Palace rally on 27 July 1912, at which Bonar Law advocated forcible resistance. From the signing of the Ulster Covenant in September 1912 onwards, he was often at Edward Carson&#x27;s side on horseback, hence the derisive nickname &quot;Galloper Smith&quot;.

A vociferous opponent of the Disestablishment of the Welsh part of the Church of England, he called the Welsh Disestablishment Bill &quot;a bill which has shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe&quot;. This prompted G. K. Chesterton to write a satirical poem, , which asked if Breton sailors, Russian peasants and Christians evicted by the Turks would know or care of what happened to the Anglican Church of Wales, and answered the question with the line &quot;Chuck it, Smith&quot;. The bill was approved by Parliament under the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911, but was stalled by the outbreak of the First World War. When it was finally implemented in 1920, Smith was part of the Lloyd George coalition that did so.

==First World War==
Smith had joined the Territorial Army by commission into the Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars, in which Churchill was already an officer, in 1913, and was a captain in the regiment before the outbreak of the First World War. On its outbreak he was placed in charge of the Government&#x27;s Press Bureau, with rank of full colonel and responsibility for newspaper censorship. He was not very successful in this role, and in 1914–1915 served in France as a staff officer with the Indian Corps with ultimate temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. He and his successor as &#x27;recording officer&#x27; (a Colonel Merewether) later collaborated on an official history entitled &quot;The Indian Corps in France&quot; (published 1917).

In May 1915, he was appointed Solicitor General by H. H. Asquith and knighted. He soon after (in October 1915) succeeded his friend Sir Edward Carson as Attorney General, with the right to attend Cabinet. Early in 1916 he was briefly placed under military arrest for arriving at Boulogne without a pass, and had to be &#x27;appeased&#x27; by a meeting with General Sir Douglas Haig.

As Attorney General, it was his responsibility to lead the prosecution for the Crown in major cases such as the trial in 1916 of the Irish nationalist Sir Roger Casement for treason. Sir Roger had been captured after landing from a &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; U-boat on Banna Strand in Tralee Bay in north County Kerry, south-west Ireland, just a few days before the Easter Rising in late April 1916. His prosecution of Casement (and Wheeldon in 1917) contributed to Smith&#x27;s reputation as a spectacular advocate at the time.

Smith was made a baronet in 1918. Following abolition of the Walton seat in constituency boundary changes, Smith was returned at the December 1918 general election for neighbouring West Derby Division, only to be elevated to the House of Lords two months later.

==Lord Chancellor in the postwar coalition==

In 1919, he was created Baron Birkenhead, of Birkenhead in the County of Chester following his appointment as Lord Chancellor by Lloyd George. At the age of 47, he was the youngest Lord Chancellor since Lord Cowper in 1707 and possibly since Judge Jeffreys (John Simon would have been younger had he accepted the post in 1915). The &quot;Morning Post&quot; commented that his appointment as Attorney-General had been amusing but that his further promotion was &quot;carrying a joke beyond the limits of pleasantry&quot;, while the King urged Lloyd George to reconsider. Birkenhead proved an excellent Lord Chancellor, but tales of his drunkenness begin from this time, very likely as he grew bored with the job and as it dawned on him that he had probably ruled himself out from the premiership by accepting a peerage.

That year, in the House of Lords debate on the Amritsar Massacre, he courageously denounced Tories who declared General Dyer (the responsible officer) a hero. He played a key role in the passage of several key legal reforms, including the Law of Property Act 1922, which began the reform of English land law which was to come to fruition in the mid-1920s. He also unsuccessfully championed a reform of the divorce laws, which he judged caused great misery and which favoured the wealthy.

Despite his Unionist background, Smith played an important role in the negotiations that led to the signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, which led to the formation of the Irish Free State the following year. Much of the treaty was drafted by Smith. His support for this, and his warm relations with the Irish nationalist leaders Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, angered some of his former Unionist associates, notably Sir Edward Carson. Upon signing the Treaty he remarked to Collins, &quot;I may have just signed my political death warrant&quot;, to which Collins dryly and with prescient accuracy replied, &quot;I have just signed my actual death warrant&quot;. Collins was killed by opponents of the treaty eight months after the signing, during the Irish Civil War.

Also in 1921, he was responsible for the House of Lords rejecting a proposal, put forward by Frederick Alexander Macquisten, MP for Argyllshire, to criminalise lesbianism. During the debate, Birkenhead argued that 999 women out of a thousand had &quot;never even heard a whisper of these practices&quot;.

Smith was created Viscount Birkenhead, of Birkenhead in the County of Chester, in the 1921 Birthday Honours, then Viscount Furneaux, of Charlton in the County of Northampton, and Earl of Birkenhead in 1922. By 1922 Birkenhead and Churchill had become the leading figures of the Lloyd George Coalition. The Anglo-Irish Treaty, the attempt to go to war with Turkey over Chanak (which was later vetoed by the governments of the Dominions) and a general whiff of moral and financial corruption which had come to surround the Coalition were all hallmarks of his tenure in office.

A scandal erupted in 1922 when it became known that Lloyd George, through the agency of Maundy Gregory, had awarded honours and titles such as a baronetcy to rich businessmen in return for cash in the range of £10,000 and more. At an earlier meeting before Parliament broke up for the summer, and more famously at the Carlton Club meeting in October 1922, Birkenhead&#x27;s hectoring of the junior ministers and backbenchers was one of the factors leading to the withdrawal of support from the Coalition.

==Out of office: 1922–24==

Like many of the senior members of the Coalition, Birkenhead did not hold office in the Bonar Law and Baldwin governments of 1922–24. Unlike the others Birkenhead was rude and open in his contempt for the new governments. He bore no grudge against Bonar Law but criticised Leslie Wilson and Lord Curzon. He sneered that Wilson and Sir George Younger were &quot;the cabin boys&quot; who had taken over the ship, he referred to Lords Salisbury and Selborne as &quot;the Dolly Sisters&quot; after two starlets of the era and remarked that the new Cabinet was one of &quot;second-class brains&quot;, to which came the reply from Lord Robert Cecil that this was better than &quot;second-class characters&quot;. He remarked that he had lost the Woolsack but was still &quot;captain of [his] own soul&quot; to which a wag retorted that this was &quot;a small command of which no-one will want to deprive him&quot;.

In the House of Lords, on 7 December 1922, he read out a letter dated 15 February 1922 in which the Greek leader Dimitrios Gounaris had begged the Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon (who had deserted the Coalition in its final hours and thus retained his office under Bonar Law) for British help in her war against Turkey. Since then, Gounaris had been executed as a scapegoat for the catastrophic Greek defeat. Birkenhead claimed that he had no knowledge of this letter, a claim which was soon echoed by Lloyd George and other leading coalitionists Austen Chamberlain, Robert Horne and Worthington-Evans. The accusations, if true, might have forced Curzon&#x27;s resignation and jeopardised the ongoing negotiation of the Treaty of Lausanne. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey located the letter, and the reply urging Gounaris to &quot;hold on&quot;, which Curzon had circulated to the Cabinet, and which Birkenhead had initialled as read. On 11 December Birkenhead was forced to apologise (&quot;frigidly received&quot; by the Lords, according to &quot;The Times&quot;) and Lady Curzon retaliated by cutting him at a ball, but as she remarked to her husband in a letter, he was &quot;too drunk to notice&quot; the snub.

In May 1923, Stanley Baldwin succeeded Bonar Law as Prime Minister. He remarked to his new Cabinet, referring to Birkenhead&#x27;s exclusion, that they were &quot;a Cabinet of faithful husbands&quot; – this referred to Birkenhead&#x27;s general character rather than simply his marital infidelities.

Even a famous speech, the Rectorial Address to the University of Glasgow on 7 November 1923, in which Birkenhead told undergraduates that the world still offered &quot;glittering prizes&quot; to those with &quot;stout hearts and sharp swords&quot;, now seemed out of kilter with the less aggressive and more self-consciously moral style of politics advocated by the new generation of Conservative politicians such as Stanley Baldwin and Edward Wood, the future Lord Halifax. Birkenhead regarded the League of Nations as idealistic nonsense, and thought that international relations should be guided by &quot;self-interest&quot;, lest Britain decline like Imperial Spain. Rather, he believed that the power of nations would still be determined by their military strength.

By this time Birkenhead was regarded with distaste by much of the grassroots Conservative Party. J. C. C. Davidson reported back to Central Office (18 November 1923) on his recent re-adoption as candidate for Hemel Hempstead that many members were unwilling to support him without an assurance that he would not support Birkenhead&#x27;s return to the Cabinet, lest this cost local votes at the upcoming election. He commented that this was proof that Puritanism was deep in the English blood, and not just in that of Nonconformist chapel-goers. Neville Chamberlain recorded in his diary (18 November 1923) that Birkenhead had &quot;so often and so deeply shocked the moral sense of the country by his drunkenness and loose living character that our Govt which rests largely on public confidence in our character would be seriously tarnished by association with such a man&quot;.

After the December 1923 General Election, at which Baldwin lost his majority and a hung Parliament was returned, Birkenhead briefly intrigued for another Lloyd George coalition government. In order to discourage them from associating with Lloyd George, Baldwin quickly invited former coalitionists Austen Chamberlain, Birkenhead and Balfour to join the Shadow Cabinet. Birkenhead persuaded his friend Churchill to stand (unsuccessfully, as an independent &quot;Constitutionalist&quot;) in the March 1924 Westminster Abbey by-election. This was part of Churchill&#x27;s move back towards rejoining the Conservative Party.

A 1924 entry in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s diary states that an English High Court judge, presiding in a sodomy case, sought advice on sentencing from Lord Birkenhead. &quot;Could you tell me,&quot; he asked, &quot;what do you think one ought to give a man who allows himself to be buggered?&quot; Birkenhead replied without hesitation, &quot;Oh, thirty shillings or two pounds; whatever you happen to have on you.&quot;

==Personal life and affair==
Smith married Margaret Eleanor Furneaux, daughter of classical scholar Henry Furneaux, in April 1901. They had three children:

* Lady Eleanor Furneaux Smith (born 7 August 1902, died 20 October 1945)
* Frederick Winston Furneaux Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead (born 7 December 1907, died 10 June 1975)
* Lady Pamela Margaret Elizabeth Smith (born 16 May 1914, died 7 January 1982), married Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell.

In around 1919, Birkenhead began an affair with Mona Dunn, the then seventeen year old daughter of the Canadian financier James Hamet Dunn, a friend of Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s (it is unclear how much her father knew of the affair). Beaverbrook, in so far as can be discerned from the limited surviving evidence in letters, appears to have provided a cover for sexual liaisons between the two of them, and for womanising by others of their social circle. She appears to have been genuinely in love with Birkenhead, whereas he was mildly fond of her but regarded her as no more than a mistress. The affair attracted the fury of Birkenhead’s daughter, a friend of Mona&#x27;s, a state of affairs likened by Campbell to the relations between Lloyd George, his mistress Frances Stevenson, and his daughter Megan.

In 1926 Arnold Bennett published a novel, &quot;Lord Raingo&quot;, about a self-made millionaire who becomes a peer and a Cabinet Minister (under a Prime Minister clearly based on Lloyd George), and who keeps a young mistress. The character was actually largely based on Lord Rhondda and Beaverbrook himself. Birkenhead gave an angry interview to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in which he criticised both the novel and the recent practice of Colonel Repington, Colonel House and Margot Asquith in publishing political secrets so close in time to the events. Bennett replied that the character was not based on any single person and anyway that it was not for Birkenhead, who had recently published a potboiler called &quot;Famous Trials&quot;, to criticise others for writing books to make money. The two men, who were both members of The Other Club, remained on friendly terms.

Mona Dunn had married &quot;Bunny&quot; Tattersall in February 1925. She had a daughter, then died in Paris aged 26 on 19 December 1928, officially of peritonitis. The original text (1983) of John Campbell&#x27;s biography states that there is no evidence for the tales that she died of a failed abortion. However, later editions contain a footnote adding that it had since come to the author&#x27;s attention that her husband had been paid off by Birkenhead to enter into a marriage of convenience with her as a cover for their continued affair, and that, the affair now over, she then fled to Paris with a third man, where she died of &quot;appendicitis and drink&quot; (inverted commas in the original). Birkenhead wrote a poem in her memory, which Beaverbrook declined to publish in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; at the time, but eventually published three decades later in his life of Sir James Dunn.

==Secretary of State for India: 1924–28==
Despite winning a large majority at the 1924 election, Baldwin formed a broad new (second) government by appointing former coalitionists such as Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain and former Liberal Winston Churchill to senior Cabinet posts; this was to discourage them from associating with Lloyd George to revive the 1916-22 Coalition. Birkenhead and Chamberlain lobbied Baldwin to reappoint another former coalitionist, Robert Horne, to the Exchequer, but Baldwin refused and appointed Churchill instead.

From 1924 to 1928 Birkenhead served as Secretary of State for India. His views on pre-partition India&#x27;s independence movement were gloomy. He thought India&#x27;s Hindu–Muslim religious divide insurmountable and sought to block advances in native participation in provincial governments that had been granted by the 1919 Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms. His parliamentary private secretary recalled much time ostensibly on India Office business seemed to be spent playing golf. It was in his government role that in October 1927 he unveiled the Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial to Indian Army soldiers of no known grave killed on the Western Front in the 1914–18 War.

Birkenhead endorsed his old political opponent H. H. Asquith, rather than his Cabinet colleague Lord Cave, in the 1925 University of Oxford Chancellor election. He wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; on 19 May, describing Asquith as the &quot;greatest living Oxonian&quot;, but his support may have done more harm than good, because of his association with the discredited Lloyd George Coalition, and because of his open scepticism both of religion and of the League of Nations. It was quipped that Asquith was &quot;a warming-pan” for Birkenhead&#x27;s views (a learned Oxford joke, referring to the legend that the Old Pretender had been an impostor baby rather than a rightful heir to the throne). Lord Cave was elected.

He was engaged outside the office in negotiating for the government with the Trades Union Congress to try to avert the 1926 General Strike and he strongly supported the 1927 Trades Disputes Act which required union members to contract into the political levies.

Baldwin remained suspicious of the activities of Birkenhead and the former coalitionists. Beatrice Webb recorded (diary 14 March 1928) him remarking &quot;the future Coalition&quot; when he saw Churchill, Lloyd George and Birkenhead chatting at the end of a state dinner. Lord Cave resigned as Lord Chancellor early in 1928. Birkenhead apparently did not want to return to his old job, but neither did Baldwin offer it to him. According to Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s diary (28 March 1928), this was because &quot;he might be seen drunk in the street&quot; (Lord Hailsham was appointed instead). Birkenhead retired from the Cabinet in October 1928 to make money in business.

In 1928 he was appointed Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India.

==Later life and assessments==
Birkenhead&#x27;s increasingly pompous oratory caused David Low to caricature him in the 1920s as &quot;Lord Burstinghead&quot;. After retiring from politics, he became Rector of the University of Aberdeen, a director of Tate &amp; Lyle, a director of Imperial Chemical Industries, and High Steward of the University of Oxford. In a 1983 biography review, William Camp – who had written a 1960 biography of the man – opined that &quot;F.E. was the quintessential male chauvinist who, almost with his dying breath, dragged himself to the Lords in July 1930 to attack the right of peeresses to take their seats.&quot;

Birkenhead wrote a series of articles (later republished in &quot;Last Essays&quot;: 1930) about &quot;The peril to India&quot;, in which he criticised the Indian Nationalist leaders as &quot;a collection ... of very inferior Kerenskis&quot; and asserted that it was widely accepted that without British rule India would collapse into anarchy. He attacked the Irwin Declaration as &quot;so ambiguous that it is impossible to select from it any clear and unambiguous proposal&quot;.

In the opinion of Winston Churchill, who was a friend: &quot;He had all the canine virtues in a remarkable degree – courage, fidelity, vigilance, love of chase.&quot; As for Margot Asquith, who was not a friend, she thought: &quot;F. E. Smith is very clever, but sometimes his brains go to his head.&quot; Of Birkenhead&#x27;s loyalty, Churchill added: &quot;If he was with you on Monday, he would be the same on Tuesday. And on Thursday, when things looked blue, he would still be marching forward with strong reinforcements.&quot;

Gilbert Frankau recalled in his own autobiography &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, that in 1928 Sir Thomas Horder confided: &quot;Birkenhead&#x27;s pure eighteenth-century. He belongs to the days of Fox and Pitt. Physically, he has all the strength of our best yeoman stock. Mentally, he&#x27;s a colossus. But he&#x27;ll tear himself to pieces by the time he&#x27;s sixty.&quot;

In 1930 he published his utopian &quot;The World in 2030&quot; with airbrush illustrations by E. McKnight Kauffer. The book was the subject of considerable controversy as several passages were alleged to have been copied from earlier works by J. B. S. Haldane.

Birkenhead died in London in 1930, aged 58, from pneumonia caused by cirrhosis of the liver. After cremation at Golders Green Crematorium, his ashes were buried in the parish churchyard at Charlton, Northamptonshire.

===Screen portrayals===
As &quot;Lord Birkenhead&quot;, he is dramatised in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, as an official of the British Olympic Committee. He is played by actor Nigel Davenport.

His role in the Anglo-Irish treaty negotiations was featured in the penultimate episode of the 1981 BBC Wales biographical series &quot;The Life and Times of David Lloyd George,&quot;where he was portrayed by Morris Perry.

<text>Les Gobelins () is a station on line 7 of the Paris Métro on the edges of the 5th and 13th arrondissements. 

This station is named after &quot;Avenue des Gobelins&quot;, which honoured the Gobelin family who manufactured dyes from the mid 15th century on the banks of the nearby river Bièvre (now covered in the area). The family manufactured tapestries from 1662 until its factory (adjacent to the station) was acquired by Louis XIV. It is located at the crossroads of four main roads: avenue des Gobelins, Boulevard Saint Marcel, Boulevard Arago, and Boulevard de Port-Royal.
== History ==
The station opened on 15 February 1930 as part of line 10&#x27;s extension from Odéon to Place d&#x27;Italie. On 26 April 1931, it was transferred to line 7 when its under-Seine crossing from &quot;Pont de Sully&quot; (now known as Sully–Morland) to Place Monge was completed.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 21 April 2005.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,377,372 passengers, making it the 149th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,733,427 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 142nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,365,942 passengers, making it the 143rd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 5 accesses:

* Access 1: Boulevard Saint-Marcel
* Access 2: Boulevard Arago
* Access 3: rue Le Brun
* Access 4: Manufacture des Gobelins (an exit only escalator from the southbound platform)
* Access 5: rue des Gobelins

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 24, 27, 47, 59, 83, and 91 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N01, N02, N15, and N22 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="504458" wikidata="Q2300258" url="?curid=504458" title="Conditional probability distribution">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, the conditional probability distribution is a probability distribution that describes the probability of an outcome given the occurrence of a particular event. Given two jointly distributed random variables formula_1 and formula_2, the conditional probability distribution of formula_2 given formula_1 is the probability distribution of formula_2 when formula_1 is known to be a particular value; in some cases the conditional probabilities may be expressed as functions containing the unspecified value formula_7 of formula_1 as a parameter. When both formula_1 and formula_2 are categorical variables, a conditional probability table is typically used to represent the conditional probability. The conditional distribution contrasts with the marginal distribution of a random variable, which is its distribution without reference to the value of the other variable.

If the conditional distribution of formula_2 given formula_1 is a continuous distribution, then its probability density function is known as the conditional density function. The properties of a conditional distribution, such as the moments, are often referred to by corresponding names such as the conditional mean and conditional variance.

More generally, one can refer to the conditional distribution of a subset of a set of more than two variables; this conditional distribution is contingent on the values of all the remaining variables, and if more than one variable is included in the subset then this conditional distribution is the conditional joint distribution of the included variables.

==Conditional discrete distributions==
For discrete random variables, the conditional probability mass function of formula_2 given formula_14 can be written according to its definition as:

Due to the occurrence of formula_15 in the denominator, this is defined only for non-zero (hence strictly positive) formula_16

The relation with the probability distribution of formula_1 given formula_2 is:

:formula_19

===Example===
Consider the roll of a fair die and let formula_20 if the number is even (i.e., 2, 4, or 6) and formula_21 otherwise. Furthermore, let formula_22 if the number is prime (i.e., 2, 3, or 5) and formula_23 otherwise.
Then the unconditional probability that formula_20 is 3/6 = 1/2 (since there are six possible rolls of the dice, of which three are even), whereas the probability that formula_20 conditional on formula_22 is 1/3 (since there are three possible prime number rolls—2, 3, and 5—of which one is even).

==Conditional continuous distributions==
Similarly for continuous random variables, the conditional probability density function of formula_2 given the occurrence of the value formula_7 of formula_1 can be written as

where formula_30 gives the joint density of formula_1 and formula_2, while formula_33 gives the marginal density for formula_1. Also in this case it is necessary that formula_35.

The relation with the probability distribution of formula_1 given formula_2 is given by:
:formula_38

The concept of the conditional distribution of a continuous random variable is not as intuitive as it might seem: Borel&#x27;s paradox shows that conditional probability density functions need not be invariant under coordinate transformations.

===Example===
The graph shows a bivariate normal joint density for random variables formula_1 and formula_2. To see the distribution of formula_2 conditional on formula_42, one can first visualize the line formula_42 in the formula_44 plane, and then visualize the plane containing that line and perpendicular to the formula_44 plane. The intersection of that plane with the joint normal density, once rescaled to give unit area under the intersection, is the relevant conditional density of formula_2.

formula_47

==Relation to independence==
Random variables formula_1, formula_2 are independent if and only if the conditional distribution of formula_2 given formula_1 is, for all possible realizations of formula_1, equal to the unconditional distribution of formula_2. For discrete random variables this means formula_54 for all possible formula_55 and formula_7 with formula_57. For continuous random variables formula_1 and formula_2, having a joint density function, it means formula_60 for all possible formula_55 and formula_7 with formula_35.

==Properties==
Seen as a function of formula_55 for given formula_7, formula_66 is a probability mass function and so the sum over all formula_55 (or integral if it is a conditional probability density) is 1. Seen as a function of formula_7 for given formula_55, it is a likelihood function, so that the sum (or integral) over all formula_7 need not be 1.

Additionally, a marginal of a joint distribution can be expressed as the expectation of the corresponding conditional distribution. For instance, formula_71.

==Measure-theoretic formulation==
Let formula_72 be a probability space, formula_73 a formula_74-field in formula_75. Given formula_76, the Radon-Nikodym theorem implies that there is a formula_77-measurable random variable formula_78, called the conditional probability, such thatformula_79for every formula_80, and such a random variable is uniquely defined up to sets of probability zero. A conditional probability is called regular if formula_81 is a probability measure on formula_82 for all formula_83 a.e.

Special cases:

* For the trivial sigma algebra formula_84, the conditional probability is the constant function formula_85
* If formula_86, then formula_87, the indicator function (defined below).
Let formula_88 be a formula_89-valued random variable. For each formula_90, define formula_91For any formula_83, the function formula_93 is called the conditional probability distribution of formula_1 given formula_77. If it is a probability measure on formula_89, then it is called regular.

For a real-valued random variable (with respect to the Borel formula_74-field formula_98 on formula_99), every conditional probability distribution is regular. In this case,formula_100 almost surely.

=== Relation to conditional expectation ===
For any event formula_101, define the indicator function:

:formula_102

which is a random variable. Note that the expectation of this random variable is equal to the probability of &quot;A&quot; itself:

:formula_103

Given a formula_74-field formula_73, the conditional probability formula_106 is a version of the conditional expectation of the indicator function for formula_107:

:formula_108

An expectation of a random variable with respect to a regular conditional probability is equal to its conditional expectation.

=== Interpretation of conditioning on a Sigma Field ===
Consider the probability space formula_109
and a sub-sigma field formula_110.
The sub-sigma field formula_111 can be loosely interpreted as containing a subset of the information in formula_75. For example, we might think of formula_113 as the probability of the event formula_114 given the information in formula_111.

Also recall that an event formula_114 is independent of a sub-sigma field formula_111 if formula_118 for all formula_119. It is incorrect to conclude in general that the information in formula_111 does not tell us anything about the probability of event formula_114 occurring. This can be shown with a counter-example:

Consider a probability space on the unit interval, formula_122. Let formula_77 be the sigma-field of all countable sets and sets whose complement is countable. So each set in formula_77 has measure formula_125 or formula_126 and so is independent of each event in formula_75. However, notice that formula_77 also contains all the singleton events in formula_75 (those sets which contain only a single formula_83). So knowing which of the events in formula_77 occurred is equivalent to knowing exactly which formula_83 occurred! So in one sense, formula_77 contains no information about formula_75 (it is independent of it), and in another sense it contains all the information in formula_75.

<doc id="504460" wikidata="Q1576648" url="?curid=504460" title="Tolbiac station">
<text>Tolbiac () is a station of the Paris Métro. It is at the crossroads of two main roads, the &quot;Avenue d&#x27;Italie&quot; and the &quot;Rue de Tolbiac&quot;. It is near the &quot;Asian Quarter&quot; and the &quot;Parc de Choisy&quot;.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue d&#x27;Italie, north of the intersection with Rue de Tolbiac. Oriented approximately along a north-south axis, it is located between the &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot; and &quot;Maison Blanche&quot; stations, the latter marking the end of the common line before it branches to &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Ivry&quot; and &quot;Villejuif-Louis Aragon&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Tolbiac&quot; opened as part of a planned section of Line 7, which was temporarily operated as part of Line 10 until the completion of the under-Seine crossing of line 7 from Pont de Sully to Place Monge. On 7 March 1930 the line was extended from Place d&#x27;Italie to Porte de Choisy, including &quot;Tolbiac&quot;. The station was integrated into line 7 on 26 April 1931. It is named after the &quot;Rue de Tolbiac&quot;. Tolbiac was the site of a battle near Cologne, where the Franks under Clovis I beat the Alamanni in 496.

As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro &quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated by 29 June 29, 2005. It saw 3,191,066 travellers enter in 2019, which places it at the 157th position of metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has four entries divided into seven metro entrances, each with a Dervaux-type balustrade and leading to Avenue d&#x27;Italie:
* Entrance 1: &quot;Rue de Tolbiac&quot;, made up of two fixed staircases established back-to-back, one of which is adorned with a Dervaux candelabra, located to the right of no. 76 Rue de Tolbiac;
* Entrance 2: &quot;Avenue d&#x27;Italie&quot;, an escalator going up allowing only the exit from the platform in the direction of Mairie d&#x27;Ivry and Villejuif-Louis Aragon, located opposite no. 72 Avenue d&#x27;Italie;
* Entrance 3: &quot;Rue Toussaint-Féron&quot;, comprising two fixed back-to-back staircases, one of which has a Dervaux mast, leading to the right of numbers 55 and 57 on the avenue;
* Entrance 4: &quot;Rue de la Maison-Blanche&quot;, also made up of two fixed back-to-back staircases, one of which has a Dervaux totem, located opposite numbers 61 and 63 on the avenue.
===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Tolbiac is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for the majority of metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot;, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the upright walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are in honey-coloured faience and the name of the station is also in faience in the style of the original CMP. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are red.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 47 and 62 and by the urban service &quot;La Traverse Bièvre Montsouris&quot; of the RATP Bus Network.

<doc id="504461" wikidata="Q234104" url="?curid=504461" title="Shirley Manson">
<text>Shirley Ann Manson (born 26 August 1966) is a Scottish singer, musician, and songwriter who is the lead singer of the Scottish-American rock band Garbage, who have toured worldwide and sold over 17 million records as of 2017. Known for her forthright style, rebellious attitude, and distinctive deep voice, her accolades include nominations for two Brit Awards and seven Grammy Awards.

Manson&#x27;s musical career began in her teens, when she was approached to perform backing vocals and keyboards for the band Goodbye Mr Mackenzie. She was later approached by the band&#x27;s record label with the idea of launching her as a solo artist, and recorded an album with her band Angelfish. She joined Garbage in 1994, and they achieved critical and commercial success with their self-titled debut album (1995) and &quot;Version 2.0&quot; (1998). They followed this by performing and co-producing the theme song to the 19th James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999) and releasing their acclaimed third album &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; (2001).

Following the troubled production of Garbage&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; (2005), the group went on hiatus; during this period, they released a greatest hits album (2007). Manson began to write and record solo material in 2006, but nothing came to fruition. She instead pursued acting, playing Catherine Weaver on the science fiction television series &quot;&quot; (2008). Garbage reunited in 2010, and have since released three more albums: &quot;Not Your Kind of People&quot; (2012), &quot;Strange Little Birds&quot; (2016), and &quot;No Gods No Masters&quot; (2021). Manson also hosted the music podcast &quot;The Jump with Shirley Manson&quot; (2019–2021).

==Early life==

Shirley Ann Manson was born in Edinburgh on 26 August 1966, the daughter of Muriel Flora (née MacKay) and John Mitchell Manson. Her father, a descendant from the fishing community of Northmavine, was a university lecturer, while her mother was a big band singer who had been adopted by a Lothian-based family at an early age and took on the family name MacDonald. Manson was named after an aunt, who was herself named after Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Shirley&quot;. She has two sisters: Lindy-Jayne who is two years older and Sarah who is two years younger. They were brought up in the Comely Bank and Stockbridge areas of Edinburgh in an old Victorian three-storey house. She attended Broughton High School and her childhood education was informed by the Church of Scotland (her father was her Sunday school teacher) until age 12.

Despite not having considered herself an artist until her forties and still not considering herself a musician, Manson&#x27;s first experiences with music are rooted in her childhood and she received education in playing many instruments. Her first public performance was in 1970, at age four, singing &quot;Never Smile at a Crocodile&quot; with her older sister in an amateur show held at the local Church Hill Theatre. Enrolled at Flora Stevenson Primary School, she received instruction in recorder, clarinet, and fiddle, and learned ballet and piano from extramural classes at age seven, when she also joined a choir. Manson was a member of Girlguiding UK throughout this period of her youth as a Brownie and a Girl Guide. She attended the City of Edinburgh Music School, the music department of Broughton High School. At about age nine, Manson joined the school orchestra. While at Broughton, she became an active member of its drama group, performing in amateur dramatic and musical performances such as &quot;The American Dream&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, while also singing with the Waverley Singers, a local girl choir. A 1981 Edinburgh Festival Fringe production of &quot;Maurice the Minotaur&quot;, in which Manson played a prophet, was awarded a Fringe First award by &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper.

While she enjoyed primary school, Manson was bullied while in her first year at secondary school, causing her to suffer from depression and body dysmorphic disorder and engage in self-injury: she carried sharp objects in the laces of her boots and would cut herself when she felt low self-esteem, stress, or anxiety. The bullying stopped when Manson associated herself with a rebel crowd, which resulted in her rebelling herself. She was absent for most of her final year at school and began smoking cannabis, sniffing glue, drinking alcohol, shoplifting, and on one occasion breaking into Edinburgh Zoo. Manson had teenage ambitions to become an actress, but was rejected by the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD). Her first job was volunteer work in a local hospital&#x27;s cafeteria, then as a breakfast waitress at a local hotel, before spending five years as a shop assistant for Miss Selfridge. She started on the shop&#x27;s makeup counters, but was eventually moved into stockrooms because of her attitude toward customers. She became well known throughout Edinburgh&#x27;s clubbing scene; making use of free samples from Miss Selfridge, she styled hair for a number of local bands. She also briefly modelled clothing for &quot;Jackie&quot; magazine.

==Career==
===Early work and bands (1987–1994)===
Manson&#x27;s first musical experiences came from briefly singing with local Edinburgh acts The Wild Indians and performed backing vocals with Autumn 1904. While she was performing with her group, Manson was approached by Goodbye Mr Mackenzie&#x27;s lead Martin Metcalfe to join his band. Manson was in a relationship with Metcalfe initially, but remained working with the band after splitting from him and became a prominent member, performing keyboards, backing vocals and becoming involved in the band&#x27;s business side. Manson&#x27;s first release with the Mackenzies was a YTS release of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; in 1984. The group signed a major-label record deal with Capitol Records in 1987, and they released their first album &quot;Good Deeds and Dirty Rags&quot;, and their only UK top 40 entry &quot;The Rattler&quot;. In 1990, the group&#x27;s contract was transferred to Parlophone, another EMI label, but after two singles failed to chart Parlophone declined to release the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Hammer and Tongs&quot;.

Gary Kurfirst, who managed Talking Heads and Debbie Harry, bought the Mackenzies contract and issued their second album through his own label Radioactive Records, a subsidiary of MCA Records. After another single failed to chart, the group were persuaded to leave Radioactive by their management. The Mackenzies continued to write material; Manson was also given the opportunity to record lead vocals on a number of tracks planned for the band&#x27;s third album. Although MCA had no desire to further their commitments to Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie, the label expressed interest in recording an album with Manson, and after hearing several demos, Kurfirst signed Manson to Radioactive as a solo artist, with the remaining Mackenzies performing as her backing band to circumvent the band&#x27;s existing deal with MCA. Manson&#x27;s contract obliged her to deliver at least one album and, at the sole option of Radioactive, up to six additional albums.

Recording under the name Angelfish, and using some of the newly written material and a previously released Mackenzie b-side, Manson and the group recorded the tracks that would make up the &quot;Angelfish&quot; album in Connecticut with Talking Heads&#x27; Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. A lead in track &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; was sent to college radio where it was well received. &quot;Angelfish&quot; and second single &quot;Heartbreak to Hate&quot; followed in 1994. Angelfish toured Belgium, Canada, France, and the U.S. The band co-supported Live on a tour of North America, along with Vic Chestnutt. The music video for &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; was aired once on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Producer and musician Steve Marker caught the broadcast and thought Manson would be a great singer for his band, Garbage, which also featured producers Duke Erikson and Butch Vig.

===Garbage (1995–2005; 2010–present)===
Vig invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing on a couple of tracks. After an unsuccessful audition, she returned to Angelfish. Manson admitted she felt intimidated showcasing herself to Vig, who produced bands she admired such as Nirvana, Sonic Youth, and The Smashing Pumpkins, and Vig added that the audition&#x27;s disorganized nature along with the Americans not understanding Manson&#x27;s Scottish accent caused communication problems. At the end of the Live tour, Angelfish imploded and Manson returned to Smart for a second try. She began to work on the then-skeletal origins of some songs and the band invited her to become a full-time member and finish the album; she co-wrote and co-produced the entire album with the rest of the band. In August 1994, Radioactive gave their permission for Manson to work with Garbage. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Garbage&quot; was released in August 1995, and went on to sell over 4 million copies, buoyed by a run of high charting singles including &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot; and &quot;Stupid Girl.&quot; Manson quickly became the public face of the band over the course of a tour that took the band through to the end of 1996. Echo &amp; the Bunnymen had asked Manson to sing on their 1997 comeback album.

Manson became the band&#x27;s chief songwriter for the follow-up record &quot;Version 2.0&quot; which equalled the success of the band&#x27;s debut record after its May 1998 release. During the two-year tour in support of the record, Manson modelled for Calvin Klein. Manson lived in hotels throughout the recording periods of the debut and Version 2.0. The group recorded the theme song to the James Bond movie &quot;The World Is Not Enough,&quot; and Manson became the third Scotswoman to sing a Bond theme after Lulu and Sheena Easton. In the accompanying video, she portrays an android assassin. For the recording of Garbage&#x27;s third record throughout 2000, Manson became one of the first high-profile artists to write a blog online, while she decided to improve her guitar playing for the band&#x27;s next tour. Their third album, &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot;, featured Manson&#x27;s most forward and personal lyrics to date. The album did not sell as well as its predecessors, but Garbage performed a successful world tour in support of it. During a concert at the Roskilde Festival, Manson&#x27;s voice gave out. She afterwards discovered a vocal fold cyst, and had to undergo corrective surgery.

Manson&#x27;s lyrics became more overtly political for Garbage&#x27;s fourth record, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Bleed Like Me,&quot; which after the surprise success of lead-in single &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot;, posted some of the band&#x27;s highest chart positions upon release. Garbage began an extended hiatus in October 2005. During this period, in 2007, Garbage reformed to perform a short set at a benefit show to raise cash to pay for Wally Ingram&#x27;s medical treatment, shared song ideas via the internet, recorded new material, and filmed a music video to promote the band&#x27;s &quot;Absolute Garbage&quot; greatest hits compilation. Garbage returned to the studio in 2010 to write and record material for a fifth album, entitled &quot;Not Your Kind of People&quot; and subsequently released in May 2012, thus ending the band&#x27;s seven-year hiatus from recording.

In 2021, Garbage supported Alanis Morissette&#x27;s 2020 World Tour: Celebrating 25 Years of Jagged Little Pill, which had been postponed due to COVID-19. At several performances, Manson wore a variation on &quot;Garden Witch Overalls&quot;, popularised by feminist poet Kate Baer through her interview on the podcast &quot;Gee Thanks, Just Bought It&quot;, hosted by Caroline Moss. Manson paired the overalls with knee-high boots and assorted t-shirts. On March 30, 2021, Garbage released the song &quot;The Men Who Rule the World&quot;, the lead single from their seventh studio album, &quot;No Gods No Masters&quot;, which was released on June 11, 2021. On April 28, the album&#x27;s title track &quot;No Gods No Masters&quot; was released as the second single, followed by &quot;Wolves&quot; on May 19. &quot;No Gods No Masters&quot; was supported in summer 2021 with an arena concert tour with Garbage as guests of Alanis Morissette. The tour went on to become the most successful female-fronted tour of the year, selling more than 500,000 tickets.

On September 7, 2022, Garbage announced their third greatest hits album &quot;Anthology&quot;, released on October 28. The compilation features 35 newly remastered tracks celebrating three decades of career, including &quot;Witness To Your Love&quot;, which was released as a single. Early in 2022, Garbage started writing for their upcoming eighth studio album. In October, after fulfilling their touring obligations, Garbage resumed writing for the album. In February 2023, Garbage announced their Summer 2023 co-headline North American tour with Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds featuring Metric as special guests. On 4 March 2024, Garbage announced a UK and European tour, marking their first UK tour in five years. The headlining tour includes dates in Germany, Italy, France, Denmark, and a date at the Wembley Arena in England. Two dates were confirmed in Manson&#x27;s native Scotland – a main stage slot at the TRNSMT festival in Glasgow, and a date at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh.

===Solo work and unreleased album (2006–2012)===

Manson confirmed in March 2006 that she had begun work on a solo album, working with musician Paul Buchanan, producer Greg Kurstin, and film composer David Arnold, stating that she had &quot;no timetable&quot; for completing the project. In 2007, Manson collaborated with Rivers Cuomo of Weezer. Manson presented some of her work to Geffen Records in 2008, who found it &quot;too noir&quot;, prompting Manson and Geffen to terminate her contract by mutual agreement. Manson later elaborated, &quot;[Geffen] wanted me to have international radio hits and &#x27;be the Annie Lennox of my generation&#x27;. I kid you not; I am quoting directly.&quot; &quot;I made a quiet, very dark, non-radio-friendly record,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in writing nursery rhymes for the masses.&quot;

Manson continued to write material while without a record deal and had been in talks with David Byrne and Ray Davies about a potential collaboration. In 2009, Manson posted three demos on her Facebook profile, written with Kurstin, titled &quot;In the Snow&quot;, &quot;Pretty Horses&quot; and &quot;Lighten Up&quot;. &quot;Pretty Horses&quot; was later featured in the pilot episode of the show &quot;Conviction&quot;. 14 additional songs co-written with Kurstin and registered on copyright and performance rights societies included Don&#x27;t Want To Pretend, Don&#x27;t Want Anyone Hurt, Gone Upside, Hot Shit, Kid Ourselves, Little Dough, Pure Genius, Sweet Old World, Spooky, So Shines A Good Deed, The Desert, No Regrets, Stop, To Be King.

In 2009, Manson announced she was stepping away from music, saying she got sick of the music industry&#x27;s new practices and had found more excitement in acting. Manson said she thought about abandoning the music business in 2008, when her mother developed dementia, and later died, saying that &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to make music, didn&#x27;t feel creative. I could barely function.&quot; Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; at their son&#x27;s memorial. According to Manson, &quot;we were all in so much pain, but it meant so much to them that I could sing that song and so much to me that I was able to do something. It made me realise how much music sustains people. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;d turned my back on it.&quot;

Manson also worked with a number of artists outside of her solo project, reciting a verse of a long poem for a Chris Connelly album, co-writing and recording a duet with Eric Avery for his solo debut recording with Debbie Harry. Although not recording material with them, Manson also performed on-stage with The Pretenders, Iggy Pop, Incubus and Kings of Leon in Atlantic City, with Gwen Stefani and twice with No Doubt in Universal City. Manson also performed in an uncredited role as a dominatrix in the music video for She Wants Revenge&#x27;s single &quot;These Things&quot;. Most recently Manson performed vocals on a track written by Serj Tankian entitled &quot;The Hunger&quot;, a single from the rock musical &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;.

In January 2012, Manson confirmed that work on her solo album had been cancelled, stating the album &quot;[is] dead and buried. We had the funeral. It was sad and I cried a lot but it made such a beautiful corpse that we had an open casket.&quot;

==Other ventures==
===Acting===
Manson was cast in &quot;&quot; in May 2008, after being asked to appear by series creator Josh Friedman and enduring a multiple audition process, beating out other actresses including Julie Ann Emery. She debuted in the season two premiere episode &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; as Catherine Weaver, CEO of a technology company, ZeiraCorp. At the conclusion of the episode, Weaver is revealed to be a liquid-metal T-1001 Terminator. Manson also performed and co-arranged a rock and blues version of the gospel song &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; for the episode&#x27;s score. She also played the human Weaver in archive footage viewed by the T-1001 in the episode &quot;The Tower Is Tall, But the Fall Is Short&quot;.

In 2009, Manson made her first venture into the video game industry as an avatar of herself for the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; franchise. In the fifth game in the series, Manson is an unlockable character, while the game also features a licensed Garbage track.

The next year, Manson was one of the final guests to appear on the cult US children&#x27;s show &quot;Pancake Mountain&quot;. Featured in a segment titled &quot;Around the World with Shirley Manson&quot;, she talked about music from other countries. She filmed five such segments but none aired before creator Scott Stuckey and producer J. J. Abrams canceled the show. One segment, featuring Germany, was eventually released and featured an original theme song sung by Manson and written by Stuckey.

In 2019, Manson travelled to Santiago, Chile, to participate in the making of &quot;Peace Peace Now Now&quot;, a documentary telling &quot;stories of women who challenged armed conflicts around the world.&quot; The first season of the documentary came out on 23 November 2022 on &quot;Star+&quot;.

=== Podcast ===
From 2019 to 2021, Manson hosted the music podcast &quot;The Jump with Shirley Manson&quot;, co-produced by Mailchimp Presents and Little Everywhere, with executive producers Dann Gallucci, Jane Marie and Hrishikesh Hirway. In each episode, Manson interviewed a guest musician about a defining song that represented a breakthrough in the artist&#x27;s own career and “the moments in an artist’s career where they decide to take a leap into something new.”

Three seasons of the podcast were produced, for a total of 28 episodes. Discussing the future of the podcast, Manson is unsure whether the show will be renewed for a fourth season. Manson credits the show for the personal growth of her as an artist and an interviewer. Some episodes of the show also directly inspired the writing and production of songs of Garbage&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;No Gods No Masters&quot;.

===Charity work===
Manson has used Garbage&#x27;s profile and her own to raise awareness and secure funds for a number of causes. She commissioned a Garbage branded lipgloss online, with all proceeds from the sales split between Grampian Children&#x27;s Cancer Research and cancer treatment institutions at Royal Aberdeen Children&#x27;s Hospital in Scotland and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York.

In 2001, Manson became an ambassador for the M•A•C AIDS Fund, fronting their fourth two-year charity lipstick marketing campaign alongside Elton John and Mary J. Blige, beginning with the launch of the VIVAMAC IV lipstick in March 2002, in which all proceeds of the sale of the lipstick goes to help fund AIDS charities and initiatives. While touring, Manson visited several AIDS charities in Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Toronto, New York, San Francisco and Madison to make several donations totalling over $300,000 on behalf of the M•A•C AIDS Fund.

In 2003, the M•A•C AIDS Fund linked with the Elton John AIDS Foundation to produce the White Bedroom campaign, where both Elton John and Manson recorded PSAs promoting condom use and stating facts on AIDS. By 2007, the combined six VIVAMAC campaigns had raised over $100 million U.S. dollars, and as a former ambassador Manson accepted a cheque for £51,000 on behalf of HIV charity Waverley Care from the M•A•C AIDS Fund on 10 April 2008 at Harvey Nichols Edinburgh store. Manson had become a patron of Waverley Care in October 2002 and previously hosted a fund raiser auction to raise funds for the charity in January 2004 which raised £45,000. A Fender guitar owned by Manson raised £1,050, while other items auctioned included contributions sourced by Manson herself, from Elton John and Kylie Minogue.

Manson has also adopted a rescue dog, a terrier-mix named Veela, named after the veelas from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books.

In 2008, Manson became involved with The Pablove Foundation, a charity founded by Dangerbird Records head Jeff Castelaz, whose son Pablo succumbed to cancer the following year. Castelaz, whose family Manson had befriended in the 90s, had asked Manson to sing &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; at their sons&#x27; memorial. Funds raised for The Pablove Foundation fund pediatric cancer research and educational and quality of life programming for families dealing with childhood cancer. Manson reformed Garbage to contribute an exclusive track, &quot;Witness to Your Love&quot;, to a charity album for the Foundation; signed off a Pablove poster for auction on eBay; Manson also hosted a fundraiser headlined by the Silversun Pickups, and performed acoustically on-stage at a second fundraiser with Butch Vig and Laura Jane Grace (for a rendition of &quot;Witness...&quot;) and with Greg Kurstin (for a cover of Pablo&#x27;s favourite song, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;).

In 2010, Shirley Manson donated two hand-decorated T-shirts to Binki Shapiro&#x27;s (of the band Little Joy) online charity auction &quot;Crafts for a Cause&quot; to raise money for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The two T-shirts raised a total of $1522.00, which was donated to the Artists for Peace and Justice organisation.

In January 2015, Manson headlined Pablove 6, the sixth-annual fundraiser for the Pablove Foundation. She made a special appearance with Chicago-based David Bowie tribute band Sons of the Silent Age, featuring Matt Walker and Chris Connelly.

==Artistry==
===Voice and style===

Manson, with Garbage, has an alternative musical style fusing various genres including electronic rock, industrial rock, punk, grunge, trip hop and shoegaze. Although trained as a soprano when singing in the choir as a child, Manson never identified as one, saying &quot;I don’t think I’m a soprano. I don’t know what the hell I am&quot;. Critics agree she possesses a contralto vocal range, which has been noted for its distinctive qualities as well as her emotive delivery. Elysa Gardner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated &quot;one of Garbage&#x27;s most compelling features is a force of nature: Manson&#x27;s vocals, which can convey a multitude of emotions without ever coming across as melodramatic&quot;. 

Reviewing a live Garbage performance, Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;Temptress, lover, sufferer, scrapper – those have been Ms. Manson&#x27;s personae since Garbage started in 1995. In other eras she might have been a pop torch singer, a soul belter or a new-wave frontwoman: a Shirley Bassey, a Dusty Springfield, or a Chrissie Hynde. There&#x27;s a little of each of them in her voice&quot; also stating &quot;In the course of each song she let her voice rise in anger, contempt or passion&quot;. &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;, in a review of &quot;Garbage&quot;, remarked that Manson &quot;vocalist and guitarist, has a powerful voice, which soars and dips like a bird. It can plead or demand. It can sound dreamy or psychotic.&quot; Reviewing a 2012 live Garbage performance, Catherine Gee of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noted that Manson &quot;remains a striking performer whose distinctive contralto snarl can still raise the hairs on the back of your neck.&quot; In a review of &quot;Garbage&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Manson&#x27;s voice as &quot;thin and airy&quot;, whilst Mike Diver of the BBC stated Manson owned &quot;a snarl in her voice but [was] equally capable of a purr to melt away any resistance.&quot; also adding &quot;even at her most vulnerable, Manson maintains her controlling condition&quot;.

===Influences and impact===
Manson&#x27;s earliest musical memories were of her mother, who sang with a big band when Manson was a child. Manson was exposed to classic jazz records as she grew up and work by Nina Simone, Cher, Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald. One of Manson&#x27;s earliest musical memories is of ABBA winning the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest and becoming a fan of the group. She was particularly drawn to Anni-Frid Lyngstad as she felt she embodied &#x27;the outsider&#x27; and her stage presence made an impression. At 14, she became a fan of Siouxsie and the Banshees albums &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, and taught herself how to sing listening to those albums, later stating &quot;many of the songs of those two albums were massive loves of my life&quot;. Vocalist Siouxsie Sioux embodied how Manson aspired to be as a teen, and &quot;has remained a touchstone for me throughout my career and is still inspiring to me.&quot;

At nineteen, Manson discovered Patti Smith, specifically her &quot;Horses&quot; album, which made a &quot;strong impact&quot; on her. Manson was inspired to learn guitar by Chrissie Hynde, who is an admirer of Manson, while also appreciating the style of Toyah Willcox and Debbie Harry, whose 2006 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech was delivered by Manson. The majority of Manson&#x27;s influences were female musicians; however she also notes David Bowie as an inspiring male musician. Manson also grew up listening to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Frank Sinatra, The Clash, The Sugarcubes, Cocteau Twins, Iggy and the Stooges, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and The Velvet Underground. For acting, she cites actress Glenn Close and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as influences for her &quot;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles&quot; performance. 

Manson&#x27;s lyrics deal with darker themes, often in a mocking manner. She credits that to her Scottish psyche that leads to a preference for depressing themes, and the fact she always felt like an outsider, even within Garbage – &quot;I&#x27;m the odd one out by default. I&#x27;m the only girl, I&#x27;m younger than they are, they&#x27;ve all known each other for 40 years, or something crazy like that. So I always felt, like, off the centre of things.&quot;

Manson has been credited with inspiring later female artists; including Amy Lee, Florence Welch, Taylor Momsen, Liz Anjos of RAC and &quot;The Pragmatic&quot;, Screaming Females&#x27; Marissa Paternoster, Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls, Skylar Grey, Paramore&#x27;s Hayley Williams, Ritzy Bryan (lead singer and guitarist of The Joy Formidable), Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Potty Mouth&#x27;s Ally Einbinder, Billie Eilish, Peaches, Radiator Hospital&#x27;s Cynthia Schemmer, The Great Wilderness&#x27; Paola Rogue, Marina and the Diamonds, and Lana Del Rey. Manson is also considered a style icon, influencing various other female artists, and inspiring fashion designers and stylists.

==Personal life==
===Family and marriage===

Manson was married to Scottish artist Eddie Farrell from 1996 to 2003. In 2008, Manson became engaged to record producer and Garbage sound engineer Billy Bush. They were married at a Los Angeles courthouse in May 2010. They continue to reside in Los Angeles, while Manson maintains a second home in the Edinburgh suburb of Joppa.

===Religion and beliefs===

Manson has distanced herself from organized religion but has long been interested in spirituality. She recalled, &quot;When I was very small, I was very besotted with the church, absolutely. I loved the theatre of it and I got very involved in all the stories we were taught.&quot; When she was about 12, she had an argument with her father at the dinner table, screaming at him, &quot;Religion&#x27;s a sham and I&#x27;m not going to church anymore, it&#x27;s just bullshit.&quot; She stopped going to church but continued to have theological debates with him every Sunday. She became disenchanted with organised religion and although she maintained an interest in spirituality, she complained that she has &quot;brushed up against too many examples of hypocritical spiritualists&quot;.

Manson identifies as a feminist and has been hailed as a feminist icon.

=== Health ===
Manson is asthmatic. She quit smoking in the early &#x27;90s, when she was around the age of 25. In 1998, Manson had a benign tumor removed from her breast. After the surgery, which she said was &quot;really botched&quot; and left her &quot;in a lot of pain&quot;, she kept on touring wearing a sling.

====Voice issues====

During the Beautiful Garbage tour, Manson started having trouble with her voice, losing her voice completely at the Roskilde Festival, in Denmark, on 30 June 2002: &quot;I got on stage and opened my mouth to sing, and about 30 seconds in, there was no voice at all. It was a fucking nightmare,&quot; she recounted &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 2005. Believing it was due to fatigue or stress, she kept on touring until Gwen Stefani pointed her towards a vocal specialist, who diagnosed her with &quot;a large-sized cyst on one of my vocal cords, which was also causing considerable damage to the vocal cord opposite.&quot; A specialist informed Manson the operation could damage her singing ability permanently, so initially she desisted. She underwent surgery in 2003 after seeing another doctor in New York and recuperated her voice after three weeks of rehabilitation, including a week of total silence. Manson described the experience as &quot;torture&quot;: &quot;speech is my absolute lifeline and I felt like I’d lost my personality, been stripped completely of me… I felt invisible,&quot; she explained.

====Disorders====

Manson has declared of suffering of various mental disorders on multiple occasions, including body dysmorphic disorder and depression, exacerbated by the media scrutiny and misogyny she encountered during Garbage&#x27;s breakthrough years. She received psychiatric help on the advice of her trainer during the making of Garbage&#x27;s third album &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; whilst also going through a divorce, a time when she was admittedly &quot;crying literally for like four hours in the bathtub every night.&quot; She said the psychiatrist she went to &quot;saved [her] life&quot; and taught her &quot;how to turn all the noise down and allow a healthier voice to emerge. Start to make sense of the world and start to control how you respond to it.&quot;

Manson has admitted she has learnt to manage her condition with time, saying &quot;It’s a constant dialogue, and you just learn to be more powerful than that other voice.&quot; She also credited her photo shoot with no make up on for Calvin Klein, in 1999, to have helped considerably in facing her own perception of herself. &quot;If everyone had seen me with no make-up on, there was nothing to hide. And, I like the photograph. I looked… sweet. I actually wrote to Calvin Klein telling him that he&#x27;d done something incredible for me&quot; she told &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine in 2001.

====Appearance====

Manson has spoken of her aversion to resorting to cosmetic surgery, stating that it wouldn&#x27;t solve her body dysmorphia: &quot;I know that even if I did get something fixed it is not going to last very long and I am still going to be back to square one, and I&#x27;m going to have to face myself in the morning&quot;, she told &quot;The Herald&quot; in 2008. She also added &quot;I don&#x27;t want to set an example for the younger generation of women who come up and think they have to fix their faces. I don&#x27;t want to pass that on to other girls. I don&#x27;t want to be responsible for that.&quot;

Manson has also spoken openly about struggling with self-harm. In 2018, she wrote an article on self-harm for &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;The First Time I Cut Myself&quot;, in which she detailed the experience of cutting for the first time when she was thirteen years old whilst in an unhealthy relationship. She said the self-harming lasted up until she was fifteen, although she has felt the impulse to cut again during the Version 2.0 tour due to the media pressure, an urge she resisted. Manson admitted not knowing to this day the reason behind her self-harming, &quot;but I&#x27;m sure there was a lot of unexpressed anger, a lot of hormones, and a lot of emotions that I was unable to process as a young person&quot;, she explained.

====Injuries====

At the first date of the Garbage tour promoting &quot;Strange Little Birds&quot;, whilst singing &quot;Special&quot;, Manson fell off the stage into the pit at KROQ Weenie Roast on 14 May 2016. She immediately stood back up, apparently unhurt, and continued performing for the rest of the set. In November 2022, she said she injured her right hip in the incident, causing her &quot;so much pain&quot; and requiring hip replacement surgery, which took place on 16 January 2023 at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

=== Residency ===
For the majority of her career, Manson commuted between her home city of Edinburgh and the United States to record with Garbage, which was originally formed in Madison, Wisconsin; she lives and works primarily in Los Angeles, and maintains a second home in Edinburgh.

<doc id="504462" wikidata="Q1576642" url="?curid=504462" title="Maison Blanche station">
<text>Maison Blanche station () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving lines 7 and 14. South of this station, Line 7 forks into two branches, one leading to and the other to . Since June 2024, it is an interchange with Line 14 running southwards to Aéroport d&#x27;Orly.

==Location==
The line 7 station is located under Avenue d&#x27;Italie, between Rue Caillaux and Rue Bourgon, near Porte d&#x27;Italie, a gate in the former Thiers Wall. Towards the south, this is the last station on the common trunk of line 7 before the branches separate, thanks to an underground grade-separated junction located after the station, one towards &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Ivry&quot; and the other towards &quot;Villejuif-Louis Aragon&quot;. Oriented approximately along a north-south axis, it is positioned between &quot;Tolbiac&quot; on the one hand and &quot;Porte d&#x27;Italie&quot; (towards Ivry) or &quot;Le Kremlin-Bicêtre&quot; (towards Villejuif) on the other. On line 14, the station is between &quot;Olympiades&quot; and &quot;Hôpital Bicêtre&quot;.

The line 14 station is located about deep between Rue Caillaux and Rue Tagore, along Avenue d&#x27;Italie, east of the current metro station of Line 7.

Access to the Line 14 and Line 7 platforms is from the centre of a large forecourt where the entrance to the metro is located. Travelers can use escalators or elevators to access the platforms. From the platforms, the connections are via the mezzanine.

The surface forecourt provides access to the T3a tram line or the Porte d&#x27;Italie bus hub. It also hosts a Véligo station.

==History==
=== Original station ===
It opened as part of a planned section of Line 7, which was temporarily operated as part of Line 10 until the completion of the under-Seine crossing of Line 7 from Pont de Sully to Place Monge. On 7 March 1930, the line was extended from Place d&#x27;Italie to Porte de Choisy, including &quot;Maison Blanche&quot;. The station was integrated into line 7 on 26 April 1931. The station is named after the district, which got its name from a hotel of the same name, which is French for &quot;White House&quot;.

Along with Place des Fêtes, a prototype air raid shelter was added to the station in 1935 to protect it from chemical attacks and was fitted with airtight doors to allow the people to take refuge inside in the event of an attack. They were chosen because of their proximity to the heavily-populated working-class districts.

An attack was perpetrated by a terrorist group (GIA) near the station on 6 October 1995. A gas cylinder placed in a trash can was discovered by a postman, but it exploded while the police set up a security perimeter; the toll was 18 injured. The place was chosen to reference the circumstances of the arrest of Khaled Kelkal, one of the main instigators of the RER B attack in Saint-Michel. A few days earlier, on 29 September 1995, the police had shot Kelkal during his arrest at a place called Maison Blanche, near Vaugneray (Rhône).

As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; renewal program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 4 October 2006.

In 2019, 1,803,381 travellers entered this station, which placed it at the 259th position of 302 among the metro stations for its number of visitors.

=== Extension of line 14 ===
Early plans to extend Line 14 south from Paris included the possibility of taking over the existing Line 7 branch from the station to Villejuif – Louis Aragon, which opened in the early 1980s.

In the 2010s, discussions took place regarding whether to extend Line 14 further south to Orly Airport. The declaration of public utility was in 2016, allowing construction on the extension to begin. The extension was originally planned to be completed in 2027, however delivery was accelerated to 2024 following the awarding of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The preparatory work at Maison Blanche took place from November 2016 until the end of 2017. The construction of the station began in 2018 for commissioning in 2024. It was awarded in March 2018 to Léon Grosse in a consortium with Soletanche Bachy France. Tunnelling work was completed in March 2021, with the arrival of a tunnel boring machine at Maison Blanche. In April 2023, testing of trains on the Line 14 extension began, with an opening date of 24 June 2024 set.

Maison Blanche is the only station built in Paris as part of the Grand Paris Express, under the contracting authority of RATP.

The design of the station is entrusted to the consortium led by the engineers SETEC TPI and SYSTRA as well as to Mark Wilson of the Groupe-6 architecture firm.

==== Architecture and art ====

Californian artist and environmentalist sculptor Ned Kahn created an art installation overlooking the station in coordination with Mark Wilson. The work called &quot;River of Air&quot; is made of stainless steel and flexible sheets of ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) which will wave and reflect the sunlight above the two of the station entrances. The height of the masts supporting the structure will be and the sail will be long and wide.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances in front of no&#x27;s 103, 144 and 162 in the Avenue d&#x27;Italie.

A fourth entrance, located at no. 119, was closed in November 2019 to allow the construction of the line 14 station. In return, the entrance located at no. 162 was rebuilt from 2016 to 2019 and provided with an escalator to exit the station.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Maison Blanche is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for the majority of metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot; renewal, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the upright wall, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are in honey-coloured faience and the name of the station is also in earthenware. The seats are &quot;Motte&quot; style in a blue colour.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 47 and by the urban service &quot;La Traverse Bièvre Montsouris&quot; of the RATP Bus Network.

==Culture==
The station serves as the backdrop for an important scene from Günter Grass&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1960), in which the hero, Oscar Matzerath, sees the inspectors coming to arrest him as he walks towards the exit using the escalator.

<text>Porte d&#x27;Italie () is a station on Line 7 of the Paris Métro, and a stop on tramway T3a in the 13th arrondissement. It is named after the &quot;Porte d&#x27;Italie&quot;, a gate in the 19th century Thiers wall of Paris, which led to the south and Italy.

== History ==

The station opened on 7 March 1930 as part of line 10&#x27;s extension from Place d&#x27;Italie to Porte de Choisy. On 26 April 1931, it was transferred to line 7. Along with Porte de Bagnolet (line 3), Porte Dorée (line 8), and Porte de Pantin (line 5), it is one of four stations built at the former gates of Paris without having been a terminus.

On 23 March 1973, a carriage of an MF 67 train caught fire, causing it to be completely destroyed and damaging part of the station. The release of toxic fumes intoxicated two passengers.

The service, then provided by all trains on the line, is now only provided by one out of every two trains when a second branch to Le Kremlin–Bicêtre (now further extended to Villejuif–Louis Aragon) opened on 10 December 1982.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 12 January 2005.

On 6 September 2014, a knife fight between two passengers on a train continued after alighting at the station at around 6 am, with one of them stabbed at the side. A cleaner at the station was also injured.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,363,639 passengers, making it the 218th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,458,709 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 180th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,507,152 passengers, making it the 235th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has four accesses:

* Access 1: Square Hélène-Boucher (two staircases)
* Access 2: Boulevard Masséna
* Access 3: avenue d&#x27;Italie
* Access 4: rue Fernand Widal (with an ascending escalator) (exit only)

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The slightly curved station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms.

=== Other connections ===

==== Tramway ====
The station has been served by tramway T3a since 16 December 2006 as part of its initial section between Pont du Garigliano and Porte d&#x27;Ivry.

==== Bus ====
The station is also served by lines 47, 131, 184, 185, and 186 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N15, N22, and N144 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Porte de Choisy () is a station on line 7 of the Paris Métro, a stop on tramway T3a as well as the northern terminus of tramway T9 in the 13th arrondissement. It is named after the &quot;Porte de Choisy&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers wall of Paris, which led to Choisy-le-Roi.

== History ==
The station opened on 7 March 1930 as part of line 10&#x27;s extension from Place d&#x27;Italie, then serving as its eastern terminus (from Invalides). On 26 April 1931, it was transferred to line 7 and ceased to be a terminus when it was extended to Porte d&#x27; Ivry to the south.

The service, then provided by all trains on the line, is now only provided by one out of every two trains when a second branch to Le Kremlin–Bicêtre (now further extended to Villejuif–Louis Aragon) opened on 10 December 1982.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 22 September 2005.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,598,026 passengers, making it the 200th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In anticipation of the increased traffic expected at the station after tramway T9 opens, a new access towards it was constructed in two phases, with it consisting of two new staircases, including an escalator. In the first phase, tramway T3a was temporarily closed between Porte d&#x27;Ivry and Porte d&#x27;Italie from 22 July to 23 August 2019 to facilitate the construction under its tracks, with RATP bus line 27 extended to service the closed stops. In the second phase, the line 7 station was closed from 6 January to 29 June 2020 (with trains passing without stopping) to enable a new corridor towards the new access to be built. Station equipment was also modernised.

In 2020, the station was used by 647,656 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 282nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,592,144 passengers, making it the 221st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has four accesses:

* Access 1: avenue de Choisy
* Access 2: Boulevard Masséna
* Access 3: avenue de la Porte-de-Choisy
* Access 4: rue Alfred Fouillée

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms.

=== Other connections ===

==== Tramway ====
The station has been served by tramway T3a since 16 December 2006 and by tramway T9 since 10 April 2021, serving as its northern terminus.

It is one of four métro stations on the network that are located at one of the former gates of Paris and are served by two tram lines; the other three are Balard (line 8), Porte de Versailles (line 12), and Porte de Vincennes (line 1). Basilique de Saint-Denis (line 13) is the only station served by two tram lines not located at one of the gates of Paris.

<text>Bolivar () is a station on 7bis of the Paris Métro in the 19th arrondissement. It is named after the nearby &quot;avenue Simon Bolivar&quot;, which in turn was named after Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), liberator of several South American countries.

==History==
The station opened on 18 July 1911, 6 months the opening of a branch of line 7 from Louis Blanc to Pré Saint-Gervais on 18 January 1911. On 3 December 1967 this branch was separated from line 7, becoming &quot;line 7bis&quot;.

During the World War I, the station, like other deep metro stations was converted into an air raid shelter. During a violent bomb attack on 11 March 1918, the local population rushed to the shelter in panic and tried to enter it down the stairs of an exit that led to gates that only opened to the outside. The first rows of the crowd were crushed or suffocated by those behind them, and were eventually trampled when the doors finally broke under pressure. 76 people died in this incident. As a result, all gates on the métro are now designed to open inwards as well as outwards.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised with the corridors being completed on 16 December 2008 and its platforms in 2009.

In 2019, the station was used by 546,780 passengers, making it the 298th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 278,933 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 296th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has a single entrance at the corner of avenue Secrétan and avenue Simon-Bolivar. Since 1987, it was adorned with a Guimard entrance previously at Barbès–Rochechouart and was listed as a historical monument on 2 December 2016.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Bolivar has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The platform in the direction of Louis Blanc had a small exhibit that paid homage to the life of Simón Bolívar through an illustrated biography on the walls but was removed during the renovation of the station.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by line 26 of the RATP bus network.

<doc id="504484" wikidata="Q1575331" url="?curid=504484" title="Point in polygon">
<text>In computational geometry, the point-in-polygon (PIP) problem asks whether a given point in the plane lies inside, outside, or on the boundary of a polygon. It is a special case of point location problems and finds applications in areas that deal with processing geometrical data, such as computer graphics, computer vision, geographic information systems (GIS), motion planning, and computer-aided design (CAD).

An early description of the problem in computer graphics shows two common approaches (ray casting and angle summation) in use as early as 1974.

An attempt of computer graphics veterans to trace the history of the problem and some tricks for its solution can be found in an issue of the &quot;Ray Tracing News&quot;.

==Ray casting algorithm==

One simple way of finding whether the point is inside or outside a simple polygon is to test how many times a ray, starting from the point and going in any fixed direction, intersects the edges of the polygon. 
If the point is on the outside of the polygon the ray will intersect its edge an even number of times. If the point is on the inside of the polygon then it will intersect the edge an odd number of times. The status of a point on the edge of the polygon depends on the details of the ray intersection algorithm.

This algorithm is sometimes also known as the crossing number algorithm or the even–odd rule algorithm, and was known as early as 1962. The algorithm is based on a simple observation that if a point moves along a ray from infinity to the probe point and if it crosses the boundary of a polygon, possibly several times, then it alternately goes from the outside to inside, then from the inside to the outside, etc. As a result, after every two &quot;border crossings&quot; the moving point goes outside. This observation may be mathematically proved using the Jordan curve theorem.

=== Limited precision ===
If implemented on a computer with finite precision arithmetics, the results may be incorrect if the point lies very close to that boundary, because of rounding errors. For some applications, like video games or other entertainment products, this is not a large concern since they often favor speed over precision. However, for a formally correct computer program, one would have to introduce a numerical tolerance ε and test in line whether &quot;P&quot; (the point) lies within ε of &quot;L&quot; (the Line), in which case the algorithm should stop and report &quot;&quot;P&quot; lies very close to the boundary.&quot;

Most implementations of the ray casting algorithm consecutively check intersections of a ray with all sides of the polygon in turn. In this case the following problem must be addressed. If the ray passes exactly through a vertex of a polygon, then it will intersect 2 segments at their endpoints. While it is OK for the case of the topmost vertex in the example or the vertex between crossing 4 and 5, the case of the rightmost vertex (in the example) requires that we count one intersection for the algorithm to work correctly. A similar problem arises with horizontal segments that happen to fall on the ray. The issue is solved as follows: If the intersection point is a vertex of a tested polygon side, then the intersection counts only if the other vertex of the side lies below the ray. This is effectively equivalent to considering vertices &quot;on&quot; the ray as lying slightly &quot;above&quot; the ray.

Once again, the case of the ray passing through a vertex may pose numerical problems in finite precision arithmetics: for two sides adjacent to the same vertex the straightforward computation of the intersection with a ray may not give the vertex in both cases. If the polygon is specified by its vertices, then this problem is eliminated by checking the y-coordinates of the ray and the ends of the tested polygon side before actual computation of the intersection. In other cases, when polygon sides are computed from other types of data, other tricks must be applied for the numerical robustness of the algorithm.

==Winding number algorithm==
Another technique used to check if a point is inside a polygon is to compute the given point&#x27;s winding number with respect to the polygon. If the winding number is non-zero, the point lies inside the polygon. This algorithm is sometimes also known as the &quot;nonzero-rule algorithm&quot;.

One way to compute the winding number is to sum up the angles subtended by each side of the polygon. However, this involves costly inverse trigonometric functions, which generally makes this algorithm performance-inefficient (slower) compared to the ray casting algorithm. Luckily, these inverse trigonometric functions do not need to be computed. Since the result, the sum of all angles, can add up to 0 or formula_1 (or multiples of formula_1) only, it is sufficient to track through which quadrants the polygon winds, as it turns around the test point, which makes the winding number algorithm comparable in speed to counting the boundary crossings.
An improved algorithm to calculate the winding number was developed by Dan Sunday in 2001. It does not use angles in calculations, nor any trigonometry, and functions exactly the same as the ray casting algorithms described above. Sunday&#x27;s algorithm works by considering an infinite horizontal ray cast from the point being checked. Whenever that ray crosses an edge of the polygon, Juan Pineda&#x27;s edge crossing algorithm (1988) is used to determine how the crossing will affect the winding number. As Sunday describes it, if the edge crosses the ray going &quot;upwards&quot;, the winding number is incremented; if it crosses the ray &quot;downwards&quot;, the number is decremented. Sunday&#x27;s algorithm gives the correct answer for nonsimple polygons, whereas the boundary crossing algorithm fails in this case.

==Implementations==

=== SVG ===
Similar methods are used in SVG for defining a way of filling with color various shapes (such as path, polyline, polygon, text etc.). The algorithm of filling is influenced by &#x27;fill-rule&#x27; attribute. The value may be either or . For example, in a pentagram, there is a central &quot;hole&quot; (visible background) with , and none with attribute.

For simple polygons, the algorithms will give the same result. However, for complex polygons, the algorithms may give different results for points in the regions where the polygon intersects itself, where the polygon does not have a clearly defined inside and outside. One solution using the even-odd rule is to transform (complex) polygons into simpler ones that are even-odd-equivalent before the intersection check. This, however, is computationally expensive. It is less expensive to use the fast non-zero winding number algorithm, which gives the correct result even when the polygon overlaps itself.

==Point in polygon queries==
The point in polygon problem may be considered in the general repeated geometric query setting: given a single polygon and a sequence of query points, quickly find the answers for each query point. Clearly, any of the general approaches for planar point location may be used. Simpler solutions are available for some special polygons.

===Special cases===

Simpler algorithms are possible for monotone polygons, star-shaped polygons, convex polygons and triangles.

The triangle case can be solved easily by use of a barycentric coordinate system, parametric equation or dot product. The dot product method extends naturally to any convex polygon.

==History==

The station opened on 13 February 1912, 13 months after the commissioning of the branch of line 7 from Louis Blanc to Pré Saint-Gervais on 18 January 1911 due to the difficulty of its construction in a backfilled quarry. As a result, the station is built with arches over each of the tracks to strengthen the station box. On 3 December 1967 this branch was separated from line 7, becoming &quot;line 7bis&quot;.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 6 May 2009.

In 2019, the station was used by 545,750 passengers, making it the 299th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 242,027 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 299th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has a single at rue Botzaris next to Parc des Buttes Chaumont.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Buttes Chaumont has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. A central wall exists between the tracks due to the unstable terrain and its significant depth–its platforms are one of the deepest in the network with landings between flights of stairs leading to the platforms equipped with seats for travellers to rest. It is also equipped with elevators.

<text>Danube () is a station of the Paris Métro serving Line 7bis (westbound only). It is named after Place de Danube, which was renamed &quot;Place Rhin-et-Danube&quot; in 1951 to commemorate the 1st French Army which had during the Italian campaign between 1943 and 1945 distinguished itself during the landing of Provence, then fought on the Rhine and Danube rivers in World War II.

== History ==

The station opened on 18 January 1911 as part of a branch of line 7 from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais, 18 days after the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette due to difficulties during its construction.

As the station is constructed in unstable terrain, located in a former mine where gypsum was extracted for export to the United States, the station box was strengthened by having separate vaults for each track, with a single shared island platform. The station box is perched more than 30 m above solid ground, with its 220 supporting columns, each 2.5 m in diameter, have a cumulative height of 5,500 m. These foundations were necessary due to the inconsistency of the ground which consisted of the former mines that had been backfilled. On 3 December 1967 this branch was separated from line 7, becoming &quot;line 7bis&quot;.

Initially during the planning phase, it was envisioned that it will serve as the terminus, but was then moved to Place des Fêtes before finally deciding to create a one-way loop between these two stations with Pré-Saint-Gervais acting as the branch&#x27;s commercial terminus.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 18 December 2007.

In 2019, the station was used by 547,896 passengers, making it the 297th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 266,623 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 297th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

<text>Place des Fêtes () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving lines 7bis (towards Pré Saint-Gervais only) and 11 in the 19th arrondissement and the Belleville district. It is one of the deepest stations in the metro, at 22.45 m underground (Abbesses is the deepest at 36 m).

== History ==
The station opened on 18 January 1911 as part of a branch of line 7 from Louis Blanc to &quot;Pré Saint-Gervais&quot;. The line 11 platforms opened with the first section of the line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas on 28 April 1935. Along with Maison Blanche, a prototype air raid shelter was added to the station in 1935 to protect it from chemical attacks and was fitted with airtight doors to allow the people to take refuge in the event of an attack. They were chosen because of their proximity to heavily populated working-class districts. On 3 December 1967, the branch was separated from line 7 and became &quot;line 7bis&quot;.

In preparation for Line 11&#x27;s extension to , its platforms were raised slightly and tiled in from 4 August to 7 September 2018. In March 2019, a new emergency exit was completed, located in a small building in Square Monseigneur Maillet, near access 1. It was designed to blend in with its natural surroundings with a wooden design and a green roof. The former access to the station was closed to the public.

In 2019, the station was used by 2 921 564 passengers, making it the 181st-busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,107,812 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 115th-busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,258,568 passengers, making it the 94th-busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station original access building with a canopy built in an Art Nouveau style was demolished in 1935 to make way for its current Art Deco building. It now has two accesses:

* Access 1: Place des Fêtes
* Access 2: rue de Crimée

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===

Line 7bis&#x27;s island platform is located in a curve and is flanked by two tracks. The southern track, on the outer side of the curve, is used for regular service for services towards &quot;Pré Saint-Gervais&quot;. The northern track, on the inner side of the curve, is not used for regular service. It leads to a connection with line 3bis towards Porte des Lilas - Cinéma via &quot;Voie des Fêtes&quot; and Haxo (a ghost station). It is decorated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style utilising orange tiles.

Line 11&#x27;s platforms have a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 20, 48, and 60 of the RATP bus network.

<text>The point location problem is a fundamental topic of computational geometry. It finds applications in areas that deal with processing geometrical data: computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), motion planning, and computer aided design (CAD).

In its most general form, the problem is, given a partition of the space into disjoint regions, to determine the region where a query point lies. For example, the problem of determining which window of a graphical user interface contains a given mouse click can be formulated as an instance of point location, with a subdivision formed by the visible parts of each window, although specialized data structures may be more appropriate than general-purpose point location data structures in this application. Another special case is the point in polygon problem, in which one needs to determine whether a point is inside, outside, or on the boundary of a single polygon.

In many applications, one needs to determine the location of several different points with respect to the same partition of the space. To solve this problem efficiently, it is useful to build a data structure that, given a query point, quickly determines which region contains the query point (e.g. Voronoi Diagram).

==Planar case==
In the planar case, we are given a planar subdivision &quot;S&quot;, formed by multiple polygons called faces, and need to determine which face contains a query point. A brute force search of each face using the point-in-polygon algorithm is possible, but usually not feasible for subdivisions of high complexity. Several different approaches lead to optimal data structures, with O(&quot;n&quot;) storage space and O(log &quot;n&quot;) query time, where &quot;n&quot; is the total number of vertices in &quot;S&quot;. For simplicity, we assume that the planar subdivision is contained inside a square bounding box.

===Slab decomposition===
The simplest and earliest data structure to achieve O(log &quot;n&quot;) time was discovered by Dobkin and Lipton in 1976. It is based on subdividing &quot;S&quot; using vertical lines that pass through each vertex in &quot;S&quot;. The region between two consecutive vertical lines is called a slab. Notice that each slab is divided by non-intersecting line segments that completely cross the slab from left to right. The region between two consecutive segments inside a slab corresponds to a unique face of &quot;S&quot;. Therefore, we reduce our point location problem to two simpler problems:

# Given a subdivision of the plane into vertical slabs, determine which slab contains a given point.
# Given a slab subdivided into regions by non-intersecting segments that completely cross the slab from left to right, determine which region contains a given point.

The first problem can be solved by binary search on the &quot;x&quot; coordinate of the vertical lines in O(log &quot;n&quot;) time. The second problem can also be solved in O(log &quot;n&quot;) time by binary search. To see how, notice that, as the segments do not intersect and completely cross the slab, the segments can be sorted vertically inside each slab. While this algorithm allows point location in logarithmic time and is easy to implement, the space required to build the slabs and the regions contained within the slabs can be as high as O(&quot;n&quot;²), since each slab can cross a significant fraction of the segments.

Several authors noticed that the segments that cross two adjacent slabs are mostly the same. Therefore, the size of the data structure can be significantly reduced. More specifically, Sarnak and Tarjan sweep a vertical line &quot;l&quot; from left to right over the plane, while maintaining the segments that intersect &quot;l&quot; in a Persistent red-black tree. This allows them to reduce the storage space to O(&quot;n&quot;), while maintaining the O(log &quot;n&quot;) query time.

===Monotone subdivisions===
A (vertical) monotone chain is a path such that the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate never increases along the path. A simple polygon is (vertical) monotone if it is formed by two monotone chains, with the first and last vertices in common. It is possible to add some edges to a planar subdivision, in order to make all faces monotone, obtaining what is called a monotone subdivision. This process does not add any vertices to the subdivision (therefore, the size remains O(&quot;n&quot;)), and can be performed in O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time by plane sweep (it can also be performed in linear time, using polygon triangulation). Therefore, there is no loss of generality, if we restrict our data structure to the case of monotone subdivisions, as we do in this section.

The weakness of the slab decomposition is that the vertical lines create additional segments in the decomposition, making it difficult to achieve O(&quot;n&quot;) storage space. Herbert Edelsbrunner, Leonidas J. Guibas, and Jorge Stolfi discovered an optimal data structure that only uses the edges in a monotone subdivision. The idea is to use vertical monotone chains, instead of using vertical lines to partition the subdivision.

Converting this general idea to an actual efficient data structure is not a simple task. First, we need to be able to compute a monotone chain that divides the subdivision into two halves of similar sizes. Second, since some edges may be contained in several monotone chains, we need to be careful to guarantee that the storage space is O(n). Third, testing whether a point is on the left or the right side of a monotone subdivision takes O(&quot;n&quot;) time if performed naïvely.

Details on how to solve the first two issues are beyond the scope of this article. We briefly mention how to address the third issue. Using binary search, we can test whether a point is to the left or right of a monotone chain in O(log &quot;n&quot;) time. As we need to perform another nested binary search through O(log &quot;n&quot;) chains to actually determine the point location, the query time is O(log² n). To achieve O(log &quot;n&quot;) query time, we need to use fractional cascading, keeping pointers between the edges of different monotone chains.

===Triangulation refinement===
A polygon with &quot;m&quot; vertices can be partitioned into &quot;m&quot;–2 triangles. Which can be shown by induction starting from a triangle. There are numerous algorithms to triangulate a polygon efficiently, the fastest having O(&quot;n&quot;) worst case time. Therefore, we can decompose each polygon of our subdivision in triangles, and restrict our data structure to the case of subdivisions formed exclusively by triangles. Kirkpatrick gives a data structure for point location in triangulated subdivisions with O(&quot;n&quot;) storage space and O(log &quot;n&quot;) query time.

The general idea is to build a hierarchy of triangles. To perform a query, we start by finding the top-level triangle that contains the query point. Since the number of top-level triangles is bounded by a constant, this operation can be performed in O(1) time. Each triangle has pointers to the triangles it intersects in the next level of the hierarchy, and the number of pointers is also bounded by a constant. We proceed with the query by finding which triangle contains the query point level by level.

The data structure is built in the opposite order, that is, bottom-up. We start with the triangulated subdivision, and choose an independent set of vertices to be removed. After removing the vertices, we retriangulate the subdivision. Because the subdivision is formed by triangles, a greedy algorithm can find an independent set that contains a constant fraction of the vertices. Therefore, the number of removal steps is O(log &quot;n&quot;).

===Trapezoidal decomposition===
A randomized approach to this problem is based on trapezoidal decomposition, or trapezoidal map. A trapezoidal decomposition is obtained by shooting vertical bullets going both up and down from each vertex in the original subdivision. The bullets stop when they hit an edge, and form a new edge in the subdivision. This way, we obtain a subset of the slab decomposition, with only O(&quot;n&quot;) edges and vertices, since for each vertex in the original subdivision we only add two new vertices and increase the number of edges by four.

A trapezoidal decomposition can be constructed by adding the segments from the original subdivision, one by one, in a random order. Initially (before no segments have been added) the trapezoidal decomposition consists of a single trapezoid, the bounding box of the subdivision. Each subsequent step uses a point location query to locate one endpoint of the next line segment, within the current trapezoidal decomposition, and then walks from the resulting trapezoid to neighboring trapezoids containing the same segment, subdividing and recombining them to form the refined decomposition. Backwards analysis, a form of analysis commonly used for this sort of randomized incremental geometry algorithm, shows that the expected number of trapezoids created for each insertion is bounded by a constant, and therefore that the total number of steps of this algorithm, outside of the point locations, is linear.

The point locations in the current subdivision, performed within this algorithm, may be done using the same structure that, at the end of the algorithm, can be used for point location queries in the final trapezoidal decomposition. This point location data structure takes the form of a directed acyclic graph, where the vertices are the trapezoids that existed at some point in the refinement, and directed edges connect each trapezoid that is no longer in the refinement to the trapezoids that replaced it. A point location query is performed by following a path in this graph, starting from the initial trapezoid, and at each step choosing the replacement trapezoid that contains the query point, until reaching a trapezoid that has not been replaced. The expected depth of a search in this digraph, starting from any query point, is O(log &quot;n&quot;). The space for the data structure is proportional to the number of trapezoids created throughout this refinement process, which in expectation is O(&quot;n&quot;).

==Higher dimensions==

There are no known general point location data structures with linear space and logarithmic query time for dimensions greater than 2. Therefore, we need to sacrifice either query time, or storage space, or restrict ourselves to some less general type of subdivision.

In three-dimensional space, it is possible to answer point location queries in O(log² &quot;n&quot;) using O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) space. The general idea is to maintain several planar point location data structures, corresponding to the intersection of the subdivision with &quot;n&quot; parallel planes that contain each subdivision vertex. A naive use of this idea would increase the storage space to O(&quot;n&quot;²). In the same fashion as in the slab decomposition, the similarity between consecutive data structures can be exploited in order to reduce the storage space to O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), but the query time increases to O(log² &quot;n&quot;).

In &quot;d&quot;-dimensional space, point location can be solved by recursively projecting the faces into a (&quot;d&quot;-1)-dimensional space. While the query time is O(log &quot;n&quot;), the storage space can be as high as formula_1. The high complexity of the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional data structures led to the study of special types of subdivision.

One important example is the case of arrangements of hyperplanes. An arrangement of &quot;n&quot; hyperplanes defines O(&quot;nd&quot;) cells, but point location can be performed in O(log &quot;n&quot;) time with O(&quot;nd&quot;) space by using Chazelle&#x27;s hierarchical cuttings.

Another special type of subdivision is called rectilinear (or orthogonal) subdivision. In a rectilinear subdivision, all edges are parallel to one of the &quot;d&quot; orthogonal axis. In this case, point location can be answered in O(log&quot;d&quot;-1 &quot;n&quot;) time with O(&quot;n&quot;) space.

<text>Pré-Saint-Gervais () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving as the eastern terminus (actually the far end of the terminal loop) of line 7bis, in the 19th arrondissement. It is named after the district of &quot;Pré-Saint-Gervais&quot;, which was part of the commune of Le Pré-Saint-Gervais before it was absorbed into Paris in 1860. &quot;Le Pré-Saint-Gervais&quot; is named after a chapel dedicated to Saint Gervasius.

== History ==
The station opened on 18 January 1911 as part of a branch of line 7 from Louis Blanc to Pré-Saint-Gervais, 18 days after the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette due to difficulties during its construction. It then served as the terminus of the two northeastern branches of line 7. From 27 November 1921 to 2 September 1939, a shuttle service operated between the station and the former &quot;Porte des Lilas - Cinéma&quot; via a tunnel called &quot;voie navette.&quot; On 3 December 1967 this branch was separated from line 7, becoming &quot;line 7bis&quot;. It serves as the commercial terminus of line 7bis and trains may stop for an extended period of time as breaks for drivers as well as for timetabling reasons.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 2 May 2006.

In 2019, the station was used by 365,930 passengers, making it the 301st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 226,935 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 300th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

<text>Balard () is the southwestern terminus of Line 8 of the Paris Métro in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. Since 16 December 2006, it has also been a stop on tramway T3a as part of the initial section of the line between Pont du Garigliano and Porte d&#x27;Ivry. The station is named after Place Balard, itself named after Antoine-Jérôme Balard (1802-1876), a French chemist and the discoverer of bromine. Among the stations serving the Boulevards des Maréchaux along the former gates of Paris, it is the only one not called &quot;Porte de…&quot;, though it serves the Porte de Sèvres.

==History==
The station opened on 27 July 1937 as part of the extension of line 8 from La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle, serving as its new south-western terminus. 

On 3 September 1943, the Royal Air Force bombarded the area and destroyed the accesses to the station, causing the deaths of 22 people, including 2 CMP agents.

To facilitate a connection to tramway T2 via &quot;Suzanne Lenglen&quot; tram station (opened on 21 November 2009), an additional access (access 6) was constructed during the first phase of works between March and December 2012. In the second phase, three new lifts were added to improve the accessibility of the station between January 2014 and June 2015 for people with impaired mobility. This was to minimise disruption to traffic on line 8 and to coordinate with the construction of the Hexagone Balard, the new headquarters of the Ministry of Defense.The cost of the project, estimated to be approximately 16.4 million euros, was included in the budget for the extension of T2 from Issy–Val de Seine to Porte de Versailles which opened on 21 November 2009.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,626,040 passengers, making it the 68th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,643,639 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 71st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,236,801 passengers, making it the 95th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 6 accesses:

* Access 1: Boulevard Victor
* Access 2: Boulevard du Général Martial Valin &quot;Ministère de la Défense&quot;
* Access 3: rue Balard &quot;Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou&quot;
* Access 4: avenue Félix Faure
* Access 5: avenue de la Porte de Sèvres (an ascending escalator)
* Access 6: rue Louis Armand &quot;Centre Aquatique Aquaboulevard&quot; (with an ascending escalator)

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has, as does Pointe du Lac located on the same line, a particular arrangement specific to the stations serving or had served as a terminus. It has three tracks and two platforms. The side platform serves as the arrival platform while the island platform serves as the departure platform. The walls of the western side of the platform are tiled with bevelled white tiles, with the name of the station written in earthenware and the advertising frames with plant motifs, also in earthenware, are honey-coloured. The rest of the station, however, is simply painted white, except for the parts below platform level which is painted grey with the station names written on enamel plates.

=== Other connections ===

==== RER ====
A remote connection with line C of the RER via Pont du Garigliano station is possible, although not shown today on RATP&#x27;s métro maps, it was previously shown in 1998 and 2000. The connection is occasionally depicted in station locality maps but not on the line maps inside its trains.

==== Tramway ====
The station has been served by tramway T3a since 16 December 2006 via &quot;Balard&quot; tram station and by tramway T2 since 21 November 2009 via &quot;Suzanne Lenglen&quot; tram station about 140 metres away. It is one of four métro stations on the network that are located at one of the former gates of Paris and are served by two tram lines; the other three are Porte de Choisy (line 7), Porte de Versailles (line 12), and Porte de Vincennes (line 1). Basilique de Saint-Denis (line 13) is the only station served by two tram lines not located at one of the gates of Paris.

<text>Lourmel () is a station on line 8 of the Paris Métro in the 15th arrondissement. It is named after the nearby rue de Lourmel, which in turn is named after General Frédéric Henri Le Normand de Lourmel (1811-1854), who was killed at the Battle of Inkerman where the Franco-British armies defeated the Russian armies under Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov during the Crimean War.

== History ==
The station opened on 27 July 1937 as part of the extension of line 8 from La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle to Balard.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 13 November 2003.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,301,922 passengers, making it the 226th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,120,497 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 231st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,696,432 passengers, making it the 210th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 2 accesses:

* Access 1: rue de Lourmel
* Access 2: rue Vasco-de-Gama (with an ascending escalator)

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===

It has 3 tracks divided amongst 1 island platform and 1 side platform. Trains towards &quot;Balard&quot; utilise the northern track (the side platform) while trains towards &quot;Pointe du Lac&quot; use the central track. The yard track is not used in revenue service and is normally used to park trains. It also has access to the Javel workshops (a maintenance centre) for trains to be removed from service (on the tracks towards &quot;Boucicaut&quot;) or for routine maintenance. The yard track leads to a dead end on the side towards &quot;Balard&quot;. The workshops contains a washing machine where trains from line 8 are regularly washed: a machine wash once a week and a manual wash once a month (including the interiors). It has several features that help reduce water consumption as part of the RATP&#x27;s sustainable development policy such as the ability to use groundwater in addition to tap water for washing.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by line 42 of the RATP bus network.

<text>Commerce station () is a station on line 8 of the Paris Métro in the &quot;Rue du Commerce&quot;, at the intersection with the &quot;Place du Commerce&quot; in the 15th arrondissement.

== History ==
The station was opened on 27 July 1937 as part of the extension of line 8 from La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle to Balard. Avenue Émile Zola on line 10 was also previously called &quot;Commerce&quot; until it was changed to its present name on 1 March 1937. Hence, it is the last station to inherit the name of an older station on the network, after Vaugirard on line 12 and Saint-Mandé on line 1. 

The &quot;rue du Commerce&quot;, as its name suggests, is a shopping street in the district of Grenelle. The whole span of the street, from Motte-Picquet to the &quot;Eglise Saint-Jean-Baptiste&quot;, is occupied by a mix of high-street shopping, amongst which are about 20 national and international brands, and small, typically Parisian food stores and cafés. After major real estate development in the 1990s and early 2000s, the street and surrounding neighborhood have managed to maintain much of their peripheral &quot;faubourg&quot; or small-town feel while prospering as one of the major centers for population attraction in the 15th arrondissement.

The station was renovated as part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP on 7 April 2008, removing the previously installed orange tiling when it was first renovated in 1969 in the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style, restoring the traditional bevelled white tiling.

There are two Vélib&#x27; bicycle stations within the vicinity, one on &quot;rue Lakanal&quot; opposite the station, and one on &quot;rue Violet&quot; on the far side of Place du Commerce.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,864,592 passengers, making it the 184th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,616,379 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 159th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,212,666 passengers, making it the 157th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has two accesses:

* Access 1: rue du Commerce
* Access 2: rue des Entrepreneurs (with an ascending escalator)

=== Station layout ===
* Note: The side platforms are offset.

==== Platforms ====
Due the station being built under rue d&#x27;Amsterdam, it is too narrow to accommodate the usual layout of the platforms, where the two side platforms are directly opposite each other. As such, its two side platforms are completely offset from each other, the northern platform for services towards &quot;Pointe du Lac&quot; and the southern platform for services towards &quot;Balard&quot;. Due to similar reasons, Liège on line 13 also have completely offset platforms whereas the ones at Anatole France on line 3 are only partially offset.

<text>The barred buttonquail or common bustard-quail (Turnix suscitator) is a buttonquail, one of a small family of birds which resemble, but are not closely related to, the true quails. This species is resident from India across tropical Asia to south China, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
==Taxonomy==
The barred buttonquail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the grouse like birds in the genus &quot;Tetrao&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Tetrao suscitator&quot;. Gmelin cited the English ornithologist Francis Willughby who in 1678 had described and illustrated the &quot;Indian Quail of Brontius&quot; from the Island of Java. The barred buttonquail is now placed in the genus &quot;Turnix&quot; that was introduced in 1791 by French naturalist in Pierre Bonnaterre. The genus name is an abbreviation of the genus &quot;Coturnix&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;suscitator&quot; is Latin and means &quot;awakening&quot;.

Sixteen subspecies are recognised.
* &quot;T. s. plumbipes&quot; (Hodgson, 1837) – Nepal to northeast India and north Myanmar
* &quot;T. s. bengalensis&quot; Blyth, 1852 – central, southwest Bengal (northeast India)
* &quot;T. s. taigoor&quot; (Sykes, 1832) – India (except above)
* &quot;T. s. leggei&quot; Baker, ECS, 1920 – Sri Lanka
* &quot;T. s. okinavensis&quot; Phillips, AR, 1947 – south Kyushu to Ryukyu Islands (south Japan)
* &quot;T. s. rostratus&quot; Swinhoe, 1865 – Taiwan
* &quot;T. s. blakistoni&quot; (Swinhoe, 1871) – east Myanmar to south China and north Indochina
* &quot;T. s. pallescens&quot; Robinson &amp; Baker, ECS, 1928 – central south Myanmar
* &quot;T. s. thai&quot; Deignan, 1946 – northwest, central Thailand
* &quot;T. s. atrogularis&quot; (Eyton, 1839) – south Myanmar, south Thailand and Malay Peninsula
* &quot;T. s. suscitator&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Sumatra, Belitung and Bangka Island (east of south Sumatra), Java, Bawean (north of east Java) and Bali
* &quot;T. s. powelli&quot; Guillemard, 1885 – Lombok to Alor Island (west, central Lesser Sunda Islands)
* &quot;T. s. rufilatus&quot; Wallace, 1865 – Sulawesi
* &quot;T. s. haynaldi&quot; Blasius, W, 1888 – Palawan group (southwest Philippines)
* &quot;T. s. fasciatus&quot; (Temminck, 1815) – Luzon, Mindoro, Masbate and Sibuyan Island (north, central Philippines)
* &quot;T. s. nigrescens&quot; Tweeddale, 1878 – Cebu, Guimaras, Negros and Panay (central west Philippines)

==Description==
A typical little buttonquail, rufous-brown above, rusty and buff below. Chin, throat and breast closely barred with black. Female larger and more richly coloured, with throat and middle of breast black. The blue-grey bill and legs, and yellowish white eyes are diagnostic, as are also the pale buff shoulder-patches on the wings when in flight. Absence of hind toe distinguishes Bustard and Button quails from true quails. Pairs, in scrub and grassland. The calls are a motorcycle-like &quot;drr-r-r-r-r-r&quot; and a loud &quot;hoon- hoon-hoon&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species occurs throughout India up to elevations of about 2500 m in the Himalayas, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines and most of Southeast Asia. There are four geographical races that differ somewhat in colour. It is found in most habitats except dense forest and desert, in particular, scrub jungle, light deciduous forest and farmlands.

==Breeding==

Buttonquails differ from true quails chiefly in the female being polyandrous The female is the brighter of the sexes, initiates courtship and builds the ground nest. She fights with other females for the possession of a cock, uttering a loud drumming drr-r-r-r-r as a challenge to rival hens and also to announce herself to a cock. Eggs when laid are left to be incubated by the cock who also tends the young, which can run as soon as they are hatched. The hen goes off to acquire another mate, and perhaps yet another, and so on, though evidently only one at a time. They breed practically throughout the year, varying locally. The nest is a grass-lined scrape or depression in scrub jungle or crops, often arched over by surrounding grass. The usual clutch comprises 3 or 4 greyish white eggs, profusely speckled with reddish brown or blackish purple.

==Conservation==
Widespread and common throughout its large range, the barred buttonquail is evaluated as being of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.

<text>Frederick Guthrie FRS FRSE (15 October 1833 – 21 October 1886) was a British physicist, chemist, and academic author.

He was the son of Alexander Guthrie, a London tradesman, and the younger brother of mathematician Francis Guthrie. Along with William Fletcher Barrett he founded the Physical Society of London (now the Institute of Physics) in 1874 and was president of the society from 1884 until 1886. He believed that science should be based on experimentation rather than discussion.

==Academic career==
His academic career started at University College, London, where he studied for three years. He studied chemistry under Thomas Graham and Alexander William Williamson and mathematics under Augustus De Morgan. In 1852, he submitted his brother Francis&#x27;s observations to De Morgan.

In 1854 Guthrie went to Heidelberg to study under Robert Bunsen and then in 1855 obtained a PhD at the University of Marburg under Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe.

In 1856 he joined Edward Frankland, professor of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester. In 1859 he went to the University of Edinburgh.

Guthrie synthesized mustard gas in 1860 from ethylene and sulfur dichloride. Guthrie was probably not the first to synthesize mustard gas, but he was among the first to document its toxic effects. Guthrie did his mustard gas synthesis at almost the same time as Albert Niemann, who also synthesized mustard gas and noted its toxic effects in his own experiments. Both Guthrie and Niemann published their findings on 1 January 1860.

In 1860 Guthrie was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Lyon Playfair. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1871.

He served as professor of chemistry and physics at the Royal College of Mauritius between 1861 and 1867.

Guthrie was later a professor at the Royal School of Mines in London, where he mentored the future experimental physicist C. V. Boys. He also mentored John Ambrose Fleming and was instrumental in turning his interest from chemistry to electricity.

He invented the thermionic diode 1873 (for which alternate credit was sometimes later given to Edison&#x27;s assistant W. J. Hammer) and coined the term eutectic in 1884.

Guthrie wrote &quot;Elements of Heat&quot; in 1868 and &quot;Magnetism and Electricity&quot; in 1873 (published in 1876).

Guthrie was also a linguist, playwright, and poet. Under the name Frederick Cerny, he wrote the poems &quot;The Jew&quot; (1863) and &quot;Logrono&quot; (1877).

Guthrie died in 1886 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Family==
He was married four times.

His son Frederick Bickell Guthrie was an agricultural chemist.

<doc id="504509" wikidata="Q841495" url="?curid=504509" title="Probabilistically checkable proof">
<text>In computational complexity theory, a probabilistically checkable proof (PCP) is a type of proof that can be checked by a randomized algorithm using a bounded amount of randomness and reading a bounded number of bits of the proof. The algorithm is then required to accept correct proofs and reject incorrect proofs with very high probability. A standard proof (or certificate), as used in the verifier-based definition of the complexity class NP, also satisfies these requirements, since the checking procedure deterministically reads the whole proof, always accepts correct proofs and rejects incorrect proofs. However, what makes them interesting is the existence of probabilistically checkable proofs that can be checked by reading only a few bits of the proof using randomness in an essential way.

Probabilistically checkable proofs give rise to many complexity classes depending on the number of queries required and the amount of randomness used. The class PCP[&quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;),&quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)] refers to the set of decision problems that have probabilistically checkable proofs that can be verified in polynomial time using at most &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) random bits and by reading at most &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) bits of the proof. Unless specified otherwise, correct proofs should always be accepted, and incorrect proofs should be rejected with probability greater than 1/2. The PCP theorem, a major result in computational complexity theory, states that .

== Definition ==
Given a decision problem &quot;L&quot; (or a language L with its alphabet set Σ), a probabilistically checkable proof system for &quot;L&quot; with completeness &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and soundness &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), where , consists of a prover and a verifier. Given a claimed solution x with length n, which might be false, the prover produces a proof &quot;π&quot; which states &quot;x&quot; solves (, the proof is a string ). And the verifier is a randomized oracle Turing Machine &quot;V&quot; (the &quot;verifier&quot;) that checks the proof &quot;π&quot; for the statement that &quot;x&quot; solves (or ) and decides whether to accept the statement. The system has the following properties:
* Completeness: For any , given the proof &quot;π&quot; produced by the prover of the system, the verifier accepts the statement with probability at least &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;),
* Soundness: For any , then for any proof &quot;π&quot;, the verifier mistakenly accepts the statement with probability at most &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

For the computational complexity of the verifier, the verifier is polynomial time, and we have the &quot;randomness complexity&quot; &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) to measure the maximum number of random bits that &quot;V&quot; uses over all &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;n&quot; and the &quot;query complexity&quot; &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of the verifier is the maximum number of queries that &quot;V&quot; makes to π over all &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;n&quot;.

In the above definition, the length of proof is not mentioned since usually it includes the alphabet set and all the witnesses. For the prover, we do not care how it arrives at the solution to the problem; we care only about the proof it gives of the solution&#x27;s membership in the language.

The verifier is said to be &quot;non-adaptive&quot; if it makes all its queries before it receives any of the answers to previous queries.

The complexity class is the class of all decision problems having probabilistically checkable proof systems over binary alphabet of completeness &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and soundness &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), where the verifier is nonadaptive, runs in polynomial time, and it has randomness complexity &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and query complexity &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

The shorthand notation is sometimes used for . The complexity class PCP is defined as .

== History and significance ==
The theory of probabilistically checkable proofs studies the power of probabilistically checkable proof systems under various restrictions of the parameters (completeness, soundness, randomness complexity, query complexity, and alphabet size). It has applications to computational complexity (in particular hardness of approximation) and cryptography.

The definition of a probabilistically checkable proof was explicitly introduced by Arora and Safra in 1992, although their properties were studied earlier. In 1990 Babai, Fortnow, and Lund proved that PCP[poly(&quot;n&quot;), poly(&quot;n&quot;)] = NEXP, providing the first nontrivial equivalence between standard proofs (NEXP) and probabilistically checkable proofs. The PCP theorem proved in 1992 states that .

The theory of hardness of approximation requires a detailed understanding of the role of completeness, soundness, alphabet size, and query complexity in probabilistically checkable proofs.

== Properties ==
From computational complexity point of view, for extreme settings of the parameters, the definition of probabilistically checkable proofs is easily seen to be equivalent to standard complexity classes. For example, we have the following for different setting of PCP[&quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)]:
*PCP[0, 0] = P (P is defined to have no randomness and no access to a proof.)
*PCP[&quot;O&quot;(log(&quot;n&quot;)), 0] = P (A logarithmic number of random bits doesn&#x27;t help a polynomial time Turing machine, since it could try all possibly random strings of logarithmic length in polynomial time.)
*PCP[0,&quot;O&quot;(log(&quot;n&quot;))] = P (Without randomness, the proof can be thought of as a fixed logarithmic sized string. A polynomial time machine could try all possible logarithmic sized proofs in polynomial time.)
*PCP[poly(&quot;n&quot;), 0] = coRP (By definition of coRP.)
*PCP[0, poly(&quot;n&quot;)] = NP (By the verifier-based definition of NP.)

The PCP theorem and MIP = NEXP can be characterized as follows:
* (the PCP theorem)

It is also known that . 
In particular, . 
On the other hand, if then P = NP.

== Linear PCP ==
A Linear PCP is a PCP in which the proof is a vector of elements of a finite field formula_1, and such that the PCP oracle is only allowed to do linear operations on the proof. Namely, the response from the oracle to a verifier query formula_2 is a linear function formula_3. Linear PCPs have important applications in proof systems that can be compiled into SNARKs.

<text>Lenda Murray (born 22 February 1962) is an American professional female bodybuilding champion.

==Early life and education==
Murray was born in 1962 in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Darcelious and Louvelle Murray. She began participating in organized sports at the age of 15. At Henry Ford High School, Murray was both a record-holding sprinter and varsity cheerleader. She went on to attend Western Michigan University, earning a degree in political science and intended to become a lawyer. While at Western Michigan, she continued to cheerlead, and became the second African American to be chosen as the university’s homecoming queen in 1982.

After a brief tenure cheerleading for the Michigan Panthers in the now-defunct United States Football League, she worked with the Michigan Panthers for two years and then was invited to try out for the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. After she auditioned for the group and made the next-to-last cut, she decided she might need to slenderize her thighs a bit.

==Bodybuilding career==

===Amateur career===
In 1984, Murray joined a gym, the Powerhouse Gym, in Highland Park, Michigan. Within the first two days of joining the gym, Ron Love, an NPC Nationals contender told her that she had the physique to be a bodybuilder. After about a year of training to just stay in shape, Murray decided to compete in the 1985 Ms. Michigan Championships. After placing fourth, she was hooked on the sport. Murray&#x27;s father did not show up for her first bodybuilding competition, but eventually did for others. She rose quickly through the ranks, soon winning contests at the state and regional levels. In 1989, Murray earned her professional status at the IFBB North American Championships.

===Professional career===

====1990–1997====
Murray soon became a regular presence in bodybuilding magazines and a favorite subject of photographer Bill Dobbins who focused extensively on her in his books &quot;The Women&quot; and &quot;Modern Amazons&quot;. At the 1990 Ms. Olympia, Murray succeeded six-time champion Cory Everson and defeated Bev Francis to become the Ms. Olympia champion, a title Murray would hold for six years from 1990 to 1995. She appeared in such mass-market publications as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Ebony&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, as well as in Annie Leibovitz’s photo essay &quot;Women&quot;. Murray’s physique became the standard against which professional female bodybuilders are now judged—an hourglass figure, with broad shoulders tapering into a V-shaped torso mirrored by a proportionally-developed lower body. At the 1991 Ms. Olympia, Murray won the slimmest margin of victory for any Ms. Olympia, edging out Bev Francis by a final score of 31 to 32. Afterwards, she would go on to win the Ms. Olympia competition in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995.

====First retirement====
Murray lost the Ms. Olympia title to Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls in 1996, and went into retirement after finishing second to Chizevsky-Nicholls again in December 1997.

====2002–2004====
Lenda, after Lonnie Teper left a voice message telling her to compete again, started thinking of coming out of retirement. She thought she could beat Juliette Bergman and thought it was sign when they choose Juliette over Iris Kyle in 2001. After four years of retirement, Lenda returned to the Ms. Olympia stage, and won two more Ms. Olympia titles in 2002 and 2003. Her coach was Chad Nicholls, a former bodybuilder, drug and nutrition guru and coach for his wife, Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls, along with professional bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman.

====Second retirement====
Murray finished second in the heavyweight class to Iris Kyle in 2004, and again retired from competition.

====Legacy====
Murray has won eight overall Ms. Olympia titles and has two professional wins in her weight class. She is the second most successful female bodybuilder ever, second only to Iris Kyle. From February 28, 2003 to May 31, 2003, she ranked 1st on the IFBB Women&#x27;s Bodybuilding Professional Ranking List.

Murray has previously done commentary for bodybuilding events on ESPN from 1993 to 1996. She was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2010 and the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. In March 2011, she became a member of the National Fitness Hall of Fame and received the award from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Every year there is an NPC competition, held at Norfolk State University, called the Lenda Murray Bodybuilding, Figure and Bikini Championships, which she is a promoter and organizer for.

Murray is also spokesperson for Wings of Strength and she owns a nutritional products company Crystal Planet Nutrition.

<text>Madeleine station () is a station on lines 8, 12 and 14 of the Paris Métro in central Paris and the 8th arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located under the Place de la Madeleine, the platforms being positioned:
* on Line 8, east of the square and oriented approximately east-west, along the axis of Boulevard de la Madeleine (between Concorde and Opéra stations));
* on Line 12, also east of the square and oriented approximately north-south, curved along the axis of the side carriageway of the said square on the one hand, and Rue Tronchet on the other hand, (between Saint-Lazare and Concorde);
* on Line 14, northeast of the square and oriented approximately northwest/southeast, along the axis of Rue de Sèze (between Saint-Lazare and Pyramides).

==History==
The station was opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. It is named after the nearby Église de la Madeleine, which was dedicated to Mary Magdalene in the 18th century. A small settlement had grown up in the district by the 6th century around a stronghold of the Bishop of Paris. It was known from an early date as &quot;la Ville-l’Évêque&quot; (&quot;Town of the Bishop&quot;).

The line 8 platforms opened on 13 July 1913 as part of the original section of the line between Beaugrenelle (now &quot;Charles Michels&quot; on line 10) and Opéra. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the &quot;Métro&quot;. The line 14 platforms opened on 15 October 1998 as part of the original section of the line between Madeleine and Bibliothèque François Mitterrand. It was the north-western terminus of Line 14 until its extension to Saint-Lazare on 16 December 2003.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 4,297,547 passengers entered this station, which places it in 25th position among metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has five accesses divided into seven metro entrances:
* access 1 - &quot;Place de la Madeleine&quot;, comprising a fixed staircase and a lift giving access to line 14, leading to the right of no. 22 of the place;
* access 2 - &quot;Eglise &quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with two atypical masts (indicating the existence of an underground passage by the double inscription &quot;PASSAGE PUBLIC - METRO&quot;), located opposite no. 16 of the Square de la Madeleine, at the corner with the same named boulevard;
* access 3 - &quot;Rue Duphot&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase with a &quot;PASSAGE PUBLIC - METRO&quot; mast and an ascending escalator arranged back-to-back, located to the right of no. 23 Boulevard de la Madeleine, and communicating directly with the basement of the Decathlon store located at this address;
* access 4 - &quot;Rue de Sèze&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase communicating with the underground car parks under the square, leading out opposite no. 2 rue Tronchet;
* access 5 - &quot;Rue Tronchet&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase, located to the right of nos. 3 and 5 of this same street;

=== Station layout ===
===Platforms===
The platforms of the three lines are of standard configuration. Two in number per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the center and the vault is elliptical.

On line 8, the decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two yellow light strips, benches and corridor outlets in flat yellow tiles and yellow &quot;Motte&quot; seats. However, the thresholds of the corridors allowing the connections with line 14 have a flat white tiling. These arrangements are combined with the same tiles that cover the side walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine typeface on enamelled plates.

The platforms of line 12 are built in a curve and have a semi-elliptical vault, a shape specific to the old North-South stations. They are also furnished in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with red strip light canopies, flat red tiled benches and red &quot;Motte&quot; seats. The outlets of the corridors are also covered in flat red tiling, except for those allowing connections with line 14 which are equipped either with flat white tiling, or with the marble characteristic of the corridors of this line. As with line 8, these fittings are combined with the flat white tiling on the side walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamel plates.

The architecture of the line 14 station is contemporary and follows the principles defined by Bernard Kohn for the whole of this line in 1991, both in the choice of materials (vault in light concrete, marble side walls fitted with glass, tiled floor, wooden seats, etc.) As for lighting and ceiling height; the platforms are also wider than those of other lines. The name of the station appears in Parisine font on backlit panels embedded in the side walls and on stickers affixed to the platform facades.

In addition, the platforms of line 14 are sadly famous for the nauseating odour which reigns there due to the emanation of Hydrogen sulfide due to the poor sealing of the station.

====Corridors====
The connection between line 14 and line 8/12 is done via a large circular access shaft, with many escalators, which is the old TBM access shaft for the construction of the line up to Madeleine. This allows quick trips between platforms.

====Cultural facilities====
Three works of art are located in the corridors or on the platforms created for line 14, &quot;La Prière&quot; and &quot;Ryaba la Poule&quot; are in the connecting corridor with line 12 while &quot;Tissignalisation no 14&quot; adorns the vault of the platforms.

&quot;La Prière&quot; is a sculpture created by Constantin Brâncuși. This work, a reproduction of the 1907 work, has been on display in the station since December 2001 and features a woman praying. Offered to France by the president of the International Franco-Romanian Foundation, the sculptor Remus Botar Botarro, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the birth of Constantin Brâncuși (1876-2001), this identical copy was made in the Noack art foundry in Berlin, in 2000, from a silicon rubber moulding.

&quot;Ryaba la Poule&quot; is a work by Russian artist Ivan Lubennikov. Installed in 2009, it is a 40m2 stained glass window made up of 20 panels inlaid with glass elements placed on the mezzanine access to the platforms, at the outlet of the connecting corridor with line 12. In exchange for this work, RATP provided the Moscow Metro with a Guimard kiosk, which was installed at the entrance to Kiyevskaya station on the Koltsevaya line in Moscow.

&quot;Tissignalisation no 14&quot; is a work by the French artist Jacques Tissinier. Created at the same time as the station, it is installed on the vault of the line 14 . This is an installation using a thousand embedded discs in coloured enamelled steel. Each disc measures 16 cm in diameter and represents a stylized papyrus sheet coloured in red, white, blue and orange.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 42, 45, 52, 84, 94 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Grands Boulevards (), formerly named Rue Montmartre (1931–1998), is a station on Lines 8 and 9 of the Paris Métro. In 2019, it was the 44th busiest station of the Métro network, with 6,807,424 yearly users.

The section of both lines from just east of Richelieu–Drouot to west of République was built under the Grand Boulevards, partly on the border between the 2nd and 9th arrondissements, that replaced the Louis XIII wall and is in soft ground, which was once the course of the Seine. The lines are built on two levels, with Line 8 on the higher level and Line 9 in the lower level. The platforms are at the sides and the box containing the lines and supporting the road above is strengthened by a central wall between the tracks. There is no interconnection between the lines at &quot;Grands Boulevards&quot;, with each level having different accesses to the street.

==History==
===Opening===
The station was opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of Line 8 from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton. The Line 9 platforms were opened on 10 December 1933 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Montreuil.

===Name change===
The station was originally called &quot;Rue Montmartre,&quot; but the tiled nameplates read simply &quot;Montmartre.&quot; This caused confusion for non-Parisians and tourists, as the Montmartre neighbhorhood lies significantly north of the station. In 1966, an attempt was made to improve clarity by covering the original nameplates with signs reading &quot;Rue Montmartre,&quot; but confusion continued. The station was renamed to &quot;Grands Boulevards&quot; in 1998 to reflect the programme of the former Mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, to upgrade the main Boulevards of Paris and because the old name continued to be misleading.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has six entrances:
* Entrance 1 - &quot;Rue du Faubourg-Montmartre&quot;
* Entrance 2 - &quot;Boulevard Montmartre, Musée Grévin&quot;
* Entrance 3 - &quot;Rue Montmartre&quot;
* Entrance 4 - &quot;Boulevard Poissonnière&quot;
* Entrance 5 - &quot;Rue Saint-Fiacre&quot;
* Entrance 6 - &quot;Rue Rougemont&quot;

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines, 105 meters long, have a particular configuration. Two in number per stopping point, they are isolated in two half-stations separated by a central wall due to their construction in unstable land. Those of line 8 have an elliptical vault while those of line 9, arranged below, have vertical side walls and a horizontal reinforced concrete ceiling.

Their decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in both cases. Those of line 8 have two red light strips (one per half-station), a bench in flat red tiles and orange &quot;Motte&quot; seats. Those of line 9 have two green light canopies (one per half-station, offset on the side opposite the track), benches in flat green tiles and green &quot;Motte&quot; seats. These fittings are combined with the flat white ceramic tiles, which are placed horizontally and in staggered rows on the side walls and the vaults of line 8, while they are placed vertically and aligned on the side walls of line 9, the ceiling of the latter being simply painted white. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in Parisine typeface on enamelled plates.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 20, 32, 39, 74 and 85 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Filles du Calvaire () is a station on Line 8 of the Paris Métro, at the limit between the 3rd and 11th arrondissements.

==History==
The station opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton.

It is named after the Boulevard des Filles du Calvaire, which is named after the &quot;Calvairiennes&quot; or &quot;Filles du Calvaire&quot; (Daughters of Calvary), who were an order of reformed Benedictine sisters. Antoinette d&#x27;Orléans and Père Joseph founded the order in Poitiers, in 1617. The convent was later moved to Paris before it was closed in the French Revolution.

Although named after the boulevard, it is located just north of it, under the Boulevard du Temple.

<text>Chemin Vert () is a station of the Paris Métro on Line 8, named after the &quot;Rue de Chemin Vert&quot;.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard Beaumarchais, between Rue Saint-Gilles and Rue du Chemin-Vert. Oriented along a north-south axis, it is sandwiched between the &quot;Saint-Sébastien-Froissart&quot; and &quot;Bastille&quot; stations.

==History==
The station opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu - Drouot to Porte de Charenton. The &quot;Rue de Chemin Vert&quot; (green path) follows the route of an old footpath through the middle of market gardens. In 1868 the &quot;Rue de Chemin Vert&quot; was extended from the &quot;Rue des Amandiers-Popincourt&quot; to the &quot;Barrier des Amandiers&quot;, a gate on the former Wall of the Farmers-General.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du Metro&quot; program, the station was completely renovated, starting with the platforms in 2001, then it was the turn of the corridors opening on 18 December 2006. The decoration of the quays in the interwar style of the former CMP was thus renewed and completed with new lighting, but the advertising frames with plant motifs were recreated in brown earthenware and no longer in honey colour as in the original.

On 20 March 2018, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP to celebrate the arrival of spring, in parallel with the distribution of flowers to passengers, as in five other stations. The new plaques depict a green landscape crossed by a path, where a wooden sign bearing the name &quot;Chemin Vert&quot; was depicted, referring to the origin of the name of the Rue du Chemin-Vert.

In 2020, passengers entered this station.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances, each consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with a balustrade and a Dervaux-type candelabra:
* Access 1 &quot;Boulevard Beaumarchais / Rue Saint-Gilles - Place des Vosges&quot; - leading to nos. 59 and 61 of the boulevard;
* Access 2 &quot;Boulevard Beaumarchais / Rue du Chemin-Vert&quot; - located to the right of nos. 52 and 54 of the same boulevard.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Chemin Vert is a station with a standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for most metro stations. The lighting strips are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are made of earthenware with brown plant motifs (a shade that did not originally exist) and the name of the station is also made of earthenware in the interwar style of the original CMP. The platforms are equipped with wooden slatted benches painted purple.

It is one of the few stations in the network whose ceramic decoration in the &quot;CMP&quot; style is no longer original, having been completely reconstructed during the 2006 renovation.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 29, 69 and 91 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N01 and N02 of the Noctilien network.

The station opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu – Drouot to Porte de Charenton. Avenue Ledru-Rollin is named after lawyer Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (1807–1874) who founded the newspaper &quot;La Réforme&quot; in 1843 and served as Minister of the Interior in 1848.

The station is one of three stops chosen as prototypes of the decorative &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, with Pont-Neuf on line 7 and Voltaire on line 9, which was tested there in 1974. It is the model for those in dark blue.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du metro&quot; revival programme, its corridors were renovated by 28 November 2002.

In 2013, 3,917,141 passengers used the station, making it the 128th busiest out of 302 on the Métro network.
==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has four accesses, each with two metro entrances (eight in total), all made up of fixed staircases with Dervaux-type balustrades:
* Access 1 &quot;Avenue Ledru-Rollin&quot;, embellished with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, leading to the right of no. 90 of the avenue;
* Access 2 &quot;Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine&quot;, decorated with a Dervaux candelabra, facing no. 100 of this street;

The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two blue light canopies, benches treated in flat blue tiles and blue &quot;Motte&quot; seats. These fittings are combined with the bevelled white ceramic tiles that cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the corridor outlets. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware and the name of the station is also in earthenware in the style of the original CMP.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 61, 76 and 86 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N16 and N34 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Porte Dorée () is a station on line 8 of the Paris Métro in the 12th arrondissement.

The station opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton. It is named after the Porte Dorée, one of the former gates of Paris. 

Along with Porte de Bagnolet on line 3, Porte de Pantin on line 5, and Porte d&#x27;Italie on line 7, it is one of the four stations on the network built at the former gates of Paris without having originally served as a terminus.
== History ==
The station opened on 5 May 1931 as part of the extension of line 8 from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton for the Paris Colonial Exposition held in the nearby Bois de Vincennes in 1931.

On the evening of 16 May 1937, Lætitia Toureaux was found stabbed in the first class car where she was alone, the first murder on the métro. Despite many investigations over the years, the identity of the culprit remains unknown till today. This story inspired Pierre Siniac&#x27;s (1928–2002) novel &quot;Le Crime du dernier métro&quot; published in 2001 as well as one of the legends of the Le Manoir de Paris, a walk-through haunted house in the 10th arrondissement.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 2 December 2008.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,763,236 passengers, making it the 191st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,428,784 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 182nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,918,182 passengers, making it the 186th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<text>Porte de Charenton () is a station on Line 8 of the Paris Métro located in the 12th arrondissement of Paris.

==History==
The station opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot for the Paris Colonial Exposition, held in the nearby Bois de Vincennes. It was the southeastern terminus of the line until its extension to Charenton–Écoles on 5 October 1942. It is named after the Porte de Charenton, a gate in the 19th-century Thiers wall of Paris on the road to Charenton-le-Pont.

An interchange with Île-de-France tramway Line 3a opened on 15 December 2012.

The nearby Pelouse de Reuilly (part of the Bois de Vincennes) is the location of the Foire du Trône funfair in April and May.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has four access points. The first two, at the south-west end of the platforms, lead:
* at 68, Boulevard Poniatowski, alongside the Léo-Lagrange stadium;
* at 25, Boulevard Poniatowski.
The last two, at the north-east end of the quays, allowing access to the Reuilly lawn, lead:
* at Boulevard Poniatowski on the even number side, near the corner with Place du Cardinal-Lavigerie;
* at 59, Boulevard Poniatowski. These two old emergency exits were renovated and put into service in 2020 [ref. necessary].

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Porte de Charenton is a station with a particular configuration. Due to its former status as a terminus, it has four tracks and two platforms, each of them being framed by two tracks. This rare arrangement can also be observed at Porte de Montreuil station . Trains usually serve the station via the side tracks. The central tracks only serve as a depot or in the event of an exceptional termination. These platforms are fitted out in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two orange light canopies, benches treated with brown flat tiles and orange &quot;Motte&quot; seats. These arrangements are combined with the flat white ceramic tiles which cover the walls and the particularly wide vault. The advertising frames are metal and the name of the station is written in capital letters on enameled plaques.

===Other connections===
The station is served by lines 77, 87 and 111 of the RATP Bus Network and at night, by line N35 of the Noctilien network.

Since 15 December 2012, it is also served by the T3a tramway after its extension from Porte d&#x27;Ivry.

<doc id="504540" wikidata="Q1405224" url="?curid=504540" title="Maisons-Alfort–Stade station">
<text>Maisons-Alfort–Stade () is a station on line 8 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Maisons-Alfort. It is named after the commune the station is situated in, and after the stade de la Suze (1935-1970) which still existed when the station was built in 1969 and which has been replaced a year later by the Métropolis building complex at number 99. This lost stadium is the very reason why the platforms have a set of stairs going nowhere on the opposite hand of the platform exit, the construction of the obsolete access to the stadium having been aborted soon before the opening to the public. This northwest access and mezzanine for ticket barriers thus remained blind and were later converted for staff use. The situation is comparable to Porte Molitor station that as no access, being originally intended for Parc des Princes. The name of the station didn&#x27;t change due to the nearby &quot;Stade Auguste Delaune&quot; that filled the void.

== History ==
The station opened on 19 September 1970 as part of the extension of the line from Charenton–Écoles, serving as its eastern terminus until it was further extended to Maisons-Alfort–Les Juilliottes on 27 April 1972. This began a new wave of network expansions after a 18-year break due to limited financial resources during the post-war period. It marks the first appearance of &quot;box stations&quot;, characterised by its rectangular shape due its cut-and-cover method of construction.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,330,375 passengers, making it the 221st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,393,467 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 186th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,702,479 passengers, making it the 208th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.
== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 2 accesses:
* Access 1: avenue du Général Leclerc &quot;côté des numéros impairs&quot;
* Access 2: avenue du Général Leclerc &quot;côté des numéros pairs&quot; (with an ascending escalator)
* Access “Stade de la Suze” was never completed (what&#x27;s left of it is a set of stairs and a mezzanine for ticket barriers on the opposite hand of the platform exit) since the stadium was destroyed to build the Métropolis building complex soon before the station opened to public.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. Built in the 1970s, it is a cage station with vertical walls and a horizontal ceiling due to its cut-and-cover construction. The decoration, typical of this decade, is similar to a variation of the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style with walls and tunnel exits covered with hollow patterned tiles in various shades of ochre, placed vertically and aligned, as well as a ceiling and wall tops treated in white. Lighting is provided by two suspended canopies that can also be found at the next station, &quot;École Vétérinaire de Maisons-Alfort&quot;, as well as at the &quot;Porte de Bagnolet&quot; station on line 3 (in addition, the &quot;Gambetta&quot; station on the latter line was equipped with the same model of canopy until its renovation in 2007). The advertising frames, slightly recessed in the walls, are metal and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The seats are &quot;Motte&quot; style in red.

The station shares this decorative style only with the two framing stopping points, &quot;École Vétérinaire de Maisons-Alfort&quot; and &quot;Maisons-Alfort-Les Juiliottes&quot;. However, ochre-coloured tiles also exist in the access corridors to the platform of the &quot;Créteil-Université&quot; station on the same line, except that they only have the lightest shade.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 104 and 372 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by line N35 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Maisons-Alfort–Les Juilliottes () is a station on line 8 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Maisons-Alfort. It is named after the &quot;Juilliottes&quot; quarter of Maisons-Alfort.

== History ==
The station opened on 27 April 1972 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from Porte de Charenton–Écoles, serving as its eastern terminus until it was further extended to on 24 September 1973.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 11 September 2015. As a result, despite the station being built in the 1970s, the walls of its corridors and mezzanine are clad with the traditional white beveled tiles found on the older stations on the métro. Some of the tiles have dimensions twice that of the classic tiles – a feature also found at as well as on Line 13. Only its platforms have retained its original coloured tiles.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,779,627 passengers, making it the 260th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 905,627 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 255th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,297,495 passengers, making it the 251st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 4 accesses:

* Access 1: rue Louis Pergaud &quot;Centre Commercial&quot;
* Access 2: avenue du Général Leclerc
* Access 3: rue du Buisson Joyeux (formerly rue Hoche, a street that stood where the highway A86 now stands)
* Access 4: avenue du Maréchal De Lattre de Tassigny (formerly an access to a bus station and loop from and towards Créteil)

The layout of the access points 3 and 4 reminds the profound changes in a district that the station preceded in its construction, built two years before the start of the A86 works. Surprisingly, accesses 1 and 2, today the busiest, do not have an escalator, unlike accesses 3 and 4 which are however less frequented. This escalator was originally intended to carry the passengers from the arrival platform of this terminus towards a bus station which has now disappeared, of which the parking lot retains the shape of the turnaround loop for buses extending the service to Créteil. Meanwhile, access 3 lead to rue Hoche (parallel to rue du Buisson Joyeux), a residential area of which absolutely nothing remains, the street and the area having been completely torn down to build the motorway A86 only two years after the construction of the station. This is how today access 4 oddly leads to a tiny car park, while access 3 bizarrely faces towards a fallow vegetation on the motorway exit embankment.

=== Station layout ===

=== Platforms ===
The station has a particular arrangement specific to the stations serving or had served as a terminus. It has three tracks and two island platforms, of which only 1 island platform and two tracks are in regular use.

Built in the 1970s, it is a box station with vertical walls and a horizontal ceiling due to its cut-and-cover construction. The decoration, typical of the 1970s, is similar to a variation of the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style with walls and tunnel exits covered with tiles in various shades of ochre (sand-coloured at the right of the advertisements), placed vertically and aligned, a ceiling and wall tops treated in white as well as a suspended lighting system with a red structure. The advertisements on the walls are frameless and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The seats are &quot;Motte&quot; style in red (replacing benches of the same colour).

The station shares this decorative style only with the two other stopping points of the line located on the territory of the municipality, &quot;École Vétérinaire de Maisons-Alfort&quot; and &quot;Maisons-Alfort-Stade&quot;. However, ochre-coloured tiles also exist in the access corridors to the platform of the &quot;Créteil–Université&quot; station, except that they only have the lightest shade.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 104, 217, and 372 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N32 and N35 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Azathioprine, sold under the brand name Imuran, among others, is an immunosuppressive medication. It is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection. It is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 human carcinogen. It is taken by mouth or injected into a vein.
Common side effects include bone-marrow suppression and vomiting. Bone-marrow suppression is especially common in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase. Other serious risk factors include an increased risk of certain cancers. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Azathioprine belongs to the purine analogues subclass of antimetabolites family of medications. It works via 6-thioguanine to disrupt the making of RNA and DNA by cells.
Azathioprine was first made in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2018, it was the 358th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Azathioprine is used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection following organ transplantation, and to treat an array of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet&#x27;s disease, and other forms of vasculitis, autoimmune hepatitis, atopic dermatitis, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic&#x27;s disease), restrictive lung disease, and others. It is also an important therapy and steroid-sparing agent for inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis) and for multiple sclerosis.

In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in kidney transplantation from human donors, and for rheumatoid arthritis.

===Transplantation===
Azathioprine is used to prevent rejections of kidney or liver allografts, usually in conjunction with other therapies, including corticosteroids, other immunosuppressants, and local radiation therapy. The administration protocol starts either at the time of transplantation or within the following two days.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Being a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), azathioprine has been used for the management of the signs and symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids may be combined or continued (if they were already in use) with azathioprine, but the combination with other DMARDs is not recommended.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
Azathioprine has been used in the management of moderate to severe chronically active Crohn&#x27;s disease, to maintain clinical remission (absence of disease activity) in corticosteroid-dependent patients, and to provide benefit in people with fistulizing Crohn&#x27;s disease. The onset of action is slow, and several months may be required to achieve a clinical response.

Azathioprine treatment is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, but whether this is due to the drug or a predisposition related to Crohn&#x27;s disease is unclear. Lower doses of azathioprine are used as a therapy in children with refractory or corticosteroid-dependent Crohn&#x27;s disease, without causing many side effects. It may also be used to prevent flares in those with ulcerative colitis.

===Others===
Azathioprine is sometimes used in systemic lupus erythematosus, requiring a maintenance dose of 15 mg or higher of prednisone in those who experience recurrent flares.

It is used as an add-on therapy when steroid therapy is given by mouth for pemphigus and myasthenia gravis, as a &quot;steroid-sparing&quot; agent. Azathioprine is also used to maintain remission in people who have granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

It can be very effective in eczema and atopic dermatitis, though it is not commonly used. The British National Eczema Society lists it as a third-line treatment for severe to moderate cases of these skin diseases.

It was widely used to treat multiple sclerosis until the first half of the 1990s. Concerns about increased risk of malignancy have led to a decreased use, yet it is still used in maintenance treatment for people who frequently relapse. A 2007 Cochrane review found that azathioprine reduced the number of relapses in the first year of treatment and disease progression in the first two to three years and did not find an increase in cancer, and noted the need for direct comparison of azathioprine and interferon beta, conflicting conclusions regarding cancer, and the potential for long-term risks.

A widely used therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was azathioprine in combination with prednisone and &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine. A 2012 study showed that this combination produced worse outcomes than a placebo.

==Adverse effects==

Nausea and vomiting are common adverse effects, especially at the beginning of treatment. Such cases are met with taking azathioprine after meals or transient intravenous administration. Side effects that are probably hypersensitivity reactions include dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and rashes. Hair loss is often seen in transplant patients receiving the drug but rarely occurs under other indications. Because azathioprine suppresses the bone marrow, patients can develop anaemia and be more susceptible to infection; regular monitoring of the blood count is recommended during treatment. Acute pancreatitis can also occur, especially in patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease. Treatment is discontinued in up to 30% of patients due these effects, but therapeutic drug monitoring of the biologically active metabolites, &quot;i.e.&quot; thiopurine nucleotides, can help to optimize the efficacy and safety. Clinically, most hospitals resort to ion-exchange LC-MS (liquid chromotography – mass spectrometry), but the newly developed approach of porous graphitic carbon-based chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry appears superior with respect to patient care in this respect.

It is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans).

===Pharmacogenetics===

The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine&#x27;s mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme is responsible, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine – this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the &quot;TPMT&quot; gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and an increased risk of severe bone-marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, &quot;TPMT&quot; polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a &quot;TPMT&quot; genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT enzyme activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.

===Cancers===
Azathioprine is listed as a human carcinogen in the 12th Report on Carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, asserting that it is &quot;known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans.&quot; Since August 2009, the U.S. FDA has required warnings to be placed on packaging with respect to increased risks of certain cancers.

The risks involved seem to be related both to the duration and the dosage used. People who have previously been treated with an alkylating agent may have an excessive risk of cancers if treated with azathioprine. Epidemiological studies by International Agency for Research on Cancer have provided &quot;sufficient&quot; evidence of azathioprine carcinogenicity in humans (group 1), although the methodology of past studies and the possible underlying mechanisms are questioned.

The various diseases requiring transplantation may in themselves increase the risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, hepatobiliary carcinomas, and mesenchymal tumours to which azathioprine may add additional risks. Those receiving azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis may have a lower risk than those undergoing transplantation.

Cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma – a rare type of lymphoma – have been reported in patients treated with azathioprine. The majority occurred in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Adolescents and young adult males were the majority of cases. They presented with a very aggressive disease course, and with one exception, died of the lymphoma. The FDA has required changes to the labeling to inform users and clinicians of the issue.

====Skin cancers====
In transplant patients, skin cancer is 50 to 250 times more common than in the general population, and between 60 and 90% of patients are affected 20 years after transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive medication including azathioprine in organ transplantation has been linked to increased rates of developing skin cancer. Azathioprine causes the accumulation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) in patients&#x27; DNA, which might trigger cancer when the patient is later exposed to ultraviolet light. Patients taking azathioprine were found to be abnormally sensitive to UVA light.

==Overdose==
Large, single doses are generally well tolerated; a patient who took 7.5 g azathioprine (150 tablets) at once showed no relevant symptoms apart from vomiting, slightly decreased white blood cell count, and marginal changes in liver function parameters. The main symptoms of long-term overdosing are infections of unclear origin, mouth ulcers, and spontaneous bleeding, all of which are consequences of its bone-marrow suppression.

== Interactions ==

Other purine analogues, such as allopurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down azathioprine, thus increasing the toxicity of azathioprine. Low doses of allopurinol, though, have been shown to safely enhance the efficacy of azathioprine, especially in inflammatory bowel disease nonresponders. This may still lead to lower lymphocyte counts and higher rates of infection, so the combination requires careful monitoring.

Azathioprine decreases the effects of the anticoagulant warfarin and of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, but increases the effect of depolarizing muscle relaxants. It can also interfere with niacin (vitamin B3), resulting in at least one case to pellagra and fatal medullary aplasia.

==Pregnancy and breastfeeding==
Azathioprine can cause birth defects. A 2003 population-based study in Denmark showed that the use of azathioprine and related mercaptopurine resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities, as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects in a child whose father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy.

Traditionally, as for all cytotoxic drugs, the manufacturer advises not to breastfeed whilst taking azathioprine, but the &quot;lactation risk category&quot; reported by Thomas Hale in his book &quot;Medications and Mothers&#x27; Milk&quot; lists azathioprine as &quot;L3&quot;, termed &quot;moderately safe&quot;.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacokinetics===

Azathioprine is absorbed from the gut to about 88%. Bioavailability varies greatly between individual patients, between 30 and 90%, because the drug is partly inactivated in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations, counting not only the drug itself, but also its metabolites, are reached after 1–2 hours, and the average plasma half-life is 26 to 80 minutes for azathioprine and 3–5 hours for drug plus metabolites; 20 to 30% are bound to plasma proteins while circulating in the bloodstream.

Azathioprine is a prodrug, a substance that is not an active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first, it is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (–S–). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver, and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thiodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is methylated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various methylated and hydroxylated purines, which are excreted via the urine.

===Mechanism of action===
Azathioprine inhibits purine synthesis. Purines are needed to produce DNA and RNA. By inhibiting purine synthesis, less DNA and RNA are produced for the synthesis of white blood cells, thus causing immunosuppression.
Azathioprine is converted within tissues to 6-MP, some of which is converted, in turn, to 6-thioguanine by the addition of an amino group. Both 6-MP and 6-thioguanine are conjugated with ribose and then phosphorylated to form the nucleotides thioinosinic acid and thioguanylic acid, respectively. These nucleotides masquerade, respectively, as inosinic acid and guanylic acid; the former is the starting point for purine nucleotide biosynthesis, while the latter is one of the building blocks of DNA and RNA.

* The nucleotides are incorporated into newly synthesized (but nonfunctional) DNA, halting replication.
* The nucleotides act to inhibit glutamine-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (GPAT), one of the enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis, one of the earlier steps in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. They achieve GPAT inhibition through a form of negative feedback called product inhibition. Because actively replicating cells (such as cancer cells and the T cells and B cells of the immune system) are most active in synthesizing purine, making new DNA, these cells are most strongly affected.
* A portion of the nucleotides is additionally phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms. These bind to GTP-binding protein Rac1, blocking synthesis of the protein Bcl-xL, thus sending activated T cells and mononuclear cells into apoptosis (programmed cell death). Increased apoptosis of mononuclear cells is seen in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with azathioprine.

==Chemistry==
Azathioprine is a thiopurine linked to a second heterocycle (an imidazole derivative) via a thioether. It is a pale yellow solid with a slightly bitter taste and a melting point of 238–245 °C. It is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in lipophilic solvents such as chloroform, ethanol, and diethyl ether. It dissolves in alkaline aqueous solutions, where it hydrolyzes to 6-MP.

Azathioprine is synthesized from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1&quot;H&quot;-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in dimethyl sulfoxide. The synthesis of the former starts with an amide from methylamine and diethyl oxalate, which is then cyclized and chlorinated with phosphorus pentachloride; the nitro group is introduced with nitric and sulfuric acid.

==History==
Azathioprine was synthesized by George Herbert Hitchings and Gertrude Elion in 1957 (named BW 57-322) to produce 6-MP in a metabolically active, but masked form, and at first used as a chemotherapy drug.

Robert Schwartz investigated the effect of 6-MP on the immune response in 1958 and discovered that it profoundly suppresses the formation of antibodies when given to rabbits together with antigens. Following the work done by Sir Peter Medawar and Gertrude Elion in discovering the immunological basis of rejection of transplanted tissues and organs, and Schwartz&#x27;s researches on 6-MP, Sir Roy Calne, the British pioneer in transplantation, introduced 6-MP as an experimental immunosuppressant for kidney and heart transplants. When Calne asked Elion for related compounds to investigate, she suggested azathioprine, which was subsequently found out to be superior (as effective and less toxic to the bone marrow) by Calne.

In April 1962, with regimens consisting of azathioprine and prednisone, the transplantation of kidneys to unrelated recipients (allotransplantation) was successful for the first time. For many years, this kind of dual therapy with azathioprine and glucocorticoids was the standard antirejection regimen, until cyclosporin was introduced into clinical practice (by Calne as well) in 1978.

Cyclosporin has now replaced some of the azathioprine use due to a longer survival time, especially in heart-related transplantations. Moreover, despite being considerably more expensive, mycophenolate mofetil is also increasingly being used in place of azathioprine in organ transplantation, as it is associated with less bone-marrow suppression, fewer opportunistic infections, and a lower incidence of acute rejection.

<text>Créteil–Université station () is an at-grade station on Line 8 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Créteil. It is located in the middle of the &quot;Route départementale 1&quot; (RD 1). Its name refers to the nearby Paris-East Créteil University.

== History ==
The station opened on 10 September 1974 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from to . It owes its name to its location in the municipal territory of Créteil as well as to its proximity to the headquarters and main site of the Paris-East Créteil University (UPEC), a French multidisciplinary institution also known as &quot;Paris XII&quot;.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,536,972 passengers, making it the 137th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,935,234 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 125th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,496,595 passengers, making it the 135th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has two accesses:
* Access 1: Mail des Mèches (pedestrian mall) / &quot;Paris-East Créteil University&quot;
* Access 2: Route de Choisy / &quot;Hôpital Albert Chenevier&quot;

=== Station layout ===
===Platforms===
Créteil–Université is an elevated station with a particular configuration. It has a central platform framed by the two tracks of the metro. This platform is equipped with &quot;Akiko&quot; style seats in blue, replacing &quot;Motte&quot; seats in the same shade; the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on suspended backlit panels. The metal advertising frames were moved to the limits of the line&#x27;s rights-of-way, the width of which made it possible to build an additional track and platform.

The access corridors to the platform are decorated with light ochre-coloured tiles that can also be found on the platforms of the stations established on the territory of the neighbouring municipality of Maisons-Alfort (&quot;École vétérinaire de Maisons-Alfort&quot;, &quot;Maisons-Alfort-Stade&quot; and &quot;Maisons-Alfort-Les Juilliottes&quot;), except that they have several different shades of ochre in the latter and not only the lightest shade.

<text>The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), more commonly known as the International Baccalaureate (IB), is a nonprofit foundation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and founded in 1968. It offers four educational programmes: the IB Diploma Programme and the IB Career-related Programme for students aged 16 to 19, the IB Middle Years Programme for students aged 12 to 16, and the IB Primary Years Programme for children aged 3 to 12. To teach these programmes, schools must be authorized by the International Baccalaureate.

The organization&#x27;s name and logo were changed in 2007 to reflect new structural arrangements. Consequently, &quot;IB&quot; may now refer to the organization itself, any of the four programmes, or the diploma or certificates awarded at the end of a programme. 
==History==
===Inception===
When Marie-Thérèse Maurette wrote &quot;Educational Techniques for Peace. Do They Exist?&quot; in 1948, she created the framework for what would eventually become the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP). In the mid-1960s, a group of teachers from the International School of Geneva (Ecolint) created the International Schools Examinations Syndicate (ISES), which would later become the International Baccalaureate Office (IBO), followed by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and then the International Baccalaureate (IB).

===First programme===
The IB headquarters were officially established in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1968 for the development and maintenance of the IB Diploma Programme. The objective of this programme was to &quot;provide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy, international and multinational organizations&quot; by offering standardized courses and assessments for students aged 16 to 19. 

International Baccalaureate North America (IBNA) was established in 1975 by Peter Nehr, International Baccalaureate Africa, Europe and Middle-East (IBAEM) in 1986, and International Baccalaureate Asia Pacific (IBAP) during the same period. The International Baccalaureate now functions as a global organization with global centers in Geneva, Washington D.C., The Hague, Cardiff and Singapore.
===Other programmes===
The IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) was first offered in 1994. Within five years, 51 countries had MYP schools. A revised MYP programme, referred to as the IB Middle Years Programme New chapter was introduced in September 2014.

The IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) was piloted in 1996 in 30 primary schools on different continents, and the first PYP school was authorized in 1997, with 87 authorized schools in 43 countries within five years.

The IB Career-related Programme (formerly IB Career-related Certificate) was first offered in 2012.

===Directors general===
Alec Peterson was IB&#x27;s first director general (1968–1977), followed by Gérard Renaud (1977–1983), Roger Peel (1983–1998), Derek Blackman (1998–1999), George Walker (1999–2005), Jeffrey Beard (2006–2013) and Siva Kumari (2013–2021).

As of May 2021, Olli-Pekka Heinonen, a Finnish politician and director of the Finnish National Agency of Education, was selected by the board of directors to serve as director general, replacing Siva Kumari.

== Organization ==
The IB is a nonprofit organization, selling its products and services to schools in a system analogous to a franchise network. Schools buy products and services from the IB &quot;–&quot; assessments, publications, the right to use branding &quot;–&quot; and in turn schools act as distributors, reselling the products and services to families.

The IB maintains its head office in Geneva, Switzerland. Assessment and grading services are located in Cardiff, Wales and the curriculum centre moved in 2011 to The Hague, Netherlands. Two other offices are located in Washington D.C., United States and Singapore.

The organization is divided into three regional centres: IB Africa, Europe and Middle East (IBAEM), administered from The Hague; IB Americas (IBA), administered from Washington D.C.; and IB Asia-Pacific (IBAP), administered from Singapore.

Sub-regional associations &quot;are groups formed by and for IB school practitioners to assist IB schools, teachers and students in their communities—from implementing IB programmes to providing a forum for dialogue.&quot; There are currently fifty-six (56) sub-regional associations, including:
* fifteen (15) in the IB Africa, Europe and Middle East (IBAEM) region;
* thirty-six (36) in the IB Americas (IBA) region;
* five (5) in the IB Asia Pacific (IBAP) region.

In 2003, the IB established the IB Fund, incorporated in the United States, to enhance fundraising and keep funds raised separately from operational funds. In 2004, the IB approved a strategic plan to &quot;ensure that programmes and services are of the highest quality&quot; and &quot;to provide access to people who are socio-economically disadvantaged.&quot; In 2010 and 2015, the strategic plans were updated after substantial consultation. The vision for the next five years was to more consciously establish the IB as a leader in international education and the Board outlined a vision and four strategic goals with key strategic objectives.

Access remains fundamental to the mission of the IB and a variety of initiatives and projects are helping to take it forward in Ecuador, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Spain, Philippines, Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea.

The United States has the largest number of IB programmes (2,010 out of 5,586) offered in both private and public schools.

The IB works with governments and non-governmental organizations across the world and has consultative status as a nongovernmental organization (NGO) at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and has collaborative relationships with the Council of Europe and the (OIF).

The IB governance is composed of an IB Board of Governors and six committees (access and advancement, audit, education, finance, human resources and governance). The Board of Governors appoints the Director General, sets the strategic direction of the organization, adopts a mission statement, makes policy, oversees the IB&#x27;s financial management, and ensures autonomy and integrity of the IB Diploma Programme examinations and other student assessments. The structure of its different committees is based on respect, representation and collaboration.

The Board of Governors can comprise between 15 and 25 members. Members are elected by the Board on the recommendation of the governance committee and from nominations presented by the Heads Council, Regional Councils and the Board. To encourage diversity of gender, culture and geography, there are only three ex officio positions: Director General (non-voting), the chair of the Examining Board and the chair of the Heads Council.

Advisory bodies include the Heads Council and Regional Councils.

==Reception==
 Some schools in the United States have eliminated the IBDP due to budgetary reasons and low student participation. In Utah, in 2008, funding for the IBDP was reduced from $300,000 to $100,000 after State Senator Margaret Dayton objected to the IB curriculum, stating, &quot;First, I have never espoused eliminating IB ... I don&#x27;t want to create &#x27;world citizens&#x27; nearly as much as I want to help cultivate American citizens who function well in the world.&quot; Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, meanwhile, believes that IB should be an option for students in Chicago Public Schools. Elizabeth Brackett, reporting on her own experience of studying the IB in Chicago, found that it made for a stressful school experience but subsequently eased the pressures of university study. A further report by the University of Chicago concluded that Chicago Public School students who completed the IB curriculum were 40% more likely to attend a four-year college, 50% more likely to attend a selective four-year college, and significantly more likely to persist in college than their matched peers outside the IB. The City of Miami Beach Commission entered into an education compact with Miami-Dade County Public Schools with one of the initiatives of the compact to implement the IB curriculum throughout Miami Beach feeder schools.

In some other parts of the world, the International Baccalaureate has been well received. In 2013, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and the IB announced a plan that will expand the opportunities for Japanese students to complete the IB curriculum in Japanese. In Malaysia, a project has been developed in response to interest expressed by the Malaysia Ministry of Education (MoE) in working with the IB to implement the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) in select secondary state schools. The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) signed an agreement with the IB to widen the options offered to parents and to meet the different needs of students in the United Arab Emirates. In April 2014, The King Faisal Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the IB signed a memorandum of understanding to develop IB programmes, including the IBDP, in up to forty primary and secondary schools, with the goal of intending to develop these schools as centres of excellence as IB World Schools. In Peru, President Ollanta Humala has committed to building a high-performing schools network (COAR) made up of IB World Schools. In early 2016 thirteen new schools were authorized by the IB as part of this programme. In Ecuador, President Rafael Correa has also committed to improving education in state schools by implementing IB programmes and by January 2016 there were over 200 state schools. With support from local organizations, there are thirteen state IB schools in Russia. In Spain, various models have been implemented (3 types of schools in Spain: public schools, private schools and state funded-private or &quot;concerted&quot; schools) and led to extensive growth with 140 schools.

Internationally, the IB continues to be recognized as innovative, and in 2014, the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) announced the IB Career-related Certificate as a finalist for their annual WISE Awards. However, the IB came under heavy criticism around the world in 2020 for controversial estimated grades, set when COVID-19 precautions obstructed examinations.

According to tertiary educational agency 7Acad, the diploma mean grade stands at a four-year low of 4.54 points,with total points at a five-year low of 28.51 pts as of 2019.

A study published by the University of Cambridge showed that a Cambridge student, who had obtained a score of 41 or more, achieved above-average success while at Cambridge. Students who had received 38 or less, were receiving grades below the average of all Cambridge students. Those that had an IB score of 38 or 39, obtained above-average grades in science, and below-average grades in social studies and humanities.

==Controversies==

===Marking guides plagiarism===
In October 2010, the IBO was accused of plagiarising some of its confidential examiner marking guides from Wikipedia.

===The Russian invasion of Ukraine===
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the International Baccalaureate Organization (IB) initially restricted its operations in Russia, halting new school authorizations. However, unlike many other international educational institutions, IB continued its activities in the country, allowing existing schools to operate under its curriculum. This decision has been criticized for contradicting global sanctions and ethical stances taken by other organizations.

===May 2020 examination results===

In March 2020, the IB announced that exams for the May 2020 session had been cancelled as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It claimed that the final grades would instead be calculated based on coursework, students&#x27; teacher-predicted grades, and historical school data. &quot;Prior to the attribution of final grades, this process was subjected to rigorous testing by educational statistical specialists to ensure our methods were robust. It was also checked against the last five years&#x27; sets of results data,&quot; an IB spokesman said. In July 2020, the IB released its results for the Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme candidates enrolled in the May 2020 session. Over 17,000 signatories signed an online petition calling for a clarification of the grading methodology, and free remarking and retesting. Several educators have criticized IB&#x27;s approach to the 2020 grading. The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation stated it would &quot;scrutinize&quot; the grades. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority asked the IB to provide data under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Some argued that using a school&#x27;s historical data to produce grades was unfair to black or low-income students, or students from smaller schools. Others complained about the lack of transparency and fair process of the grades&#x27; appeal process.

=== May 2021 examination session ===
In August 2020, amidst the continuing coronavirus pandemic, the IB announced a series of comprehensive amendments to its scheduled examinations in May 2021. They were inclusive of a few assessment components being discounted (for select subjects), and others being revised in length or syllabi. On 4 February 2021, the IB announced a dual exam route for the May 2021 examination: examinations were expected to take place in regions where a written assessment could be &quot;administered safely&quot;, while candidates in other regions follow a non-exam &quot;alternative route&quot; based on coursework and predicted grades. This decision was met with stiff backlash as students taking the IB Diploma Programme protested against perceived injustice. Students argued that exams would harm student mental health and well-being as well as possible consequences for university admissions. The IB&#x27;s dual system approach has also been criticized by exam boards such as Cambridge Assessment International Education, who canceled their IGCSE and international A-level exams.

===May 2024 examination leaks===

In late April/early May, select IB final exams were leaked to the subreddit r/pirateIB and other platforms. To date, there have been documents shared for Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, English, Chinese, German, Psychology, Digital Society, Geography, Business Management, Computer Science and Global Politics. Some online forums have been expressing student discontent, especially with concerns on unfair advantages in examinations, with claims of miscommunication from the IB. A statement from the IBO was published on 4 May, claiming that the organization had discovered a very small number of students engaged in &quot;time zone cheating&quot;, further claiming that the cheating was not widespread. South China Morning Post rebutted this claim, having discovered over 45,000 downloads of papers. Significant numbers of students have raised concerns about grade boundaries being inflated as a result of the leaks. One group dedicated to leaking papers has affirmed the concerns, by restricting the release of English Lang. Lit. leaks to &quot;protect the grade boundaries&quot;. 

Following the examination leaks, the IBO also experienced an alleged security breach in their IT Infrastructure, potentially exposing internal documents and further test papers. Upon inspecting data shared online by the unknown threat actor(s), vx-underground, a group dedicated to investigating malware and cybersecurity, confirmed on the morning of 6 May that the breach appeared to be legitimate. On 7 May, the IBO confirmed that some of their data from 2018 was breached, including employee names, positions, and emails. The organization also stated that no exam material has been compromised.

<text>Pont de Sèvres station () is a station of the Paris Métro on Line 9, serving as its western terminus. It is located near the Pont de Sèvres, which is a bridge on the Seine connecting to Sèvres.

== History ==

The station opened on 3 February 1934 with the extension from Porte de Saint-Cloud station. It was the first extension of the métro network beyond the limits of Paris. Hence, it is one of the first three stations to provide service to the inner suburbs of Paris (along with &quot;Billancourt&quot; and &quot;Marcel Sembat&quot;).

In 1943, during an Allied air raid aimed at destroying the Renault factories at Boulogne-Billancourt (on Seguin Island), the bombs missed their targets and caused 300 deaths, including 80 around the station, partially destroying it.

In 2017, construction started on line 15&#x27;s station and is expected to open in 2026 as part of the Grand Paris Express project and is currently projected to open in late 2026 as of August 2021. The underground station will be located on the bank of the Seine.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,048,247 passengers, making it the 79th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,651,763 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 69th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,430,203 passengers, making it the 83rd busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 3 accesses:

* Access 1: Forum Pont de Sèvres &quot;Île Seguin&quot;
* Access 2: quai Alphonse Gallo &quot;Sous-Préfecture des Hauts-de-Seine&quot;
* Access 3: rue de Bellevue

=== Platforms ===
The station has a particular arrangement specific to the stations serving or had served as a terminus. It has three tracks and two platforms. The side platform serves as the arrival platform while the island platform serves as the departure platform. However, during off-peak hours, arriving trains may be directed to the island platform where the passengers can then get off. A luminous display on the platform indicates the side of the platform the next train will depart from.

=== Other connections ===
Since 2 July 1997, the station has been served by tramway T2 via the nearby &quot;Musée de Sèvres&quot; tram station on the Seine&#x27;s left bank.

<text>Billancourt () is a station of the Paris Métro, located in the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt. It is named after the nearby rue de Billancourt, which was in turn named after the former village of Billancourt which was annexed in 1859 into the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt.

== History ==
The station opened on 3 February 1934 with the extension of the line from Porte de Saint-Cloud to Pont de Sèvres, which was the first extension of the métro network beyond the limits of Paris. Hence, it is one of the first three stations to provide service to the inner suburbs of Paris (along with &quot;Marcel Sembat&quot; and &quot;Pont de Sèvres&quot;).

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors was renovated and modernised on 26 July 2001.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,099,341 passengers, making it the 164th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,525,990 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 173rd busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,967,532 passengers, making it the 180th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 4 accesses divided into 5 access points on either side of the avenue du Général-Leclerc.

* Access 1: rue de la Ferme
* Access 2: rue de Billancourt
* Access 3: rue Castéjà
* Access 4: rue de Silly

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with two tracks surrounded by two 105-metre-long platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two yellow light canopies, benches and aisle outlets treated in flat yellow tiles as well as &quot;Motte&quot; seats in the same colour. These fittings are combined with the bevelled white ceramic tiles that cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware and the name of the station is also made of earthenware in the style of the original CMP.

It is one of the few stations to still present the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in its entirety, if we exclude the tunnel exits (whose treatment with flat coloured tiles was not systematic).

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by line 389 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N12 and N61 bus of the Noctilien network.

<text>Jasmin () is a station on Line 9 of the Paris Métro. It serves Rue Jasmin in the 16th arrondissement. The station was first used with the opening of the first section of the line from Trocadéro to Exelmans.

==History==
The station was opened on 8 November 1922. It is named after the French poet Jacques Jasmin (born Jacques Boé; 1798–1864), called the wig-maker poet, whose works in Langue d’oc were the precursor of the &quot;Félibrige&quot;, the literary movement of Provençal.

Rue Jasmin is a section of the old Rue de la Cure. This was a reference to the medical cures claimed for the mineral springs of the former vineyards of the surrounding suburb of Auteuil.

As part of RATP&#x27;s metro renewal programme, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated by 28 June 2005.

On March 20, 2018, half of the name plates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP to celebrate the arrival of spring, as in five other stations. Taking up the surname of Jasmin in capital letters, the new plates are decorated with motifs representing white jasmine.

In 2019, 1,935,764 passengers entered this station, which placed it in the 249th place of metro stations for its attendance out of 302. In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 1,017,366 passengers entered this station, which placed it in the 239th position of metro stations for its attendance. In 2021, attendance gradually increased, with 1,418,238 passengers entering this station which placed it in the 243rd position of metro stations for its attendance out of 304.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two accesses, each consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a Dervaux type balustrade:
* access 1 - &quot;Rue Jasmin&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a Val d&#x27;Osne style candelabra, leading to the right of No. 78 Avenue Mozart, at the corner with Rue de l&#x27;Yvette facing No. 2 of the latter;
* access 2 - &quot;Rue Ribera&quot;, consisting of an escalator allowing only an exit, located to the right of no. 85 avenue Mozart, at the corner of Rue Ribera facing no. 47 thereof.

The old switch-room in the station was established in the form of a mezzanine overlooking the tracks, a rare situation that it shares only with the following two metro stations in the direction of Mairie de Montreuil, Ranelagh and La Muette. Thus, the platforms are visible from the old-switch room and the information counters. The latter was one of the few style of the 1970s to survive until the 2010s.

===Station layout===

===Platform===
Jasmin is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for the majority of metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the 2000s metro revival, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the straight walls, vault, tunnel exits and corridor outlets. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware and the name of the station is also in earthenware in the style of the original CMP. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are red. The decoration of the platforms is completely identical to that of the nearby metro station, &quot;Ranelagh&quot;.

A cultural poster on the poet Jasmin is affixed on the platform in the direction of Mairie de Montreuil.
===Bus connections===
The station has only one connection with line 22 of the RATP Bus Network, in the direction of Opéra only.

<text>Equisetales is an order of subclass Equisetidae with only one living family, Equisetaceae, containing the genus &quot;Equisetum&quot; (horsetails), as well as a variety of extinct groups, including the tree-like Calamitaceae.

==Classification==
In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, Equisetales, in its present circumscription, was held to be the sole member of class Equisetopsida. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, made it the sole member of subclass Equisetidae, equivalent to Smith&#x27;s Equisetopsida. The placement of Equisetales in subclass Equisetidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016).

The fossil record includes additional extinct species in Equisetaceae and the extinct families Calamitaceae, Archaeocalamitaceae and Phyllothecaceae.

<text>Ranelagh () is a station on line 9 of the Paris Métro located in the 16th arrondissement. 

It is named after the nearby &quot;rue de Ranelagh&quot;, which in turn was named after Lord Ranelagh, an Irish peer and amateur musician, who built a rotunda for concerts in his park, Ranelagh Gardens, in Chelsea in 1750 and after whom the affluent Dublin suburb of Ranelagh is named. A similar establishment, the Jardin du Ranelagh was established on the grounds of the Château de la Muette in 1774. The place was fashionable under Marie Antoinette, under the Directory and then again under the Restoration. It disappeared in 1858 with the creation of the Bois de Boulogne.

== History ==
The station opened on 8 November 1922 as part of the initial section of the line from Trocadéro to Exelmans.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 28 April 2004.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,314,539 passengers, making it the 222nd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,234,203 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 206th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,779,206 passengers, making it the 199th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has two accesses:

* Access 1: avenue Mozart
* Access 2: rue du Ranelagh

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with two tracks surrounded by two platforms separated by the subway tracks, and the vault is elliptical. The ticket barriers and passenger information counter located at the mezzanine overlooks the tracks, an uncommon situation it shares only with La Muette and Jasmin, which the station is located in between.

The decoration is in the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware with vegetable motifs and the name of the station is also in earthenware in the interwar style of the original CMP. The seats are in the &quot;Motte&quot; style in red.

The decoration of the platforms is thus identical to that of the neighbouring station, Jasmin.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 22, 52 (only in the direction of &quot;Opéra&quot;), and 70 of the RATP bus network.

<text>La Muette () is a station on line 9 of the Paris Métro, in France, named after the &quot;Chaussée de la Muette&quot;, a nearby street. The station opened on 8 November 1922 with the opening of the first section of the line from Trocadéro to Exelmans.

==History==
The &quot;Chaussée de la Muette&quot; is named after the Château de la Muette, which was converted from a hunting lodge to a small castle for Margaret of Valois, the first wife of King Henry IV of France. The meaning of the name of the hunting lodge is not known. It may have derived from &quot;muete&quot;, a spelling which appears frequently up to the end of the eighteenth century, and which signifies a pack of deer-hounds (meute); it may have come from the &quot;mues&quot; or horns which stags shed in the autumn; or again from the &quot;mue&quot; or moulting-period of hunting hawks. The old château was demolished in the 1920s to make room for a wealthy housing estate. A new château was built nearby for Baron Henri James de Rothschild (1872–1947) in 1922. This is now the headquarters for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances:
* access 1 - &quot;Chaussée de la Muette&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a Val d&#x27;Osne candelabra, leading to the corner formed by Avenue Mozart and Chaussée de la Muette;
* access 2 - &quot;Avenue Mozart&quot;, consisting of an escalator going up only allowing only an exit, located to the right of no. 5 of the avenue.

The ticket room in the station is in the form of a mezzanine overlooking the tracks, a rare situation that it shares with the two previous stations in the direction towards Mairie de Montreuil (Ranelagh and Jasmin). Thus, the platforms are visible from the room and the information desk.
=== Station layout ===

===Platforms===
La Muette is a standard station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks. Established at ground level, the ceiling is made up of a metal deck, whose silver-coloured beams are supported by vertical walls. White bevelled ceramic tiles cover the walls, the tunnel exits and the shaft staircase surrounds giving access to the RER. The metal advertising frames are inclined, and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The green seats are in the &quot;Akiko&quot; style. The lighting is partly indirect, projected on the walls, the advertising, and the vaults above the platforms.

The decoration is like that of the École Militaire station on line 8 and Charles Michels station on line 10, also built with a metal roof, bodied in the 1960s and completely renovated at the end of the 2000s.

===Other connections===
The station is connected to the Boulainvilliers station on the RER C line, accessible via an underground corridor.

In addition, it is served by lines 22, 32, 52 and 70 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by line N53 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="504570" wikidata="Q582111" url="?curid=504570" title="Jaguar S-Type (1999)">
<text>The Jaguar S-Type is an executive car that debuted at the 1998 Birmingham Motor Show and was marketed by Jaguar for model years 1999–2007, reviving the nameplate of the company&#x27;s 1963–1968 S-Type as a four-door notchback saloon. The S-Type received a mild facelift for the 2002 model year and again in 2004. The S-Type was discontinued in late 2007 and replaced by the XF.

==Overview==
After being privatised in 1984, Jaguar had been developing a smaller saloon to complement the XJ6 by the early 1990s, but these plans were axed following its takeover by Ford in 1989, only to resurface within a few years. 
The S-Type was produced at Jaguar&#x27;s Castle Bromwich facility in Birmingham, England. The car was styled by Geoff Lawson in 1995 and is based on the Jaguar DEW platform/Ford DEW platform, shared with the Lincoln LS and Ford Thunderbird. It was unveiled at the Birmingham International Motor Show on 20 October 1998.

The first S-Types (&quot;X200&quot; 1999–2002) are distinguished by a U-shaped centre console and optional touchscreen navigation system in the 2003 and later models. The traditional leaping jaguar bonnet mascot was optional and is approved by the US and EU standards and breaks away in the case of an accident. Subsequent models (&quot;X202&quot;, &quot;X204&quot;, &quot;X206&quot;; the last digit denoting the model year) have the Jaguar logo incorporated within the radiator grille and a more traditional &#x27;looped&#x27; styling for the centre console. In Australia, the &quot;leaper&quot; bonnet mascot did not become available until 2004.

The supercharged &quot;S-Type R&quot; (Jaguar STR for short) joined the lineup in 2002, and the hope was that it would compete with BMW&#x27;s M5 and the Mercedes E55 AMG. The &quot;R&quot; was powered by the newly revised hand-built 4.2-Litre V8 with an Eaton M112 supercharger, producing and could accelerate from 0 to in 5.3 seconds (0 to in 5.6 s). The top speed was limited to 155 mph. It included 18-inch (457-millimetre) alloy wheels, wire-mesh grille, and monochromatic paint. The &quot;R&quot; also has a rear apron, side-skirts, and front apron with built-in fog-lamps, a rear spoiler, a brace located near the rear subframe, and &quot;R&quot; badging on the boot lid and both front fenders (wings).

The Jaguar S-Type R is able to produce an extra 20 bhp with a modified pulley.

Also added on the 2003 model was an electronic parking-brake paddle-switch that replaced the conventional manually operated lever for the rear brakes. For the 2003 model year, the Jaguar S-type was given a six-speed, automatic ZF 6HP26 transmission as well as a revised 3.0-litre V6 engine with (US spec) versus for the 1999 to 2002 models. The 2003 model featured a revised dash, centre console, and a grille with the Jaguar badge to give the vehicle a more Jaguar-like appearance, and a flip-open key was devised for the ignition.
A minor facelift on the 2004 model year featured redesigned front and rear aprons, a slightly modified grille, remodelled rear light clusters, an aluminium bonnet, and a new 2.7-litre V6 diesel engine with . The windscreen washer jets were incorporated into the windscreen wiper arms. There were no changes made to the cabin interior. 2006 to 2007 models featured no fog lights.
There were 291,386 S-Types produced during its production run of 1999 to 2007.

==Powertrain==
The S-Type was powered by a variety of petrol and diesel engines. At launch, the V8 S-Type was powered by the 4.0L Jaguar AJ-V8 engine, the capacity of which was increased to 4.2L for the 2003 model year. Variants of this engine are used in Ford, Lincoln, Land Rover/Range Rover and Aston Martin models. The V6 petrol engines used were originally conceived by Porsche for use in a replacement 944, before being picked up by Ford to be developed into the Ford Duratec unit which is used extensively throughout the Ford model range (and in Ford subsidiary companies). With the Jaguar 3.0L version benefitting from Jaguar designed heads, variable valve timing and an additional 30bhp over the original Ford Duratec. The 2.5 L V6 engine was not available for vehicles exported to the United States and Canada. Diesel engines are the Ford/Peugeot 2.7L HDi Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17 which is used in a number of Ford, Peugeot, Citroën, Jaguar and Land Rover models.

From model years 1999 to 2002, the rear-wheel-drive S-Type was equipped with either a five-speed manual or a five-speed &quot;J-Gate&quot; Ford 5R55N transmission. From 2003, the S-Type was produced with either a 5-speed manual transmission (Getrag 221) or a six-speed &quot;J-Gate&quot; ( ZF 6HP26 transmission) that allows automatic manual gear selection. The 2004 diesel saw the introduction of a 6-speed manual transmission; it was also available with the six-speed &quot;J-Gate&quot; automatic transmission.

===Specifications===
==Safety==
==Reception==

The car was praised on its release for its interior and ride. In particular, the 2.7 V6 twin-turbodiesel engine was described as &#x27;a paragon of refinement, quietness, and fuel economy&#x27; by the European automotive press, with enough &#x27;refinement and performance to wean anyone off petrol power&#x27;. The supercharged &#x27;R&#x27; version was also praised for its speed and for &#x27;proper rear-drive Jag&#x27; handling, however the lack of a limited-slip differential was criticised, along with whine from the Eaton supercharger. The car, particularly the 3.0 Sport manual, was described by the Honest John website, as the spiritual successor to the Jaguar Mark 2.

<text>Rue de la Pompe () is a station on line 9 of the Paris Métro, named after the Rue de la Pompe. The station opened on 8 November 1922 with the opening of the first section of the line from Trocadéro to Exelmans.

This Passy street is mentioned in the archives of 1730 as a way of skirting the walls of the &quot;Château de la Muette&quot;. It led to one of the gates in the wall surrounding the Bois de Boulogne. It was called the old path, but was transformed at the end of the 18th century into a street and was named after the pump (French: pompe) that supplied water to the Château de la Muette.

Nearby are the Lycée Janson de Sailly (a prestigious high school) and the town hall of the 16th arrondissement.

<text>Fanplex was an entertainment center in Atlanta, Georgia, adjacent to Turner Field. It opened in 2002 and was shut down in early 2004 after losing $500,000, above and beyond an initial investment of $2.5 million.

The attraction was meant to lure fans of the Atlanta Braves with miniature golf and video games, and to pump economic activity into the depressed area around the stadium. However, Fanplex saw little business, even on game days, perhaps since it was actually located far away from most game-day foot traffic. An initial staff of 16 was pared down to one and operating hours were scaled back as patrons continued not to show up.

Critics say Fanplex was largely built to justify the existence of the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority, which was originally created to manage Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium and The Omni Coliseum, both of which no longer exist, along with Zoo Atlanta.

An October 2, 2006 article in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; says that the authority has put the facility up for sale twice, but cannot find a buyer at the $2.7 million price it has sought. The miniature golf course is now overgrown and nearby residents complain that the facility has become another vacant parking lot. With seemingly few commercial prospects for the current facility, Atlanta leaders quoted by the paper speculate Fanplex may ultimately be swept up in large-scale redevelopment of areas around the stadium.

Starting November 2013, the Fanplex is home to the &quot;A&quot; team of Archer Western Contractors who is currently constructing a 5 million gallon underground storage tank in the media lot across Hank Aaron Drive.

<text>Iéna () is a station on Line 9 of the Paris Métro, named after the Avenue d&#x27;Iéna. The station opened on 27 May 1923 with the extension of the line from Trocadéro to Saint-Augustin. &quot;Iéna&quot; is the French name of Jena where the Napoleon&#x27;s army defeated Prussia in 1806 at the Battle of Jena. It is the nearest station to the Guimet Museum (Asian art) and the Palais de Tokyo (contemporary art museum), as well as the Embassy of Mexico, the International Chamber of Commerce, and the Pont d&#x27;Iéna (&quot;Jena Bridge&quot;).

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances made up of fixed stairs, which have an original balustrade, matching the railings of the Musée national des Arts asiatiques - Guimet located north of the Place d&#x27;Iéna :
* Access 1 - &quot;Avenue du Président-Wilson - Musée d&#x27;Art moderne; Palais de Tokyo&quot;, adorned with a Dervaux candelabra, leading to the south-east of the Place d&#x27;Iéna, on the odd numbered side of the latter and the Avenue du Président-Wilson;
* Access 2 - &quot;Rue Boissière - Musée Guimet&quot;, embellished with a Val d&#x27;Osne totem, one of the few in the Paris metro to be slightly curved due to its location, adjacent to the museum;
* Access 3 - &quot;Avenue d&#x27;Iéna - Palais d&#x27;Iéna&quot;, also equipped with a Dervaux-type mast, located to the south of the square, to the right of no. 7 Avenue d&#x27;Iéna.
=== Station layout ===

===Platforms===
Jena is a standard station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; renovations of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the right legs, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware, and the name of the station is also made of earthenware in the style of the original CMP. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are red in colour.

<doc id="504580" wikidata="Q3144969" url="?curid=504580" title="Silent Service II">
<text>Silent Service II is a submarine simulation game developed and published by MicroProse for MS-DOS in 1990 and for the Amiga in 1991. It is a sequel to 1985&#x27;s &quot;Silent Service&quot;, also set in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Silent Service II&quot; allows the player to choose either single scenarios (training, a single historical battle, or a single random encounter war patrol) or an extended war career. In the career mode, the player undertakes a number of consecutive patrols in the submarine, meeting other ships or convoys in unscripted encounters generated by the game. The player is able to select a home port and a patrol area on a map of the Pacific Ocean, and time acceleration allowed the submarine to move quickly to the chosen area. The length of each patrol is limited by the submarine&#x27;s available fuel, but a typical war career can still take several hours of play time to complete. Common encounters involve the detection of a merchant ship or convoy, with the player determining whether and how to attack. On other occasions the player may face sudden detection by warships and be forced to act quickly to escape.

Several different viewpoints are available, including the bridge, the periscope (usable either submerged or surfaced), the navigation area with the map, and internal status displays. Other ships are displayed as sprites in the bridge or periscope views. The MS-DOS version of the game uses up to 256 colors.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised &quot;Silent Service II&quot;, citing its excellent graphics, &quot;amazing&quot; sound card audio, and seven accurate submarine types. It concluded that the game &quot;teaches historical lessons worthy of a graduate seminar in modern American history&quot; while exciting as &quot;a mammoth roller-coaster&quot;. 1991 and 1993 surveys of strategy and war games in that magazine gave it four and a half stars out of five.

<doc id="504583" wikidata="Q1667131" url="?curid=504583" title="Maggie Gallagher">
<text>Margaret Gallagher (born September 14, 1960) is an American writer, socially conservative commentator, and activist. She wrote a syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate from 1995 to 2013 and has written several books. Gallagher founded the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, a small, socially conservative think tank. She is also a co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), an advocacy group which opposes same-sex marriage and other legal recognition of same-sex partnerships; she has served as president and as chairman of the board of NOM.

== Biography ==
Maggie Gallagher was born on September 14, 1960, to William Walter Gallagher Sr. and the former Darrilyn Doris Stenz. She is originally from Lake Oswego, Oregon, where she attended Lakeridge High School. She has three siblings: Kathleen, William Jr., and Colleen. Her parents were initially active in their local Catholic parish, but her mother left the Catholic Church when Gallagher was eight years of age. As a young person, Gallagher was influenced by the works of Ayn Rand and Robert A. Heinlein.

In 1982, Gallagher earned a B.A. in religious studies from Yale University, where she belonged to the Party of the Right in the Yale Political Union. Shortly before she was due to graduate, Gallagher became pregnant after a relationship with a fellow party member. She gave birth to a son out of wedlock. She initially planned to put the baby up for adoption, but then changed her mind. Neither of the parents thought they should marry. According to Gallagher, her son&#x27;s father eventually abandoned her and became uninterested in their child.

In her twenties, Gallagher reverted to Catholicism because her experience as a single mother made her consider the necessity of fathers and the link of sex to procreation. Gallagher married Raman Srivastav, a Hindu, in 1993. They have one son together.

Gallagher attended the premiere reading of &quot;8&quot;, Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play about the trial surrounding California&#x27;s Proposition 8, where a depiction of her was performed by Jayne Houdyshell. She expressed the opinion that most people would find the work &quot;kind of dull&quot;.

==Career==
Early in her career, Gallagher wrote for &quot;National Review&quot;. She later worked at the &quot;City Journal&quot;, a public policy magazine and website. In 1995, she began writing a nationally syndicated column. Gallagher joined the Institute for American Values (IAV) in 1996. She later left IAV and founded the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, a conservative think tank whose slogan is &quot;strengthening marriage for a new generation.&quot; As of May 2011, Gallagher was president of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy. Gallagher also co-founded the National Organization for Marriage (NOM). She was President of NOM from its founding until 2010, and she remained on the organization&#x27;s board until August 2011. In 2013, the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; described Gallagher as a &quot;leading gay marriage opponent&quot;.

In 2011, Gallagher founded the Culture War Victory Fund and served as the fund&#x27;s director.

On January 2, 2013, she announced the retirement of her syndicated column, then distributed by Universal Uclick.

Gallagher later worked for the American Principles Project. In 2017, she was hired at the Benedict XVI Institute for Sacred Music and Divine Worship. She has authored several books.

==Views==
Gallagher is a Roman Catholic and a social conservative. She is a signatory of the Manhattan Declaration, a November 2009 ecumenical statement calling on Orthodox, Catholic, and Evangelical Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters against their religious consciences.

===Views on abortion===
Gallagher opposes abortion and believes that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; should be overturned. She believes that most people who support legal abortion do so reluctantly because they think it is a necessary evil. &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overturned in 2022.

===Views on assisted suicide===
Gallagher is opposed to the legalization of assisted suicide such as the Death with Dignity Act or voluntary euthanasia. Gallagher believes that state-approved suicide diminishes the value of life, especially for the elderly, sick, or vulnerable.

===Views on marriage and same-sex relationships===
Gallagher is a strong opponent of the legal recognition of same-sex unions and has written books toward that end. Gallagher holds that one of the purposes of marriage is always procreation and rearing children exclusively by heterosexual parents, and argues that same-sex unions diminish the value of heterosexual marriages. Gallagher has compared winning the fight to ban same-sex marriage with the fall of communism and believes that if same-sex marriage is made legal, it will mean &quot;losing American civilization.&quot;

Gallagher advocates litigation against spouses who commit adultery and opposes laws which facilitate no-fault divorce.

Gallagher has written that &quot;[w]e need a social institution, endowed with public authority, that teaches young men and women [...] that they need to come together in love to raise the children their bodies make together. If this is a core purpose of marriage, then same-sex unions are not marriages. If gay unions are marriages, then this is no longer what marriage is about.&quot; Further, Gallagher has written that same-sex marriage is &quot;rooted in a false equation: Loving a man is not the same as loving a woman; a sexual union that can give rise to children is fundamentally different in kind than a union not so freighted, for good and for ill, with the fact of procreativity.&quot;

In October 2006, Gallagher suggested that gay rights groups stop promoting same-sex marriage and start vigorously advocating for civil unions. In 2010, she expressed her support for certain kinds of civil unions for same-sex couples but not available for opposite-sex couples. However, in 2012, she supported North Carolina&#x27;s Amendment 1, a state constitutional amendment that banned recognition of both same-sex marriages and civil unions.

Gallagher believes that many people in the LGBT community, specifically gay men, choose to oppose what they label as the &quot;heteronormative&quot; constraints of a monogamous relationship, with reference to Eric Erbelding&#x27;s assertion that the married gay couples he knows are &quot;for the most part monogamous, but for maybe a casual three-way&quot;.

Gallagher has asserted that same-sex marriage is worse than polygamy, which &quot;for all its ugly defects, is an attempt to secure stable mother-father families for children.&quot; She has also written that &quot;once the principle [of same-sex marriage] is in the law, the next step will be to use the law to stigmatize, marginalize, and repress those who disagree with the government’s new views on marriage and sexual orientation.&quot; As an example, she has cited efforts by LGBT advocates to revoke the tax-exempt status of churches that oppose same-sex marriage.

On April 8, 2009, Gallagher appeared on the NBC television show &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; to debate the issue of same-sex marriage. During that appearance, Gallagher said, &quot;Marriage is the only institution we have that‘s about bringing together the two great halves of humanity, male and female, so that children can know and be known by and love and be loved by their own mother and father.&quot;

Gallagher has stated that she will not attend a same-sex wedding if she is ever invited to one.

===Views on sexuality and sex education===
Gallagher believes that teaching abstinence (encouraging celibacy until legally married) should be the sole curriculum. She does not believe in instructing students in birth control or how to prevent STDs through use of condoms or safe-sex techniques and has advocated discontinuing all safer-sex education in public schools.

Gallagher has stated that &quot;[s]exual orientation is almost certainly unchosen&quot;, but that the decision to act on that desire and to incorporate it into one’s identity is a choice that bears moral reflection. She believes that &quot;sexual desire is not its own justification&quot; for acceptance or legal recognition of same-sex relationships.

On a February 2012 edition of &quot;Up with Chris Hayes&quot; on which Gallagher appeared for a segment on the revival of the &quot;culture wars&quot;, Gallagher was asked by &quot;The Nation&quot; editor Richard Kim about her support of gay reparative therapy. Gallagher denied having ever supported ex-gay therapy and claimed that Kim was &quot;making stuff up&quot;. Kim subsequently quoted from a 2001 column written by Gallagher praising Robert Spitzer for his research on the possibilities of ex-gay therapy and calling on then-President George W. Bush to support federal funding for research into ex-gay therapy. In 2013, after blogging her support for Chuck Limandri&#x27;s representation of JONAH (a Jewish organization that offered support to persons with unwanted same-sex attraction), Gallagher made the following comments regarding conversion therapy:
===Views on single parenting===
When Dan Quayle criticized the fictional television character Murphy Brown for being an unwed mother, Gallagher wrote an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;An Unwed Mother for Quayle&quot;, in his defense.

===Views on the 2012 presidential election===
Gallagher&#x27;s endorsement of candidate Rick Santorum in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries was promoted by the Santorum campaign.

==Federal contracts==
Gallagher received tens of thousands of dollars from the Department of Health and Human Services during 2002 and 2003 for helping the George W. Bush administration promote the President&#x27;s Healthy Marriage Initiative. Gallagher testified before Congress in favor of &quot;healthy marriage&quot; programs but never disclosed the payments. When asked about that situation, she replied, &quot;Did I violate journalistic ethics by not disclosing it? I don&#x27;t know. You tell me…frankly, it never occurred to me.&quot;

After &quot;The Washington Post&quot; revealed this information on January 26, 2005, Gallagher claimed significant differences between her situation and that of conservative columnist Armstrong Williams. She went on to add, &quot;I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it. My apologies to my readers.&quot;

Gallagher received an additional $20,000 from the Bush administration for writing a report, titled &quot;Can Government Strengthen Marriage?&quot;, for the National Fatherhood Initiative, a private organization.

<text>Saint-Philippe du Roule () is a station on line 9 of the Paris Métro. The station opened on 27 May 1923 with the extension of the line from Trocadéro to Saint-Augustin. The village of Roule, which became a suburb in 1722, was a small locality called &quot;Romiliacum&quot; by Frédégaire, &quot;Crioilum&quot; by Saint Eligius, then &quot;Rolus&quot; in the 12th century.

===Access===
The station has two entrances divided into three metro entrances on Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt:
* Access 1 - &quot;Rue La Boétie&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase embellished with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, leading to the right of no. 30 of the avenue;
* Access 2 - &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue&quot;, consisting of a fixed stairway entrance also equipped with a yellow &quot;M&quot; mast and an exit by an ascending escalator, located back-to-back facing No. 69.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Saint-Philippe-du-Roule is a standard station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two orange light canopies, benches, tunnel exits, and corridor openings treated with flat orange tiles as well as &quot;Motte&quot; seats in the same colour. These fittings are combined with the bevelled white ceramic tiles covering the walls and vault. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware and the name of the station is also made of earthenware, in the style of the original CMP. It is one of the few stations that still features the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in its entirety.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 28, 32, 52, 80 and 93 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Nearby==
North of the station is the fashionable street of Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré and the church of Saint-Philippe du Roule. A chapel was established in the district of Bas-Roule, near a leprosarium. It was replaced by a more important church, which was built by Jean Chalgrin between 1774 and 1784. The church of Saint-Philippe du Roule was built in the style of a Greco-Roman basilica. It was enlarged by Godde in 1845 and Victor Baltard in 1860. Its pediment, representing &quot;Religion&quot; and its attributes, is by François-Joseph Duret.

<text>Miromesnil () is a station on Line 9 and Line 13 of the Paris Métro in the 8th arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located near the intersection of Rue de Miromesnil and Rue La Boétie, the platforms being situated:

* on line 9, under Rue La Boétie between Rue de Miromesnil and the junction of Avenue Percier and Avenue Delcassé;
* on line 13, below the stopping point of line 9, along the north-south axis of the same &quot;Avenues&quot;.

==History==
The station opened on 27 May 1923 with the extension of line 9 from Trocadéro to Saint-Augustin. The line 13 platforms opened on 27 June 1973 with the extension of the line from Saint-Lazare. It was the southern terminus of line 13 until its extension to Champs-Élysées – Clemenceau on 18 February 1975. The station is named after the street of &quot;Rue de Miromesnil&quot;, which is named after Armand Thomas Hue de Miromesnil (1723–1796), who was Keeper of the Seals, deputy to the &quot;Chancellor of France&quot; (Minister of Justice) from 1774 to 1787. He abolished the use of torture during the interrogation of the accused.

On April 27, 1973, the line 13 station was opened in turn following its extension from Saint-Lazare, which was the first of the three phases of the extension of the former line B of the Nord-Sud Company underground electric railway (known as North-South), in a southerly direction. Miromesnil was its southern terminus until 18 February 18, 1975, when it was extended by a station at Champs-Élysées - Clemenceau before being merged the following year with the old line 14 of the &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris&quot; (known as CMP), which had the Invalides metro station as its northern terminus.

The line 13 station is the first in a series of twelve on this line to be equipped with platform doors in order to reduce the risk of passengers falling on the tracks, which is amplified at peak times. The work took place in April 2010 for the preparation of the platforms, then in July of the same year, the installation itself.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 2,618,473 passengers entered this station, which places it in the 74th position of metro stations for its use.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has four metro entrances:
* entrance 1: &quot;Avenue Percier&quot; (odd-numbered side): a curved staircase, a rare feature on the network leading to the corner of Avenue Percier and Rue La Boétie;
* entrance 2: &quot;Avenue Delcassé&quot; (odd numbered side): a staircase also curved, located at the corner formed by Avenue Delcassé and Rue La Boétie, decorated with a mat with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle;
* entrance 3: &quot;Rue La Boétie&quot; (odd-numbered side): two back-to-back staircases on the south sidewalk west of the junction with Rue de Miromesnil, the closest to the latter having a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle;
* entrance 4: &quot;Rue La Boétie&quot; (even numbered side): a kiosk established within the building at no. 13, Rue de Miromesnil, which forms the corner with Rue La Boétie; in addition to this rare feature in Paris, it has two unique signals with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. There are two per stopping point, separated by the metro tracks located in the centre. On line 13, the station has vertical upright walls and a horizontal ceiling. On line 9, the station has an ovoid-shaped vault, except at its western end where the walls are vertical and the ceiling is horizontal supported by pillars. This part corresponds to the extension fitted out during the reorganization in 1973, where two large rooms were created to allow a connection with the platforms of line 13.

Lighting is provided by two red canopies suspended on the two lines; small cream-colored ceramic tiles placed vertically cover the walls as well as the tunnel entrances. The vault of line 9 is painted white and the western ceiling treated in off-white, while that of line 13, in concrete, is covered with black fire-flocking. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is inscribed in capital letters on protruding plaques. The seats are &quot;Motte&quot; style in blue. The platforms of line 13 are equipped with platform screen doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 28, 32, 52, 80 and 93 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N01, N02 and N53 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="504591" wikidata="Q1322733" url="?curid=504591" title="Ruger Mini-14">
<text>The Mini-14 is a lightweight semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. Introduced in 1973, the design was outwardly based on the M14 rifle and is, in appearance, a scaled-down version chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, though with its own gas system design.

Since 1973, Ruger has introduced several variants, including variants chambered in both .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO, the Ranch Rifle with a civilian style rear aperture sight and integral scope ring mounts on the receiver, the Mini-14 GB with a bayonet lug and flash suppressor, variants with folding stocks, stainless steel versions of the most popular variants, a target version featuring a heavyweight barrel and barrel tuner, the Mini Thirty, which is chambered for 7.62×39mm, as well as variants chambered in 6.8mm Remington SPC and .300 AAC Blackout. The rifle is currently used by military personnel, law enforcement and corrections personnel, and civilians in the United States and around the world.
==History and design==
Introduced in 1973 by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., the Mini-14 resembles a smaller version of the military M14 rifle. Designed by L. James Sullivan and William B. Ruger, it incorporated numerous innovations and cost-saving engineering changes. The Mini-14 rifle has an investment-cast, heat-treated receiver and is mechanically similar to the M1 rifle in the receiver area, but with a self-cleaning, fixed-piston gas system.

Initial rifles were produced with a complex, exposed-bolt hold-open device with no button for manual engagement. Stocks were somewhat angular, and heat shields were made of wood. These rifles, with serial number prefixes before 181, were tooled and redesigned with a new stock, new bolt hold-open mechanism, and other small changes.

The original Mini-14 rifle had a rear aperture sight with large protective wings and no integral scope bases. In 1982, Ruger introduced the Ranch Rifle with an integral scope base on the receiver, a new folding-aperture rear sight, and factory scope rings. 

In 1987, Ruger introduced the Mini Thirty rifle chambered for the Russian 7.62×39mm cartridge. At the time, large quantities of surplus military ammunition were being imported into the United States at rock-bottom prices. Also, the 7.62×39mm is ballistically similar to the .30-30 Winchester cartridge. As a result, the Mini Thirty proved to be an effective deer rifle.

In 2003, the design was overhauled to improve accuracy, update the styling, and reduce production costs. The standard Mini-14 was discontinued and the name became the family name for all Mini-14-type rifles. As of 2005, all Mini-14-type rifles are based on the Ranch Rifle design, with integral scope bases, a nonfolding ghost ring aperture rear sight, and a winged front sight similar to that used on the Ruger police carbine. They have serial numbers beginning with 580 and are sometimes referred to as 580-series Ranch Rifles. They also have a new modified gas system designed to reduce barrel vibration and can shoot two-inch groups at 100 yards, which is 2 minute of angle (MOA) accuracy.

Around 2007 or 2008, Ruger added a heavier, larger-diameter barrel visibly tapered from gas block to muzzle. These changes combined with tighter tolerances result in greater potential accuracy.

All Mini-14-type rifles are available in stainless steel or blued finish with hardwood, synthetic, or laminated stocks with or barrels.

==Variants==
===Ranch Rifle===
The Ranch Rifle is a basic model offered in a wood or synthetic rifle stock paired with a blued or stainless steel receiver and a standard 18.5&quot; tapered barrel (1:9&quot; RH twist rate). These rifles feature an adjustable ghost ring rear sight and winged front sight, and they are sold with a detachable Picatinny scope rail mount and a choice of two 20-round or 5-round detachable box magazines to comply with some U.S. states and other countries, which have laws restricting magazine capacity. All models are chambered in both .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition except the Target Rifle variant (which is .223 only).

==== Target Rifle ====
In 2007, the &quot;Target Rifle&quot; version was introduced with a cold hammer-forged heavy barrel, adjustable harmonic tuner with adjustable MOA accuracy, and either a laminated wood or Hogue overmolded synthetic stock. The Target Rifle does not have iron sights but includes the standard scope rings and Picatinny rail mount. It is designed for use with the .223 Remington round only; 5.56 NATO is not warranted by Ruger.

====Tactical Rifle====

Introduced in 2009, the &quot;Tactical Rifle&quot; is the newest variant, which includes the shorter 16.12&quot; barrel with flash suppressor, and is available with a standard fixed stock/fore end, or a collapsible ATI-brand stock with Picatinny rails. This model is chambered in both .223 Remington/5.56×45mm NATO and .300 AAC Blackout as of 2015.

===Mini Thirty===

In 1987, Ruger began production of the Mini Thirty, which is chambered for the Russian 7.62×39mm cartridge, used in the SKS and AK-47, as many states prohibit hunting of deer with calibers smaller than 6 mm (.243 in). The 7.62×39mm has ballistics similar to the well-known .30-30 Winchester. The Mini Thirty is available with a 16.12&quot; (Tactical Model) or 18.50&quot; barrel having a twist rate of 1:10&quot; RH, and is sold with two 20-round or 5-round box magazines. Ruger does not currently produce 30-round Mini Thirty magazines. The Mini Thirty shares many of the same design and accessory options with those of the smaller caliber Mini-14 Ranch Rifle.

====Mini Thirty Tactical Rifle====
The &quot;Mini Thirty Tactical Rifle&quot; variant was introduced in 2010. It closely mimics the Mini-14 Tactical Rifle variant, but in 7.62×39mm. It also has a shorter 16.12-inch barrel with flash suppressor, and is available with a standard fixed stock/fore end, or a collapsible ATI-brand stock with Picatinny rails.

===Government models===
====Mini-14 GB====

The Mini-14 GB (&quot;government barrel&quot;) models feature either a pistol grip, side-folding stock, or a standard semipistol grip rifle stock, a 20- or 30-round magazine, bayonet lug, threaded barrel, and flash suppressor. Proof that GB stands for &quot;government barrel&quot; and not &quot;government bayonet&quot; can be seen in Ruger&#x27;s new Tactical models and Ruger continuing to use &quot;GB&quot;, which are catalogued for example KM-14/20GBCP. These models have no bayonet lug but do have the flash hider. Sales of the models with bayonet lug were intended only for law enforcement, military, and private security markets, and could only be found in Ruger&#x27;s Law Enforcement Catalog. Many have entered the civilian market, though.

====AC-556====
Introduced in 1979, the AC-556 is a selective-fire version of the Mini-14 marketed for military and law-enforcement use. The design incorporates a selector on the right/rear of the receiver to select either semi-automatic, three-round burst, or full automatic fire modes; the manual safety at the front of the trigger guard operates the same as a standard Mini-14. The front sight is winged and incorporates a bayonet lug. The or barrel incorporates a flash suppressor, which can be used to launch approved tear-gas and smoke rifle grenades. A folding stock was used on the AC-556F and AC-556K. The rifle came equipped with 20-round magazines and a 30-round version was available for a time. The AC-556 was dropped from production in 1999 and Ruger stopped offering service for the rifle in 2009. By that time, some models became available for private civilian purchase in the NFA market.

=====Mousqueton A.M.D.=====

In France, the AC-556 is known as the Mousqueton A.M.D. where it was used by several governmental agencies within the French Interior Ministry: the Police Aux Frontières (&quot;P.A.F.&quot;—Border Police), the Police Nationale Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (or &quot;C.R.S.&quot;—Riot Control Brigade), and the Groupe d&#x27;Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (&quot;GIGN&quot;) special-operations unit. The A.M.D. was made in two versions, the first has the standard Ruger aperture rear sight. On the other, the aperture rear sight has been completely removed and replaced with a tangent rear sight located on top of the barrel just forward of the receiver.

===Straight-pull action===
A small number of straight-pull only (or bolt-action only) Mini-14 and Mini Thirty rifles were manufactured for sale in the United Kingdom as a result of legislation that banned semi-automatic centerfire rifles in 1988.

===Other calibers and accessories===

====.222 Remington====
Ruger produced a .222 Remington caliber model as early as 1984. Designated Mini-14/5R.222, these rifles were made mostly for civilian markets overseas where .223 caliber and 5.56 mm firearms are generally banned. These were discontinued in the early 1980s.

====6.8 mm Remington====
In 2007, Ruger began production of the Mini-6.8 using the commercial 6.8 mm Remington SPC cartridge. However, they were discontinued in 2012 and are no longer listed in the Ruger catalog.

====Accessories====
A wide range of aftermarket accessories are available for the Mini-14 and Mini Thirty, including numerous stocks, magazines, and Weaver and Picatinny rail mounts.

<text>Saint-Ambroise () is a station on Line 9 of the Paris Métro, located in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. It is under Boulevard Voltaire.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard Voltaire, northwest of the Rue Saint-Ambroise exit. Oriented along a north-west / south-east axis, it is situated between the Oberkampf and the Voltaire stations.

==History==
Saint-Ambroise station was opened on 10 December 1933 following the extension of Line 9 from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Montreuil.

Its namesake is the street it is located under (Rue Saint-Ambroise), where a church bearing the same name can also be found. Rue Saint-Ambroise and the church of Saint-Ambroise pay homage to Ambrose of Milan (340–394), bishop of Milan from 374 to 397, born in Trier, Germany, whose father was a prefect of Gaul. The church was rebuilt following a decree of 24 January 1863 during the modernisation of the newly created Saint-Ambroise district.

At the end of the 1990s, the station was chosen by the RATP to test the prototypes of the main lighting model that would be deployed on the platforms of many other stations renovated as part of the &quot;Espace Métro 2000&quot; operation subsequently entitled &quot;Renouveau du Métro&quot; and then &quot;Une métro + beau&quot;. In 1998, it became the first in a series of 273 futures to benefit from the components. However, its corridors were only modernised on 20 December 2005.

In 2018, 3,037,654 passengers entered this station which places it at the 183rd out of 302.

==Services for passengers==

<text>Charonne () is a station on Line 9 of the Paris Métro. It was opened on 10 December 1933 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Montreuil.

The station is named after the &quot;Rue de Charonne&quot; and the district of Charonne. In 1008, Robert II of France the Pious gave Charonne to the Abbey of Saint-Magloire, but it changed hands over the centuries. A small locality developed around the castle of Charonne, which was largely annexed by Paris in 1860.

==The Charonne Métro station massacre==
During the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962) most French politicians came to accept the need to grant Algeria its independence. Only the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; (OAS; Secret Armed Organization) continued to resist independence. The Left called for a demonstration on 8 February 1962 to denounce the OAS and the Algerian war. The Paris Police, led by Maurice Papon, repressed this demonstration, as it had done on 17 October 1961 (when between 32 and 200, mainly Algerian people, are estimated to have been killed). Police blocked nearby streets at both ends before charging the crowd. Demonstrators tried to take refuge in the entry of the Charonne metro station, but police pursued the crowd into the station and hurled heavy iron plates (used around the bases of trees and on metro vents) down onto demonstrators in the stairwells. Eight people were crushed to death or died from skull fractures and a ninth died from wounds in hospital. All of the dead, except a sixteen-year-old boy, were Communist Party or union members. Police blamed the violence on the demonstrators. A massive funeral demonstration drew between a quarter and a half million participants. The dead are buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery near the &quot;Mur des Fédérés&quot;. A ceremony at a memorial plaque in the station is held each February 8.

<text>Sukhothai (, ) was the capital of the Sukhothai Kingdom (also known as the Kingdom of Siam). Sukhothai is 12 km west of the modern city of Sukhothai Thani.

==History==
Sukhothai is from Sanskrit &quot;sukha&quot; (सुख &quot;happiness&quot;) + &quot;udaya&quot; (उदय &quot;rise, emergence&quot;), meaning &quot;dawn of happiness&quot;. Founded in 1238, it is about 427 km north of Bangkok. Sukhothai was the capital of the Thai Empire for approximately 140 years. As of 2014, 193 temples have been excavated and partly reconstructed.

The stele of Ram Khamhaeng states the city had a triple wall and four gates. At its center was a pond, a &quot;marvelous pond of clear and delicious water like the water of the Mekong in the dry season.&quot; The Aranyika monastery was west of the city, a great lake to the east, a market to the north, and the Khao Luang hill to the south.

Old Sukhothai is a small town with nearly no hotels. Most visitors stay in New Sukhothai.

Sukhothai occupies an area of 6,596 km2. The historic town of Sukhothai and related areas were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1991.

<text>Buzenval () is a station on line 9 of the Paris Métro in the 20th arrondissement. It lies under &quot;rue de Buzenval&quot;, of which it is named after. Its name commemorates the Battle of Buzenval, part of the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War that took place on 19 January 1871. It occurred in the village of &quot;Buzenval&quot;, now part of the Hauts-de-Seine commune of Rueil-Malmaison, west of Paris.

The &quot;Tarzan of Buzenval&quot; was the nickname of Laurent Dauthuille, a boxer of the 1950s.

== History ==

The station opened on 10 December 1933 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from between Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Montreuil.

Its main entrance was originally integrated with the former &quot;Palais Avron&quot; cinema, which opened in September 1936, replacing a former cinema on the same site, the &quot;Grand Cinéma Buzenval&quot; that opened in 1913 and closed in 1931 (initially named &quot;Casino de Buzenval&quot;). It has been repurposed as a supermarket since 1977, currently an Auchan, along with many other local cinemas that were converted into commercial spaces during the same period.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platforms were renovated and modernised on 2 December 2008.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,941,769 passengers, making it the 249th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,080,500 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 234th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,448,855 passengers, making it the 239th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

It in turn took its name from the market gardens &quot;maraîchers&quot; once located there; until the 20th century, the hills of &quot;Belleville&quot; and &quot;Montreuil&quot; were cultivated by many market-gardeners whose most famous product were the peaches from &quot;Montreuil&quot;.

== History ==
The station opened on 10 December 1933 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from between Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Montreuil. It offered a out-of-station connection to the &quot;Gare de la rue d&#x27;Avron&quot; on the Petite Ceinture railway until its subsequent closure to passenger traffic a few months later on 23 July 1934.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platforms were renovated and modernised on 12 December 2006.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,608,017 passengers, making it the 199th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

<doc id="504623" wikidata="Q254599" url="?curid=504623" title="Battle of Shanghai">
<text>The Battle of Shanghai () was a major battle fought between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China in the Chinese city of Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It lasted from August 13, 1937, to November 26, 1937, and was arguably the single largest and longest battle of the entire war, with it even regarded by some historians as the first battle of World War II. It resulted in the Japanese capture of the city and heavy destruction to the city.

It was the first of the twenty-two major engagements fought between the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) of the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese eventually prevailed after over three months of extensive fighting on land, in the air and at sea. Both sides accused each other of using chemical weapons during the battle, with Japanese forces confirmed to have illegally deployed poison gas at least thirteen times. Historian Peter Harmsen stated that the battle &quot;presaged urban combat as it was to be waged not just during the Second World War, but throughout the remainder of the twentieth century&quot; and that it &quot;signalled the totality of modern urban warfare&quot;. It has also been called &quot;one of the most incredible defensive battles ever waged on this planet&quot;. It was the single largest urban battle prior to the Battle of Stalingrad, which occurred almost 5 years later.

Since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 followed by the Japanese attack on Shanghai in 1932, there had been ongoing armed conflicts between China and Japan without an official declaration of war. These conflicts finally escalated in July 1937, when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the full advance from Japan. Shanghai was China&#x27;s largest and most cosmopolitan city, with it being the world&#x27;s fifth largest city at the time. Shanghai was known as the &quot;Pearl of the Orient&quot; and &quot;Paris of the East&quot;, with it being China&#x27;s main commercial hub and largest port. Dogged Chinese resistance at Shanghai was aimed at stalling the Japanese advance, giving much needed time for the Chinese government to move vital industries to the interior, while at the same time attempting to bring sympathetic Western powers to China&#x27;s side. During the fierce three-month battle, the forces of China and Japan fought in downtown Shanghai, in the outlying towns, and on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay, where the Japanese had made amphibious landings.

Chinese forces were equipped primarily with small-caliber weapons against much greater Japanese air, naval, and armor power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, the elite Chinese forces trained and equipped by the Germans, while failing to elicit any international intervention. However, the resistance of Chinese forces over three months of battle shocked the Japanese, who believed they could take Shanghai within days and China within months.

The battle can be divided into three stages, and eventually involved around one million troops. The first stage lasted from August 13 to August 22, 1937, during which the NRA besieged the Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed in Shanghai in bloody urban fighting in an attempt to dislodge them. The second stage lasted from August 23 to October 26, 1937, during which the Japanese launched reinforcing amphibious landings on the Jiangsu coast and the two armies fought a house-to-house battle in the creek country north of Shanghai, with the Japanese attempting to gain control of the city and the surrounding regions. The last stage, ranging from October 27 to the end of November 1937, involved the retreat of the Chinese army in the face of Japanese flanking maneuvers, and the ensuing combat on the road to China&#x27;s capital at the time, Nanjing. In addition to the urban combat, trench warfare was also fought in the outskirts of the city.
== Prelude ==
=== Ōyama Incident ===

On 9 August, Naval Sub-Lieutenant , head of the Western Detachment of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai and his driver, First-Class Seaman Saito Yozo, along with a guard from the Chinese Peace Preservation Corps were found dead around the gate to Hongqiao Airport on Monument Road. Several accounts allege Ōyama and his driver were stopped by the Peace Preservation Corps Guard before Ōyama opened fire and killed them. The Sub-Lieutenant and his driver were then subsequently killed in returning fire from other guards at airport. Ōyama was however unarmed at the time of the shooting, having left his sidearm at the headquarters. Historian Peter Harmsen purported the so-called shootout to in fact be a staged scene to coverup the murder of the two Japanese naval personnel by Chinese soldiers masquerading as Peace Preservation Corps.

It is still unknown whether Ōyama attempted to enter the military airport under higher orders. The incident heightened the tensions between the Chinese and Japanese forces in Shanghai. On 10 August, the Japanese Consul General demanded that the Chinese withdraw the Peace Preservation Corps and dismantle their defense works around the city. He also made it clear that the Imperial Japanese Army regarded the shooting of a Japanese officer as humiliating, and that any further incident would escalate the situation. In response to the incident, the Japanese began sending in reinforcements to Shanghai. Facing the increasing Japanese military presence in Shanghai, Chinese troops were also being deployed to the Shanghai area beginning on 11 August.

=== Final efforts at negotiation ===

On 12 August, representatives from the United Kingdom, France, United States and Italy along with Japan and China participated in the joint conference held in Shanghai to discuss the ceasefire terms. Japan demanded the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Shanghai, while the Chinese representative Yu Hung-chun dismissed the Japanese demand, stating that the terms of ceasefire have already been violated by Japan. The major powers did not wish to see another January 28 Incident, which greatly disrupted foreign economic activities in Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese citizens feverishly welcomed the presence of Chinese troops in the city. In Nanjing, Chinese and Japanese representatives met for the last time for final efforts at negotiation. The Japanese demanded that the Chinese withdraw all Peace Preservation Corps from Shanghai and all regular troops from the vicinities of the city. The Chinese insisted that the Japanese demand of a unilateral Chinese withdrawal was unacceptable since the two countries were already fighting a war in North China. At last Mayor Yu made it clear that at most the Chinese government would concede that the Chinese troops would not fire unless fired upon. Japan on the other hand placed all responsibility on China because of Chinese deployment of troops around Shanghai. Negotiation was impossible and there was no alternative other than the spread of war into Central China.

== Order of battle ==
== First phase (13 August – 22 August) ==

=== Opening shots ===

Around 9 am on August 13, the Chinese Peace Preservation Corps exchanged small arms fire with Japanese troops in the Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan districts of Shanghai. At about 3 pm the Japanese army crossed over the Bazi Bridge (八字橋) in Zhabei and attacked various centers in the city. The 88th Division retaliated with mortar attacks. Sporadic shooting continued through the day until 4 pm, when Japanese headquarters ordered ships of the Third Fleet stationed in the Yangtze and the Huangpu River to open fire on Chinese positions in the city. Late that night, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Zhang Zhizhong to begin Chinese offensive operations the next day. The next morning the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) began bombing various Japanese targets and Chinese ground forces attacked at 3 pm. On the same day, August 14, the Chinese government issued the Proclamation of Self-Defense and War of Resistance (自衛抗戰聲明書), explaining the government&#x27;s resolution against Japanese aggression. The Battle of Shanghai had officially begun.

Chiang&#x27;s initial plan was to have the numerically superior Chinese forces attack the Japanese by surprise and push them into the Huangpu River using &quot;Entscheidungsschlacht&quot; tactics recommended by his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. His troops were then to blockade the coast to deny the Japanese the opportunity to land reinforcements at the Huangpu wharves between Yangshupu and Hongkou,. The 88th Division was to attack Japanese army headquarters near Zhabei, and the 87th Division was to attack the reinforced Kung-ta Textile Mill, where the Japanese naval command was located.

The Japanese strongholds in the Hongkou salient were heavily fortified with thick concrete, barbed wire, sandbags, and machine guns. Their bunkers and were also resistant to 150mm howitzers, the only heavy weapons the Chinese possessed. Zhang estimated it would take one week to achieve these objectives; however, the operation ran into trouble when his troops were fought to a standstill just outside the Shanghai International Settlement.

=== First attacks ===

On the late afternoon of August 14th, the Chinese 88th Division attacked Japanese positions in downtown Shanghai, but was halted by direct fire from the entrenched Japanese and heavy bombardments from the Japanese Third Fleet moored in the Huangpu. Chinese artillery was also positioned too far in the rear, with inexperienced crews and poor communication from their observers preventing effective Chinese artillery support in the fighting. Chinese troops could only advance, under the cover of machine gun fire, by getting close enough to the emplacements to kill those within with hand grenades. The Chinese advance was greatly slowed and the element of surprise was lost.

As a result, the Chinese suffered heavy losses in the first attack, with over a thousand casualties including brigade commander Huang Meixing who was killed when an artillery shell destroyed his position near the Bazi Bridge. By nightfall, Chiang ordered Zhang Zhizhong to pause the assault. The Japanese SNLF had suffered roughly a hundred casualties including twenty-seven dead.
=== Operation Iron Fist ===
On August 15, Chiang convened with his divisional staff to organize a second assault on the Japanese defenses, this time with greater firepower and preparation. The Chinese divisions were to use German &quot;Stosstrupp&quot; shock tactics, advancing immediately after an intense artillery barrage to break through Japanese lines and fight their way deep behind enemy positions before the defenders could recover.

Since their forces lacked adequate heavy weapons to destroy the Japanese bunkers directly, the Chinese command decided to use encirclement tactics. To this end, Zhang Zhizhong instructed his troops to take the streets surrounding the Japanese strongholds, avoiding costly frontal attacks on heavily fortified positions.

In the morning of the 16th, the 88th and 87th Divisions launched &quot;Iron Fist,&quot; first intensely shelling the Japanese positions and then charging with infantry. In line with Zhang&#x27;s tactics, every time a street was successfully cleared, the Chinese would construct sandbag blockades and gradually surround each Japanese stronghold, closing off all possible routes of escape. The tactic was successful at first and the Chinese were able to destroy several emplacements and outposts on the first day.

Upon several successful penetrations near the Sajing Port and Guangzhong Road, the Japanese countered by deploying several tanks and armored cars in the streets, enabling them to blunt and eventually halt the Chinese attacks. At the Baji Bridge, the Chinese 88th Division suffered high casualties in a seesaw battle against Japanese armor units, which had flanked their positions from multiple directions.

The Japanese then shifted their attack to the Chinese positions in the Patriotic Girls School and Guangzhong Road. However, the 88th Division defending the road possessed anti-tank guns, and successfully held their positions against the Japanese counterattack, destroying or damaging three Japanese tanks. After several hours of intense fighting, the Japanese assault on Guangzhong Road had been repelled with some 200 SNLF casualties, including 83 killed.

In spite of the fierce fighting and heavy casualties, the Chinese were unable to make a major breakthrough because of ineffective coordination between infantry and artillery, poor reconnaissance, and the relentless shelling from Japanese ships on the Huangpu River. The Chinese were further hampered by their reluctance to fight inside the International Settlement so as to not alienate international opinion, which prevented potential flanking maneuvers against weaker points in the Japanese line.

By August 18 the Chinese attack had been called off. &quot;Iron Fist&quot; had proved a costly affair for the Chinese, who had endured heavy casualties in the vicious urban fighting. The Japanese had suffered some 600 casualties in the fighting, of which 134 were fatalities according to the Official Gazette.

=== Urban Fighting ===
On August 18, another 1,400 Japanese marines were shipped in to Shanghai from Manchuria, bolstering the ranks of the Japanese Shanghai SNLF. On the same day, Chinese General Chen Cheng reached the front lines to discuss the situation with Zhang Zhizhong. Due to the attrition sustained by the forces present, the Chinese commanders decided to send the newly arrived German-trained 36th Division into the attack. Half the division was ordered to attack towards the Hueishan (匯山) docks on the northern side of the Huangpu River, which would cut the Japanese forces in two. The plan entailed fighting through five heavily defended intersections; heavy casualties were expected.

On August 19th, two regiments of the 36th Division began their assault towards the wharf, enduring withering fire from Japanese defenders positioned on the roofs and upper floors of the buildings lining the streets. The Chinese were also subject to fierce bombardments from the Japanese Third Fleet anchored in the Huangpu. 

At this point, the Chinese decided to deploy British-made Vickers 6-ton tanks to assist their troops in the assault. However, the Chinese were insufficiently trained in coordinating infantry-tank tactics, and the troops were unable to keep up with the tanks. Without sufficient infantry to protect them, the tanks were vulnerable to Japanese anti-tank weapons and artillery in the close quarters, and became useless when they entered the city center. The few troops who did manage to keep up with the tanks through the city blocks were then trapped by Japanese blockades and cut down by flamethrowers and intense machine gun fire. The Japanese also lost tanks to Chinese anti-tank weapons within the battle&#x27;s urban confines. 36th staff officer Xiong Xinmin saw a Chinese suicide bomber stop a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank.

Despite the heavy resistance and at the cost of heavy casualties, the Chinese were able to push the Japanese back. At the same time, the 87th Division had broken through Japanese lines at Yangshupu, and pushed the Japanese back to the Hueishan docks along with the 36th Division. By August 21, Chinese tanks had managed to punch through to Broadway, the last street before the Huangpu. 

However, the Chinese were unable to finish their breakthrough, as the Japanese had taken position atop the high walls lining the wharf, through which the only entrance was a steel gate impervious to the heaviest Chinese artillery pieces. Chinese soldiers attempting to scale the gate were gunned down by enfilading machine gun fire. The Japanese had also fortified several factories along the riverline, such as the Gong Da Cotton Mill that could withstand Chinese artillery. 

While the Chinese had almost succeeded in pushing the Japanese into the Huangpu River, the casualty rate was exceedingly high. During the night of August 22 alone, the 36th Division lost more than ninety officers and a thousand troops. By the end of the offensive, the 36th Division had suffered more than 2,000 casualties, many of which were sustained by the relentless shelling from Japanese naval guns.

The Japanese SNLF had suffered roughly 900 casualties in the fighting including 200 killed, per their own records. Despite their losses, another wave of reinforcements from Sasebo brought the SNLF garrison&#x27;s numbers to 6,300 on August 22.American correspondent Edgar Snow described the scenes of the battle while observing from the international zone, &quot;It was as though Verdun had happened on the Seine, in full view of a Right Bank Paris that was neutral; as though a Gettysburg were fought in Harlem, while the rest of Manhattan remained a non-belligerent observer.&quot; An eyewitness at the battle stated that it was &quot;no longer a war between armies, but between races. With mounting fury the two giants, like two men who have started a boxing match and who suddenly find themselves convulsed with hate, sprang at each other’s throat in a tussle in which the only prize was death.&quot;
=== Air operations ===
The frontline fighter aircraft of the Chinese Air Force at the beginning of full-scale hostilities consisted primarily of Curtiss Hawk IIs and Hawk IIIs (many license-built at the CAMCO plant at the Jianqiao Airbase) and the Boeing P-26 Model 281 Peashooter. The Chinese pilots in particular used the Hawk IIIs in various multi-role combat operations against Imperial Japanese positions in and around Shanghai, while the P-26 primarily provided escort cover.

On August 14, the ROCAF bombed the Japanese Navy flagship &quot;Izumo&quot;. In what became known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, bombs from ROCAF aircraft fell in the Shanghai International Settlement. While the Chinese pilots were instructed not to fly over the Shanghai International Settlement, the Japanese flagship was berthed right in front of it in what may amount to using the civilian enclave as a human shield; 700–950 Chinese and foreign civilians were killed outright, with a total of 3,000 of civilian deaths and injuries resulting from the accidental release of the bombs, with most of the death occurring at the Great World entertainment centre, where civilian refugees had gathered after fleeing from the fighting. 

The bombing was not an intended attack on the International Settlement: the four errant bombs were intended for the Japanese cruiser &quot;Izumo&quot;, which was moored nearby in the Whangpoo (Huangpu) river, adjacent to the Bund. Two exploded in Nanking Road and two in front of the Great World Amusement Centre on Avenue Edward VII, killing an estimated 2,000 shoppers and passers-by. 

Japanese planes responded to the attack on &quot;Izumo&quot; and the 4th Flying Group of the ROCAF, based in Henan, under the command of Captain Gao Zhihang (高志航), shot down six Japanese planes, while suffering zero losses. (In 1940 the government announced August 14 would be &quot;Air Force Day&quot; to raise the morale of the Chinese populace.) From August 15 to 18, the Chinese fought the numerically superior Japanese air force in intense air battles that saw two Japanese squadrons destroyed. China was fighting the air war with every airplane in its possession, some of them purchased second-hand from various countries. It was not able to produce any planes of its own to replace those lost in combat and was always running low on replacement parts and supplies. 

Japan, in contrast, had a robust aviation industry able to design and manufacture technologically advanced planes and could easily make good their losses. Thus, it was impossible for China to sustain an air war with Japan, however, the Chinese Air Force were given a much-needed lifeline with many new replacement fighter aircraft under the new Sino-Soviet Treaty as the initial inventory of American-made aircraft were gradually lost through attrition. 

=== Other developments ===
==== Combat around Jiangyin (16 August – 30 October) ====
On 16 August, one-hundred kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Shanghai, the battle for Jiangyin began. Military preparations for the battle began on 7 August, when Chinese Secretary of the Navy Chen Shaokuan ordered a blockade at Jiangyin with a force of five light cruisers and one training cruiser along with several mines to prevent Japanese warships from entering the Yangtze River. Admiral Kiyoshi Hasegawa of the Japanese 3rd Fleet ordered aerial bombings of the forces at Jiangyin with carrier and ground-based aircraft, which led to the sinking of ten Chinese ships by 23 October. However, despite these losses, the Chinese navy recovered some of the naval guns from the sunken ships and deployed them on land as coastal batteries, thus maintaining a defensive position at Jiangyin. In early November, Jiangyin was eventually captured after a brief but bloody battle as Chinese forces retreated.
==== Mobilization of the Japanese Army ====
On August 15, the Japanese formed the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEF), composed of the 3rd and 11th Divisions, under the command of General Iwane Matsui. On August 19, Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe announced that the Sino-Japanese conflict could only be resolved through war, regardless of any attempts at negotiation by third party nations. Konoe said that the initial plan of localized &quot;containment&quot; around the Shanghai region had now escalated to total war, with the ultimate goal of forcing the Chinese government to fully cooperate with the economic and political demands of Japan. On August 23, the Japanese began the bombing campaign over Nanjing, and various cities in Central China. The Shanghai Expeditionary Army also arrived on the same day.

At the beginning of the battle, Zhang Zhizhong, as the commander of the 5th Army and the Nanjing-Shanghai war zone, was responsible for conducting Chinese operations. The failure of the initial Chinese offensive greatly dismayed Chiang Kai-shek and his staff. Chiang criticized Zhang&#x27;s failure to make sufficient preparations, especially the procurement of weapons capable of penetrating Japanese bunkers, before sending the troops in massive waves, which resulted in unsustainable casualties in many divisions right from the start. Zhang was also criticized for his overconfidence and his penchant for holding press conferences for both foreign and Chinese reporters in the cosmopolitan city. Chiang Kai-shek and his staff, the most prominent including Chen Cheng and Gu Zhutong, began taking over command duties from Zhang. Chiang Kai-shek himself would eventually become the commander of the third war zone which covers the entirety of Shanghai. Regardless, the Chinese offensives against the Japanese garrison failed despite outnumbering the Japanese troops, due to the lack of heavy weaponry and artillery support.

== Second phase (23 August – 26 October) ==

As the Chinese forces began to withdraw from the Shanghai area, more Japanese troops began to land near Shanghai, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese side. The fighting spread across from Shanghai metropolis all the way to the township of Liuhe, near the coast where the majority of the Japanese landings occurred. A manoeuvre Japan had also performed in the 1932 battle and therefore should have been expected.

The perceived strength of the Chinese response resulted in major reinforcement for Japanese units. The 9th, 13th, and 101st Divisions, the 5th Heavy Artillery Brigade, and a brigade-strength mixture of smaller units were ordered from Japan to Shanghai by Imperial General Headquarters on 11 September 1937.

=== Japanese landings (23 August – 10 September) ===
On August 23, the Japanese 3rd, 8th, and 11th Divisions made an amphibious assault under the cover of naval bombardment and proceeded to land in Chuanshakou (川沙口), Shizilin (獅子林), and Baoshan (寶山), towns on the northeast coast some fifty kilometers (31 miles) away from downtown Shanghai. Japanese landings in northeast Shanghai suburban areas meant that many Chinese troops, who were deployed in Shanghai&#x27;s urban center, had to be redeployed to the coastal regions to counter the landings. Thus, the front line was lengthened from metropolitan Shanghai along the Huangpu River to the northeast coastal districts. The Chinese offensive in the urban center had ground to a halt, and the fighting in downtown Shanghai essentially became a stalemate with both sides suffering heavy losses and making minimal changes in the front line. The Chinese divisions would hold on to Zhabei, Jiangwan, and other downtown positions for three months, until situations in other areas made it strategically impossible to continue defending them.

On August 23, the SEF, led by Iwane Matsui, landed in Liuhe, Wusong (吳淞), and Chuanshakou. Chiang Kai-shek had expected these coastal towns to be vulnerable to Japanese landings and ordered Chen Cheng to reinforce the area with the 18th Army. However, the Chinese were no match for Japanese firepower. The Japanese almost always began their amphibious assaults with heavy naval and air bombardment of the Chinese coastal defense works and trenches. It was not unheard of for the Chinese to lose an entire garrison to such bombardments. However, the Chinese would reinforce almost immediately to counter the Japanese troops who had just made their landing after the bombardment.

In the two weeks that followed, the Chinese and Japanese troops fought bitter battles in the numerous towns and villages along the coast. The Chinese troops fending off the amphibious assaults had only their small-caliber weapons to depend on, and were not sufficiently supported by the ROCAF and the almost nonexistent Chinese navy. They paid heavily for the defense. An entire regiment could be reduced to just a few men in action. In addition, Chinese coastal defense works were hastily constructed and did not offer much protection against enemy attacks, as many trenches were newly constructed during lulls in fighting. Moreover, the sandy soil of the coastal region meant that it was difficult to construct sturdy fortifications. Many trenches would collapse due to rain. The Chinese raced against time to construct and repair these defense works despite constant Japanese bombardment. Logistics difficulty also meant it was hard to transport the necessary construction materials to the front line. The Chinese often had to turn to bombed-out houses to obtain bricks, beams, and other such materials. However, the Chinese fought against great odds and tried to hold on to the coastal villages as long as they could. It was commonplace for the Japanese to successfully occupy the towns in the day under heavy naval support, only to lose them during the night to Chinese counterattacks.

Such attacks and counterattacks continued well into late August, when the fall of Baoshan, a vital coastal town, seemed imminent. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the remaining troops of the 98th Division to defend the walled town. One battalion, under lieutenant colonel Yao Ziqing (姚子青), was assigned to the task. The situation in Baoshan was grim, as the Japanese had surrounded the town by September 5. However, Yao ordered his men to defend to the death, pledging to die at his post. Several Japanese assaults on September 4 were repulsed with heavy casualties, but a Japanese tank assault with air support broke through the gate the next day. The Chinese defenders were gradually pushed into a shrinking perimeter, and only had 100 troops by sunset. Yao ordered a single soldier to escape the city and deliver news of the unit&#x27;s impeding fate. The soldier succeeded in delivering his message, which was simply: &quot;We are determined to continue fighting the enemy until each and every one of us is killed.&quot;

On the next day, September 6, Baoshan fell. By that point, Japanese artillery strikes had reduced the town to rubble, and Yao had been killed in house-to-house fighting. The entire battalion, except for the single soldier sent outside, was killed in action. The Chinese would continue to sustain this level of casualties throughout the Shanghai campaign.

=== Combat around Luodian (11 September – 30 September) ===
On September 11, with the fall of Baoshan, the Chinese Army moved into defensive positions around the small town of Luodian (羅店), the transportation center connecting Baoshan, downtown Shanghai, Jiading, Songjiang and several other towns with highways. The successful defense of Luodian was strategically paramount to the security of Suzhou and Shanghai; as early as August 29, German adviser Alexander von Falkenhausen had advised Chiang Kai-shek that the town must be held at all costs, as it was &quot;the most crucial strategic point.&quot;

The Japanese had also recognized Luodian&#x27;s importance, and had sent troops to attack the town on August 23. Two large assaults were repelled by the Chinese 11th Division, who overcame Japanese advantages in armor and artillery by harassing Japanese columns with small scale ambushes and engaging in close-quarters street fighting within Luodian.

To defend Luodian, the Chinese concentrated some 300,000 soldiers there, while the Japanese amassed more than 100,000 troops, supported by naval gunfire, tanks, and aircraft.

The carnage and intensity of the resulting battle earned the fight for Luodian the nickname &quot;grinding mill of flesh and blood&quot; (血肉磨坊). Japanese assaults typically began at daybreak with concentrated aerial bombing, followed by the release of observation balloons to pinpoint the exact location of remaining Chinese positions for artillery and naval strikes. Japanese infantry would then advance under smoke screens, with armored support. Japanese planes would also accompany the infantry and strafe Chinese reinforcements. The battle for Luodian was marked by bloody street fighting, with the close combat making the Chinese the equals of the Japanese.

Chinese defense was stubborn even in the face of overwhelming firepower. During the night, Chinese soldiers mined the roads connecting the coastal towns to Luodian and engaged in night combat to cut off Japanese advance troops. At daybreak, the Chinese would garrison the foremost defensive lines with comparatively few troops in order to reduce casualties resulting from intense Japanese bombardments. The Chinese would then emerge from rear positions to engage the enemy when the Japanese land offensive started after naval and artillery strikes had ceased.

Despite their numerical superiority, the defense of Luodian would prove impossible for the Chinese. The Japanese superiority of firepower forced the Chinese into a passive position, from which they could not mount counter-attacks until the Japanese were practically on top of them. Because of this, the decision was made to defend the entire town to the death, a tactic which greatly accelerated the attrition rate within the Chinese ranks. The casualty rate of General Chen Cheng&#x27;s army group was more than fifty percent. By the end of September, the Chinese had been almost bled dry and were forced to give up Luodian.

=== Battle for Wusong Creek and Dachang (1 October – 26 October) ===

By October 1, the Japanese had increased troop strength in the Shanghai region to more than two hundred thousand. Japanese troops also invaded the town of Liuhang (劉行), south of Luodian. Thus, the frontline moved further south onto the banks of the Wusong River. The Japanese aim was to cross the Creek and take the walled town of Dachang (大場), which was the communications link between Chinese troops in downtown Shanghai and the northwest outlying towns. If Dachang fell, Chinese troops would have to forfeit their positions in downtown Shanghai and regions east of the Huangpu River to avoid encirclement by the Japanese. The defense of Dachang was vital to how long the Chinese army could continue fighting in the Shanghai war zone; for this, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized whatever remaining troops he could find.

To compensate for artillery shortages, Matsui massed four Japanese divisions, some 60,000 men, in a 6 mile front to break through the Chinese lines via brute frontal assaults.

The Chinese focused their defensive line on the Wusong Creek, a natural defensive position with a six-foot tall embankment and a width of up to three hundred feet across. The Chinese, learning from the lessons of their German advisors, had fortified the southern bank with a dense network of defenses, including barbed wire, machine gun nests, artillery emplacements, pillboxes and trenches. The local buildings and farmhouses were reinforced with sandbags and barbed wire, and trees had been cut down to ensure open fields of fire.

On October 5, the Japanese forces smashed into the Chinese defenses across the Wusong Creek, but were immediately met by heavy resistance. The Chinese fought back against the assault fiercely, pummeling the Japanese bridgeheads with concentrated and coordinated artillery fire from six artillery battalions, which were reinforced with 2 cm and 3.7 cm anti-aircraft guns to protect against Japanese aircraft.

The two armies would engage in seesaw battles, with little changes in the frontline. House to house fighting was common, and in the most intense moments these positions would change hands up to five times a day. In this brutal combat, Chinese soldiers regularly fought to the death even when surrounded, a result of the Japanese Army&#x27;s habit of taking no prisoners. In overrun positions, Japanese soldiers frequently found dead Chinese soldiers, some with childlike features, clutching weapons as though &quot;their ghosts had returned to continue resistance.&quot; In one case, the village of Tangbeizhai was defended against a Japanese column by a single Chinese soldier, as the rest of his battalion had already been destroyed.

From September 11 to October 20, the Japanese army was able to advance only five kilometers. It was in this fighting where the Japanese suffered their heaviest losses of the entire campaign, estimated at 25,000 casualties with some 8,000 killed in action over a 20-day period between October 5 and October 25. The 101st Division alone suffered 3,000 casualties in four days of combat around Wusong Creek, and the 9th division suffered some 9,556 casualties for an advance of 2.5 miles.

Despite heavy casualties, the Japanese would eventually breach the Wusong Creek line, seizing the Tangqiaozhan bridge from the Chinese Tax Police Division after two days of intense fighting. However, even though the Japanese penetrated the Wusong Creek line, they were confronted with further belts of similar defenses built around a series of creeks anchored by Zoumatang Creek. The two armies became bogged down in trench warfare around a mostly stagnant frontline, with heavy rains transforming the terrain into a muddy landscape.

On October 21, the Guangxi Army under Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi finally arrived to join Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Central Army in the battle for Shanghai. These Guangxi units, four divisions in total, then staged a final counteroffensive in an attempt to fully consolidate Chinese positions around Dachang and retake the banks of the Wusong Creek. However, the counteroffensive was poorly coordinated with little reconnaissance, and quickly bogged down despite some initial success. The Japanese would counterattack with artillery, tanks and poison gas on October 23, with Japanese aircraft wreaking havoc on Chinese divisions throughout daytime. The operation was halted, and had cost the Guangxi divisions over 2,000 casualties including dozens of officers. In just 8 days, the 21st Group Army of the Guangxi Army had lost two-thirds of its soldiers.

Following the failed counteroffensive, Matsui ordered his divisions to push to Zoumatang Creek. The Chinese, having been exhausted by the combat through October, had begun withdrawing their troops to a defensive line behind Suzhou Creek. The Japanese, aided by their tanks and aircraft, seized two bridges across the Zoumatang Creek and pushed the remaining Chinese forces back to Dachang. The Japanese then utilized some 700 artillery pieces and 400 aircraft including 150 bombers for the assault on Dachang and reduced the town to rubble. They then followed up with an armored spearhead of some 40 tanks. The Chinese defenders, having withdrawn their artillery to safer positions beforehand, were outgunned and overwhelmed. The fighting continued until October 26, when Dachang finally fell. By then, Chinese troops had no option but to withdraw from downtown Shanghai, which they had held for almost three months.

== Third Phase (27 October – 26 November) ==
=== Chinese withdrawal from Shanghai city ===

Starting the night of October 26, the Chinese began withdrawing from Shanghai&#x27;s urban center. Because Dachang and other vital suburban towns had been lost already, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chinese troops to retreat from Zhabei, Jiangwan (江灣), and other positions that the troops had held for seventy-five days without faltering. However, Chiang ordered one battalion of the 88th Division remain in Zhabei to defend the Sihang Warehouse on the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek.

=== Battle of the Sihang Warehouse ===
Under the leadership of Whampoa Colonel Xie Jinyuan, the 1st battalion of the 524th regiment rallied some 411 men and officers to make a stand in the five-story &quot;Four Banks&quot; Warehouse (Sihang Warehouse). The building was situated on the Suzhou Creek across from the International Settlement, and was reinforced with rifle slots, machine gun nests and sandbags.

Between October 27 and November 1, the 1st battalion defended Sihang Warehouse against multiple attacks from the Japanese. The warehouse&#x27;s ten-foot thick walls and proximity to the International Settlement nullified Japanese advantages in firepower, as the Japanese feared accidentally hitting the foreign concessions. As a result, the Chinese managed to beat back several Japanese attacks, which were witnessed by crowds of tens of thousands Westerners and Chinese across the creek. At one point, girl guide Yang Huimin smuggled a Chinese Nationalist flag into the warehouse, which the defenders then raised as a symbol of defiance.

Eventually, Chiang ordered the battalion to retreat into the nearby International Settlement, where they were interned by British authorities. Most of the 1st battalion survived intact: 34 Chinese defenders had been killed in action. The attacking Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces recorded suffering one fatal casualty around Sihang Warehouse among some forty wounded during the takeover of Zhabei. Colonel Xie initially reported to the newspaper Zhongyang Ribao that his men had killed over 100 Japanese troops before retreating. Military historian Stephen Robinson has claimed the Japanese lost some 200 men in their effort to take the warehouse.

Chiang wanted the Chinese military presence to remain in Shanghai as long as possible to have a positive reflection on the ongoing Nine-Power Treaty Conference that was in session in Brussels, with the hopes for possible intervention from Western powers. The rest of the Chinese troops crossed the Suzhou Creek and regrouped to engage the Japanese troops.

=== Fighting around Suzhou Creek ===
Chiang&#x27;s original plan was to fight in areas south of the Suzhou Creek and inflict as many Japanese casualties as possible. However, through three months of intense fighting, Chinese troop strength had been greatly reduced. Most units had their strength halved, and as a result a division had the fighting capability of less than two regiments. By now, the Chinese army needed between eight and twelve divisions to match the fighting strength of just one Japanese division. Thus, Chinese commanders were pessimistic about the outcome of the Suzhou Creek combat.

Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui and other commanders insisted that the Chinese troops should enter the Wufu and Xicheng defense lines to protect Nanjing, but Chiang wanted the Chinese troops to continue fighting on the southern bank of Suzhou Creek. On October 28, Chiang arrived in the battlefield to boost the morale of his troops. However, the situation was bleak. On October 30, the Japanese crossed Suzhou River and the Chinese troops were in danger of encirclement. The Chinese army was at its limit of endurance.

=== Japanese landings at Jinshanwei ===

As early as October 12, the Japanese chiefs of staff had already formulated plans to force a landing in Jinshanwei (金山衛), a town located on the northern bank of Hangzhou Bay, south of the Shanghai region. The Jinshanwei landings would facilitate a northward push into Shanghai, to complement the landings in northeastern towns, such as the ones around Baoshan between late August and mid-September, which brought about a southward push.

Chiang Kai-shek was aware of the Japanese plan to encircle his army in Shanghai from the north and the south, and had already ordered his commanders to take precautions of the possible Japanese landings at Jinshanwei. However, the impending fall of Dachang in late October forced Chiang to redeploy the Chinese divisions originally stationed along the northern coast of Hangzhou Bay.

As a result, the lack of Chinese defenses allowed the Japanese 10th Army Corps, composed of units diverted from the Battle of Taiyuan in the North China Theater, to land easily in Jinshanwei on November 5. Jinshanwei was only forty kilometers away from the banks of Suzhou River where the Chinese troops had just retreated from the fall of Dachang.

== Road to Nanjing ==
=== Decision to take Nanjing ===

In October, the SEF was reinforced by the Japanese 10th Army commanded by Lieutenant General Heisuke Yanagawa. On 7 November, Japanese Central China Area Army (CCAA) was organized by combining the SEF and the 10th Army, with Matsui appointed as its commander-in-chief concurrently with that of the SEF. After winning the battles around Shanghai, the SEF suggested the Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo to attack Nanking.

The CCAA was rearranged and Lieutenant General Prince Asaka (Yasuhiko), an uncle of Emperor Hirohito, was appointed as the commander of the SEF, while Matsui stayed as the commander of CCAA overseeing both the SEF and the 10th Army. The real nature of Matsui&#x27;s authority is however difficult to establish as he was confronted with a member of the imperial family directly appointed by the Emperor. In anticipation of the attack on Nanking, Matsui issued orders to his armies that read:Nanjing is the capital of China and the capture thereof is an international affair; therefore, careful study should be made so as to exhibit the honor and glory of Japan and augment the trust of the Chinese people, and that the battle in the vicinity of Shanghai is aimed at the subjugation of the Chinese Army, therefore protect and patronize Chinese officials and people, as far as possible; the Army should always bear in mind not to involve foreign residents and armies in trouble and maintain close liaison with foreign authorities in order to avoid misunderstandings.On December 2, Emperor Showa nominated one of his uncles, Prince Asaka, as commander of the invasion. It is difficult to establish if, as a member of the imperial family, Asaka had a superior status to general Iwane Matsui, who was officially the commander in chief, but it is clear that, as the top-ranking officer, he had authority over division commanders, lieutenant-generals Kesago Nakajima and Heisuke Yanagawa.

=== Japanese advance toward Nanjing ===
After securing control of Shanghai, the Japanese army began its advance towards Nanjing on November 11, 1937, approaching the city from different directions.

The Japanese advance to Nanjing can be characterized as a &quot;forced march&quot;. Almost all units covered the distance of almost 400 kilometers in about a month. Assuming that capture of the Chinese capital would be the decisive turning point in the war, there was an eagerness to be among the first to claim the honor of victory.

The Japanese army was engaged by Chinese soldiers on a number of occasions on the way to Nanjing. As a general rule, they were heavily outnumbered. As the Japanese came closer to Nanjing, the fighting grew in both frequency and severity.

=== Chinese retreat from Shanghai ===
Japanese landings at Jinshanwei meant that the Chinese army had to retire from the Shanghai front and attempt a breakout. However, Chiang Kai-shek still placed some hope that the Nine-Power Treaty would result in a sanction against Japan by Western powers. It was not until November 8 that the Chinese central command issued a general retreat to withdraw from the entire Shanghai front. All Chinese units were ordered to move toward western towns such as Kunshan, and then from there enter the final defense lines to stop the Japanese from reaching Nanjing.

By then, the Chinese army was utterly exhausted, and with a severe shortage of ammunition and supplies, the defense was faltering. Kunshan was lost in only two days, and the remaining troops began moving toward the Wufu Line fortifications on November 13. The Chinese army was fighting with the last of its strength and the frontline was on the verge of collapse.

In the chaos that ensued many Chinese units were broken up and lost contact with their communications officers who had the maps and layouts to the fortifications. In addition, once they arrived at Wufu Line, the Chinese troops discovered that some of the civilian officials were not there to receive them as they had already fled and had taken the keys with them. The battered Chinese troops, who had just emerged from the bloodbath in Shanghai and were hoping to enter the defense lines, found that they were not able to utilize these fortifications.

The Wufu Line was penetrated on November 19, and the Chinese troops then moved toward Xicheng Line, which they were forced to give up on November 26 in the midst of the onslaught. The &quot;Chinese Hindenburg Line&quot;, which the government had spent millions to construct and was the final line of defense between Shanghai and Nanjing, collapsed in only two weeks. The Battle of Shanghai was over. However, fighting continued without a pause on the road to China&#x27;s capital and the ensuing combat immediately led into the Battle of Nanjing.

By early December, Japanese troops had reached the outskirts of Nanking.

After its success in the Battle of Shanghai, Japan did not immediately occupy the Shanghai International Settlement or the Shanghai French Concession, areas which were outside of China&#x27;s control due to the treaty port system. Japan moved into these areas after its 1941 declaration of war against the United States and the United Kingdom. It seized most of the banks in these areas of Shanghai and declared that the Nationalist currency fabi had to be exchanged for bank notes of the Wang Jingwei regime.

== Casualties ==
The battle saw both sides suffer an enormous amount of casualties, especially the Chinese forces, who had inferior armaments as compared to the Japanese. A Chinese historian at the time stated that it was &quot;the bloodiest battle . . . since Verdun.&quot; There are differing estimates and reports of the number of casualties each side suffered.

According to historians Peter Harmsen, Rana Mitter and Richard Frank, China suffered 187,200 killed and wounded defending the city per an official Chinese report on November 5. Contemporary Japanese estimates for Chinese military casualties were roughly 250,000 including some 67,000 killed. Frank Dorn, an American military officer stationed in China at the time, put total Chinese casualties for the entire Shanghai campaign (including the retreat) at 240,000 casualties, of which 130,000 were suffered before October 20. Hsi-Sheng Chi stated that China suffered some 300,000 casualties during the battle. Chen Cheng reported his Left Wing Force alone had suffered more than 100,000 casualties in two to three months of fighting. The high Chinese casualties were due to a combination of factors, including tactical reliance on costly frontal assaults, Japanese superiorities in airpower and naval artillery, poor medical services, and the near-fanatical resistance of Chinese defenders who were willing to fight to the death on numerous occasions.

The Japanese claimed their casualties in the Shanghai campaign amounted to 9,115 killed and 31,257 injured. Historian Peter Harmsen notes that this figure is possibly understated, as Iwane Matsui had recorded in his diary that his forces had sustained over 18,000 deaths to combat and disease in the Shanghai-Nanjing Campaign. Historian Richard Frank agrees, and states the official Japanese figures fail to convey the extent of their losses sustained during the campaign, especially the four most heavily engaged divisions such as the 9th division, which suffered a 94% casualty rate. According to official Japanese military records compiled by Ikuhiko Hata, the five divisions most involved in combat (3rd, 9th, 11th, 13th, 101st) suffered 42,202 casualties including 11,072 killed in action, although this number doesn&#x27;t include losses from the Special Naval Landing Forces or any of the divisions deployed in October. According to the Japanese Official Gazette documenting wartime casualties, the Japanese forces had suffered nearly 20,000 fatalities in the fighting for Shanghai, of which nearly 18,800 were combat deaths.Chinese wartime records indicate that the Japanese suffered over 60,000 casualties in the three months of combat around Shanghai. Jonathan Fenby provides a similar number, claiming the Japanese suffered some 70,000 casualties in the battle. Benjamin Lai provides higher figures, estimating the Japanese suffered a total of 93,000 to 99,000 casualties, including 17,000 combat deaths plus about 1,800 illness-induced deaths, making a total of almost 19,000 deaths, with another 35,000–40,000 wounded and 40,000 sick, for a combined total of 363,700 to 369,700 casualties. According to research done by James Paulose, the Japanese suffered 92,640 casualties and the Chinese suffered over 333,500 casualties based on the memoir of He Yingqin, for a combined total of at least 426,140 casualties.

== Atrocities ==
Numerous atrocities were committed during the Shanghai Campaign, especially by the Japanese forces.

Japanese troops rarely took prisoners, if ever. Captives, including civilians accused of spying, were interrogated and disposed of once they had no more information to offer. According to Iwane Matsui&#x27;s diary, every single one of the 500 Chinese POWs captured around Wusong was shot. Executions were typically conducted by decapitation with swords, but it was not uncommon for more gruesome methods to be used: injured Chinese prisoners were often tied together face-down, doused in gasoline, and then burned alive.

Civilians and non-combatants were also targeted. For example, the Japanese machine gunned crowds of refugees by the Jessfield Railway Bridge, and deliberately strafed refugee columns near Brenan road. To compensate for supply shortages, Japanese troops often looted from local towns and villages, frequently massacring their civilian inhabitants in the process. Japanese aircraft deliberately targeted anything that bore the Red Cross, frequently strafing or bombing ambulances transporting wounded Chinese soldiers, civilians and medical personnel.

Chinese forces also committed atrocities. Several hundred civilians were also killed on August 14 when stray bombs dropped by the ROCAF exploded in densely packed areas during an attack on the Japanese cruiser &quot;Izumo&quot;. In addition, the Chinese implemented scorched earth tactics to deny Japanese forces local resources. This meant burning buildings and fields, destroying harvests, killing animals and poisoning wells, causing massive property damage to Shanghai.

== Aftermath ==
=== Loss of Central Army military strength ===

Even though the Battle of Shanghai was only the first of the twenty-two major battles fought between China and Japan, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s decision to send his best troops into the battle had significant repercussions. At the outbreak of the war, the Chinese NRA boasted a standing army of some 1.75 million troops, but the combat strength was significantly lower as the majority of the Chinese troops were poorly trained and poorly equipped. Only about 300,000 were comparatively better trained. These troops were reorganized into some 20 newly formed divisions. Of these, around 80,000 had belonged to the German-trained divisions that composed the elite units of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Central Army. However, even these divisions were not sufficiently supported by combined arms or modern logistics. Thus, out of a grand total of almost two million men-in-arms, less than one hundred thousand Chinese troops were able to fight Japan on more or less equal terms.

Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s decision to commit his elite divisions to fight in Shanghai caused his elite units to suffer some sixty percent disproportionate casualties. In one single blow, Chiang also lost some 10,000 of the 25,000 junior officers trained by the Whampoa Military Academy between 1929 and 1937, in addition to some tens of thousands of potential military officers. Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Central Army was never to recover from these devastating losses. By the time the 88th Division, arguably the best of these elite divisions, began its defense of Nanjing, it had been reduced to seven thousand men, of whom three thousand were new recruits to replace the losses.

Losses to the Nationalist army&#x27;s very small stock of armor were also significant. The Chinese deployed three tank battalions in the battle and its immediate aftermath. The 1st Battalion had 32 VCL Amphibious Tanks and some 6-ton Vickers Mark E tanks. The 2nd Battalion also in Shanghai had 20 Vickers Mark E tanks, 4 VCL Tanks and Carden Loyd tankettes. The 3rd Battalion had 10 Panzer I light tanks, 20 CV35 tankettes, and some Leichter Panzerspähwagen armored cars. Almost all of these were lost during the battles in Shanghai and later on in Nanjing.

The heavy casualties inflicted on Chiang&#x27;s own military strength forced him to rely more on non-Whampoa generals, who commanded the provincial armies and many of whom had questionable loyalty to Chiang. Because of the reduction in his military power, Chiang lost some of his political leverage over local warlords. In effect, Chiang Kai-shek was effectively only the head of a loose coalition, rather than the commander-in-chief of a united fighting force. The sapping of China&#x27;s best fighting men also made the planning and execution of subsequent military operations difficult. In essence, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s concerted pre-war effort to build a truly effective, modernized, national army was greatly devastated by the sacrifices made in the Battle of Shanghai.

=== International response ===

A major reason that the Chinese army held onto the city as long as it did, even though it was on the brink of collapse, was that China was hoping for Western intervention in the Sino-Japanese War. Western nations had been paying little attention to China&#x27;s plight since they were preoccupied with the situation in Europe. In addition, most Western nations had little prospect that their intervention would help China in the long run because they believed that China would eventually lose. If China was deemed militarily weak, economically backward, and politically disunited by Western powers, it would not make sense for them to help China when it seemed bound for defeat by Japan.

Thus, Chiang Kai-shek had to devote everything China had to offer to make sure the Western powers knew that the present conflict between China and Japan was a major war, not a collection of inconsequential &quot;incidents&quot; as had been the case previously. Based on this political strategy, Chiang Kai-shek had to order his troops to fight to the death in an attempt to arouse international sympathy and cause the international community to adopt measures that would help China and sanction Japan.

On September 12, one month after the Battle of Shanghai began, China formally brought the case against Japan to the League of Nations. Again, the League was not able to formulate any effective sanctions against Japan other than an October 4 statement that gave China &quot;spiritual support&quot;. The United States was not a member of the League and Great Britain and France were reluctant to challenge Japan. Of all the major Western powers, only the United States seemed able to act more since it was not embroiled in the volatile European affairs.

In addition, on October 5, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave the Quarantine Speech, calling for the United States to help nations fight against aggressor nations. This speech had a tremendous effect on raising China&#x27;s morale. Because America seemed willing to confront Japan, the British representative suggested to close the League case and convene the Nine Power Treaty Conference. Since the Nine-Power Treaty was signed as a result of the Washington Naval Conference of 1922, the opening of the Conference automatically brought the United States into the effort to rein in Japanese aggression.

American entry into the international response brought new hope to the Chinese, and Chiang Kai-shek again reiterated the need for his troops to hold on to Shanghai to prove that China was indeed worth fighting for. By mid-October, the Chinese situation in Shanghai had become increasingly dire and the Japanese had made significant gains. The vital town of Dachang fell on October 26 and the Chinese withdrew from metropolitan Shanghai.

However, because the Nine Power Treaty Conference was to begin in early November, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his troops to stay in the Shanghai battlefield, instead of retreating to the Wufu and Xicheng Lines to protect Nanjing. He also left one lone battalion to defend the Sihang Warehouse in metropolitan Shanghai. Chiang also visited the frontlines to encourage his troops.

Because Shanghai was the most important Chinese city in Western eyes, the troops had to fight and hold on to the city as long as possible, rather than moving toward the defense lines along nameless towns en route to Nanjing. On November 3, the Conference finally convened in Brussels. While the Western powers were in session to mediate the situation, the Chinese troops were making their final stand in Shanghai and had all hopes for a Western intervention that would save China from collapse.

=== Effects ===
In terms of its long-term effects on the war of attrition, the Battle of Shanghai bought enough time for the Chinese government to move some of its vital industries to Wuhan and Xi&#x27;an, and from there to Chongqing, China&#x27;s wartime capital after the fall of Nanjing and Wuhan. The difficulty in dismantling and relocating thousands of tons of machinery and factory equipment, especially in the heat of Japanese bombing campaigns, meant that the Chinese government fell short of its goal of moving the entire industrial base from the Shanghai region.

Many factories were destroyed during the fighting and ceased to be functional. Of the nearly twelve hundred factories and workshops of all sizes, only slightly more than ten percent were moved out of Shanghai. However, as insignificant as they were, these factories formed the core of China&#x27;s wartime industry, especially in the bleak days of the blockade of the entire Chinese coast, the closure of the Burma Road, and the low tonnage of supplies flown over the Hump.

Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s strategy of bringing the fight to Shanghai to force Japan to adopt an east-to-west direction of attack also prevented Japan from cutting right into Central China. As a result, the Battle of Wuhan was delayed for almost a year, and the time bought gave the Chinese government breathing space to recuperate and relocate more resources to Chongqing. Overall, even though Chinese losses were irreparable, the strategy of trading &quot;space for time&quot; proved its worth.

The Battle of Shanghai was a military defeat but a high point for Chinese nationalism. The beginning of full-scale war meant that China would no longer stand idly and allow Japan to conquer its territories piece by piece as it had done in the past. It also demonstrated China&#x27;s resolve not to surrender even in the face of overwhelming firepower. However, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s order to have his troops make one death stand after another greatly sapped his strength and directly caused his army&#x27;s inability to defend Nanjing for even two weeks.

In his memoir, General Li Zongren pointed out that Chiang&#x27;s staff had proposed that the Chinese army reserve around ten divisions along the Wufu Line to protect Nanjing and felt it made no difference if Shanghai could be held for a few months longer at the expense of huge casualties. However, as China was not able to defeat Japan single-handedly, Chiang believed the best option was to bring the western powers into the war by eliciting international sympathy being committed to the resistance in Shanghai.

In his correspondence with Hu Shih, Chiang wrote that China was capable of withstanding six months of combat before changes in the international situation would have to end the war. This may have also caused Chiang to devote all of his best troops in the first battle of what would eventually become a prolonged war. However, while Chiang&#x27;s initial assessment was overly optimistic, China continued to fight for eight more years until Japan finally surrendered after the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

<text>The M24 Sniper Weapon System (SWS) or M24 is the military and police version of the Remington Model 700 rifle, &quot;M24&quot; being the model name assigned by the United States Army after adoption as their standard sniper rifle in 1988. The M24 is referred to as a &quot;weapon system&quot; because it consists of not only a rifle, but also a detachable telescopic sight and other accessories.

The M24 SWS has the &quot;long action&quot; bolt version of the Remington 700 receiver but is chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO &quot;short action&quot; cartridge that has an overall length of . The &quot;long action&quot; allows the rifle to be re-configured for dimensionally larger cartridges up to in overall length.

The M24 originally came tapped for the Leupold Ultra M3A 10×42mm fixed-power scope, which came with a circle-shaped mil-dot glass-etched reticle. This was later replaced in 1998 by the Leupold Mk 4 LR/T M1 10×40mm fixed-power scope with an elongated-shaped mil-dot wire reticle. The rifle also comes with a detachable Harris 9–13&quot; 1A2-LM or Harris 9–13&quot; 1A2-L bipod unit.

The M24 SWS was to be replaced with the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System, a contract awarded to Knight&#x27;s Armament Company. However, the Army still continued to acquire M24s from Remington until February 2010 and upgraded to the A2 and M24E1 standard in many cases, continuing to serve. The Army chose to upgrade all its M24 rifles in the arsenals to the M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle, with the final M24 being converted in April 2014.

==Specifications==

Scope: Leupold Ultra M3A 10×42mm fixed power, or Leupold Mk 4 LR/T M3 10×40mm fixed power scope. Detachable emergency Redfield-Palma International back-up iron sights, they are attached to iron sight bases that are screwed into drilled and tapped holes machined into the front of the barrel and back on the left side of the receiver. In 2001 when Remington had the second contract to the U.S. military, minor changes were done to the M24. These changes included two piece Leupold Mark 4 scope ring bases instead of the one piece on the first series rifles, and a switch from Redfield-Palma International iron sights to another manufacturer OK Weber. Redfield was out of business by then, necessitating a change.

Barrel: Made of 416R stainless steel. The bore twist is 1-turn-in-11.25 inches [1:285.75 mm] and the rifling is five radial lands and grooves (5-R) with a right-hand (RH) twist. Because of the odd number of lands, none of the lands are 180° apart, i.e. in direct opposition. This results in less bullet deformation, which (at least in theory) produces more consistent point of impact. In 5-R rifling, the &quot;side&quot; of the land is cut at a 65° angle, rather than 90° in conventional rifling. This results in less barrel fouling, and more consistent point of impact, compared to conventional rifling when relatively high numbers of rounds are fired between cleaning, as might be expected in military applications.

Stock: H-S Precision PST-024, the model with the fixed cheek piece, adjustable LOP and hinged floorplate. The stock secures the action via an aluminum bedding block to keep it rigid. The barrel is free floating. A twin-strut extension that pulls out of the butt allows a adjustment to length-of-pull, as well as allowing for the weapon to fit inside the M-1950 Weapon Container for Airborne Operations. This is effected by a thick wheel on a central grooved pillar for adjusting the length and a thin locking ring behind it locks the thick wheel in place. The stock is primarily made from a polymer foam reinforced with fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar to reduce weight and then painted with a heavy duty polane paint. They were rigorously tested before being approved by Remington and the military.

Accuracy: According to MIL-R-71126(AR), 3.15.7 Targeting and Accuracy, The rifle shall achieve the dispersion set forth below when fired from a Government approved machine rest. The average mean radius shall be less than or equal to the values stated below. The minimum rate of fire for conducting this test shall be three rounds per minute.

Range / Average Mean Radius (AMR) — Mean Radius (MR) expresses the average distance of all the shots from the center of the shot group. AMR averages the MR of several shot groups.
* : 1.3 inches
* : 1.4 inches
* : 1.9 inches
The radial distance from the calculated center of impact of the first target compared to the calculated center of impacts of the subsequent targets shall be less or equal to 1.086 MOA (3.3 inches @ 300 yards, 2.2 inches @ 200 yards, 2.4 inches @ 200 meters) on an average basis.

The actual rifle requirements for accuracy were .35 MOA from a machine rest and according to Major John Mende (ret.), this accuracy had to be maintained to 10,000 rounds. He stated, &quot;Interesting side note was there was a 10,000 round requirement for the barrel to maintain the original accuracy. In fact after some 10,000 round tests we discovered the accuracy improved. A few barrels were tested past 20,000 and accuracy never went below the original accuracy requirement.&quot;
Maximum effective range is given as , but record shots have been made with the M24 at over . Meanwhile, the standard optical sight has a maximum elevation adjustment of .

==M24 variants==
===XM24A1===
An experimental variant re-chambered for the .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62×67mm) round. It was not adopted by the US Army due to concerns that operators would not be able to acquire the special ammo. Also, the available .300 Winchester Magnum ammo that was procured sometimes misfired due to incompletely-burned propellant in the longer cartridge. Redick Arms Development further researched this concept, which eventually grew into the RAD M91A1 (7.62x51mm NATO) and M91A2 (.300 Winchester Magnum). These rifles were adopted by the US Navy SEALs.

===M24A2===
Remington has developed an improved version of the M24 rifle, known as the M24A2. The A2 model features a detachable 5-round magazine, top-mounted and adjustable side-mounted Picatinny rails (advertised by Remington as &quot;MARS&quot;, or Modular Accessory Rail System), barrel modifications designed to accommodate a sound suppressor, and an improved H-S Precision PST-026 stock with adjustable cheek height and length of pull. Existing M24s can also be converted into M24A2s, which replaces the stock and adds the new detachable magazine feed. The conversion requires a re-barreling of the weapon so it can take the OPS silencer.

===M24A3===
Remington developed the M24A3 SWS, a variant of the M24 chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum round (8.58×70mm) and feeding from a 5-round detachable box magazine. It comes tapped for the Leupold Mk 4 M1LR/T 8.5–25×50mm Variable Power day scope. It can also use detachable front and rear Back-Up Iron Sights in an emergency (BUIS units are standard accessories that can be fitted to the Picatinny Rail that runs on the top of the receiver and along the barrel).

===U.S. Army 2009 solicitation for an M24 reconfiguration===
The U.S. Army put out a solicitation in May 2009 for reconfiguring M24 Sniper Weapon Systems currently available in Army inventory consisting of a:
* Rebarreling/rechambering the SWS&#x27;s barrel optimized to accommodate Mk 248 (DODIC A191) .300 Winchester Magnum ammunition.
* Replacement of existing weaver rails with a MIL-STD-1913 rail capable of accommodating both a day optic and in-line forward mounted, AN/PVS-26 (NSN 5855-01-538-8121) image intensified (I2) night vision device.
* Reconfiguring the stock with a stock that incorporates a detachable box magazine, adjustable comb and length of pull.
* Addition of a detachable sound suppressor as well as any necessary barrel modifications required for a sound suppressor interface.
* Replacement of the existing day optic sight (DOS) and rings with an Army specified variable power day optic and compatible rings.

The US government purchased MK 248 MOD 1 .300 Winchester Magnum match-grade ammunition in 2009 for use in .300 Winchester Magnum sniper rifles like the U.S. Navy Mk.13 MOD 5 rifle or reconfigured M24 SWSs. This ammunition was developed as a .300 Winchester Magnum Match Product Improvement (PIP) and uses the 14.26 g (220 gr) Sierra MatchKing Hollow Point Boat Tail (HPBT) very-low-drag bullet fired at a nominal muzzle velocity of ± . According to the U.S. Navy, this ammunition should increase the maximum effective range of .300 Winchester Magnum sniper rifle systems to , decrease wind deflection on bullets in flight and use a reduced muzzle flash propellant that remains temperature stable across an operational temperature range of .

===2010 M24E1 Enhanced Sniper Rifle reconfiguration competition===


In September 2010, the United States Army&#x27;s Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center awarded Remington a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract (W15QKN-10-R-0403) for the upgrade of up to 3,600 M24 Sniper Weapon Systems currently fielded to the Army pending type classification as the M24E1 Enhanced Sniper Rifle (ESR). Later, the Enhanced Sniper Rifle was classified as the XM2010. The major configuration change for this system is the conversion from 7.62×51mm NATO to dimensionally larger .300 Winchester Magnum ammunition exploiting the M24&#x27;s &quot;long action&quot; bolt to provide additional precision and range.

The M24E1/XM2010 is considered a &quot;total conversion upgrade&quot;, by which the barrel, stock, magazines, muzzle brake, suppressor, and even the optics will be changed. Besides the rechambering and rebarreling with a 610 mm (24 in) long, 254 mm (1 in 10 inch) twist rate (5R) hammer-forged barrel the main reconfiguration changes compared to 7.62×51mm NATO chambered M24 rifles are:
* Fitting a new chassis (stock) assembly, which maximizes the amount of physical adjustments for the sniper to provide a better user customized fit. The chassis has a folding buttstock that shortens the system for easier transport and better concealment during movement and accommodates the mounting of accessories via removable MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rails.
* Fitting a 5-round detachable box magazine.
* Fitting a quick-attachable/detachable Advanced Armament Corp. sound suppressor with muzzle brake.
* Fitting a Leupold Mark 4 6.5–20×50mm ER/T M5 Front Focal variable power telescopic sight featuring a 30 mm tube diameter, first focal plane Horus Vision H-37 grid system range estimation reticle and Bullet Drop Compensation.
* Applying advanced corrosion resistant coatings throughout the system.

According to Remington Arms, each rifle is tested to meet (and typically exceeds) the requirement to fire ≤ 1 MOA (less than a 2-inch shot group at 200 yards) before being released for fielding.

Based on the results and feedback from troops, the U.S. Army decided in May 2011 to replace its entire fleet of M24s, ordering a total of 2,558 M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifles. By September 2012, the Army had fielded more than 1,400 systems as part of an urgent material release. The M2010 achieved Type Classification-Standard in July 2013 and Full Materiel Release in September 2013, supporting procurement for the balance of the Army requirement. On April 25, 2014, the 2,558th M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle was completed.

===IDF modernized M24===
In 2019, the Israel Defense Forces started to upgrade the M24 and replace the stock and receiver of the old M24 rifles with a modern MDT Defense M24 Chassis stock assembly with AR15/M16 pistol grip that increases the number of physical adjustments to individual ergonomic preferences, magazine feeding and an M-LOK forend with attachable MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails around the barrel. The modernized M24 entered service in 2021.

==Differences between M24 and M40==
The U.S. Marine Corps also uses the Remington 700/40x action as the basis for its M40 Sniper Weapon System. The primary difference between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps rifles is that while the U.S. Marine Corps M40 variants use the short-action version of the Remington 700/40x (which is designed for shorter cartridges such as the .308 Winchester/7.62×51 mm NATO), the U.S. Army M24 uses the Remington 700 Long Action. Despite the fact that the M24 comes fitted with a 7.62×51mm NATO barrel upon issue, retaining the longer action allows them to reconfigure the rifle in dimensionally larger cartridge chamberings if necessary (which has been the case during the longer engagement distances during Operation Enduring Freedom). Long actions also increase reliability and reduce jamming by reducing the angle of cartridges leaving the magazine and permit long, low-drag heavy-for-caliber bullets to be loaded in short-action cartridges that otherwise would not fit in short-action cartridges, magazines and receivers.

The U.S. Army reconfigured their M24 rifles to M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifles rechambering the original M24 rifles to .300 Winchester Magnum. The USMC M40A3 uses a Schneider barrel and the U.S. Army M24 used a Rock Creek 5R barrel.

<doc id="504627" wikidata="Q927829" url="?curid=504627" title="Chardon Lagache station">
<text>Chardon Lagache () is a station on the Paris Métro in the 16th arrondissement, serving line 10 (eastbound only). It is named after the nearby &quot;rue Chardon Lagache&quot;, which was named after a local retirement home. It is one of the few métro stations to have been named after a woman, after Bagneux–Lucie Aubrac, Barbara, Barbès–Rochechouart, Boucicaut, Louise Michel, Madeleine, and Pierre et Marie Curie.

== History ==
The station opened on 30 September 1913 as part of the extension of line 8 from Charles Michels (then known as &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot; ) to Porte d&#x27;Auteuil. On 27 July 1937, the section of line 8 between La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle and Porte d&#x27;Auteuil, including Michel-Ange–Molitor was transferred to line 10 during the reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14. However, service between Porte d&#x27;Auteuil and Jussieu was not provided until two days later, on July 29, with service initially limited to La Motte-Picquet-Grenelle. Line 10 was also extended from Duroc to La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle on the same day.

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors was renovated and modernised on 18 May 2006.

In 2019, the station was used by 692,665 passengers, making it the 295th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 331,901 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 295th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 482,053 passengers, making it the 296th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has a single Guimard entrance, rue Chardon Lagache &quot;Hôpital Sainte-Périne&quot;. It was listed as a historical monument on 12 February 2016. The corridors from the entrance to the mezzanine are unusually adorned with green ceramic friezes, typically seen on métro stations built by the Nord-Sud Company.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platform ===
The station has a single curved side platform with a single tracks, only serving trains towards Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 22 and 62 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N12 and N61 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Mirabeau () is a rapid transit station on Line 10 of the Paris Métro system. Located in the 16th arrondissement of the city, it is served solely by eastbound trains to Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz. It is located in close proximity to Église d&#x27;Auteuil (with their accesses are less than 100 m apart), and as such, the two stations can be considered twins, with &quot;Mirabeau&quot; serving eastbound traffic and &quot;Église d&#x27;Auteuil&quot; serving westbound traffic, albeit with separate entrances and exits. The station is named after the nearby rue Mirabeau, under which it runs. It was in turn named after Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, the Count of Mirabeau, a leader during the early stages of the French Revolution. The station is near the Pont Mirabeau.

==History==
The station opened on 30 September 1913 as part of the extension of line 8 from Charles Michels (then known as &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot;) to Porte d&#x27;Auteuil. On 27 July 1937, the section of line 8 between La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle and Porte d&#x27;Auteuil, including Mirabeau was transferred to line 10 during the reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14. However, service between Porte d&#x27;Auteuil and Jussieu was not provided until two days later, on July 29, with service initially limited to La Motte-Picquet-Grenelle. 

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors was renovated and modernised on 15 September 2006.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,377,611 passengers, making it the 281st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 724,167 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 277th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,001,302 passengers, making it the 284th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 2 accesses divided amongst 3 access points:

* Access 1: avenue de Versailles (with a Guimard entrance – it was listed as a historical monument on 12 February 2016)
* Access 2: rue Mirabeau (with a rare &quot;Val d&#x27;Osne&quot; totem)

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a unique configuration in which it only has a single side platform that serves only one track – the eastbound track for trains heading towards &quot;Javel–André Citroën&quot;. The westbound track, however, does not have a platform that serves it. Instead, it has an ascending ramp for trains heading towards &quot;Église d&#x27;Auteuil&quot; and diverges at the western end of the station. This ramp enables the westbound track to stay near the surface to reach &quot;Église d&#x27;Auteuil&quot; as &quot;Mirabeau&quot; is relatively deep underground due to the tunnels between it &quot;Javel–André Citroën&quot; needing to pass under the Seine.
=== Other connections ===

<text>Porte d&#x27;Auteuil () is a métro station serving Line 10 (westbound only). It is situated in the 16th arrondissement.

== History ==
The station opened on 30 September 1913 as part of the extension of line 8 from &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot; (now Charles Michels). On 29 July 1937, line 10 was extended from Duroc to La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle and the section of line 8 between &quot;La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle&quot; and &quot;Porte d&#x27;Auteuil&quot;, including &quot;Porte d&#x27;Auteuil&quot; was transferred to line 10. Prior to 3 October 1980, when the line was extended to Boulogne - Jean Jaurès, trains ran on to Michel-Ange - Molitor to return to the east. The station is named after the &quot;Porte d&#x27;Auteuil&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers wall of Paris, which was located in the district of &quot;Auteuil&quot;, which was mostly incorporated in the 16th arrondissement in 1860, with the remainder absorbed into the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt.

<text>The pronoun who, in English, is an interrogative pronoun and a relative pronoun, used primarily to refer to persons.

Unmarked, &quot;who&quot; is the pronoun&#x27;s subjective form; its inflected forms are the objective &quot;whom&quot; and the possessive &quot;whose&quot;. The set has derived indefinite forms &quot;whoever&quot;, &quot;whomever&quot;, and &quot;whoseever,&quot; as well as a further, earlier such set &quot;whosoever,&quot; &quot;whomsoever&quot;, and &quot;whosesoever&quot; (see also &quot;-ever&quot;).

==Etymology==
The interrogative and relative pronouns &quot;who&quot; derive from the Old English singular interrogative , and whose paradigm is set out below:

It was not until the end of the 17th century that &quot;who&quot; became the only pronoun that could ask about the identity of persons and &quot;what&quot; fully lost this ability. 

&quot;The first occurrences of wh-relatives date from the twelfth century (with the possible exception (see Kivimaa 1966: 35)). The wh- form does not become frequent, however, until the fourteenth century.&quot; Today, relative &quot;whose&quot; can still refer to non-persons (e.g., &quot;the car whose door won&#x27;t open&quot;).

The spelling &#x27;who&#x27; does not correspond to the word&#x27;s pronunciation ; it is the spelling that represents the expected outcome of , while the pronunciation represents a divergent outcome – for details see Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩. The word is cognate with Latin and Greek .

==Uses==

===As interrogative pronoun===
&quot;Who&quot; and its derived forms can be used as interrogative pronouns, to form questions:

*&quot;Who did that?&quot;
*&quot;Who did you meet this morning?&quot; (formal: &quot;Who(m) did you meet this morning?&quot;)
*&quot;Who did you speak to?&quot; (formal: &quot;To whom did you speak?&quot; or &quot;Whom did you speak to?&quot;)
*&quot;Whoever could have done that?&quot; (emphatic form, expressing disbelief)
*&quot;Whose bike is that?&quot; (use of &#x27;whose&#x27; as possessive determiner/adjective; see possessive and English possessive)
*&quot;Whose do you like best?&quot; (use of &#x27;whose&#x27; as possessive pronoun)

The same forms (though not usually the emphatic ones) are used to make indirect questions:

*&quot;We don&#x27;t know who did that.&quot;
*&quot;I wonder who(m) she met this morning.&quot;

The corresponding form when referring to non-humans is &quot;what&quot; (which has the emphatic form &quot;whatever&quot;, and no possessive form). Another similar interrogative is &quot;which&quot; – this can refer to either humans or non-humans, normally implying selection from a particular set, as either interrogative pronoun (&quot;Which do you prefer?&quot;) or interrogative determiner (adjective) (&quot;Which man should I choose?&quot;). &#x27;What&#x27; can also be used as a determiner (&quot;What book are you reading?&quot;), but &#x27;who&#x27; cannot.

&quot;Which&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, and &quot;what&quot; as interrogatives can be either singular or plural (&quot;Which is the highest hill?&quot;, &quot;Which are the highest hills?&quot;, &quot;Who was born in 1920?&quot; or &quot;Who were king and queen in 1920?&quot;). &quot;Who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. The questions &quot;Who wants some cake?&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s in the bag?&quot; do not presuppose anything about number in possible responses: &quot;I want some cake&quot;, or &quot;All of us want some&quot;; and &quot;A rabbit is in the bag&quot;, or &quot;Five coins and a bus ticket&quot;.

===As relative pronoun===
The other chief use of &quot;who&quot; and its derivatives are in the formation of relative clauses:
*&quot;These are the men who work upstairs.&quot;
*&quot;This is Tom, who(m) I believe you have already met.&quot;
*&quot;I helped some lads whose car had broken down.&quot;

The corresponding form for non-humans is &quot;which&quot;, although &quot;whose&quot; can be used as a possessive in relative clauses even when referring to non-humans: &quot;I will have to fix the car whose engine I ruined.&quot;

In restrictive relative clauses, when not preceded by a preposition, both &quot;who(m)&quot; and &quot;which&quot; can be replaced by &quot;that&quot;, or (if not the subject of the clause) by zero. In relative clauses, &quot;who&quot; (like other relative pronouns) takes the number (singular or plural) of its antecedent. &quot;Who&quot; also takes the person (first, second or third) of its antecedent:

* &quot;I, who &#x27;am&#x27; having a hard time right now, won&#x27;t be able to help you.&quot;
* &quot;I, a tired old man who &#x27;is&#x27; fed up with all your nonsense, refuse to help you.&quot;

&quot;Who&quot; and &quot;whom&quot; can also be used to form free relative clauses (those with no antecedent). The emphatic forms are often used for this purpose: informal: &quot;I&#x27;ll take whoever you choose&quot;; formal: &quot;I&#x27;ll take whomever/whomsoever you choose&quot;. This corresponds to the use of &quot;what(ever)&quot; when referring to non-humans. (For the choice between &quot;who(ever)&quot; and &quot;whom(ever)&quot; in formal English, see below.)

The emphatic forms can also be used to make adverbial clauses, as in &quot;Whomever/Whoever you choose, I&#x27;ll be satisfied&quot;.

For more details, see English relative clauses.

==Usage of &quot;whom&quot;==
===Tendency to replace &quot;whom&quot; with &quot;who&quot;===

According to traditional prescriptive grammar, &quot;who&quot; is the subjective (nominative) form only, while &quot;whom&quot; ( ) is the corresponding objective form (just as &quot;him&quot; is the objective form corresponding to &quot;he&quot;). It has long been common, particularly in informal English, for the uninflected form &quot;who&quot; to be used in both cases, thus replacing &quot;whom&quot; in the contexts where the latter was traditionally used.

In 1975, S. Potter noted in &quot;Changing English&quot; that, &quot;nearly half a century ago Edward Sapir predicted the demise of &quot;whom&quot;, showing at great length that it was doomed because it was &#x27;psychologically isolated&#x27; from the objective pronouns me, us, him, her, them on the one hand, and the invariables which, what, that and where, when, how, why on the other.&quot; By 1978, the &#x27;who&#x27;–&#x27;whom&#x27; distinction was identified as having &quot;slipped so badly that [it is] almost totally uninformative&quot;. According to the OED (2nd edition, 1989), &quot;whom&quot; is &quot;no longer current in natural colloquial speech&quot;. Lasnik and Sobin argue that surviving occurrences of &quot;whom&quot; are not part of ordinary English grammar, but the result of extra-grammatical rules for producing &quot;prestige&quot; forms.

According to Mair, the decline of &quot;whom&quot; has been hastened by the fact that it is one of relatively few synthetic (inflected) remnants in the principally analytical grammar of Modern English. It has also been claimed that the decline of &quot;whom&quot; is more advanced in the interrogative case than in the relative case, this possibly being related to the degree of complexity of the syntax.

Some prescriptivists continue to defend &quot;whom&quot; as the only &quot;correct&quot; form in functions other than the subject. Mair notes that: &quot;&#x27;whom&#x27; is moribund as an element of the core grammar of English, but is very much alive as a style marker whose correct use is acquired in the educational system [, where it is taught]. [The use of &quot;whom&quot;] is highly restricted, but rather than disappear entirely, the form is likely to remain in use for some time to come because of its overt prestige in writing.&quot;

Whom is also sometimes used by way of hypercorrection, in places where it would not even be considered correct according to traditional rules, as in &quot;Whom do you think you are?&quot; For more examples see the section below.

Retention of the &#x27;who&#x27;–&#x27;whom&#x27; distinction often co-occurs with another stylistic marker of formal or &quot;prestige&quot; Englishavoidance of the stranded preposition. This means that &quot;whom&quot; can frequently be found following a preposition, in cases where the usual informal equivalent would use &quot;who&quot; and place the preposition later in the sentence. For example:

* Formal: &quot;To whom did you give it?&quot;
* Informal: &quot;Who did you give it to?&quot;

In relative clauses, movement of the preposition further allows &quot;who&quot; to be replaced by &quot;that&quot; or removed entirely:

* Formal: &quot;He is someone to whom I owe a great deal.&quot;
* Informal: &quot;He is someone who I owe a great deal to&quot;, or &quot;He is someone that I owe a great deal to&quot;, or &quot;He is someone I owe a great deal to...&quot;

===Difference between &quot;who&quot; and &quot;whom&quot;===
In the types of English in which &quot;whom&quot; is used (which are generally the more formal varieties, as described in the section above), the general grammatical rule is that &quot;who&quot; is the subjective (nominative) form, analogous to the personal pronouns &quot;I&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, while &quot;whom&quot; is the objective (oblique) form, analogous to &quot;me&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. Thus, &quot;who&quot; is used as a verb subject, while &quot;whom&quot; is used as an indirect or direct object of a verb or as the object (complement) of a preposition.

Examples:
*As verb subject: &quot;Who is waiting over there? Tom is someone who works hard&quot; (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: &quot;&#x27;He&#x27; works hard.&quot;)
*As verb object: &quot;Whom do you support? She is someone whom many people admire.&quot; (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: &quot;Many people admire &#x27;her&#x27;.&quot;)
*As preposition complement: &quot;On whom do you plan to rely? These are the players of whom I am most proud.&quot; (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: &quot;I am most proud of &#x27;them&#x27;.&quot;)

Notice that in a relative clause, the form depends on the role of the pronoun in the relative clause, not that of its antecedent in the main clause. For example, &quot;I saw the man who ate the pie&quot;not &quot;whom&quot;, since &quot;who&quot; is the subject of &quot;ate&quot; (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: &quot;&#x27;He&#x27; ate the pie&quot;); it makes no difference that its antecedent &quot;(the) man&quot; is the object of &quot;saw&quot;.

In the position of predicative expression, i.e. as the complement of forms of the copula &quot;be&quot;, the form &quot;who&quot; is used, and considered correct, rather than &quot;whom&quot;. (Compare the case of the personal pronouns, where the subjective form is traditionally considered correct, although the objective forms are more commonly usedsee .)

*&quot;Who were those people?&quot;
*&quot;Who is this?&quot;, or &quot;Who is it?&quot; Compare: &quot;It is I&quot; (formal, and traditionally correct) to &quot;it is me&quot; (informal, but now common usage).

In the examples that follow, notice how, when the verb is a form of &quot;be&quot;, the question &quot;Who is the captain of the team?&quot; or the noun clause &quot;who the captain of the team is&quot; (we know it is a noun clause because it replaces the word &quot;something&quot;) is the same regardless of whether the original placement of the unknown person was before or after &quot;be&quot; (is):

*She asked something. John is captain of the team. 
**Interrogative: She asked, &quot;&#x27;Who&#x27; is captain of the team?&quot;
**Noun clause: She asked &quot;who the captain of the team is&quot;.
*She asked something. The captain of the team is John.
**Interrogative: She asked, &quot;&#x27;Who&#x27; is captain of the team?&quot;
**Noun clause: She asked &quot;who the captain of the team is&quot;.

==== Ambiguous cases ====
A problem sometimes arises in constructions like this:

*&quot;Beethoven, &#x27;who&#x27; you say was a great composer, wrote only one opera.&quot;

Use of &quot;who&quot; here is normal, and to replace it with &#x27;whom&#x27; would be grammatically incorrect, since the pronoun is the subject of &quot;was&quot;, not the object of &quot;say&quot;. (One would write &quot;You say [that] &#x27;he&#x27; [not &#x27;him&#x27;] was a great composer&quot;.) Nevertheless, &quot;whom&quot; is quite commonly encountered, and even defended, in sentences of this type. It may arise from confusion with a form like:

*&quot;Beethoven, whom you believe [or &quot;whom you believe to be&quot;] a great composer, wrote only one opera.&quot;

In this case, &quot;whom&quot; is used correctly according to the traditional rules, since it is now the object of the verb &quot;believe&quot;. (One would write &quot;You believe him [not &#x27;he&#x27;] (to be) a great composer.&quot;)

The use of &quot;whom&quot; in sentences of the first type (&quot;Beethoven, whom you say was a great composer...&quot;)referred to as &quot;subject &#x27;whom&#x27; can therefore be regarded as a hypercorrection, resulting from awareness of a perceived need to correct &quot;who&quot; to &quot;whom&quot; in sentences of the second type. Examples of this apparently ungrammatical usage can be found throughout the history of English. The &quot;OED&quot; traces it back to the 15thcentury, while Jespersen cites even earlier examples from Chaucer. More examples are given below:

*&quot;Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown&#x27;d, [...]&quot; (Shakespeare, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, III, 3)
*&quot;[...] going to seek the grave / Of Arthur, whom they say is kill&#x27;d to-night / On your suggestion.&quot; (Shakespeare, &quot;King John&quot;, IV, 2)
*&quot;[...] the rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were come to themselves, all but him whom they thought had been dead; [...]&quot; (Defoe, &quot;The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Chapter 6, Part 1. Use of &quot;whom&quot; here may be due partly to the proximity of &quot;him&quot;.)
*&quot;But if others were involved, it was Harris and Klebold whom students said seemed the tightest, who stood apart from the rest of their clique.&quot; (From &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, Melbourne, Australia, April 1999, in an article syndicated from the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. The original article had the &quot;correct&quot; &quot;who&quot;. Note that the continuation with the parallel construction &quot;who stood apart&quot; illustrates how the use of subject &quot;whom&quot; can lead to inconsistencies.)
*&quot;He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?&quot; (King James Bible, Matthew 16:15. Technically &quot;whom&quot; here is not a subject, but the complement of the copula &quot;am&quot;; but in this position too it is &quot;who&quot; that would be expected according to the traditional grammatical rules as given in the section above, as it would be in &quot;Who am I?&quot;)

Doubts can also arise in the case of free relative clauses, formed with &quot;who(m)&quot;, &quot;who(m)ever&quot; or &quot;who(m)soever&quot;. Modern guides to English usage say that the relative pronoun should take the case appropriate to the relative clause, not the function performed by that clause within an external clause. For example, it is correct to write &quot;I&#x27;ll talk to whoever&quot; [not &quot;whomever&quot;] &quot;will listen&quot;, since &quot;whoever&quot; is the subject of &quot;will listen&quot; (regardless of the fact that the entire clause &quot;whoever will listen&quot; serves as the object of the preposition &quot;to&quot;). On the other hand, &quot;Whomever you choose will suit me&quot; is correct, since &quot;whomever&quot; is now the object of &quot;choose&quot; (despite the fact that the entire relative clause is the subject of &quot;will suit&quot;).

Similarly:
*&quot;Let whoever is without sin cast the first stone.&quot; (In the internal clause, &quot;whoever&quot; is the subject of &quot;is&quot;.)
*&quot;Whom you choose will be placed on this list.&quot; (In the internal clause, &quot;whom&quot; is the object of &quot;choose&quot;.)
In sentences of this type, as with the &quot;subject &quot;whom&quot;&quot; examples above, use of &quot;whom(ever)&quot; is sometimes found in places where it would not be expected grammatically, due to the relative complexity of the syntax. In fact in Middle English it was standard for the form of the pronoun to depend on the function in the external clause; the modern rule came about through re-analysis of the pronoun as primarily an element of the internal clause.

==Usage of &quot;whose&quot;==

&quot;Whose&quot; is the genitive case of &quot;who&quot;.
* &quot;The boy whose name I don&#x27;t remember came from Japan.&quot;

Unlike the other forms of &quot;who&quot;, relative &quot;whose&quot; (but not interrogative &quot;whose&quot;) can still refer to non-persons, in the way that all forms of the word could in Old and Middle English.

* &quot;The cars &quot;whose &quot;door won&#x27;t open.&quot;
