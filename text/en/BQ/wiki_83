<doc id="505307" wikidata="Q844977" url="?curid=505307" title="Island of California">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The Island of California () refers to the long-held global misconception, dating from the 16th century, that the California region was not part of mainland North America but rather a large island separated from the continent by a strait now known to be the Gulf of California.

One of the most famous cartographic errors in history, it was propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, like the Garden of Eden or Atlantis. This mapping error was not a one-off event. From the mid-1500s to the late 1700s great controversy surrounded the geography of California. For instance, a Spanish map from 1548 depicts California as a peninsula, while a 1622 Dutch map depicts California as an island. A 1626 Portuguese map depicts the land as a peninsula, while a 1630 British map depicts it as an island. A French map from 1682 only shows the tip of the Baja Peninsula. There are slightly over 1,000 maps in Stanford&#x27;s &quot;Glen McLaughlin Collection of California as an Island&quot;, the largest collection of such maps in the world.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== History ==
The first known mention of the legend of the &quot;Island of California&quot; was in the 1510 romance novel &quot;&quot; by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo—the sequel to Montalvo&#x27;s more famous tales of , father of Esplandian. He described the island in this passage:

Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons.

It is thought that, because of the widespread popularity of &quot;Las sergas de Esplandián&quot; at the time of European exploration of California, that it is reasonable that the book inspired the naming of California. The book&#x27;s description is also thought to have prompted early explorers to misidentify the Baja California peninsula as the island in these legends.

In 1533, Fortún Ximénez, a mutineer on an exploring expedition sent by Hernán Cortés, discovered the southern portion of Baja California, around present-day La Paz. He was killed by natives but his men returned to New Spain and reported on their find. In 1535, Cortés arrived in the bay there and named the area Santa Cruz; he attempted to start a colony but abandoned his efforts after several years due to logistical problems. Cortés&#x27; limited information on southern Baja California apparently led to the naming of the region after the legendary California and to an initial but short-lived assumption that it was a large island.

In 1539, Cortés sent the navigator Francisco de Ulloa northward along the Gulf and Pacific coasts of Baja California. Ulloa reached the mouth of the Colorado River at the head of the Gulf, which seemed to prove that the region was a peninsula rather than an island. Ulloa was quoted as having described the land he saw on his expedition as, &quot;High and bare, of wretched aspect without any verdure.&quot; An expedition under Hernando de Alarcón ascended the lower Colorado River and confirmed Ulloa&#x27;s finding. Maps published subsequently in Europe during the 16th century, including those by Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, correctly showed Baja California as a peninsula.

Rather than many cartographers independently making the same mistake, it is thought that maps of California as an island spread due to copying in the early 1600s, since it is known that cartographers of the time frequently made copies of other maps. Interestingly, the first maps depicting California as an island originated after a series of correct maps. Carmelite friar , a priest at the top of the Spanish church, was the first known person to depict California as an island in 1603.

On the return voyage to Acapulco, Mexico, Friar Antonio&#x27;s ship was overtaken by Dutch pirates who found and confiscated a map drawn by him that depicted California as an island, effectively leaking state-secret information. Spain was not in the habit of willingly sharing information about their expeditions— in fact, maps produced by Sebastián Vizcaíno, the leader of the expedition that brought friar Antonio de la Ascensión to California, were not published until 1802, two hundred years after the expedition occurred. Shortly after the map was confiscated from Friar Antonio&#x27;s ship, Dutch maps were published depicting California as an island. At the bottom left corner of a British map from 1630 drawn by Henry Briggs is scribbled &quot;California, sometimes supposed to be a part of the western continent, but since by a Spanish chart taken from Hollanders, it is found to be a goodly island&quot;. This stolen map was Friar Antonio&#x27;s, and this quote provides evidence for the spread of knowledge of California as an island. As the Dutch were reputable cartographers, it is thought that word of California as an island began to spread, as the majority of maps depicting California as an island were published after 1622. Throughout the 1600s, the Dutch, Japanese, French, Germans, British, and more all drew California as an island.

Another contributing factor may have been the second voyage of Juan de Fuca in 1592. De Fuca claimed to have explored the western coast of North America and to have found a large opening that possibly connected to the Atlantic Ocean — the legendary Northwest Passage. Finding a Northwest Passage was something that motivated many of the explorers coming to the California coast at the time, as it would be extremely profitable for Europe if a northern trade route to Asia could be found. In fact, explorers like Sebastián Vizcaíno were operating under orders to sail north until they found the Northwest Passage, and only to turn around if the coast veered northwest, which would imply that there was no waterway and the land was actually connected to Asia. De Fuca&#x27;s claim remains controversial because there is only one surviving written account of it found, his account as related to an Englishman, Michael Locke. Nonetheless, this account claims de Fuca found a large strait, with a large island at its mouth, at around 47° north latitude. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is in fact at around 48° N, as is the southern tip of the large island now called Vancouver Island, while the northern reach of the Gulf of California terminates much farther south, at about 31° N. It is possible that explorers and mapmakers in the 17th century could have confused the two (if, in fact, they were aware of de Fuca&#x27;s voyage), and in any case further exploration was inevitable. Indeed, the famed British explorer James Cook narrowly missed the Strait of Juan de Fuca in March 1778, almost 200 years later. Cook even named Cape Flattery (at the northwest tip of modern Washington state) which is at the mouth of the strait, and stopped in Nootka Sound just off the west coast of Vancouver Island at about 49° N. His account states &quot;we saw nothing like [the Strait of Juan de Fuca]; nor is there the least probability that ever any such thing existed.&quot; However, Cook describes some bad weather in his account around this time, and did continue on to map most of the outer Pacific coastline of North America from modern-day northern California to the Bering Strait in Alaska on the same voyage.

A key role in changing ideas about California seems to have been played by an overland expedition led by the founding governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, Juan de Oñate. The expedition descended the Colorado River in 1604 and 1605, and its participants believed that they saw the Gulf of California continuing off to the northwest (presumably behind the Sierra de Los Cucapah into the Laguna Salada Basin and Lake Cahuilla, but was more likely due to the California Superflood of 1605, in which the flooded Central and Indio Valley basins did essentially appear to extend the peninsula hundreds of miles northward).

Reports from Oñate&#x27;s expedition reached Antonio de la Ascención, a Carmelite friar who had participated in Sebastián Vizcaíno&#x27;s explorations of the west coast of California in 1602 and 1603. Ascención was a tireless propagandist in favor of Spanish settlement in California, and his later writings referred to the region as an island. As older maps confirm, Spanish authorities and local residents were well aware where the actual northern terminus of the Gulf of California lay, but by extending the coastline north past Cape Mendocino and eventually even into Puget Sound, Francis Drake&#x27;s claim of Nova Albion for England (1579) could be invalidated by the priority of Cortes&#x27; claim (1533).

The Jesuit missionary and cartographer Eusebio Francisco Kino revived the fact that Baja California was a peninsula. While studying in Europe, Kino had accepted the insularity of California, but when he reached Mexico he began to have doubts. He made a series of overland expeditions from northern Sonora to areas within or near the Colorado River&#x27;s delta in 1698–1706, in part to provide a practical route between the Jesuits&#x27; missions in Sonoran and Baja California but also to resolve the geographical question. Kino satisfied himself that a land connection must exist, and the 18th century Jesuits generally followed his example. The first report of Kino&#x27;s discovery and his map from 1701 showing California as a peninsula were sent to Europe by Marcus Antonius Kappus, a Jesuit missionary from Kamna Gorica (Duchy of Carniola, now Slovenia). In a June 1701 letter, he wrote about that to his friend Philippus Alberth in Vienna and thus acted as an important intermediary in the dissemination of this knowledge. However, Juan Mateo Manje, a military companion on several of Kino&#x27;s treks, expressed scepticism; European cartographers remained divided on the question.

Jesuit missionary-explorers in Baja California who attempted to lay the issue finally to rest included Juan de Ugarte (1721), Ferdinand Konščak (1746), and Wenceslaus Linck (1766). The matter was settled beyond all dispute when the expeditions of Juan Bautista de Anza traveled between Sonora and the west coast of Alta California in the period of 1774–1776.

<text>Tabelbala (, , Korandje: &quot;tsawərbəts&quot;) is a town and commune between Béchar and Tindouf in south-western Algeria, and is the capital, and only significant settlement, of the Daïra of the same name, encompassing most of the western half of Béni Abbès Province (part of Béchar Province until 2019). As of the 2008 census, its population was 5,121, up from 4,663 in 1998, with an annual growth rate of 1.0%. The commune covers an area of , making it by far the largest commune in the province, as well as the least densely populated.

Tabelbala is notable for being the only town in Algeria to speak a language neither Arabic nor Berber, namely Korandje, which is spoken by about 3,000 people. Most of the rest of the population are descendants of twentieth-century immigrants to the oasis.

==History==

From at least the 13th to the 19th century, Tabelbala was a stop on the caravan routes linking southern Morocco (notably Sijilmasa) to the Sahel, in particular Timbuktu.

==Geography==

The oasis occupies a band of land between a stone mountain to the south and a large sand dune field, the Erg Er Raoui, to the north. The water table of the latter is relatively high, making irrigation agriculture possible. The foggara system was traditionally used, but has been in decline since the early twentieth century.

==Climate==

Tabelbala has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), with extremely hot summers and mild winters, and very little precipitation throughout the year.


==Localities==

Tabelbala town is divided into four settlements. The administrative and commercial centre, &quot;le Village&quot; or &quot;le Quartier&quot;, officially Haï El Wasat (), also simply known as &quot;Tabelbala&quot; itself, is a relatively recent settlement which first grew up around the French fort in the colonial period. It is flanked by three older villages, or ksars: Cheraïa (, &quot;Ifrenyu&quot; in Korandje) to the west, Zaouia Sidi Zekri (, &quot;Kwara&quot;) and the tiny hamlet of Makhlouf (, &quot;Yami&quot;) to the east.

The commune is formally composed of seven localities:

*Tabelbala
*Cheraïa
*Zaouia Sidi Zekri
*Makhlouf
*Zeraïb
*Boutbiga
*Hassi Kharet
==Economy==

Agriculture is the main industry in Tabelbala. The commune has a total of of arable land, of which is irrigated. There are a total of 139,183 date palms planted in the commune. As of 2009 there were 3,549 sheep, 9,949 goats, and 4,810 camels. There were also 138000 chickens.

==Infrastructure and housing==

97% of Tabelbala&#x27;s population are connected to drinking water, 100% are connected to the sewerage system, and 99% (including 2,527 buildings) have access to electricity. The city has a 3,048 kW power plant. There is one fuel service station in the town.

Tabelbala has a total of 1,083 houses, of which 625 are occupied, giving an occupation rate of 8.2 inhabitants per occupied building, the third highest in the province after Ouled Khoudir and Timoudi.

==Culture==

Much of the Korandje-speaking population of Ifrenyu claims descent from the Ait Isfoul sub-branch of the Ait Atta Berber confederation; there are also a few Tamazight-speaking families from the Ait Khebbach, another Ait Atta sub-group.

According to oral tradition in both places, the founders of Melouka, near Adrar, Algeria, were emigrants who escaped Tabelbala when one of its ksars was destroyed by Arab nomads, variously named as the Rehamna or Ghenanma, for non-payment of tribute. The Idaw Ali of Mauritania also claim to have lived in Tabelbala at an early period.

==Religion==

A number of reputed walis (saints) are buried in Tabelbala. In the main cemetery of Zaouia Sidi Zekri, &quot;imamaden&quot;, these include Sidi Zekri (the village&#x27;s namesake), Sidi Larbi and Sidi Brahim (each said to be the ancestor of a family found there today), and a group of seven unnamed men, the &quot;seb`atu rijal&quot; (), as well as the sixteenth-century Islamic scholar Sidi Makhluf al-Balbali, who is also memorialised in a cenotaph in the hamlet named after him, Makhlouf.

Tabelbala has 4 operational mosques, with another 2 under construction.

==Transportation==

Tabelbala&#x27;s only significant transport link to the outside world is a paved road connecting it to the main Bechar-Tindouf highway some seventy kilometres away. Tabelbala is from the provincial capital, Béchar.

There is a total length of of roads in the commune.

==Education==

There are 5 elementary schools, with 37 classrooms including 24 in use. There are a total of 1,104 school students.

5.1% of the population has a tertiary education, and another 18.0% has competed secondary education. The overall literacy rate is 75.0%, and is 81.9% among males and 68.2% among females.

==Health==

Tabelbala has one polyclinic and 3 room care facilities. The nearest hospital is in Méchraâ Houari Boumédienne.

==Notable people==
* Makhluf al-Balbali, jurist

<doc id="505315" wikidata="Q1054559" url="?curid=505315" title="Celadon">
<text>Celadon () is a term for pottery denoting both wares glazed in the jade green celadon color, also known as greenware or &quot;green ware&quot; (the term specialists now tend to use), and a type of transparent glaze, often with small cracks, that was first used on greenware, but later used on other porcelains. Celadon originated in China, though the term is purely European, and notable kilns such as the Longquan kiln in Zhejiang province are renowned for their celadon glazes. Celadon production later spread to other parts of East Asia, such as Japan and Korea, as well as Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand. Eventually, European potteries produced some pieces, but it was never a major element there. Finer pieces are in porcelain, but both the color and the glaze can be produced in stoneware and earthenware. Most of the earlier Longquan celadon is on the border of stoneware and porcelain, meeting the Chinese but not the European definitions of porcelain.

For many centuries, celadon wares were highly regarded by the Chinese imperial court, before being replaced in fashion by painted wares, especially the new blue and white porcelain under the Yuan dynasty. The similarity of the color to jade, traditionally the most highly valued material in China, was a large part of its attraction. Celadon continued to be produced in China at a lower level, often with a conscious sense of reviving older styles. In Korea the celadons produced under the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) are regarded as the classic wares of Korean porcelain.

The celadon color is classically produced by firing a glaze containing a little iron oxide at a high temperature in a reducing kiln. The materials must be refined, as other chemicals can alter the color completely. Too little iron oxide causes a blue color (sometimes a desired effect), and too much gives olive and finally black; the right amount is between 0.75% and 2.5%. The presence of other chemicals may have effects; titanium dioxide gives a yellowish tinge.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;celadon&quot; for the pottery&#x27;s pale jade-green glaze was coined by European connoisseurs of the wares. The most commonly accepted theory is that the term first appeared in France in the 17th century and that it is named after the shepherd Celadon in Honoré d&#x27;Urfé&#x27;s French pastoral romance &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; (1627), who wore pale green ribbons. (D&#x27;Urfé, in turn, borrowed his character from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; V.144.) Another theory is that the term is a corruption of the name of Saladin (Salah ad-Din), the Ayyubid Sultan, who in 1171 sent forty pieces of the ceramic to Nur ad-Din Zengi, Sultan of Syria.

== Production and characteristics ==
Celadon glaze refers to a family of usually partly transparent but colored glazes, many with pronounced (and sometimes accentuated) &quot;crackle&quot;, or tiny cracks in the glaze produced in a wide variety of colors, generally used on stoneware or porcelain pottery bodies.

So-called &quot;true celadon&quot;, which requires a minimum furnace temperature, a preferred range of , and firing in a reducing atmosphere, originated at the beginning of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), at least on one strict definition. The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide&#x27;s transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Individual pieces in a single firing can have significantly different colors, from small variations in conditions in different parts of the kiln. Most of the time, green was the desired color, reminding the Chinese of jade, always the most valued material in Chinese culture.

Celadon glazes can be produced in a variety of colors, including white, grey, blue and yellow, depending on several factors:

# the thickness of the applied glaze, 
# the type of clay to which it is applied, 
# the exact chemical makeup of the glaze, 
# the firing temperature 
# the degree of reduction in the kiln atmosphere and 
# the degree of opacity in the glaze.

The most famous and desired shades range from a very pale green to deep intense green, often meaning to mimic the green shades of jade. The main color effect is produced by iron oxide in the glaze recipe or clay body. Celadons are almost exclusively fired in a reducing atmosphere kiln as the chemical changes in the iron oxide which accompany depriving it of free oxygen are what produce the desired colors.

==East Asia==
===Chinese celadons===
Greenwares are found in earthenware from the Shang dynasty onwards. Archaeologist Wang Zhongshu states that shards with a celadon ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang, and that this type of ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). These are now often called proto-celadons, and tend to browns and yellows, without much green.

The earliest major type of celadon was Yue ware, which was succeeded by a number of kilns in north China producing wares known as Northern Celadons, sometimes used by the imperial court. The best known of these is Yaozhou ware. All these types were already widely exported to the rest of East Asia and the Islamic world.

Longquan celadon wares were first made during the Northern Song, but flourished under the Southern Song, as the capital moved to the south and the northern kilns declined. This had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and the bodies increasingly had high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.

All the wares mentioned above were mostly in, or aiming to be in, some shade of green. Other wares which can be classified as celadons, were more often in shades of pale blue, very highly valued by the Chinese, or various browns and off-whites. These were often the most highly regarded at the time and by later Chinese connoisseurs, and sometimes made more or less exclusively for the court. These include Ru ware, Guan ware and Ge ware, as well as earlier types such as the &quot;secret color&quot; (&quot;mi se&quot;) wares, finally identified when the crypt at the Famen Temple was opened.

Large quantities of Longquan celadon were exported throughout East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East in the 13th–15th century. Large celadon dishes were especially welcomed in Islamic nations. Since about 1420 the Counts of Katzenelnbogen have owned the oldest European import of celadon, reaching Europe indirectly via the Islamic world. This is a cup mounted in metal in Europe, and exhibited in Kassel in the Landesmuseum. After the development of blue and white porcelain in Jingdezhen ware in the early 14th century, celadon gradually went out of fashion in both Chinese and export markets, and after about 1500 both the quality and quantity of production was much reduced, though there were some antiquarian revivals of celadon glazes on Jingdezhen porcelain in later centuries.

Decoration in Chinese celadons is normally only by shaping the body or creating shallow designs on the flat surface which allow the glaze to pool in depressions, giving a much deeper color to accentuate the design. In both methods carving, moulding and a range of other techniques may be used. There is very rarely any contrast with a completely different color, except where parts of a piece are sometimes left as unglazed biscuit in Longquan celadon.

=== Japanese celadons ===

The Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters for greenware is . It was introduced during the Song dynasty (960–1270) from China and via Korea. Even though Japan has arguably the most diverse styles of ceramic art in the modern era, greenware was mostly avoided by potters because of the high loss rate of up to 80%. Kaolinite, the ceramic material usually used for the production of porcelain, also does not exist in large quantities like in China. One of the sources for kaolin in Japan is from Amakusa in Kyushu. Nevertheless, a number of artists emerged whose works received critical acclaim in regards to the quality and color of the glazes achieved, as well as later on in the innovation of modern design.

Three pieces originally from China have been registered by the government as national treasures. They are two flower vases from the Longquan kiln dating to the southern Song dynasty in the 13th century, and a flower vase with iron brown spots also from Longquan kiln dating to the Yuan dynasty in the 13–14th century.

Production in the style of Longquan was centered around Arita, Saga and in the Saga Domain under the lords of the Nabeshima clan.
Greenware is also closed entwined with white porcelain. The glaze with a mixed subtle color gradations of icy, bluish white is called &quot;seihakuji&quot; (青白磁) porcelain. In Chinese this type of glaze is known as Qingbai ware. Qingbai&#x27;s history goes back to the Song dynasty. It is biscuit-fired and painted with a glaze containing small amounts of iron. This turns a bluish color when fired again. Japanese artists and clients tend to favor the &quot;seihakuji&quot; bluish white glaze over the completely green glaze.

Pieces that are produced are normally tea or rice bowls, &quot;sake&quot; cups, vases, and plates, and &quot;mizusashi&quot; water jars for tea ceremony, censers and boxes. Some post-modern ceramic artists have however expanded into the area of sculpture and abstract art as well.

Artists from the early Showa era are Itaya Hazan (1872–1963), Tomimoto Kenkichi (1886–1963), Kato Hajme (1900–1968), (1912–1990), and Okabe Mineo (1919–1990), who specialized in Guan ware with its crackled glaze. Tsukamoto Kaiji was nominated a Living National Treasure in 1983 for his works in &quot;seihakuji&quot;. Artists from the mid- to late Showa era were Shimizu Uichi (1926–?), who also specialized in crackled glaze, Suzuki Osamu (1926–2001), Miura Koheiji (1933–?), Suzuki Sansei (b. 1936), Fukami Sueharu (b. 1947), and Takenaka Ko (b. 1941). During the Heisei era artists are Masamichi Yoshikawa (b. 1946), Kawase Shinobu (b. 1950), Minegishi Seiko (b. 1952), Kubota Atsuko (b. 1953), Yagi Akira (b. 1955) and (b. 1962).

Artists such as Fukami Sueharu, Masamichi Yoshikawa, and Kato Tsubusa also produce abstract pieces, and their works are part of a number of national and international museum collections. Kato Tsubusa works with kaolin from New Zealand.

=== Korean celadons ===


Korean celadon has its own tradition of greenware production, dating back to the Three Kingdoms period. Korea has a tradition of making jewels and crowns with jade in gogok shapes as a symbol of creativity, universe, divinity, and leadership. Chinese greenwares inspired local potters as well. Exceptional high-quality celadons were produced in Korea during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. An inlaid greenware technique known as &quot;sanggam&quot;, where potters would engrave semi-dried pottery with designs and place black or white clay materials within the engraving, was invented in Korea during this time.

Korean greenware, also known as &quot;Goryeo celadon&quot; is usually a pale green-blue in color. The glaze was developed and refined during the 10th and 11th centuries during the Goryeo period, from which it derives its name. Korean greenware reached its zenith between the 12th and early 13th centuries, however, the Mongol invasions of Korea in the 13th century and persecution by the Joseon dynasty government destroyed the craft.

The Gangjin Kiln Sites produced a large number of Goryeo wares and were a complex of 188 kilns. The kiln sites are located in Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do near the sea. Mountains in the north provided the necessary raw materials such as firewood, kaolin and silicon dioxide for the master potters while a well established system of distribution transported pottery throughout Korea and facilitated export to China and Japan. The sites are tentatively listed as a World Heritage by the South Korean government. Celadon was used as a &quot;spirit vessel&quot; or Chy- Tang to summon spirits to bring positivity, in many Korean temples from the 14th century.

Traditional Korean greenware has distinctive decorative elements. The most distinctive are decorated by overlaying glaze on contrasting clay bodies. With inlaid designs, known as &quot;sanggam&quot; in Korean, small pieces of colored clay are inlaid in the base clay. Carved or slip-carved designs require layers of a different colored clay adhered to the base clay of the piece. The layers are then carved away to reveal the varying colors.

A number of items dating from the Goryeo dynasty have been registered by the government as a National Treasure of South Korea, such as a Dragon kettle from the 12th century (National Treasure No. 61), a &quot;maebyeong&quot; vase with &quot;sanggam&quot; engraved cranes (National Treasure No. 68), an elaborate censer with kingfisher glaze (National Treasure No. 95), and a pitcher in the shape of a Dragon Turtle (National Treasure No. 96).

Beginning in the early 20th century, potters, using modern materials and tools, attempted to recreate the techniques of ancient Korean Goyeo celadons. Playing a leading role in its revival was Yu Geun-Hyeong (유근형; 柳根瀅), a Living National Treasure whose work was documented in the 1979 short film, Koryo Celadon. Another notable potter and Living National Treasure was Ji Suntaku (1912–1993). Today, hundreds of potters showcase their work at the Icheon Ceramics Village, which features contemporary work from Sugwang-ri, Sindun-myeon, and Saeum-dong in the city of Icheon.

In the late 20th century ceramists like Shin Sang-ho and Kim Se-yong created their own styles based upon traditional Goryeo ware. Kim came to prominence for his double-openwork his highly detailed which sometimes featured more than 1500 individually formed chrysanthemum flowers. 

The National Museum of Korea in Seoul houses important celadon works and national treasures. The Haegang Ceramics Museum and the Goryeo Celadon Museum are two regional museums that focus on Korean greenware.

==Southeast Asia==
===Thai celadon===

Thai ceramics has its own tradition of greenware production. Medieval Thai wares were initially influenced by Chinese greenware, but went on to develop its own unique style and technique. One of the most famous kilns during the Sukhothai Kingdom were at S(r)i Satchanalai, around Si Satchanalai District and Sawankhalok District in Sukhothai Province, north-central Thailand. Production started in the 13th century CE and continued until the 16th century. The art reached its apex in the 14th century.

===Vietnamese celadon===
==Others==
Outside of East Asia, a number of artists also worked with greenware to varying degrees of success in regard to purity and quality. These include Thomas Bezanson of Weston Priory in the US and Wanda Golakowska (1901–1975) of Poland, whose works are part of the collection of the National Museum, Warsaw and National Museum, Kraków.

<text>Joseph Anthony Pereira (born September 10, 1950), professionally known as Joe Perry, is an American musician best known as a founding member, guitarist, backing and occasional lead vocalist of the rock band Aerosmith. Perry also has his own solo band called the Joe Perry Project, and is a member of the all-star band Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp.

He was ranked 84th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and in 2001, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Aerosmith. In 2013, Perry and his songwriting partner Steven Tyler were recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award and were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2014, Simon &amp; Schuster released &quot;Rocks: My Life In and Out of Aerosmith&quot;, written by Perry with David Ritz.

==Early life==
Joseph Anthony Pereira was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and grew up in Hopedale, Massachusetts. His father was an accountant of Portuguese descent from Madeira, and his mother was a high school gym teacher of Italian descent.

At a very young age, Perry found himself drawn to the ocean. His dream was to one day become a marine biologist and follow in the footsteps of his hero, Jacques Cousteau. His grades at Hopedale Junior Senior High School were not good, and his chances of eventually going to college were fading. At one point, his parents even tried enticing him with a promise that if he worked to get his grades up, he might be able to intern for a summer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod. However, Joe&#x27;s academic struggles continued, and in his junior year, his parents made the decision to withdraw him from Hopedale and enroll him at an all-boys preparatory school, Vermont Academy. The boarding school, which housed around 200 young men, was located in Saxtons River, a small town in southern Vermont. The teenaged Joe Perry was not very happy with this plan. It was his parents&#x27; hope that, with their son actually living at the school and being embedded in such an educational environment, he would be able to focus more on learning and bring his grades up to an acceptable college entry level.

Many years later, in his memoir, &quot;Rocks: My Life In and Out of Aerosmith&quot;, Perry wrote about his self-professed learning difficulties during his school years and how it was actually the result of his having ADHD, a condition that had remained undiagnosed until recently. He spoke about it while discussing the book in a 2014 interview with J.C. Macek for &quot;PopMatters&quot;: &quot;It was looked at as a discipline problem when I was in school. And certainly, over the years, after I left school, I had forged my way into this thing called rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and it was less of an issue.&quot; However, Perry now considers the possibility that the learning disability was something of a double-edged sword for his career: &quot;I&#x27;m starting to realize that in some ways it&#x27;s helped my guitar playing and it&#x27;s hurt my guitar playing in the way that I kind of learned certain things and my ability to retain certain things.&quot;

The time Perry spent at Vermont Academy was vastly different from what his parents had envisioned for him, and it turned out to be an experience that would forever alter the trajectory of his life. Living there was nothing like what Joe had been accustomed to, coming from such a sheltered small town like Hopedale. The students who attended this prep school were from all over the world. Many of them lived in major metropolitan cities like Los Angeles and New York, and unlike Perry, they had been living right in the middle of the &quot;sex, drugs, and rock &#x27;n roll&quot; culture of the late 1960s: &quot;After vacations, guys would come back with bits and pieces of different cultures&quot;, Perry was quoted as saying in an interview with the &quot;Burlington Free Press&quot;. &quot;It was a real education for me and not the kind of learning they (his parents) sent me there for.&quot;

His classmates introduced him to a whole new world, and he soon started discovering things like &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the first underground newspaper to extensively cover American culture. However, it was his exposure to this new music that would be the heaviest influence on him. It was so different from anything he had ever heard before. Perry had actually taken up the guitar at the age of ten, and even though he is left-handed, he learned to play with his right. He said in 2014 that a substantial early influence on his music was the Beatles: &quot;The night The Beatles first played &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, boy, that was something. Seeing them on TV was akin to a national holiday. Talk about an event. I never saw guys looking so cool. I had already heard some of their songs on the radio, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared by how powerful and totally mesmerizing they were to watch. It changed me completely. I knew something was different in the world that night.&quot; After hearing the music his classmates were listening to, he found himself becoming even more obsessed with his playing. He would sit in his room for hours, lifting the needle off a record that was playing. He then would try to drop it back down in the same spot, so it would be perfectly in sync with the riff he was playing on his own guitar.

Vermont Academy was where he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time. It was also where he first heard British rock bands like the Who, the Kinks, and the Yardbirds – the band responsible for one of Aerosmith&#x27;s first and most iconic covers, &quot;Train Kept a Rollin&quot;. It was where Joe Perry went from dreaming about being a marine biologist to dreaming about being in a band like The Yardbirds. Perry said: &quot;This band called the Yardbirds had a sound like I had never heard before, they had guitars that sound like nothing I&#x27;d ever heard before. The Stones were pushing the edge with distorted guitars. That was a big influence on me.&quot;

==Career==
===Formation and initial success of Aerosmith (1968–1979)===

During the 1960s, Perry formed The Jam Band with Tom Hamilton. Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer eventually joined them, and the band became Aerosmith. While initially dismissed as Rolling Stones knock-offs, the band came into its own during the mid-1970s, with a string of hit records. Chief among these successes were their first hit single, &quot;Dream On&quot;, and early albums such as &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rocks&quot; (1976), thanks largely to the prevalence of free-form, album-oriented FM radio. The group also managed hit singles on the radio, with songs like &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;Back in the Saddle&quot;, and &quot;Last Child&quot;.

During this time, Perry and Tyler became known as the &quot;Toxic Twins&quot; for their notorious hard-partying and drug use. Aerosmith&#x27;s crowd earned the nickname &quot;The Blue Army&quot;, so called by the band after the seemingly endless number of teenagers in the audience wearing blue denim jackets and blue jeans. The audience was abundantly male with long hair.

Following &quot;Rocks&quot;, the group began to stumble. Drug use escalated and the creative process became hampered by strained relationships within the band. This was highlighted during the recording process for their next album, which was recorded at an abandoned convent in upstate New York. During their time there, Tyler and Perry would spend much of the time in their rooms getting high, away from the rest of the band, and would often record their parts separately. The band, hampered by heavy drug use and distracted by hobbies such as driving fast cars on the nearby parkways and shooting high-powered firearms in the building&#x27;s attic, struggled to come up with material. &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, released in 1977, became a hit nonetheless, going double Platinum. However, it was not as successful as their prior efforts, with the singles &quot;Draw the Line&quot; and &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; both charting in the Hot 100, but failing to crack the Top 40. On the album, Perry sang lead vocals on the track &quot;Bright Light Fright&quot;. The band toured throughout 1977 and 1978 in support of the album, but increasing violence at concerts (such as bottles, cherry bombs, M-80s, and firecrackers being thrown on-stage, including several notorious incidents at the Spectrum in Philadelphia) as well as the band&#x27;s heavy drug use began to mar the performances. In 1978, Aerosmith released the live collection &quot;Live! Bootleg&quot;, released the stand-alone single &quot;Chip Away the Stone&quot;, and starred as &quot;The Future Villain Band&quot; in the film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. For the film, the band released a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Come Together&quot;, which would become the band&#x27;s last Top 40 hit for nearly a decade.

===Decline of Aerosmith and formation of Joe Perry Project (1979–1984)===
In 1979, Aerosmith headlined over Van Halen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Foreigner during the world music festival concerts. However, as the decade was about to conclude, the band&#x27;s drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. On July 28, 1979, at the World Series of Rock in Cleveland, an argument resulted in Perry&#x27;s wife throwing a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton&#x27;s wife. Perry and Tyler had a heated argument, which led to Perry leaving Aerosmith part-way through the recording of the album &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, with the remainder of his parts played by temporary guitarists. Perry took a collection of unrecorded material with him, which would later become the basis of his album &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot;, released in 1980. The album featured vocalist Ralph Morman, bassist David Hull and drummer Ronnie Stewart and went on to sell 250,000 copies. Midway through the tour in support of the album, Ralph Morman was replaced for the remainder of the tour by Joey Mala. It was followed by &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Rolls Again&quot; in 1981, which featured vocalist/rhythm guitarist Charlie Farren, a veteran of the Boston rock scene. After this tour, there was a major shakeup of the band: Charlie Farren, David Hull and Ronnie Stewart left the band and the Joe Perry Project was dropped from Columbia Records. Equipped with a new record label (MCA Records) and three new band members in singer Mach Bell, bassist Danny Hargrove and drummer Joe Pet, the Joe Perry Project released the follow-up and &quot;Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker&quot; (1983). These albums did not fare as well as The Project&#x27;s debut, selling only 40,000 copies apiece. Despite the poor sales, The Project went out on a final tour in support of the album, adding former Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford to the lineup. During this tour, The Project performed in a series of co-bills with Huey Lewis and the News.

===Reunion of Aerosmith and return to the spotlight (1984–1999)===
In February 1984, both Perry and Whitford met up with their old bandmates in Aerosmith, which led to their rejoining the band two months later. Aerosmith signed a new record deal with Geffen Records (which coincidentally was sold to MCA in 1990, absorbing the MCA label 13 years later). When Perry rejoined Aerosmith, he brought on his manager Tim Collins to manage the band. Collins would help orchestrate much of Aerosmith&#x27;s success over the next decade.

In 1984, Aerosmith embarked on a successful comeback tour, the &quot;Back in the Saddle Tour&quot;. The following year, the band released their first album since re-uniting, &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, which was received favorably by critics but did not fare as well commercially, only going gold and failing to generate a hit single, aside from the rock radio cut &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot;, a remake of Perry&#x27;s 1980 solo song. In 1986, Perry and Tyler collaborated with Run-D.M.C. in a remake of Aerosmith&#x27;s 1975 hit &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, which helped break rap into mainstream popularity and brought Aerosmith renewed mainstream attention as well. Despite their success since re-forming, drug problems still stood in their way. After completing drug rehabilitation, Aerosmith went on to collaborate with various big-name songwriters (such as Desmond Child and Jim Vallance), producers (Bruce Fairbairn), A&amp;R men (John Kalodner), and music video directors (Marty Callner and David Fincher) to launch their true comeback, with the successful multi-platinum albums &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1987), &quot;Pump&quot; (1989), and &quot;Get a Grip&quot; (1993), which were backed by many hit singles (&quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Rag Doll&quot;, &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, &quot;What it Takes&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, and &quot;Crazy&quot;), popular music videos, and worldwide concert tours. The band won several awards throughout the 1990s, including four Grammy Awards and ten MTV Video Music Awards. Perry and Tyler resumed their friendship, again co-writing songs and performing very close together on stage, as well as vacationing together with their families after the conclusion of the Get a Grip Tour. However, tensions with the band hit its stride again in 1996, while the band was in the midst of recording their next album. While songwriting and recording sessions in Miami had begun well, the band&#x27;s manager began pressuring the band members, spreading false information to the band members, and keeping the band members separate from one another, almost causing Aerosmith to disband. While grateful for all he had done to help resurrect their careers, Aerosmith fired Collins in 1996, and carried on with new management. The double-platinum-certified album, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, was finally released in 1997. &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was fueled by the hit singles &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot; and &quot;Pink&quot; and supported by the three-year-long Nine Lives Tour. During this time, Perry starred in a commercial for The Gap with Steven Tyler. The band also released their bestselling tell-all book &quot;Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith&quot;. In 1998, Perry helped conceive the group&#x27;s first number one single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;, with pop songwriter Diane Warren. It appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Armageddon&quot;, in which Tyler&#x27;s daughter Liv starred. In 1999, the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith opened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. On September 9, 1999, Perry and Tyler reunited with Run-D.M.C. and were also joined by Kid Rock for a collaborative live performance of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; at the MTV Video Music Awards.

===Continued success of Aerosmith and solo albums (2000–present)===
In 2001, Aerosmith performed at the Super Bowl XXXV half-time show and released the platinum-certified album, &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, which included the Top 10 single &quot;Jaded&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Perry was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Aerosmith. The band subsequently went on the eight-month-long Just Push Play Tour and went on to tour every following year, with the exception of 2008. The Aerosmith blues cover album &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; was released in 2004. Perry released his first solo record, the self-titled &quot;Joe Perry&quot;, in May 2005. It was recorded at his home studio (The Boneyard) in suburban Boston, with every instrument but the drums played by Perry himself. Critics also responded favorably; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine crowned it with three-and-a-half (out of five) stars, declaring &quot;A Joe Perry solo joint? about time!&quot; He was also nominated for &quot;Best Rock Instrumental&quot; at the 2006 Grammys for the track &quot;Mercy&quot; but lost to Les Paul. In 2006, Perry performed alongside Steven Tyler for a three-song medley (&quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;) with the Boston Pops Orchestra as part of a nationally televised event to celebrate the Fourth of July in Boston, Massachusetts.

&quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, a video game featuring the band&#x27;s songs, was released in 2008. In 2009, while on tour with Aerosmith, Perry announced that he would be releasing a new Joe Perry Project album entitled &quot;Have Guitar, Will Travel&quot;, which was released on October 6, 2009. The first single from the album was &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Long Way to Go&quot;. This marks the first Joe Perry Project album since 1983&#x27;s &quot;Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker&quot;, and the fifth Joe Perry solo album in total, counting the 2005 self-titled album. He toured Europe and the States in late 2009 and early 2010 in support of the album. After Tyler fell off a stage during an Aerosmith show in August 2009 in Sturgis, South Dakota, during the band&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot; Tour (causing the rest of the ill-fated tour to be canceled), tensions flared between Tyler and his bandmates, especially Perry, and it got to the point where the band members were not speaking to each other. Media reports began to circulate that Tyler had left the band and that Perry and the other members of Aerosmith were seeking out a new singer to replace Tyler. On November 10, 2009, at a Joe Perry Project concert in New York City, Tyler made a surprise appearance, assuring the crowd he was not quitting Aerosmith and performed &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with the band. After Tyler completed drug rehabilitation in early 2010, he got back together with his bandmates and they announced a world tour called the Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock Tour which took place in the spring and summer of 2010. While on tour, several on-stage incidents (including Tyler accidentally hitting Perry in the head with his mic stand and Perry bumping Tyler off the stage) as well as Tyler signing on to be a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot; without telling his bandmates caused tensions to again flare between Tyler and Perry, but cooled once again by the time the tour ended.
Aerosmith then proceeded to spend much of the summer of 2011 recording their next album, their first of predominantly original material in a decade. Like &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot;, their next album was produced by a team that included Perry, Tyler, Jack Douglas, and Marti Frederiksen. The band toured Japan and South America in late 2011 and continued recording in early 2012. In May 2012, their new single &quot;Legendary Child&quot; was released and performed live on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;. It was also announced that the band&#x27;s new album would be titled &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot; and would be released in August 2012; the album&#x27;s release date would later be pushed back to November 2012. Two more singles (&quot;What Could Have Been Love and &quot;Lover Alot&quot;) were released in advance of the album. The band supported the album with the Global Warming Tour, which lasted for much of summer and fall of 2012 and appearances on national television programs. In January 2013, the single &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Lovin&#x27; You&quot; (a duet with country star Carrie Underwood) was released, and in February, it was announced that Perry and his songwriting partner Steven Tyler would be recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award at the society&#x27;s 30th Annual Pop Music Awards on April 17 and that the duo would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame at a ceremony to be held on June 13.
In late April and early May 2013, Aerosmith extended their Global Warming Tour to Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This marked the band&#x27;s first performances in Australia in 23 years, and the band&#x27;s first-ever performances in the latter three countries. On May 30, Aerosmith performed as part of the &quot;Boston Strong&quot; charity concert for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. The band also performed at a handful of shows in the U.S. and Japan in July and August. In the fall of 2013, Aerosmith extended their tour to Central and South America, including their first-ever performances in Guatemala, El Salvador and Uruguay.

From May 17 to June 28, 2014, Perry performed 15 shows with Aerosmith on the European leg of the Global Warming Tour. This was followed by the Let Rock Rule Tour (featuring Slash with Myles Kennedy &amp; the Conspirators as the opening act), which sent Aerosmith to 19 locations across North America from July 10 to September 12.

On October 7, 2014, Perry released his autobiography &quot;Rocks: My Life in and Out of Aerosmith&quot;, co-written by David Ritz. Perry promoted the book with a book-signing tour that took him to 14 locations across the United States in the month of October.
On June 13, 2015, Perry embarked on the Blue Army Tour with Aerosmith, which sent the band to 17 North American locations through August 7, many of them in smaller venues in secondary markets that the band has either never performed in or has not performed in many years. On the tour, the band performed several lesser-known deep cuts. Also in 2015, Perry was one of the narrators for the documentary film &quot;Unity&quot;.

Since 2015, Joe Perry has worked with Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp on the side project Hollywood Vampires, which released their eponymous debut album in September 2015 and performed at the 58th Grammy Awards on February 15, 2016. In the summer of 2016, the Vampires launched a summer concert tour of North America, joined by drummer Matt Sorum and bassist Robert DeLeo.

On July 10, 2016, Perry collapsed onstage at a concert he was performing with the Hollywood Vampires on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. It was believed that Perry had suffered cardiac arrest. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was quickly upgraded to stable condition later that night. The Vampires continued the show without Perry that evening, and continued the rest of their tour, but canceled an appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. After resting for a few days, Perry made a full recovery and returned to the Hollywood Vampires tour.

In September and October, Perry rejoined Aerosmith for a festival performance in San Diego and a nine-date tour of Latin America, called the Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Rumble Tour. In November 2016, Aerosmith announced that they would be going on a &quot;farewell&quot; tour in Europe in the spring and summer of 2017, titled the Aero-Vederci Baby! tour. According to Perry and bandmate Brad Whitford, the tour will likely last several years and the band is also considering recording another album. After the European leg of the tour concluded in July 2017, the band performed in South America in September and October 2017.

In November 2017, Perry announced a January 2018 release date for his fourth solo album, &quot;Sweetzerland Manifesto&quot;. The album comprised ten tracks of new material and included guest musicians Johnny Depp, Robin Zander, David Johansen, and others. In November 2018, Perry released the first single off &quot;Sweetzerland Manifesto&quot;, entitled &quot;Quake&quot;, with Aerosmith bandmate Brad Whitford and Gary Cherone of Extreme on board.

In 2019, Perry joined Aerosmith for a residency in Las Vegas called &quot;&quot;, a reference to both Las Vegas casino gambling and the band&#x27;s 1994 single of the same name. The band will play 50 shows during the months of April 2019 through June 2020 at the Park Theater. Interspersed in the middle of the residency in July and August 2019, the band performed at a festival in Minnesota and played a total of nine shows spread across three MGM venues in Maryland, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.

==Personal life==
Perry was married to Elyssa Jerret from 1975 to 1982. Together they had a son, Adrian. With his second wife, Billie, whom he married in 1985, he has two sons, Tony and Roman. She has a son, Aaron, from a previous relationship. Adrian and Tony Perry are founding members of the rock group Dead Boots. As of 2014, Perry and his wife had homes in Vermont, Massachusetts, Florida, and Los Angeles.

Perry endorsed John McCain for the 2008 Presidential election, and described himself as a &quot;lifelong Republican&quot;. &quot;I love America&quot;, he said. &quot;I love the culture. I love the freedom that it stands for. But I don&#x27;t like the politics. I don&#x27;t feel the people are represented the way they should be. So many things that made America great have been kinda stepped on by politicians. Politics is a business. First thing they do when they get into office is figure out how they&#x27;re gonna get reelected.&quot;

Perry has spearheaded the creation of a line of hot sauces with Ashley Food Company: &quot;Joe Perry&#x27;s Rock Your World Hot Sauces&quot;, featured widely in the marketplace. A quesadilla featuring a flavor of his hot sauce is available as an appetizer at Hard Rock Cafe. Perry was featured in an episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;Inside Dish&quot; with Rachael Ray during a stop on an Aerosmith tour. He prepared a meal, displayed his passion for knives, discussed his hot sauce brand and cooking, and gave insight into meal preparations on tour.

Until 2006, Perry, with bandmate Steven Tyler and other partners, co-owned Mount Blue, a restaurant in Norwell, Massachusetts.

Perry resides in Massachusetts, and maintains a home in Pomfret, Vermont.

After performing at a Billy Joel concert at Madison Square Garden in November 2018, Perry collapsed in his dressing room. Perry had experienced a similar backstage collapse in July 2016 after performing with the Hollywood Vampires. Reportedly, his breathing problem appears to be congestion in the lungs, but Perry later blamed &quot;dehydration and exhaustion&quot; for his health issues.

As a result of his NYC collapse, Perry canceled his fall/winter Sweetzerland Manifesto concert tour in order to rest for the remainder of 2018.

==Influences==
He is a huge fan of the early Fleetwood Mac, particularly their first lead guitarist, Peter Green, which explains the occasional inclusion of the FM classics &quot;Stop Messin&#x27; Round&quot; and &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; in Aerosmith&#x27;s sets. Steven Tyler has even mentioned that hearing Perry play &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; brought them together. He is also a huge fan of guitarist Jeff Beck and looked at him as one of his influences. Beck played onstage with Aerosmith in 1976, as a &#x27;birthday present&#x27; for Perry. Perry was also strongly influenced by Jimi Hendrix as evidenced in particular by some of the playing on the Joe Perry Project track song &quot;The Mist Is Rising&quot;, and his covering the Hendrix classic &quot;Red House&quot; both with the Project and later with Aerosmith. Perry also cites Johnny Winter as an important influence &quot;probably since I was about seventeen or eighteen. I&#x27;ve always loved his music.&quot;
Perry is a huge fan of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page in particular. He and Steven Tyler had the honor of inducting Led Zeppelin into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and specifically stated that Aerosmith would not exist in its current form without them.

==Equipment==

Perry has a collection of about 600 guitars. He prefers Gibson guitars, particularly the Les Paul, with a few models even recreated by the manufacturer as part of their Signature series. One of those, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul, had to be sold by Perry during his 1982 divorce. Later Perry had his guitar tech and equipment managers search for this guitar. One day Brad Whitford brought him a guitar magazine and in the middle of the centerfold was Slash with the Les Paul in his hand. Perry immediately called Slash and bugged him for years, offering to pay more than the guitar&#x27;s worth which had nearly tripled since Joe sold it. Eventually he gave up as it was straining the pair&#x27;s friendship. Many years later at Joe&#x27;s 50th birthday party, Slash finally gave him the guitar as a gift. He also owns various Gibson ES guitars (one of which features a painting of his wife Billie), and Gibson Firebirds.

<text>A lighterman is a worker who operates a lighter, a type of flat-bottomed barge, which may be powered or unpowered. In the latter case, it is usually moved by a powered tug. The term is particularly associated with the highly skilled men who operated the unpowered lighters moved by oar and water currents in the Port of London.

==Lightermen in the Port of London==

===History===
Lightermen were one of the most characteristic groups of workers in London&#x27;s docks during the heyday of the Port of London, but their trade was eventually rendered largely obsolete by changes in shipping technology. They were closely associated with the watermen, who carried passengers, and in 1700 joined the Company of Watermen to form the Company of Watermen and Lightermen. This is not, strictly speaking, a livery company but a &quot;City Company Without Grant of Livery&quot;, formed in 1700 by an act of Parliament, the Thames Watermen Act 1698 (11 Will. 3. c. 21). The guild continues to license watermen and lightermen working on the River Thames. Watermans&#x27; Hall is located at 16 St Mary At Hill, in Billingsgate. It dates to 1780 and is the only surviving Georgian guild hall.

The construction of the docks was bitterly opposed by the lightermen and other vested interests, but went ahead anyway. However, they did win a major concession: that became known as the &quot;free-water clause&quot;, first introduced into the West India Dock Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. lxix) and subsequently written into the Acts governing all of the other docks. This stated that there was to be no charge for &quot;lighters or craft entering into the docks ... to convey, deliver, discharge or receive ballast or goods to or from on board any ship ... or vessel.&quot; This was intended to give lighters and barges the same freedom in docks that they enjoyed on the open river. In practice, however, this proved highly damaging to the dock owners. It allowed ships to be loaded and unloaded overside, using barges and lighters to transfer their goods to and from riverside wharves rather than dock quays, thus bypassing quay dues and dock warehouses. This significantly reduced the docks&#x27; income and harmed their finances, while boosting the profits of their riverside competitors. Not surprisingly, the dock owners lobbied vigorously—but unsuccessfully—for the abolition of this damaging privilege.

===Operation===

The lightermen were a vital component of the Port of London before the enclosed docks were built during the 19th and 20th centuries. Ships anchored in the middle of the Thames or near bridge arches transferred their goods aboard or in respect of a few exports from lighters. Lightermen rode the river&#x27;s currents — westward, when the tide was coming in, eastward on the ebb tide — to transfer the goods to quay-sides. They also transferred goods up and down the river from quays to riverside factories and vice versa. This was an extremely skilled job, requiring an intimate knowledge of the river&#x27;s currents and tides. It also demanded a lot of muscle power, as the lighters were unpowered; they relied on the current for motive force and on long oars, or &quot;paddles&quot;, for steering.

The lightermen&#x27;s trade was eventually swept away by the docks mentioned, as well as economic and technological changes, particularly the introduction of containers, which led to the closure of London&#x27;s major central docks in the 1960s.

Few written accounts of the process of becoming an apprentice now exist, though the best-known is &quot;Men of the Tideway&quot; by Dick Fagan and Eric Burgess. (Fagan worked as a lighterman for more than forty years). In the book, Fagan mentions the exploitative nature of lighterage and expresses his disdain for what he called a &quot;free-for-all capitalist system&quot;.

The term lighterman is still used for the workers who operate motorised lighters to access a vessel which is too large or due to conditions unable to moor at a dock and the phrase &quot; goods&quot; is used in the goods trade widely compared to the phrase &#x27;alighting of passengers&#x27; which has become archaic across most of the English-speaking world except in formal contexts and on some railways, having been generally replaced with the terms &#x27;exit&#x27;, &#x27;leave&#x27;, or &#x27;depart&#x27;.

==Lightermen in Hull==
The Humber Estuary causes similar problems to the Thames plus vast shifting sandbanks. For centuries the Port of Hull took much of its traffic in transfer of cargoes between vessels as Hull was cut off from safe land routes for much of the year. Lightermen were experts in these transfers and also in guiding vessels to safe moorings away from the sandbanks. By the 19th century, enclosed docks were being built but only with the arrival of steam barges late in the century did the Lightermen&#x27;s expertise become redundant. A sub-category consisted of ballast lightermen, specialising in transferring rubble, bricks, and cobbles to and from the lower holds of vessels to keep them upright even in severe storms.

== Lightermen in Singapore ==
As with their English counterparts, lightermen in Singapore were men who worked on a lighter or on a barge. Their primary role was to transport cargo between ships in the harbour and warehouses along the Singapore River. They were active in Singapore in the 19th and 20th century, playing a key role in the city’s port functions. They were mostly migrant labourers from India or China and worked in teams ranging from two to four aboard tongkangs and twakows. Lighterman had to be skilled in managing cargo boats as they dealt with many valuable goods that could easily be damaged or misplaced. Before the introduction of motorised boats, they were also required to have the skills to manage their boats with just oar and sail.

=== Lighterage in Singapore ===
Singapore developed rapidly in the 19th to 20th century, owing much of its accomplishments to its development as an important trading port. The Singapore River was the initial site of trade and formation of lighterage services was indispensable in Singapore’s initial success as the river was too narrow and shallow for ships to enter. Large merchant vessels had to cast anchor at the harbour before transferring their goods into the lighters. From there, lightermen would then transport the cargo between warehouses by the river. These lightermen, by enabling Singapore’s smooth functioning as a port, were essential figures that, while lesser known, have contributed greatly to the city’s success. As such, the lighterage industry was one of the first major service industries to develop in Singapore.

=== History of lightermen in Singapore ===
==== 19th century: Indian lightermen ====
Between the period of 1819 to 1900, South Indian lightermen were the dominant group leading Singapore’s lighterage industry. Consisting mainly of Chulias, Muslims who hailed from the Coromandel Coast at the southeastern coastal region of the Indian subcontinent in the 1800s, many of the earlier lightermen were also recruited through the East India Company’s port at Madras. 

However, in the later half of the 1800s, the position of these Indian lightermen began to weaken. Numerous reasons for this decline included the transference of the Straits Settlements to the Colonial Office, which resulted in the loss of the close connection and link with the administration that operated in India. The movement of European merchants’ operations from the Singapore River to New Harbour also affected the livelihoods of Indian lightermen as lighters were not needed to move goods there.

The tongkang was the first of the lighter boats used by the Indian lightermen along the Singapore River. They were generally large, ranging in size from 20 to 120 tonnes, making it difficult to control. However, this also meant that the lighters could offer greater protection to the cargo they carried.

==== 20th century: Chinese lightermen ====
Between the early twentieth century up to 1983 when the Singapore government proceeded to remove the lighters from the river, the lighterage industry came to be dominated by Chinese boatmen.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Chinese migrated to Singapore to seek wealth and better lives. This was in response to a cumulation of push and pull factors such as political and social turmoil in China, as well as the rising status of Singapore as an important trading entrepot. With the large influx of Chinese migrants in the late 19th centuries, Chinese lighters and lightermen started to inevitably replace their Indian counterparts.

Two main Chinese dialect groups dominated the lighterage industry, namely the Hokkiens from the Fujian province and the Teochews from the Guangdong area. In the years during the initial phase of Chinese domination leading to World War II, the Teochews essentially controlled the lighterage industry along the Singapore River. Nearly three quarters of the twakow in the river then were run and staffed by the Teochews. The other one quarter of the twakow were owned and operated by the Hokkiens. However, the twakow owned by the Hokkien mostly transported cargo from along the waterfront within the Telok Ayer Basin and less from the river itself. This business strategy changed after the war as the Hokkiens became the predominant conveyors of trading commodities in the river.

The twakow was the lighter vessel used by Chinese lightermen in the late 19th to early 20th century. By 1900, it had replaced the tongkangs used by Indian lightermen as the preferred lighter for transporting goods between ships as they were more manoevurable. The vessel stemmed from Chinese influence and had a wide hull and nearly flat bottom, features that made it well-suited for carrying heavy cargo in shallow waters. Traditional twakows, which used punt poles and sails, were used up to the 1950s, despite the emergence of motorized versions in the 1930s.

==== Late 20th to 21st centuries: Changing urban landscape and economy ====

As Singapore became one of the busiest ports in the 20th century, technological advancements such as containerism and the government’s decision to rely less on river-borne trade caused the previously crucial role of the Singapore River as a commercial hub to decline. As a result, jobs centered on the Singapore River also started to lose their importance, with the lighterage industry being no exception. The clean up of the Singapore River was also linked to the introduction of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) which was in charge of rehousing the river communities.

Another key factor leading to the decline of lightermen was the Singapore government’s effort towards urban-environmental renewal through the Clean Rivers Campaign in the 1980s. The campaign saw the removal of all lighters from the Singapore River in the cleaning process and was the catalyst in their relocation and disappearance. By September 1983, lighterage activities which included approximately 800 lighters were relocated to facilities of the Port of Singapore Authority at Pasir Panjang.

=== About ===
==== Occupation ====
In Singapore, lightermen existed along the same spectrum of life as coolies as labourers coming from India and China. Yet, they had different roles in the early days of Singapore as they contributed to the city’s development. Coolies were often unskilled labourers, employed as manual labour in nearly every sector. They were employed in various areas such as construction and plantation work. On the other hand, lightermen were distinctly situated along the Singapore River, transporting goods from ships to land. Lighterage work also required great skill and strength to load and maneuver lighters. While the main transfer of goods to lighters were carried out by coolies and stevedores, lighters would personally load their craft with the goods, as a poorly loaded lighter could cause the boat to be unstable on water. 

==== Working conditions ====
The lightermen faced harsh working conditions due to the physically demanding and dangerous nature of the work.

The work of lightermen was high risk and immensely back-breaking. Demanding tremendous physical strength, some of the heaviest goods lightermen were tasked with included cases of dried fish that often exceeded 200 kilograms. These crates were particularly tricky to maneuver as they were huge, bulky and haphazardly constructed. Before cranes were introduced, three coolies were even needed to hoist a single case which would be passed on to a waiting lighter.

The challenges of handling bulky cargoes were further exacerbated by the conditions inside the vessel. Some of the bigger lighters had wide and deep undercarriages which would become unbearably hot and humid during certain months. Putrid and poisonous smells, coupled with the swaying and lurching unpredictably due to waves made the work as challenging as it was hazardous. It was difficult in itself to maintain one’s balance while avoiding being hit by goods that were lowered along the side of the vessel.

The work also had erratic hours and lightermen would work when called for. Oftentimes, they were even known to work for more than 24 hours continuously, with minimal rest.

Yet, in light of the skill and effort involved, lightermen were often held in higher regard and paid more than their peers in other manual labouring occupations.

==== Relationships ====
===== Towkays =====
Lightermen worked under Towkays - Chinese businessmen. The lightermen and their towkays generally shared a strong reciprocal relationship that exceeded the standard for typical employers and employees as it was one that was built on mutual trust and reciprocity.

Towkays had the responsibility of caring for the welfare of their lightermen, being a reliable figure that they could turn to regardless of difficulties. This could be through advance payments in financial difficulties, or providing less strenuous work upon retiring from lighterage work. These welfare measures were especially important to lightermen as they were often unmarried migrants with no local connections.

===== Coworkers =====
Lightermen worked in teams and often shared close, familial relationships with their coworkers. Many lightermen were employed by and with those that shared a common dialect, surname background, or other kinship lines. This hiring practice was seen to be beneficial in ensuring a cohesive and efficient workforce. As a result, there was a close bond within the lightermen community as they often worked with those whom they shared a social bond with, and treated each other like family members. These positive relationships provided the lightermen with job security and a sense of belonging, and they changed jobs minimally.

=== Industrial organisation ===
Early labour disputes in the lighterage industry and on the river were uncommon and usually unrelated to work conditions. The earliest record of lightermen striking took place in 1842 and was connected to a large-scale protest by the Indian community against the government who did not permit a religious procession to take place along the streets.

Lightermen’s main concerns in forming a union were to primarily ensure that they received fair payment and compensation for long hours and injuries incurred on the job. Over the years, they formed several unions which achieved varying levels of success. These included the Lightermen&#x27;s Union, the Transport Vessel Workers Association, and Singapore Lighter Workers’ Union.

==== Lightermen&#x27;s Union ====
Formed in the late 1930s with 3000 members, the Lightermen&#x27;s Union’s goal was to address and correct lightermen&#x27;s grievances over their working conditions. Despite the positive and harmonious relationship between lightermen and their towkays, the 1930s was a period of tension and volatility due to the pre-war environment. Labourers from all occupations gained increasing political awareness, especially of their political strength when banded together, and started forming unions. This also included the lightermen.

==== Transport Vessel Workers Association (TVWA) ====
The Lightermen&#x27;s Union was subsequently reorganised their administration post-war and registered as the Transport Vessel Workers Association (TVWA). Yet, despite being formed for all lightermen, the union started to focus only on their representation of Chinese lightermen. Due to the increasingly militant nature, biased attitudes and persisting rivalries of the union, many Indian lightermen left as a result and formed their own union. This was short lived, however, as a number of Indian lightermen eventually did rejoin the union upon the failure of their own.

Through arbitration and negotiation, the union was relatively successful in achieving their goals. Members were able to receive the appropriate amount of pay and work with better conditions. More than that, the TVWA provided the lightermen with a sense of solidarity and allowed them a strong voice. This unity was so strong that it surpassed previous clan rivalries and even reduced the frequency of clashes between the Hokkien and Teochew lightermen. 

==== Singapore Lighter Workers&#x27; Union ====
The Singapore Lighter Workers&#x27; Union was formed by Indian lightermen working in the Telok Ayer Basin as a response to the growing Chinese-centric ideals of the Transport Vessel Workers Association. It was generally unsuccessful, however, as it was unable to meet the demands of its members and was filled with controversy. The leaders of the union prioritised their own interests over that of their members and rumors of the misuse of union funds caused internal distrust and dissatisfaction. The union soon collapsed, and further attempts at forming an Indian lightermen union were faced with failure.

<text>Counseling psychology is a psychological specialty that began with a focus on vocational counseling, but later moved its emphasis to adjustment counseling, and then expanded to cover all normal psychology and psychotherapy. There are many subcategories for counseling psychology, such as marriage and family counseling, rehabilitation counseling, clinical mental health counseling, educational counseling, etc. In each setting, they are all required to follow the same guidelines.

The Society for Counseling Psychology in the United States says:Counseling Psychology is a generalist health service (HSP) specialty in professional psychology that uses a broad range of culturally informed and culturally sensitive practices to help people improve their well-being, prevent and alleviate distress and maladjustment, resolve crises, and increase their ability to function better in their lives. It focuses specifically but not exclusively on normative life-span development, with a particular emphasis on prevention and education as well as amelioration, addressing individuals as well as the systems or contexts in which they function. It has particular expertise in work and career issues.

==History==

=== Before the end of World War II ===
Before World War II, qualified &quot;psychologists&quot; typically pursued science, rather than the direct treatment of patients. This task was the domain of &quot;psychiatrists&quot; who had both a medical degree and psychological training.

In 1896, the first psychological patient clinic was opened at the University of Pennsylvania by psychologist Lightner Witmer. He coined the term &quot;clinical psychology&quot; to describe his work. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology focused on children&#x27;s psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment or adults.

The Vocation Bureau was established in Boston in 1908 by Frank Parsons. Parsons coined the term &quot;vocational guidance&quot; that year, and the Bureau soon became the concept&#x27;s national body. The Bureau supported the work of &quot;vocational counselors&quot;, and successfully advocated for a large number of them to be appointed by Boston schools. Parson&#x27;s influential book &quot;Choosing a Vocation&quot; was published in 1909. The Boston YMCA offered the first vocational guidance training.

Building on the work of the Bureau, the National Vocational Guidance Association (NVGA) was founded in 1913.

The National Social Workers&#x27; Exchange began in 1917, and in 1921 expanded its scope and became the American Association of Social Workers.

Abraham and Hannah Stone began a marriage consultation centre in New York in 1929. The American Institute for Family Relations (AIFR) was established by Paul Popenoe in Los Angeles in 1930. Emily Mudd founded the Marriage Council of Philadelphia in 1932. This kind of organisation was first found in Germany, and had grown through parts of Europe.

During World War II, the term &quot;counseling&quot; was used by American psychologist Carl Rogers to describe therapy provided by psychologists. In 1942, Rogers published the book &quot;Counseling and Psychotherapy&quot;. In that book&#x27;s introduction he said the terms &quot;counselling&quot; and &quot;psychotherapy&quot; were equivalents, the main difference being that different professions tended to use one term or the other. He noted that people who did this work might call themselves &quot;a psychologist, a college counselor, a marital adviser, a psychiatrist, a social worker, a high-school guidance counselor, an industrial personnel worker, or [use] some other name.&quot;

1942 also saw the establishment of the American Association of Marriage Counselors (AAMC)&quot;.&quot; The Stones and Mudd took part in this.

=== A great adjustment ===
The end of World War II in 1945 saw many combatants return home. Over 3.2 million American veterans applied for training under the GI Bill, creating a strong need for vocational and personal adjustment counseling at the US Veterans Administration (VA). That year, Rogers was invited to set up a counseling center at the University of Chicago.

It was also at this time that clinical psychologists began offering therapy to adults in large numbers, with many employed by the VA.

The end of the war also saw the American Psychological Association establish Divisions, providing interest groups for its members to join. Divisions 11 and 12 of were formed in 1945, with the two merging in 1946 to become the &quot;Division of Clinical and Abnormal Psychology&quot; (as Division 12).

Division 17 of the APA was formed in 1946 as the &quot;Division of Personnel and Guidance Psychologists&quot;.

Also in 1946, Connecticut became the first US state to require &quot;psychologists&quot; to be licensed. The last to do so was Missouri in 1977.

In 1947, Rogers was elected president of the APA.

The Marriage Council of Philadelphia started the first US marriage counsellor training program in 1948, training Navy chaplains.

It was suggested that &quot;personal adjustment counseling is actually a psychotherapeutic supplement to vocational counseling for problems not serious enough to require psychiatric treatments,&quot; in 1949.

More than 500 people had joined Division 17 in 1949. Around half of these provided guidance (or supervised it) in an educational setting. Approximately 20% guided people in the VA. 40% of Division 17 members were also members of the NVGA.

=== &quot;Counseling psychology&quot; and other counseling ===
In 1951, the APA&#x27;s Division 17 became the &quot;Division for Counseling Psychology&quot;. This body united psychologists, students and professionals who were dedicated to promote education and training, practice, scientific investigation, diversity and public interest in the field of counseling psychology. (It would later become known as the &quot;Society for Counseling Psychology&quot;).

In 1952 the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA) was founded, merging the NVGA, the National Association of Guidance and Counselor Trainers (NAGCT), the Student Personnel Association for Teacher Education (SPATE), and the American College Personnel Association (ACPA).

Starting in the early 1950s, the first counseling psychology PhD programs were at the University of Minnesota; Ohio State University; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Missouri; Teachers College, Columbia University; and University of Texas at Austin.

At times, counseling psychologists with qualifications from university education departments had difficulty being registered as &quot;psychologists&quot; by US states, due to difficulty proving that their study was sufficiently psychological in nature.

In 1955, the National Association of Social Workers was established through the consolidation of seven groups including the American Association of Social Workers and the National Association of School Social Workers.

In 1960, the AIFR in Los Angeles was described &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and best known marriage-counseling center,&quot; with a staff of seventy. By that year, the institute had given training to over 300 marriage counselors and shorter courses around the US to over 1500 other people.

The US National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) began in 1969.

The AAMC became the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) in 1974.

In 1976, the American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA) was founded to represent mental health counselors who did not qualify for APA membership, and didn&#x27;t fit in the college counseling focused APGA. The AMHCA became a part of the latter in 1978.

Individual US states began to license counselors in the 1970s. In 1981, the APGA established The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs to standardise counseling education. In 1982, the APGA established an independent body, the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC), to provide a national certification system for counselors who were not qualified psychologists.

The APGA changed its name in 1983 to the &quot;American Association of Counseling and Development&quot; (AACD), and then in 1992 to the &quot;American Counseling Association&quot; (ACA). (Also in 1992, the ACPA left the organisation.)

The AIFR ceased operating in the 1980s.

A 1986 study found that of APA Division 17 members, 80% did personal adjustment counseling, 71% did vocational counseling, 69% did long-term psychotherapy and 58% did family counseling. It found that &quot;there appear to be few, if any, empirical bases on which to distinguish counseling psychologists from their colleagues in clinical psychology.&quot;

In the late 1980s and 1990s, US states increasingly required the licensing of family councilors. The Association of Marital &amp; Family Therapy Regulatory Boards was established to allow for nationally harmonised accreditation.

The ACA defined &quot;counseling&quot; in 2010 as &quot;a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, families, and groups to accomplish mental health, wellness, education, and career goals.&quot; 

In 2019, the American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA) separated from the ACA.

As much as their practitioners did many of the same things&quot;,&quot; c&quot;linical psychology&quot; came to focus on treating abnormal psychology issues, while &quot;counseling psychology&quot; came to focus on addressing normal psychology matters.

&quot;Counseling&quot;, as overseen by the ACA and AMHCA, came to include all the subject areas listed by Rogers in 1942 that didn&#x27;t require its practitioners to have psychology or psychiatry qualifications, including those that use &quot;some other name&quot;. However, while it had Divisions for family counseling and social work, other bodies would have many more members from those fields.

Many US states now require people describing themselves as &quot;counselors&quot; to be licensed by the NBCC, such counselors becoming a &quot;National Certified Counselor&quot;.

Books describing the present international state of the field include the &quot;Handbook of Counseling and Psychotherapy in an International Context&quot;; the &quot;International Handbook of Cross-Cultural Counseling&quot;; and &quot;Counseling Around the World: An International Handbook&quot;. Taken together these volumes trace the global history of the field, explore divergent philosophical assumptions, counseling theories, processes, and trends in different countries, and review a variety of global counselor education programs. Moreover, traditional and indigenous treatment and healing methods that may predate modern counseling methods by hundreds of years remain of significance in many non-Western and Western countries.

== Educational Requirements ==
To be a counseling psychologist in the United States, it is first necessary to obtain a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology, sociology, anthropology, or a different degree within the realm of human services, from a four-year university. After acquiring a Bachelor’s, obtaining a Master&#x27;s degree is the next requirement. While prerequisites for a Master&#x27;s degree vary from program to program, a person can become a counselor after receiving their Master’s. Although, it is possible to obtain a Master’s and Doctorate degree simultaneously if the program you are enrolled in has that option. In the field of psychology, a doctorate degree is another term for PhD or PsyD. A PsyD is a Doctor of Psychology degree where the training emphasizes clinical practice, while a PhD is a Doctor of Philosophy degree that emphasizes clinical science and research. It is necessary to attend an accredited program to receive a Doctorate. An accredited program means that it is approved by the APA. The APA in the United States ensures that the program has defined training goals that follow the professional and scientific guidelines required for a successful, ethical, and skillful psychology program. 

==Salary==

In 2022, the median salary for counseling psychologists in the United States was $86,938 to $90,130. According to O*NET, the estimated hourly wage is $43.33. The expected growth rate is projected to be faster than average between the years of 2021 to 2031. There are assumed to be over 5000 job openings during then. 

==Variables in the Counseling Process ==
Counseling psychologists are interested in answering a variety of research questions about counseling process and outcome. Counseling &quot;process&quot; refers to how or why counseling happens and progresses. Currently, it is becoming more common for one to be concerned with their emotions and motivations, as well as learning how to control and manage their unwanted habits or emotions. Counseling psychology is sometimes used in order to achieve this. Counseling &quot;outcome&quot; addresses whether or not counseling is effective, under what conditions it is effective, and what outcomes are considered effective—such as symptom reduction, behavior change, or quality of life improvement. Topics commonly explored in the study of counseling process and outcome include therapist variables, client variables, the counseling or therapeutic relationship, cultural variables, process and outcome measurement, mechanisms of change, and process and outcome research methods. Classic approaches appeared early in the US in the field of humanistic psychology by Carl Rogers who identified the mission of counseling interview as &quot;to permit deeper expression that the client would ordinarily allow himself&quot;

===Therapist variables===
Therapist variables include characteristics of a counselor or psychotherapist, as well as therapist technique, behavior, theoretical orientation and training. In terms of therapist behavior, technique and theoretical orientation, research on adherence to therapy models has found that adherence to a particular model of therapy can be helpful, detrimental, or neutral in terms of impact on outcome.

A recent meta-analysis of research on training and experience suggests that experience level is only slightly related to accuracy in clinical judgment. Higher therapist experience has been found to be related to less anxiety, but also less focus. This suggests that there is still work to be done in terms of training clinicians and measuring successful training.

===Client variables===
Client characteristics such as help-seeking attitudes and attachment style have been found to be related to client use of counseling, as well as expectations and outcome. Stigma against mental illness can keep people from acknowledging problems and seeking help. Public stigma has been found to be related to self-stigma, attitudes towards counseling, and willingness to seek help.

In terms of attachment style, clients with avoidance styles have been found to perceive greater risks and fewer benefits to counseling, and are less likely to seek professional help, than securely attached clients. Those with anxious attachment styles perceive greater benefits, as well as risks, to counseling. Educating clients about expectations of counseling can improve client satisfaction, treatment duration and outcomes, and is an efficient and cost-effective intervention.

===Counseling relationship===
The relationship between a counselor and a client consists in the feelings and attitudes that a client and therapist have towards one another and the manner in which those feelings and attitudes are expressed. Some theorists have suggested that the relationship may be thought of in three parts: transference and countertransference, working alliance, and the real—or personal—relationship. Other theorists argue that the concepts of transference and countertransference are outdated and inadequate.

Transference can be described as the client&#x27;s distorted perceptions of the therapist. This can have a great effect on the therapeutic relationship. For instance, the therapist may have a facial feature that reminds the client of their parent. Because of this association, if the client has significant negative or positive feelings toward their parent, they may project these feelings onto the therapist. This can affect the therapeutic relationship in a few ways. For example, if the client has a very strong bond with their parent, they may see the therapist as a father or mother figure and have a strong connection with the therapist. This can be problematic because as a therapist, it is not ethical to have a more than &quot;professional&quot; relationship with a client. It can also be a good thing, because the client may open up greatly to the therapist. In another way, if the client has a very negative relationship with their parent, the client may feel negative feelings toward the therapist. This can then affect the therapeutic relationship as well. For example, the client may have trouble opening up to the therapist because he or she lacks trust in their parent (projecting these feelings of distrust onto the therapist).

Another theory about the function of the counseling relationship is known as the secure-base hypothesis, which is related to attachment theory. This hypothesis proposes that the counselor acts as a secure base from which clients can explore and then check in with. Secure attachment to one&#x27;s counselor and secure attachment in general have been found to be related to client exploration. Insecure attachment styles have been found to be related to less session depth than securely attached clients.

===Cultural variables===
Counseling psychologists are interested in how culture relates to help-seeking and counseling process and outcome. Standard surveys exploring the nature of counselling across cultures and various ethnic groups include Counseling Across Cultures by Paul B. Pedersen, Juris G. Draguns, Walter J. Lonner and Joseph E. Trimble, Handbook of Multicultural Counseling by Joseph G. Ponterotto, J. Manueal Casas, Lisa A. Suzuki and Charlene M. Alexander and Handbook of Culture, Therapy, and Healing by Uwe P. Gielen, Jefferson M. Fish and Juris G. Draguns. Janet E. Helms&#x27; racial identity model can be useful for understanding how the relationship and counseling process might be affected by the client&#x27;s and counselor&#x27;s racial identity. Recent research suggests that clients who are Black are at risk for experiencing racial micro-aggression from counselors who are White.

Efficacy for working with clients who are lesbians, gay men, or bisexual might be related to therapist demographics, gender, sexual identity development, sexual orientation, and professional experience. Clients who have multiple oppressed identities might be especially at-risk for experiencing unhelpful situations with counselors, so counselors might need help with gaining expertise for working with clients who are transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people of color, and other oppressed populations.

Gender role socialization can also present issues for clients and counselors. Implications for practice include being aware of stereotypes and biases about male and female identity, roles and behavior such as emotional expression. The APA guidelines for multicultural competence outline expectations for taking culture into account in practice and research.

===Counseling ethics and regulation===
Perceptions on ethical behaviors vary depending upon geographical location, but ethical mandates are similar throughout the global community. Ethical standards are created to help practitioners, clients and the community avoid any possible harm or potential for harm. The standard ethical behaviors are centered on &quot;doing no harm&quot; and preventing harm. An excellent guideline to follow is the Ethics Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. This code lists out the expectations psychologists must meet and thoroughly clarifies portions of the code. Some examples from the code would be respecting clients&#x27; rights, ensuring proper professional competence, ensuring the client&#x27;s welfare, and giving informed consent to name a few items from the code. Several states require counselors to follow a specific Code of Ethics which was revised and updated in 2014. Failure to follow this code can lead to license revocation or more severe consequences. One of the major reason for the Code of Conduct is to better protect and serve the client and the counselor.

Counselors must review with their clients verbally and in writing the responsibilities and rights that the counselor and client have.

Counselors must share their techniques with the client. This should include their goals for the client in their sessions, and breaking down the procedures of each session. It is required for any counselor to discuss their qualifications and credentials in order to establish trust in the relationship. There should be a breakdown of what to expect during each session and the provider should address any concerns or misgivings a patient might share about their choice to seek counseling.

Counselors cannot share any confidential information that is obtained through the counseling process without specific written consent by the client or legal guardian except to prevent clear, imminent danger to the client or others, or when required to do so by a court order. Insurance companies or government programs will also be notified of certain information about your diagnosis and treatment to determine if your care is covered. Those companies and government programs are bound by HIPAA to keep that information strictly confidential.

Counselors are held to a higher standard than most professionals because of the intimacy of their therapeutic delivery. Counselors are not only to avoid fraternizing with their clients. They should avoid dual relationships, and never engage in sexual relationships. While explicit/detrimental relationships must be avoided, the counselor should understand what is currently going on and how their patient is reacting. While explicit/detrimental relationships must be avoided, the counselor should understand what is currently going on and how their patient reacts to the counseling sessions. Counselors are also prohibited from counseling their friends and family members to ensure they remain objective. They are also prohibited from engaging in an online relationship, such as a relationship over social media with a client.

The National Board for Certified Counselors states that counselors &quot;shall discuss important considerations to avoid exploitation before entering into a non-counseling relationship with a former client. Important considerations to be discussed include amount of time since counseling service termination, duration of counseling, nature and circumstances of client&#x27;s counseling, the likelihood that the client will want to resume counseling at some time in the future; circumstances of service termination and possible negative effects or outcomes.&quot;

Counselors walk a fine line in regards to gifts. Counselors are generally discouraged from accepting gifts, favors, or trade for therapy. While the idea of a gift seems innocent to others, it can have long-lasting consequences for a counselor. In some communities, it may be avoidable given the economic standing of that community. However, individuals may feel personally rejected. In some cases if an offering is something such as a &quot;cookie&quot; or some form of small token gesture like a drawing from a child, it may be acceptable to receive the gesture. As counselors, a judgment call must be made, but in most cases, avoiding gifts, favors, and trade can be maintained.

There are specific examinations all counselors must pass to practice their craft successfully. These examinations are the National Counselor Examination (NCE), National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE), Certified Rehabilitation Counselor Examination (CRCE), Examination of Clinical Counselor Practice (ECCP). Of the exams listed, certain ones must be passed in certain specialties; however, the most common exam utilized is the NCE.

==Training and supervision==

===Professional training process===
Counseling psychologists are trained in graduate programs. Almost all programs grant a PhD, but a few grant a Psy.D. or Ed.D. Most doctoral programs take 5–6 years to complete. Graduate work in counseling psychology includes coursework in general psychology and statistics, counseling practice, and research. Students must complete an original dissertation at the end of their graduate training. Students must also complete a one-year full-time internship at an accredited site before earning their doctorate. In order to be licensed to practice, counseling psychologists must gain clinical experience under supervision, and pass a standardized exam.

===Training models and research===
Counseling psychology includes the study and practice of counselor training and counselor supervision. As researchers, counseling psychologists may investigate what makes training and supervision effective. As practitioners, counseling psychologists may supervise and train a variety of clinicians. Counselor training tends to occur in formal classes and training programs. Part of counselor training may involve counseling clients under the supervision of a licensed clinician. Supervision can also occur between licensed clinicians, as a way to improve clinicians&#x27; quality of work and competence with various types of counseling clients.

As the field of counseling psychology formed in the mid-20th century, initial training models included Robert Carkuff&#x27;s human relations training model, Norman Kagan&#x27;s Interpersonal Process Recall, and Allen Ivey&#x27;s microcounseling skills. Modern training models include Gerard Egan&#x27;s skilled helper model, and Clara E. Hill&#x27;s three-stage model (exploration, insight, and action). A recent analysis of studies on counselor training found that modeling, instruction, and feedback are common to most training models, and seem to have medium to large effects on trainees.

===Supervision models and research===
Like the models of how clients and therapists interact, there are also models of the interactions between therapists and their supervisors. Edward S. Bordin proposed a model of supervision working alliance similar to his model of therapeutic working alliance. The Integrated Development Model considers the level of a client&#x27;s motivation/anxiety, autonomy, and self and other awareness. The Systems Approach to Supervision views the relationship between supervisor and supervised as most important, in addition to characteristics of the supervisor&#x27;s personal characteristics, counseling clients, training setting, as well as the tasks and functions of supervision. The Critical Events in Supervision model focuses on important moments that occur between the supervisor and supervised.

Problems can arise in supervision and training. Questions have arisen as far as a supervisor&#x27;s need for formal training to be a competent supervisor. Recent research suggests that conflicting, multiple relationships can occur between supervisors and clients, such as that of the client, instructor, and clinical supervisor. The occurrence of racial micro-aggression against Black clients suggests potential problems with racial bias in supervision. In general, conflicts between a counselor and his or her own supervisor can arise when supervisors demonstrate disrespect, lack of support, and blaming.

== Categories of counseling ==

=== Career counseling ===

The goal of career counseling is to help provide guidance during all stages of a person&#x27;s career trajectory. Career Counseling looks to help an individual understand themselves and the ongoing world around them so they may make an informed decision regarding their life and career. Career counselors provide a wide array of services, such as attempting to help individuals discover themselves. Counselors also attempt to help others discover their actual goals or achievements they may want to complete in life regarding education, career, or their life in general. While also helping individuals figure out what they may want to become, career counselors also help find resources and information that may be of use to people in achieving their future goals. Career counselors will create a roadmap of sorts to help individuals visualize where they are along in their journey of achieving their dreams. One factor that counselors deal with is people tend to think unemployment can be permanent; however, counselors must make sure that unemployment is only temporary and their status will eventually change. So counselors must do their best to give positive reinforcement to focus more on finding their path in life. Career counseling may include provision of occupational information, modeling skills, written exercises, and exploration of career goals and plans. Career counseling can also involve the use of personality or career interest assessments, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is based on Carl Jung&#x27;s theory of psychological type, or the Strong Interest Inventory, which makes use of Holland&#x27;s theory. Assessments of skills, abilities, and values are also commonly assessed in career counseling. Career counselors have the flexibility to decide whether to conduct sessions using a group setting or single face-to-face in person or online setting. Currently, there is no internationally accepted standard to become a qualified career counselor; qualifications and certification will vary depending on local, state, and internal regulations.

=== Marriage and family counseling ===
The purpose of marriage and family counseling is to explore the relationships and interactions in the family and discuss the positive actions already taken, and how to change the negative actions in order to bring productive change to the family. Marriage and family counseling allows the family to discover how they can work together to make the household functional and find solutions, when necessary.

=== Rehabilitation counseling ===
The purpose of rehabilitation counseling is to work alongside people with disabilities in order to achieve their academic, career, or personal goals. In rehabilitation counseling, a counselor works closely with the client to address their goals, and come up with a plan to achieve those goals.

=== Clinical mental health counseling ===

Clinical mental health counseling is addressing a variety of issues such as addiction, family and relationship issues, abuse, and stress. Clinical mental health counseling provides guidance on how to handle and cope with these life struggles. They help make any adjustments in order to improve the quality of life for each client.

=== Educational counseling ===
The purpose of educational counseling is to work with students in elementary, junior high, and high school to discuss future education goals. For elementary and junior high, educational counselors are there to provide support and work alongside teachers and parents in order to avert negative actions and replace them with positive. In high school, an educational counselor is mainly there to help guide students to success after graduation. 

== Effects of COVID in relation to counseling ==
The ongoing pandemic has caused career counselors to adjust many of their current plans with their clients. While also helping to improve their abilities by facing new and different situations. The pandemic, in the beginning, caused a significant job layoff, which messed up a lot of people&#x27;s career plans. Towards the beginning of 2020, employment lost around 22.4 million individuals, a downturn of around 15%. Another critical factor regarding the pandemic is that many schools shut down for a while, negatively impacting students. One such scenario is students looking for specific programs to start their masters may not have been able to with the educational shut down, which could have negatively impacted their future career path. After education started to come back online, counselors soon ran into an issue. They had to become more tech-savvy and understand how to work digitally significantly faster to help clients since the shift to an online platform. While moving to a more online counseling presence can be tricky, it will lead to more positives overall. One major positive being the flexibility with obtaining the counseling has become significantly better. However, while moving a portion to online telehealth, there are still cases that are better suited to in-person like addictions. There was an almost doubling of referrals regarding seeing a psychologist around 2020, 62%. When looking at psychologists, 7 out of 10 had their waitlist grow more extended, about 68%. Another factor to consider is the effect Covid has played on the counselor&#x27;s health. Seeing how the pandemic has affected their patients why could it not affect the counselors if not be more sever, since they are dedicating more time to helping others instead of themselves. It has been noted that Counselors could be feeling overwhelmed, which can lead to many negative consequences. Hopefully, through research and information based upon prior crises, they can stay informed to take better care of themselves while helping others.

== Professional journals ==
In the United States, the scholarly journals of the profession are the &quot;Journal of Counseling Psychology&quot; and &quot;The Counseling Psychologist&quot;. The &quot;Journal of Counseling Psychology&quot; publishes articles with, “theoretical, empirical, and methodological articles on multicultural aspects of counseling.” It also focuses on assessment, intervention, consultations, and educational requirements.

<text>Thomas William Hamilton (born December 31, 1951) is an American musician and songwriter who serves as the bassist for the hard rock band Aerosmith.

Hamilton has regularly co-written songs for Aerosmith, including two of the band&#x27;s biggest successes: &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; (1975) and &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; (1989). Hamilton occasionally plays guitar (e.g. &quot;Uncle Salty&quot;, &quot;Sick as a Dog&quot;), sings backing vocals (e.g. &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;) and on rare occasions, lead vocals (&quot;Up On the Mountain&quot;). He was a 2001 inductee in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Aerosmith.

==Early years==
Hamilton was born to George and Betty Hamilton in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He has an older brother named Scott, an older sister named Perry, and a younger sister named Cecily. His father was a United States Air Force pilot in World War II and his mother was a housewife.

Hamilton initially played guitar and was taught at age 12 by his older brother Scott. He switched to bass when he was 14 due to an open position in a local band. Later, Hamilton was in several bands with future Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry and David &quot;Pudge&quot; Scott. One of the bands was simply called &quot;The Jam Band.&quot; It was at a Jam Band gig in the summer of 1970 at a venue named &quot;The Barn&quot; in Sunapee, New Hampshire that the group met Steven Tyler. Next, the four of them agreed to move to Boston in order to start a band (not yet named Aerosmith). Scott left the group shortly thereafter and was replaced by Tyler on drums. The three became a power trio with Hamilton on bass, Perry on guitar, and Tyler doubling as both the vocalist and drummer. Guitarist Ray Tabano and drummer Joey Kramer would join shortly thereafter; Kramer replaced Tyler on drums so he could focus on vocals and also named the band &quot;Aerosmith.&quot; Tabano would be replaced by Brad Whitford in 1971.

==Personal life==

According to Aerosmith&#x27;s official website, Hamilton&#x27;s favorite song by the band is &quot;The Farm&quot; (from the 1997 album &quot;Nine Lives&quot;). He married Terry Cohen in 1975 and they have two children.

Prior to becoming a musician, Hamilton worked as a nursing home orderly and had embarked on a journey to become an actor; he was accepted into two different acting schools but declined in order to pursue a career in music. Eventually, however, Hamilton would fulfill his acting goal by joining the cast of &quot;Banned in Boston&quot; in 1996; he has been performing with them yearly since.

Additionally, he has created and currently owns a line of adult-themed plush toys and merchandise called Obscenies.

In August 2006, he announced that he was diagnosed with throat and tongue cancer and completed a seven-week course of radiation and chemotherapy. As a result, he missed Aerosmith&#x27;s Route of All Evil Tour. David Hull (who played in the Joe Perry Project) filled in. Prior to this, Hamilton had never missed an Aerosmith show. He sat in with the band on &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; at their September 2006 Boston show and played an entire performance at a private show at the Beacon Theatre in New York, on December 3, 2006. On December 20, 2006, Hamilton reported on Aero Force One that he is cancer-free after a recent PET scan. He underwent further surgery, causing him to sit out some of the Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour. David Hull covered for him again during his absence. His cancer returned in 2011, but he is now cancer-free.

Hamilton left the band&#x27;s April 2013 Australian tour after two shows due to a chest infection. David Hull was flown in from the US to fill in.

In April 2016, Thin Lizzy announced that Hamilton was joining them for their 2016 and 2017 reunion shows.

The longtime Aerosmith bassist revealed a new band, Close Enemies, in September 2024.

Hamilton&#x27;s favorite bassists are John Paul Jones, John Entwistle and Paul McCartney.

== Instruments and equipment ==

Hamilton has used a wide variety of basses over Aerosmith&#x27;s career. He has stated in several interviews that his first bass was a Fender Precision Bass that he borrowed and later bought from a friend. He would use a Fender Precision Bass in the early years of Aerosmith, and used one to record the bass lines for their first two albums; he would return to using one on the &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; and &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; albums.

Since 2000, Hamilton has primarily played G&amp;L basses. He purchased his first metal-flake G&amp;L ASAT Bass around that time at 48th Street Guitars in New York City. Hamilton now has his own G&amp;L ASAT Bass signature model line, which is made from a unique reduced-weight Western Sugar Pine body. It also comes with specially developed &quot;Hamiltone&quot; pickups and is available for sale in three different metal-flake colors. Hamilton says that he enjoys playing his G&amp;L signature basses as they are an evolution of the Fender Jazz Bass sound and feel, and discusses his signature basses in rig rundowns (most notably in 2012 on the Global Warming Tour).

Hamilton also frequently plays Sadowsky basses, and has said that Roger Sadowsky makes &quot;unbelievably nice basses.&quot; For the recording of the album &quot;Honkin&#x27; On Bobo&quot; and subsequent tours, he used a butterscotch Sadowsky &#x27;51 Fender Precision Bass replica modified with a second pickup. It has been one of his main basses for quite some time, and he appeared as playing this bass in &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;. Additionally, Hamilton used a five-string Sadowsky to record the hits &quot;Pink&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Miss a Thing&quot;, and &quot;Full Circle.&quot; As of June 2009, he was touring with five Sadowsky basses.

During Aerosmith&#x27;s 1970&#x27;s heyday, Hamilton primarily used an early model stack-knob Fender Jazz Bass to record bass lines. This bass was used to record the bass lines for &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way.&quot; Furthermore, it was also used to record the rest of &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Rocks&quot;, and some of &quot;Draw the Line&quot;. Hamilton stated that he enjoys the feel of the slender Jazz Bass neck as well as its unique sounding pickups. Though he rarely tours with a Jazz Bass anymore, bandmate Steven Tyler surprised Hamilton with a custom-shop Fender Jazz Bass while the two were at a music store in Vancouver, Canada in 2011; it was used to record most of the songs on &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;

Notably, Hamilton was one of the earliest and most well-known players of the Music Man StingRay Bass. He first used a StingRay Bass to record most of &quot;Draw the Line&quot; in 1977. Since then, he used a StingRay Bass to record the albums &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot;, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, and some of &quot;Just Push Play&quot;. Additionally, he even used a StingRay Bass to record the demo tracks for &quot;Get a Grip&quot;, before switching to an F Bass. He toured with StingRay basses throughout the late 1970s, and has once again begun touring with various StingRay Bass models during the 2022 &quot;Deuces are Wild&quot; residency and the current &quot;Peace Out!&quot; tour. In an interview, Hamilton noted that he was very proud of the tone he got from his early model StingRay Bass on the &quot;Pump&quot; album.

In the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, Hamilton often played a Gibson Thunderbird Bass on tour.

On the album &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, he used a Music Man Sabre Bass to record his bass lines. He can be seen playing one in the music videos for &quot;No Surprize&quot; and &quot;Chiquita.&quot;

For the &quot;Get a Grip&quot; album, Hamilton recorded all of his bass lines with an F Bass that featured a P/J pickup configuration; he bought it during the album sessions in 1992.

During the &quot;Dude Looks Like A Lady&quot; sequence of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, he is seen playing a Gibson Les Paul Bass; it was occasionally used on the 1993–94 Get a Grip Tour.

He has also used a 1960s Höfner Violin Bass to record some of the &quot;Just Push Play&quot; album, but most notably it was used to record the songs What It Takes and Jaded. Additionally, it was played during the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. During the &quot;Just Push Play&quot; sessions, he also used a double bass.

During the 2000s, he toured with several Parker basses. Hamilton worked closely with Parker to develop the Fly Bass and was gifted a prototype version in 2002, which he donated to VH1&#x27;s Save the Music charity; it raised funds for schools with inadequate music programs. Hamilton had frequently played the bass for six months prior on tour, and it was signed by all five members of Aerosmith as well as employees of Parker Guitars. He was also gifted the first production Fly Bass in April 2003. Lastly, he primarily played a red Fly Bass on the 2004 Honkin&#x27; On Bobo Tour.

Other basses played on tour by Hamilton include a Duesenberg Starplayer semi-hollow bass strung with flatwound strings, a Visionary Instruments Video Bass, an Australian-built Tomkins Kimberely 1 Bass, an acoustic Kramer USA bass, a neon-blue colored ESP bass, as well as various four and five string F-Bass models.

In 2023, Hamilton sent a sizeable portion of his instrument and equipment collection to Donn&#x27;s Drum Vault in Bellevue, MA to be offered for public sale. Notable items available for sale were three early-model Music Man StingRay basses, the 1960s Höfner Violin Bass used during the recording of &quot;Just Push Play&quot; and the Super Bowl XXXV Halftime Show, a &#x27;62 American Vintage Re-issue Fender Jazz Bass used in the &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; 1991 music video, various Sadowsky basses, and two Parker Fly basses fitted with EMG pickups.

Over the course of his career, Hamilton has used an array of different amplifiers and effects. He has been a large proponent of Gallien-Krueger heads and amplifiers. Currently, he uses their Neo 410 and 412 cabinets paired to their Fusion 550 head. During the recording of the &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; album, he used an Ampeg B-15 amplifier and an Electro-Voice RE20 microphone. From the 1990s to the early 2010s, Hamilton primarily used Hartke 4.5XL Module cabinets paired with Gallien-Krueger heads.

Hamilton primarily uses TC Electronic effects, namely their Corona Chorus, Mojomojo Overdrive, and G-Major Overdrive Rack Processor. Other effects used by Hamilton include a Pigtronix BASS Fat Drive pedal, a Soundbox Pro multi-wave distortion box, and a Mojo Hand FX Rook Overdrive pedal.

Lastly, Hamilton has been a long-time user of D&#x27;Addario 45-100 and 45-130 strings.

==Playing style==

Hamilton commonly employs pauses in his bass lines to help define the rhythm pattern of the song. He also often uses descending arpeggios, upbeat accents, and pentatonic scales in his playing. Additionally, he frequently uses slides in his bass lines (e.g. &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Falling in Love&quot;). Apart from this, Hamilton plays with suspended chords (e.g. &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;), and also uses open strings to form a low drone sound; he frequently jumps to higher registers so that his notes can ring out. Moreover, he also occasionally plays slap bass (e.g. &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;). Notably, Hamilton has alternated between playing finger-style and with a pick. Lastly, on &quot;Taste of India&quot;, he used a percussion mallet.

<doc id="505341" wikidata="Q1413715" url="?curid=505341" title="United States presidential nominating convention">
<text>A United States presidential nominating convention is a political convention held every four years in the United States by most of the political parties who will be fielding nominees in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The formal purpose of such a convention is to select the party&#x27;s nominees for popular election as President and Vice President, as well as to adopt a statement of party principles and goals known as the &quot;party platform&quot; and adopt the rules for the party&#x27;s activities, including the presidential nominating process for the next election cycle. Conventions remain an important part of the political process despite the nominees almost always being determined during the primary season, as they provide positive publicity for the nominee and party, which can then lead to a convention bounce.

The earliest public national presidential nominating Conventions have been traced back to the 1832 election, before which smaller groups of party leaders chose the nominee, arguably beginning with the 1796 election. Since 1972, most of the delegates have been selected in presidential primaries state by state. Other delegates to these conventions include political party members who are seated automatically, and are called &quot;unpledged delegates&quot; because they can choose for themselves for which candidate they vote. The pledged delegates determined by the primaries generally allow the nominees to be decided before the convention opens, but if no single candidate has secured a majority of both pledged and unpledged delegates then a &quot;brokered convention&quot; can result. 

In addition to the two major parties&#x27; quadrennial events: the Democratic and Republican National Convention, some minor parties also select their nominees by convention, including the Green Party, the Socialist Party USA, the Libertarian Party, the Constitution Party, and the Reform Party USA.

==Logistics==

===Schedule===
The convention cycle begins with the &quot;Call to Convention&quot;. Usually issued about 18 months in advance, the Call is an invitation from the national party to the state and territory parties to convene to select a presidential nominee. It also sets out the number of delegates to be awarded to each, as well as the rules for the nomination process. Since 1964, the conventions are usually scheduled for four days of business, with the exception of the 1972 Republican and 2012 Democratic conventions, which were scheduled for three days each. (The 2008 and 2012 Republican conventions were also three days each, but in each case was shortened from the scheduled four days due to weather issues.)

Since 1936 the party to which the incumbent president belongs has held its convention second. Between 1864 and 1952, the Democrats went second every year (except for 1888). In 1956, when Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower was the incumbent, the Democrats went first for the first time since 1888. So from 1936 to 1952, during administrations led by Democratic presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, the Democrats had their convention after the Republicans, but it is unclear whether they went second because they held the White House or because they had almost always gone second. 1956 became the first year it was clear a party went second because they were the party of the incumbent, and that protocol has been followed ever since.

Major party conventions from the start through 1948 were mostly held in May and June, with a few exceptions. This might have been due to the lack of air conditioning – the last conventions held without air conditioning were in 1948.
Since 1952, all major party conventions have been held in the months of July, August or (for the first time in 2004), finishing in early September. Between the middle of the 20th century and 2004, the two major party conventions were primarily scheduled about one month apart, often with the Summer Olympics in between so they did not have to compete for viewers. In 1996, both were held in August to accommodate the Atlanta Olympics in July, the last Summer Olympics to date to be hosted in the U.S. In 2000, both conventions preceded the Sydney Olympics in late September.

In 2008 and 2012, the Democratic and Republican conventions were scheduled for back-to-back weeks following the conclusion of the Beijing and London Olympics, respectively, resulting in the later conventions starting in September for the first time (Republicans in 2008, Democrats in 2012, with the Democratic start on September 4, 2012, the latest any major convention has started). One reason for these late conventions had to do with campaign finance laws, which allow the candidates to spend an unlimited amount of money before the convention, but forbid fundraising after the convention, for the parties to receive federal campaign funds. However, moving the conventions into early September led to conflicts with the National Football League&#x27;s season kickoff game, which is usually held on the first Thursday after Labor Day in September. (The NFL accommodated the conventions and moved its game to an earlier start time in 2008, and to a rare Wednesday in 2012. Convention dates in 2004, and 2016 through 2024 did not conflict with the NFL schedule). Additionally, election laws in some states would likely prevent conventions from moving later into mid-September. Ohio election laws forced the Democrats to schedule a virtual nomination of Kamala Harris prior to the scheduled 2024 convention, to get around an August 7 ballot deadline. (Such deadlines have been waived in one way or another in previous election cycles).

However, Barack Obama&#x27;s choice not to receive federal campaign funds for the 2008 general election started a trend, and so the campaign finance reason for the late scheduling of conventions has gone away in subsequent cycles.

Finally, within the above general constraints, and the variable scheduling of the Olympics, political reasons can also drive the schedules. For example, the Democratic Party held its 2008 convention after the Beijing Olympics to &quot;maximize momentum for our Democratic ticket in the final months of the Presidential election&quot;. In 2016, both the Republican and Democratic conventions moved to July, before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August. One reason why the Republican Party wanted a July convention was to help avoid a drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012 that left the party fractured heading into the general election. The Democrats then followed suit so they could provide a quicker response to the Republicans, rather than wait for a month until after the Olympics were over.

The 2020 Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled to take place July 13–16, but was postponed to August 17–20, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 Republican National Convention took place as scheduled from August 24–27. The Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled to open on July 24, 2020, were also postponed, because of the pandemic, to July 2021. This was the first time that nominating conventions did not coincide with the Olympics since 1944, when the games were cancelled due to World War II.

The schedule for 2024 returned to the standard for most of the late 20th century, with the conventions bracketing the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles start a little earlier, in mid-July, and this could therefore have an effect on the schedule for the two 2028 conventions. And unlike the 2000 Sydney Olympics, which were held in late September, the 2032 Brisbane Olympics start on July 23, 2032, potentially allowing a normal convention bracketing schedule in that year.

===Participation===

Each party sets its own rules for the participation and format of the convention. Broadly speaking, each U.S. state and territory party is apportioned a select number of voting representatives, individually known as &quot;delegates&quot; and collectively as the &quot;delegation&quot;. Each party uses its own formula for determining the size of each delegation, factoring in such considerations as population, proportion of that state&#x27;s Congressional representatives or state government officials who are members of the party, and the state&#x27;s voting patterns in previous presidential elections. The selection of individual delegates and their alternates, too, is governed by the bylaws of each state party, or in some cases by state law.

The 2004 Democratic National Convention counted 4,353 delegates and 611 alternates. The 2004 Republican National Convention had 2,509 delegates and 2,344 alternates. However, other attendees who do not participate in the formal business of the convention dwarf these individuals numerically. These include non-delegate party officials and activists, invited guests and companions, and international observers, not to mention numerous members of the news media, volunteers, protesters, and local business proprietors and promoters hoping to capitalize on the quadrennial event.

===Location===

The convention is typically held in a major city selected by the national party organization 18–24 months before the election is to be held, although the Republican National Committee voted in 2022 to allow the party to select its presidential convention sites six years in advance. As the two major conventions have grown into large, publicized affairs with significant economic impact, cities today compete vigorously to be awarded host responsibilities, citing their meeting venues, lodging facilities, and entertainment as well as offering economic incentives.

The location of early conventions was dictated by the difficulty of transporting delegates from far-flung parts of the country; early Democratic and Whig Conventions were frequently held in the central Eastern Seaboard port of Baltimore, Maryland. As the U.S. expanded westward and railroads connected cities, Midwestern locations such as Chicago, Illinois—which since 1860 has held 26 Republican and Democratic Conventions combined, more than any other city—became the favored hosts. In addition St. Louis, Missouri, hosted Democratic national nominating conventions in 1876, 1888, 1904, and 1916, as well as the national Republican convention of 1896 and a national Populist convention in the same year. The city had easy railroad access, numerous elegant hotels and expansive meeting facilities, with Democrats wanting to meet close to their base in the &quot;Solid South.&quot; But the ubiquity of air travel in the mid twentieth century eroded the advantage of the central location of midwestern cities, and the infamous protest activity and police response at the 1968 Democratic National Convention ended Chicago&#x27;s hosting dominance, with the city only holding two conventions since.

Baltimore is an excellent example of the changing nature of convention host cities. The most frequent host city of major party conventions in the 19th century, Baltimore is currently considered to lack an appropriate venue and sufficient hotel space for modern conventions. When the city made a longshot bid for the 2004 Democratic National Convention, the city proposed hosting the convention underneath a temporary canopy that would be erected at Oriole Park at Camden Yards (which would have likely necessitated its baseball team tenant to vacate the venue for a roughly two-month period of their season). 

In present times, political symbolism affects the selection of the host city as much as economic or logistical considerations do. A particular city might be selected to enhance the standing of a favorite son, or in an effort to curry favor with residents of that state. For example, in 2011, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina noted: &quot;We put the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in part because we believe so deeply in&quot; a &quot;New South map.&quot; Likewise, New York City was selected as the host of the 2004 Republican National Convention to evoke memories of George W. Bush&#x27;s leadership during the September 11 attacks. Milwaukee, in the politically competitive state of Wisconsin, was chosen as the site of the 2020 Democratic National Convention (although due to COVID-19 it was essentially not held there), and the subsequent 2024 Republican National Convention.

The conventions historically have been held inside convention centers, but in recent decades the two major parties have favored sports arenas and stadiums to accommodate the increasing capacity, the former because indoor arenas are usually off-season outside of WNBA sites, allowing plenty of time for preparation (the major political parties have avoided baseball stadiums ever since the 1992 Republican National Convention at the Houston Astrodome forced the Houston Astros to play 26 consecutive road games). Bids for the 2008 Republican National Convention, for example, were required to have a facility with a seating capacity of at least 20,500 people, including a convention floor of about 5,500 delegates and alternates; the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota was eventually selected. Meanwhile, approximately 84,000 people attended the last day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention at Denver&#x27;s Invesco Field at Mile High. The last day of the 2012 Democratic Convention originally also was scheduled for an outdoor football stadium, but was moved indoors due to weather concerns. Excepting the pandemic-affected 2020 conventions, the last non-sporting venue to host the Democratic National Convention was San Francisco&#x27;s Moscone Center in 1984. In 1996, the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego became the last non-sporting venue to host the Republican National Convention.

On six occasions, both the Democratic and Republican parties held their conventions in the same city: Chicago four times, in 1884, 1932, 1944, and 1952; Philadelphia in 1948, and Miami Beach, the last to do so, in 1972.

==Delegate selection process==

Every year of a presidential election, the United States&#x27; political parties have national conventions that result in presidential candidates. However, selected delegates from each state choose candidates rather than members of the public.

Including pledged delegates in the nomination process began after the Presidential election year of 1968, when there was widespread dissatisfaction with the presidential nominating process. Minor-party movements also threatened the chances of Democratic and Republican candidates to win majorities of the electoral votes, which resulted in the reformation of the presidential election process.

===Democratic selection process===

Each party and state has its own process to selecting delegates.

Generally speaking, delegates of both major parties usually pledge their votes to a specific candidate, and those who are associated with the Democratic Party and are unpledged are considered super delegates. These super delegates may include governors who identify with the party, members of the U.S. Congress, as well as members of the Democratic National Committee. Super Delegates aren&#x27;t pledged to a particular candidate, and can vote for who they please. Any registered Democrat may run to be a delegate, and wins are based on congressional votes. Once Democrats choose their delegates, they distribute delegates to each candidate evenly, according to the number of congressional district votes they get (must be at least 15%).

===Republican selection process===

Rule 14 of the Republican Party&#x27;s national rules determines the size of delegates for each state, territory, or political subdivision. Delegate selection for the Republican Party must take between March 1 and the second Saturday in June in the year that the convention is held (except for Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, which are exempt from the rule and may hold earlier selection processes). The Republican Party uses a &quot;Proportional Allocation&quot; rule, which states that delegates should be based on the statewide votes or the number of congressional district votes in proportion to the number of votes received by each candidate. Also, each state must advocate to have an equal number of men and women in its delegation.

Delegates and alternate delegates for the Republican National Convention may be selected or bound by only &quot;one&quot; of the following:

* Primary election
* Republican State Committee
* State and Congressional district conventions
* Any method that stays consistent with the rules by which they were selected

==Favorite son, dark horse, bolter==
===Favorite son===
A powerful state politician, typically the governor or senator, can set up as a &quot;favorite son&quot;. The state delegates are pledged to vote for him at least for the first round. Today the role is honorific, but before 1972 control of a delegation gave bargaining power regarding the platform or the nomination. The technique was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since nationwide campaigns by candidates and binding primary elections have replaced brokered conventions, the technique has fallen out of use, as party rule changes in the early 1970s required candidates to have nominations from more than one state.

In 1860, Senator Robert M. T. Hunter was Virginia&#x27;s favorite at the Democratic Party convention. He offered a proslavery voice of moderation amidst the strident rhetoric of secession. In 1952, California Governor Earl Warren was the favorite son at the Republican convention, but he was challenged by Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon leveraged his way into becoming Eisenhower&#x27;s choice for the vice presidential nomination.

===Dark horse===
The term &quot;dark horse candidate&quot; was used at the 1844 Democratic National Convention, at which little-known Tennessee politician James K. Polk emerged as the candidate after the failure of the leading candidates to secure the necessary two-thirds majority.
Other successful dark horse candidates include:
* Franklin Pierce, the Democratic nominee, elected in 1852.
* Rutherford B. Hayes, elected in 1876.
* James A. Garfield, elected in 1880.
* Warren G. Harding, elected president in 1920 after his surprise Republican nomination.
* Wendell Willkie, a businessman who came out of nowhere to win the Republican nomination in 1940. He lost to President Franklin Roosevelt. 

===Bolter===
Delegates to the convention are expected to support whichever candidate wins the nomination. A delegate who refuses to do that walks out or &quot;&quot;, sometimes in public fashion, can be referred to as a bolter. A group of bolters may form an alternate convention that can be called a bolting convention; the remnants of the party or convention they leave behind can be called a rump convention.

At the intensely fought 1896 Republican convention, the decisive battle was on support for gold or silver. When gold forces won by tally of 812 to 110, 25 of the 110 bolted while the others supported the party nominee, William McKinley. The next day the bolters formed a new political party, dubbed the Silver Republican Party. It had a strong base of support in the silver-mining Mountain states. The Democratic nominee, William Jennings Bryan, appealed to the bolters by accepting the Silver Republican nomination; he also accepted the People&#x27;s party nomination, so he ran on three tickets.

Conservative Democrats from the South bolted from the 1948 Democratic Convention to form the States&#x27; Rights Party under the banner of Strom Thurmond when Minneapolis Mayor Hubert Humphrey successfully added a civil rights plank to the Democratic platform.

The most notorious instance of bolting was in 1912 when, having lost a credentials fight, the supporters of former President Theodore Roosevelt formed the so-called Bull Moose Party, splitting the GOP down the middle, holding a bolting convention to nominate Roosevelt who came in second in the election, something that would never happen again.

==Proceedings==
During the day, party activists hold meetings and rallies, and work on the platform. Voting and important convention-wide addresses usually take place in the evening hours.

In recent conventions, routine business such as examining the credentials of delegations, ratifying rules and procedures, election of convention officers, and adoption of the platform usually take up the business of the first two days of the convention. Balloting was usually held on the third day, with the nomination and acceptance made on the last day, but even some of these traditions have fallen away in 21st-century conventions. The only constant is that the convention ends with the nominee&#x27;s acceptance speech.

===Platform===
Each convention produces a statement of principles known as its &quot;platform&quot;, containing goals and proposals known as &quot;planks&quot;. Relatively little of a party platform is even proposed as public policy. Much of the language is generic, while other sections are narrowly written to appeal to factions or interest groups within the party. Unlike electoral manifestos in many European countries, the platform is not binding on either the party or the candidate.

Because it is ideological rather than pragmatic, however, the platform is sometimes itself politicized. For example, defenders of abortion rights lobbied heavily to remove the Human Life Amendment plank from the 1996 Republican National Convention platform, a move fiercely resisted by conservatives despite the fact that no such amendment had ever come up for debate.

===Voting===
Since the 1970s, voting has for the most part been perfunctory; the selection of the major parties&#x27; nominees have rarely been in doubt, so a single ballot has always been sufficient. Each delegation announces its vote tallies, usually accompanied with some boosterism of their state or territory. The delegation may pass, nominally to retally their delegates&#x27; preferences, but often to allow a different delegation to give the leading candidate the honor of casting the majority-making vote.

Before the presidential nomination season actually begins, there is often speculation about whether a single front runner would emerge. If there is no single candidate receiving a majority of delegates at the end of the primary season, a scenario called a brokered convention would result, where a candidate would be selected either at or near the convention, through political horse-trading and lesser candidates compelling their delegates to vote for one of the front runners. The best example was the 1924 Democratic Convention, which took 103 ballots. The situation is more likely to occur in the Democratic Party, because of its proportional representation system, but such a scenario has been the subject of speculation with regard to most contested nominations of both parties without actually coming to pass in recent years. It is a common scenario in fiction, most recently in an episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The closest to a brokered convention in recent years was at the 1976 Republican National Convention, when neither Gerald Ford nor Ronald Reagan received enough votes in the primary to lock up the nomination. Since then, candidates have received enough momentum to reach a majority through pledged and bound delegates before the date of the convention.

More recently, a customary practice has been for the losing candidates in the primary season to release their delegates and exhort them to vote for the winning nominee as a sign of party unity. Thus, the vote tallied on the floor is unanimous or nearly so. Some delegates may nevertheless choose to vote for their candidate. And in 2008 both happened: Hillary Clinton received over 1,000 votes before she herself moved to nominate Barack Obama by acclamation, officially making it a unanimous vote.

The voting method at the conventions is a &quot;roll call of the states&quot;, which include territories such as Washington D.C., American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and a catch-all &quot;delegates abroad&quot; category. The states are called in alphabetical order (beginning with Alabama and ending with Wyoming). The state&#x27;s spokesperson (who generally begins with glowing comments about the state&#x27;s history, geography, and notable party elected officials) can either choose to announce its delegate count or pass. Once all states have either declared or passed, those states which passed are called upon again to announce their delegate count. (Generally, a decision is made beforehand that some states will pass in the first round, to allow a particular state—generally either the presidential or vice-presidential nominee&#x27;s home state—to be the one whose delegate count pushes the candidate &quot;over the top&quot;, thus securing the nomination.)

Vice-presidential voting has been problematic since the beginning: at the 1972 Democratic National Convention, the vote was scattered between 50 candidates and at the 1976 Republican National Convention, the vote was also scattered widely. In 1988, both parties decided to have their designated candidates nominated by suspending the rules and declaring them nominated by acclamation; the most recent vice-presidential roll call vote was at the 1984 Republican National Convention.

If, after the first round of voting, there is no candidate with a majority of votes, subsequent roll calls are held. In between, candidates can make backroom deals, swapping delegates in exchange for positions in the administration or other favors, or candidates can release their delegates to vote for whoever they personally prefer. Roll calls continue until one candidate has a majority: the 1924 Democratic National Convention holds the record as the longest ever, as divisions within the party concerning Prohibition led to 102 ballots between Alfred E. Smith and William G. McAdoo, before the relatively unknown John W. Davis was chosen as a compromise candidate on the 103rd ballot.

===Speeches===

Minor figures in the party are given the opportunity to address the floor of the convention during the daytime, when only the small audiences of C-SPAN and other cable television outlets are watching. The evening&#x27;s speeches—designed for broadcast to a large national audience—are reserved for major speeches by notable, respected public figures; the speakers at the 2004 Democratic Convention included Ted Kennedy, a forty-two-year veteran of the United States Senate, and Jimmy Carter, a former Democratic President, while speakers at the Republican Convention included Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Governor George Pataki of New York, two of the largest states in the nation.

The organizers of the convention may designate one of these speeches as the keynote address, one which above all others is stated to underscore the convention&#x27;s themes or political goals. For instance, the 1992 Democratic National Convention keynote address was delivered by Georgia Governor Zell Miller, whose stories of an impoverished childhood echoed the economic themes of the nominee, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. The 1996 Republican National Convention was keynoted by U.S. Representative Susan Molinari of New York, intended to reassure political moderates about the centrism of the nominee, former Senator Bob Dole. And the 2004 Democratic National Convention featured Senator Barack Obama, whose speech brought the future President national recognition for the first time.

Uniquely, Miller, by then a Senator, would also be the keynote speaker at the 2004 Republican Convention, despite still maintaining his Democratic registration.

The final day of the convention usually features the formal acceptance speeches from the nominees for president and vice president. Despite recent controversy maintaining that recent conventions were scripted from beginning to end, and that very little news (if any) comes out of the convention, the acceptance speech has always been televised by the networks, because it receives the highest ratings of the convention. In addition, the halls of the convention are packed at this time, with many party loyalists sneaking in. Afterwards, balloons are usually dropped and the delegates celebrate the nomination.

==Presidential primary history==

The history of conventions in the United States is driven by the history of presidential primaries in the United States. 
In the first two presidential elections, the Electoral College handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected George Washington, so no conventions were needed.

But as political parties were created, starting with the 1796 election, congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party&#x27;s presidential candidates. That system collapsed in 1824, and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention. Delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions. Sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent.

Progressive Era reformers then looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates, as opposed to the opinion of the bosses. Florida enacted the first presidential primary in 1901. The Wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates. In 1910, Oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary, which requires delegates to the National Convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention. The impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Vice President Hubert Humphrey secured the presidential nomination despite not winning a single primary under his own name. After this, a Democratic National Committee-commissioned panel led by Senator George McGovern – the McGovern–Fraser Commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation. A large number of states, faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates in 1972, chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national Democratic Party rules. The result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary. The Republicans also adopted many more state presidential primaries.

==Convention history==

===First conventions===
The Federalist Party invented the first national conventions in 1808 and 1812 when they held secret national meetings to pick their candidates. The Democratic-Republican Party never used conventions. Instead its members of Congress met in party caucuses to select the nominee. Regional conflicts erupted in the hotly contested 1824 election, in which factions of the Democratic-Republican Party outright rejected taking part in the caucus because of its little, heavily dwindling participation and in their view undemocratic character, rejected the eventual caucus nominee, William H. Crawford of Georgia, and backed three regional candidates, nominated by state legislatures, John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, Henry Clay of Kentucky, and Andrew Jackson of Tennessee (all of whom carried more states than Crawford in the election) instead.

In 1831 the Anti-Masonic Party convened in Baltimore, Maryland to select a single presidential candidate agreeable to the whole party leadership in the 1832 presidential election. The National Republican and Democratic parties soon followed suit.

====Civil War era conventions====
The new Republican party held their first convention in 1856.

In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was nominated by the Republicans. The Democratic Party convention nominated Stephen A. Douglas: however, after Southern delegates walked out of or boycotted the convention, they held their own convention and nominated John C. Breckinridge.

During the Civil War, the 1864 Republican convention was rebranded as the National Union Convention, since it included Democrats who remained loyal to the Union.

===Late 1800s===
====1872 Democrats====
The Democrats held a very short 1872 Democratic National Convention which endorsed the nominee of the 1872 Liberal Republican convention. The Liberal Republicans were bitterly opposed to incumbent Republican Ulysses S. Grant, and bolted to form their own party. They nominated Horace Greeley, who lost to Grant in a landslide, and the new party soon collapsed.

====1884 Republicans====
In the run-up to the 1884 GOP convention, reformers called &quot;Mugwumps&quot; organized their forces in the swing states, especially New York and Massachusetts. They failed to block James G. Blaine, and many bolted to the Democrats, who had nominated reformer Grover Cleveland. Young Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, leading reformers, refused to bolt—an action that preserved their leadership role in the GOP.

===1900s===
Conventions were often heated affairs, playing a vital role in deciding each party&#x27;s nominee. The process remained far from democratic or transparent, however. The party convention was a scene of intrigue among political bosses, who largely appointed and otherwise controlled for the most part nearly all of the delegates.

====1912 Republicans====

Entering the convention, the forces of President Taft and ex-president Roosevelt seemed evenly matched. Taft had better planning, better organizers, and more top convention officials. The camps engaged in a fight for the delegations, with Taft emerging victorious, and Roosevelt claiming that several delegations were fraudulently seated because of the machinations of conservative party leaders including William Barnes Jr. and Boies Penrose. Following the seating of the anti-Roosevelt delegations, California Governor Hiram Johnson proclaimed that progressives would form a new party to nominate Roosevelt. Though many of Roosevelt&#x27;s delegates remained at the convention, most refused to take part in the presidential ballot in protest of the contested delegates. Roosevelt ultimately ran a third party campaign as part of the Progressive Party (nicknamed the &quot;Bull Moose Party&quot;). Taft and Roosevelt both lost the 1912 election to the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson.

====1924 Democrats====

The party was deeply factionalized along regional and cultural lines, with two powerful factions: a rural/Protestant/Southern faction led by William McAdoo, and an urban/Catholic/machine element represented by New York Governor Al Smith. The second Ku Klux Klan was flourishing nationwide, although no nationally prominent Democrat acknowledged membership, and the factions battled over a resolution to condemn the KKK. No compromises seemed possible as the convention dragged on for 17 days, with the balloting for presidential candidate being deadlocked for 103 ballots until dark horse John W. Davis, a neutral figure, was nominated.

Naming the younger brother of William Jennings Bryan as running mate was a sop to the rural faction. Oklahoma was a representative border state, with the delegation deeply divided on the KKK issue.

Until the late 1960s, most delegates in presidential nominating conventions were appointed by political bosses or &quot;kingmakers&quot;, &quot;party regulars...who had the most say in picking a candidate.&quot;

====1968 Democrats====

The Vietnam War energized a large number of supporters of anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, but they had no say in the matter. Vice President Hubert Humphrey—associated with the increasingly unpopular administration of Lyndon B. Johnson—did not compete in a single primary, yet controlled enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. This proved one of several factors behind rioting which broke out at the Democratic convention in Chicago.

====Switch to primary system====
A few, mostly western, states adopted primary elections in the late 19th century and during the Progressive Era, but the catalyst for their widespread adoption came during the election of 1968. Media images of the event—angry mobs facing down police—damaged the image of the Democratic Party, which appointed a commission headed by South Dakota Senator George McGovern to select a new, less controversial method of choosing nominees. The McGovern–Fraser Commission settled on the primary election, adopted by the Democratic National Committee in 1968. The Republicans adopted the primary as their preferred method in 1972. Henceforth, candidates would be given convention delegates based on their performance in primaries, and these delegates were bound to vote for their candidate. As a result, the major party presidential nominating convention has lost almost all of its old drama. The last attempt to release delegates from their candidates came at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, when Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts sought votes of delegates held by incumbent President Jimmy Carter. The last major party convention whose outcome was in doubt was the 1976 Republican National Convention, when former California Governor Ronald Reagan nearly won the nomination away from the incumbent president, Gerald Ford.

====Television coverage====
While rank and file members had no input in early nominations, they were still drawn by the aura of mystery surrounding the convention, and networks began to broadcast speeches and debates to the general public. The 1924 Republican convention was the first broadcast on radio, and NBC affiliate W2XBS in New York City made the first telecast of a national party convention, of the 1940 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, and the other two of the Big Three television networks soon followed. NBC News anchorman John Chancellor said just before the start of the 1972 Democratic National Convention, &quot;Convention coverage is the most important thing we do. The conventions are not just political theater, but really serious stuff, and that&#x27;s why all the networks have an obligation to give gavel-to-gavel coverage. It&#x27;s a time when we all ought to be doing our duty.&quot;

The presence of journalists at presidential nominating conventions have increased with the television networks. In 1976, the Democratic Convention consisted of 3,381 delegates and 11,500 reporters, broadcasters, editors and camera operators. This is on par with the increase in the number of televisions in American homes. In 1960, 87 percent of people had a television; by 1976, 98 percent did. By the 1992 conventions, network coverage increased from three networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) to five networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox and PBS). At the 1996 Republican National Convention there were approximately seven journalists per one delegate, or about 15,000 journalists.

The increase of the media at these conventions originally led to a growth in the public&#x27;s interest in elections. Voter turnout in the primaries increased from fewer than five million voters in 1948 to around thirteen million in 1952. By broadcasting the conventions on the television, people were more connected to the suspense and the decisions being made, therefore making them more politically aware, and more educated voters. When scholars studied the 1976 conventions they determined that by watching nomination conventions, even viewers that were not previously very politically active developed a much stronger interest in the election process and the candidate.

====1976 Republicans====

Going into the 1976 GOP Convention, President Gerald Ford had won more primary delegates than California Governor Ronald Reagan. However, Ford did not have enough delegates to secure the nomination, and as the convention opened both candidates were seen as still having a chance to win. Because of this, both Ford and Reagan arrived in Kansas City before the convention opened to woo the remaining uncommitted delegates in an effort to secure the nomination. 

Reagan had promised, if nominated, to name Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate, in a bid to attract liberals and centrists in the party. The key vote of the convention occurred when Reagan&#x27;s managers proposed a rules change that would have required Ford to publicly announce his running mate before the presidential balloting. Reagan&#x27;s managers hoped that when Ford announced his choice for vice president, it would anger one of the two factions of the party and thus help Reagan. The proposed rules change was defeated, and Ford gained the momentum he needed to win the nomination.

This is considered the last convention where the nominee was in doubt at the beginning of the convention.

And not coincidentally, the Democratic 1976 convention was the last convention where the vice-presidential nominee was announced during the convention, after the presidential nominee was chosen. In recent years, once the presidential nominee is obvious, the choice of the vice-presidential nominee has become a major publicity event in the leadup to the convention.

==== Decrease in importance ====
With the rise of the direct primary, and in particular with states moving earlier and earlier in the primary calendar since the 1988 election, the nominee has often secured a commanding majority of delegates far in advance of the convention. As such, any actual business conducted at the major parties&#x27; conventions (such as the roll call of delegates) have largely become a formality, and the main focus is on promoting the nominee and party platform to a wider audience. For instance, speeches by noted and popular party figures are scheduled for the coveted primetime hours, when most people would be watching.

During the 1996 Republican National Convention (where the RNC had purchased time-brokered blocks of party-produced coverage on the cable network The Family Channel in response to decreasing network coverage), ABC News &quot;Nightline&quot; host Ted Koppel abruptly ended his coverage of the 1996 conventions, arguing that the events had effectively become an &quot;infomercial&quot; for the party&#x27;s nominee rather than a &quot;bona fide&quot; news event. In 2020, political historian Michael Barone argued in an op-ed that the advents of direct distance dialing and television had made the original purposes of the conventions—being &quot;the only place and time where party politicians could communicate frankly and bargain personally&quot;, and &quot;discover which candidates had genuine support and which just gave lip service&quot;–increasingly redundant, and that the events had become largely &quot;choreographed&quot; celebrations of the party nominee. 

The changing nature of the conventions, as well as overall changes in television viewing habits, have changed how broadcasters cover the conventions. Coverage of the conventions is now typically relegated to news channels, C-SPAN, and streaming outlets; by 2012, the major networks usually only provided an hour of coverage per-night, focusing on the headlining speakers. PBS continues to provide full primetime coverage of the conventions, although it breaks away from minor speakers and mundane business for analysis and discussion.

=== 2000s ===
==== COVID-19 affected 2020 conventions ====

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 forced both major and third parties to modify the format of their conventions to comply with social distancing and restrictions on public gatherings. The Democratic convention was conducted as a virtual event with all speakers appearing from remote locations, and no in-person gatherings of delegates. To fulfill the host city contract with Milwaukee, the event&#x27;s production was conducted from the Wisconsin Center. The acceptance speeches of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were held at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Biden&#x27;s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.

Donald Trump repeatedly pushed for the Republican convention to be held in-person as normal. The event was originally scheduled for Spectrum Center in Charlotte; after North Carolina&#x27;s Democratic governor Roy Cooper refused to allow it to be held at full scale or without mandatory masking or social distancing, the RNC announced plans to move most of the in-person events to Jacksonville, Florida, but still conduct the official business from Charlotte. However, after Jacksonville enacted similar restrictions, and amid nationwide increases in cases, Trump announced in July 2020 that the events in Jacksonville had been called off. 

As with the Democratic convention, the Republican convention was conducted in a downsized form. To fulfill the host city contract with Charlotte, a program of official business was conducted in-person on August 24 with a smaller contingent of 336 delegates, including the roll call. The remainder of the event consisted of primetime programs of pre-recorded speeches, filmed mainly at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. The speeches by Vice President Pence (from Fort McHenry in Baltimore), and by First Lady Melania Trump and President Trump (from the White House Rose Garden), were conducted live and in-person with audiences of supporters; CDC-recommended mitigations were largely ignored.

==== 2024 conventions ====
The 2024 Republican National Convention was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from July 15 to 18, with the selection of Milwaukee in the swing state of Wisconsin making a political point after the Democrats were unable to hold a full convention there in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The 2024 Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago, Illinois, from August 19 to 22; although returning to an in-person event, the roll call was still held as a virtual vote in early August to comply with Ohio&#x27;s ballot deadline, as the state was unable to sufficiently move its ballot deadline from August 7 to accommodate the scheduling of the DNC; the new law did not take effect until September 1.

<doc id="505350" wikidata="Q7639616" url="?curid=505350" title="Sunday league football">
<text>Sunday league football, is a term used in Britain, Ireland and Australia to describe the amateur association football competitions which take place on Sunday rather than the more usual Saturday. The term [[beer league|pub league]] may also be used, owing to the number of public houses that enter teams. Sunday league football is stereotypically seen as being of far lower quality than Saturday football and involving players who are often unfit or hungover. As a result, the term &quot;Sunday league&quot; can be used to describe a performance at any level of football which is seen as inept or amateurish. Despite this perception some leagues include players who also play at a high level of semi-professional football on Saturdays.

Sunday leagues are sanctioned by the local County Football Association. Sunday leagues do not form part of the hierarchical English football league system, but Sunday teams can opt to switch to Saturday play and potentially rise up the levels of the league system. The FA Sunday Cup is a national knock-out competition for English Sunday league football teams administered by the FA, which has been staged since 1964. 

The most prominent single location for Sunday league football is Hackney Marshes in east London, which has been called the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of Sunday league. The oldest Sunday League in England is the Edmonton &amp; District Sunday Football League, based in North London, which was formed in 1925.

In March 2012, Wheel Power F.C. won 58–0 against Nova 2010 F.C. in the Torbay Sunday League to record what was believed to be the largest victory ever achieved in British football.

==Television coverage==
In 1991, Danny Baker hosted &quot;The Game&quot;, a TV series focusing on East London Sunday League matches at Hackney Marshes, on Friday nights on LWT. The title of the show was a spoof of &quot;The Match&quot;, formerly &quot;The Big Match&quot;, the banner under which major league matches were televised on ITV at the time. The series ran for six episodes, culminating in the final of the Dick Coppock Cup (for Division Four of the league).

<text>Joseph Michael Kramer (born June 21, 1950) is an American musician best known as the drummer of the hard rock band Aerosmith, which was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Personal life==
Kramer was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Doris and Mickey Kramer, a businessman. He is Jewish and received a bar mitzvah.

Kramer&#x27;s second wife, Linda, died on June 22, 2022, at age 55.

==Career==
In the early 1970s, Kramer was a member of The Institution, a seminal New Jersey garage band founded by Philip Rubin, J. Howard Duff, Richie Lester, and Marv Coopersmith. On November 25, 1970, the early Bruce Springsteen band, Steel Mill, opened for The Institution at Newark State College.

===Aerosmith===

Kramer wrote that he idly conceived the name Aerosmith while listening to Harry Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot; in 1968, two years before the band was formed. He insists that there is no connection between the name and Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;. Shortly before joining Aerosmith, Kramer moved to Boston, where he attended Berklee College of Music and worked with Chubby &amp; the Turnpikes (later renamed Tavares) alongside Bernie Worrell.

Kramer&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Hit Hard: A Story of Hitting Rock Bottom at the Top&quot;, was released on June 30, 2009.

Kramer made two guest appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, with Aerosmith in the episode &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot; (1991) and by himself in the episode &quot;The Ned-Liest Catch&quot; (2011). In 2015, NECA released a Simpsons themed action figure of the members of Aerosmith.

In 2013, Kramer launched Rockin&#x27; &amp; Roastin&#x27; Coffee, a whole bean organic brand. In 2015, he announced a business partnership with Les Otten, the former vice chairman of the Boston Red Sox, to open two Joey Kramer&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; &amp; Roastin&#x27; Café and Restaurant locations which since closed.

==Equipment==

<doc id="505366" wikidata="Q11681469" url="?curid=505366" title="In Search of... (TV series)">
<text>In Search of... is an American television series that was broadcast weekly from 1976 to 1982, devoted to mysterious phenomena. It was created after the success of three one-hour documentaries produced by creator Alan Landsburg: &quot;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&quot; in 1973 (based on the 1968 book/ 1970 film &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; by Erich von Däniken), &quot;In Search of Ancient Mysteries&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Outer Space Connection&quot; in 1975 (later adapted into popular paperbacks written by Landsburg), all of which featured narration by Rod Serling, who was the initial choice to host the spin-off show. Serling died before production started, and Leonard Nimoy was then selected to be the host. The series was revived with host Mitch Pileggi in 2002 and again in 2018 with Zachary Quinto for the History channel.

The original series was shown in Australia in the 1980s under the title &quot;Great Mysteries of the World,&quot; with each episode having an introduction and conclusion presented by television presenter Scott Lambert.

== Format ==

Each episode of the program explored a general or specific topic in one of several general categories as given in the opening titles: Extraterrestrials, Magic &amp; Witchcraft, Missing Persons, Myths &amp; Monsters, Lost Civilizations, and Special Phenomena (changed to Strange Phenomena from season 3 onward). The program conducted investigations into the controversial and paranormal (e.g., UFOs, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster). Additionally, it featured episodes about mysterious historical events and personalities such as Anna Anderson, the Lincoln Assassination, the Jack the Ripper murders, infamous cults (e.g., Jim Jones), and missing persons, cities, and ships (e.g., Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa, D. B. Cooper, the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the lost Roanoke Colony). Each episode&#x27;s opening credits included a verbal disclaimer about the conjectural nature of the evidence and theories to be presented:

The program included interviews, reenactments, and host segments including Nimoy on location or in studio, and each episode featured voiceovers by Nimoy. The music was composed by Laurin M. Rinder and W. Michael Lewis. A soundtrack album was released on AVI (American Variety International) Records in 1977.

Nimoy wrote an episode about the turbulent life of artist Vincent van Gogh, having earlier played the artist&#x27;s brother Theo in a one-man show. As part of his research, Nimoy found records in the archives of the hospital where Van Gogh was treated that suggested that he suffered from epilepsy rather than insanity.

The show also spawned at least six spin-off books, all written by Landsburg with forewords by Nimoy: &quot;In Search of Lost Civilizations,&quot; &quot;In Search of Extraterrestrials,&quot; &quot;In Search of Magic and Witchcraft,&quot; &quot;In Search of Strange Phenomena,&quot; &quot;In Search of Missing Persons,&quot; and &quot;In Search of Myths and Monsters,&quot; with an additional book that collected the best segments from these existing volumes.

In 1978, Landsburg produced a Bigfoot documentary using portions of two &quot;In Search of...&quot; episodes (&quot;The Monster Hunters&quot; and &quot;The Yeti&quot;) called &quot;Manbeast! Myth or Monster,&quot; based on his book &quot;In Search of Myths and Monsters.&quot; Though Nimoy had written the foreword to Landsburg&#x27;s book, he did not narrate this documentary.

Reruns of the &quot;In Search of...&quot; series aired during the early 1990s on the A&amp;E Network. In the later 1990s, the show aired on another of the A&amp;E Television Networks&#x27; properties, the History Channel. The licensing agreement with MCA Television/Universal Domestic Television expired in the early 2000s, ending the show&#x27;s run. When the show aired on A&amp;E, a re-recording of the original theme music was used plus a new alternate theme. The original opening titles were also modernized. In this incarnation virtually all of Nimoy&#x27;s on-camera appearances in the series were replaced with reused footage, so viewers could hear Nimoy but not see him.

A short-lived revival of the show, featuring Mitch Pileggi, aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2002.

In January 2018, it was announced that Zachary Quinto, who, like Nimoy, stars as Spock in the rebooted &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, would host the revived version of the show on History Channel. On March 27, 2019, History Channel announced the series was renewed for a second season.

== Episodes ==

=== Specials ===
Three specials hosted by Rod Serling aired from 1973-1975.

==== Season 3 (1978–1979) ====
==== Season 4 (1979–1980) ====
==== Season 5 (1980–1981) ====

=== Sci-Fi Channel revival (2002) ===
A revival of the series aired on The Sci-Fi Channel for one season, hosted by Mitch Pileggi.

=== History Channel revival (2018–2019) ===
A second revival of the series aired on The History Channel for two seasons, hosted by Zachary Quinto.

==== Season 1 (2018) ====
==== Season 2 (2019) ====
== Home media releases ==
In February 2012, it was announced that Visual Entertainment, under license from Universal Studios, had acquired the home video rights to the original series for the United States and Canada. &quot;In Search of: The Complete Collection&quot; was released in Canada and the U.S. on December 11, 2012, from VEI&#x27;s website.

The 21-DVD set includes all 144 installments hosted by Leonard Nimoy. Also included are two Rod Serling specials: &quot;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&quot; and &quot;In Search of Ancient Mysteries&quot; which aired prior to the start of the regular Nimoy series. Three Landsburg specials &quot;The Outer Space Connection&quot; (1975), &quot;Secrets of the Bermuda Triangle&quot; (1978), and &quot;Manbeast! Myth or Monster&quot; (1978), are not included. VEI also included all eight episodes of the short-lived 2002 series hosted by Mitch Pileggi.

== Homages ==
The style of the original &quot;In Search of...&quot; has been paid homage to and parodied by many productions. Examples include &quot;Mysteries in History&quot;, a show-within-a-show that plays a part in the plotline to &quot;Men in Black II&quot; (the faux series is hosted by Peter Graves in the film; coincidentally, Graves once co-starred with Nimoy in &quot;&quot;). Two other examples are &quot;Truth from Legend&quot; and &quot;Fact from Myth&quot;, two nearly identical series existing in alternate universes for which &quot;mini-episodes&quot; were created for YouTube as part of the viral marketing campaign for the two-part video game &quot;BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea&quot;.

<doc id="505367" wikidata="Q1056320" url="?curid=505367" title="Brad Whitford">
<text>Bradley Ernest Whitford (born February 23, 1952) is an American musician who is best known for serving as guitarist for the hard rock band Aerosmith for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. He has also worked as a songwriter for the group, co-composing well-received tracks such as 1976&#x27;s &quot;Last Child&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Whitford graduated from Reading Memorial High School in Reading, Massachusetts in 1970. He then attended the Berklee College of Music.

==Career==
===20th century===
Whitford played as lead guitarist in forming local bands Cymbals of Resistance (1965–1968), Teapot Dome, Earth, Inc. (1968–1970) as bassist, and Justin Thyme (1970–1971) as guitarist before joining Aerosmith in 1971, where he replaced original guitarist Ray Tabano. Aerosmith went on to be one of the most successful bands of the 1970s. Following several less successful albums in the late 1970s, however, Whitford left Aerosmith in 1981 to work on his own project with singer Derek St. Holmes, called Whitford/St. Holmes. The project was dissolved after a sole self-titled album was released in 1981, although Whitford/St. Holmes reunited for 2015 and 2016 tours and released another album, &quot;Reunion&quot;.

Whitford briefly toured with Joe Perry Project, featuring former Aerosmith bandmate Joe Perry, before both Perry and Whitford rejoined Aerosmith in 1984. In the mid-late 1980s, all band members completed drug rehabilitation, including Whitford, who completed programs to combat his alcohol abuse. Whitford remains sober to this day and continues to be an active member in Aerosmith.

Whitford also served as a producer for the Neighborhoods, a Boston band that was led by David Minehan, a rabid Aerosmith fan. In 1994, a family illness forced Whitford to leave unexpectedly in the middle of a tour of Asia, and Minehan flew to Japan, where he performed in Whitford&#x27;s place for several days until Whitford returned.

===21st century===
In 2007, along with fellow Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, Whitford was included in the &quot;Guitar World&quot; book &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

Whitford missed the start of Aerosmith&#x27;s 2009 summer tour after requiring surgery as a result of a head injury sustained while getting out of his Ferrari. He joined the tour a month later.

In 2010, Whitford was announced as one of the guitarists to take part in the &quot;Experience Hendrix&quot; tour, playing songs performed and inspired by Jimi Hendrix with Joe Satriani, Jonny Lang, Eric Johnson, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Ernie Isley, Living Colour, Hubert Sumlin, bassist Billy Cox, and others.

== Musical contributions and style ==
While Joe Perry is Aerosmith&#x27;s better known guitarist and the band&#x27;s principal songwriter with Steven Tyler, Whitford has made significant contributions to the band&#x27;s repertoire over the years. This includes co-writing Aerosmith&#x27;s hit &quot;Last Child&quot; as well as some of Aerosmith&#x27;s heaviest songs: &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault&quot; and &quot;Round and Round&quot;, and playing lead guitar on &quot;Sick as a Dog&quot; and &quot;Back In the Saddle&quot; (on which Perry plays six string bass), &quot;Last Child&quot;, and on the ballads &quot;You See Me Crying&quot; and &quot;Home Tonight&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot; and &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;. The version of &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot; on their 1978 live album &quot;Live! Bootleg&quot; in particular is perhaps his most famous soloing moment. When Aerosmith made their comeback in the late 1980s, Whitford continued to co-write tracks such as &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; and &quot;Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man&quot;, and plays occasional lead guitar on some more recent tracks as well as during many live performances.

Concerning his lesser role in the band&#x27;s songwriting process, Whitford has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t consider myself a terribly prolific writer. I can write music with other people if they&#x27;re better songwriters than I am. I really can&#x27;t create a song. It&#x27;s very difficult to do. That&#x27;s why the people that can do it are very few and far between. I&#x27;m certainly not that type of a guy. More of a guitar player, more of the kind of [guy] who comes up with enough riffs and ideas to write a song. But to write lyrics and come up with a melody for it, it won&#x27;t happen.&quot;

Said Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler of the two guitarists, &quot;Joe is self-taught and his playing comes from raw emotion. Not that Brad&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t, but his style is more schooled.&quot;

Slash, lead guitarist of Guns N&#x27; Roses cites Whitford as one of his heaviest influences, stating: &quot;I identified with Joe Perry&#x27;s image, both soundwise and visually...but I was also totally into Brad Whitford&#x27;s guitar solos, and he had a more direct influence on the way I play than anybody realizes.&quot;

# &quot;Soul Saver&quot; from &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;

# &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Lovin&#x27; You&quot; from &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;

== Equipment ==
At current performances, Whitford can be seen playing a wide array of solid-body guitars, some including Floyd Rose locking tremolos: Gretschs, several Floyd Rose Discovery Series guitars, a Shoreline Gold painted (Stratocaster style) Melancon Pro Artist, a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop along with a wide variety of Fender Stratocasters. Whitford continues to tour primarily with vintage Fender Stratocasters and Gibson Les Pauls for Aerosmith concerts as well as smaller gigs.

Meanwhile, Aerosmith&#x27;s original heyday in the late 1970s saw both Whitford and co-guitarist Joe Perry arm themselves with aggressive-looking guitars from BC Rich (Whitford favored an unpainted BC Rich Eagle, while Perry often played an alien-looking red BC Rich Bich).

On the amplifier front, Whitford has created his own amplifier company – 3 Monkeys Amplification and tours with many of their products. Furthermore, he also uses Paul Reed Smith amps. Additionally, Whitford has used a myriad of pedals throughout his career including many boutique ones.

== Guest appearances ==
*Whitford appears in &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot; as the guitarist. He is also a playable character.
*In 2011 Whitford made a guest appearance on A&amp;Es &quot;Storage Wars&quot; episode &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High Desert&quot; along with collector Barry Weiss appraising two vintage guitars and an amp
*In 2012 Whitford contributed to Joe Bonamassa&#x27;s album &quot;Driving Towards the Daylight&quot; on several tracks.
*In 2019, Whitford made an appearance, along with his son Graham, in an episode of &quot;American Pickers&quot; where Mike and Frank find the original Aerosmith van (Season 20, episode 8)

<text>Little Lulu is a comic strip created in 1935 by American author Marjorie Henderson Buell. The character, Lulu Moppet, debuted in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on February 23, 1935, in a single panel, appearing as a flower girl at a wedding and mischievously strewing the aisle with banana peels. &quot;Little Lulu&quot; replaced Carl Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Henry&quot;, which had been picked up for distribution by King Features Syndicate. The &quot;Little Lulu&quot; panel continued to run weekly in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; until December 30, 1944.

&quot;Little Lulu&quot; was created as a result of Anderson&#x27;s success. Schlesinger Library curator Kathryn Allamong Jacob wrote: 
:Lulu was born in 1935, when &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; asked Buell to create a successor to the magazine’s &quot;Henry&quot;, Carl Anderson’s stout, mute little boy, who was moving on to national syndication. The result was Little Lulu, the resourceful, equally silent (at first) little girl whose loopy curls were reminiscent of the artist’s own as a girl. Buell explained to a reporter, &quot;I wanted a girl because a girl could get away with more fresh stunts that in a small boy would seem boorish&quot;.

==History==
Marjorie Henderson Buell (1904–1993), whose work appeared under the pen name &quot;Marge&quot;, had created two comic strips in the 1920s: &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; and &quot;Dashing Dot&quot;, both with female leads. She first had Little Lulu published as a single-panel cartoon in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on February 23, 1935. The single-panel strip continued in the &quot;Post&quot; until the December 30, 1944 issue, and continued from then as a regular comic strip. Buell herself ceased drawing the comic strip in 1947. In 1950, &quot;Little Lulu&quot; became a daily syndicated series by Chicago Tribune–New York News Syndicate, and ran until 1969.

Comic-book stories of the character scripted by John Stanley appeared in ten issues of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot; before a &quot;Marge&#x27;s Little Lulu&quot; series appeared in 1948 with scripts and layouts by Stanley and finished art by Irving Tripp and others. Stanley greatly expanded the cast of characters and changed the name of Lulu&#x27;s portly pal from &quot;Joe&quot; to &quot;Tubby&quot;, a character that was popular enough himself to warrant a &quot;Marge&#x27;s Tubby&quot; series that ran from 1952 to 1961. &quot;Little Lulu&quot; was widely merchandised, Writer/artist John Stanley&#x27;s work on the &quot;Little Lulu&quot; comic book is highly regarded. He did the initial Lulu comics, later working with artists Irving Tripp and Charles Hedinger (Tripp inking Hedinger before eventually assuming both duties), writing and laying out the stories. 

He continued working on the comic until around 1959. Stanley is responsible for the many additional characters in the stories. After Stanley, other writers produced the Lulu stories for Gold Key Comics, including Arnold Drake. The comics were translated into French, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Portuguese, and other languages. After Buell&#x27;s retirement in 1972 she signed the rights to Western Publishing. &quot;Marge&#x27;s&quot; was dropped from the title, and the series continued until 1984.

==Characters==
The main characters of the Little Lulu comic strip include the following. Full details and supporting and minor characters can be found in the main article of Little Lulu characters. Variations from the comic strip and other media representations are discussed in the main article.

* Little Lulu – Louise &quot;Little Lulu&quot; Moppet is the main character and Tubby and Annie&#x27;s best friend. She is very smart, but stubborn and always initiates a battle with the boys to show that the girls are as good as them. Lulu is also very creative and tells stories to Alvin to teach him a lesson with fun. She wears a red dress and hat and has long black curly hair with brown highlights.
* Tubby Tompkins – Thomas &quot;Tubby&quot; Tompkins is Lulu&#x27;s male best friend and her chief opponent in their disputes. He is the leader of the boys&#x27; club known as &quot;The Fellers&quot;. He is relapsed and always forgets to pay the monthly fee or to fulfill the obligations and his clubmates often take him out of office. Tubby is in love with Gloria, but she&#x27;s rarely given him a chance. He has red hair and wears a white sailor hat, a black suit jacket, a large blue bow tie and light brown/orange pants, making his attire very similar to a sailor&#x27;s uniform. See main article: Tubby Tompkins.
* Annie Inch – Lulu&#x27;s female best friend who is involved in most of Lulu&#x27;s escapades and adventures. She is not as smart, but she is a true friend who helps Lulu in her plans. Sometimes she is annoyed at everyone for no reason. Annie is Iggy&#x27;s sister. She has short black straight hair and wears a blue dress (in the earlier years she wore a yellow dress).
* Iggy Inch – Tubby&#x27;s male best friend and a member of the &quot;Fellers&quot;. He is grumpy, mischievous and always doing tricks. Iggy is Annie&#x27;s brother. He has a shaved head, and wears a white collar shirt and orange pants (in the early years, he wore an orange collared shirt and blue pants).
* Willie Wilkins – One of Tubby&#x27;s friends and the strongest member of the &quot;Fellers&quot;. He has short black hair and wears an orange cap, a green suit jacket, and orange knickers (in the early years, he wore a brown cap, a red shirt and gray knickers).
* Eddie Stimson – One of Tubby&#x27;s friends and the smartest member of the &quot;Fellers&quot;. He often creates the boys&#x27; plans against the West Side Boys.
* Wilbur Van Snobbe – The richest and most charming boy in town. He likes to be loved by the girls, but he is arrogant and petulant, being sweet only with Gloria. Wilbur has no friends, although he sometimes plays with the other kids. He has curly blond hair and wears a purple suit (in the early years, he had red hair and a blue suit). 
* Gloria Goode – The most beautiful girl in town. She is nice and playful with the girls, who secretly hate her out of envy, and the boys, who fall in love with her. Gloria has a friendly rivalry with Lulu and she is richer than most of the class, although less than Wilbur. She has long, wavy blonde hair and wears a ruffled pink dress.
* Alvin Jones – Lulu&#x27;s 6-year-old neighbor. He is mischievous, bratty and only stops tantrums when Lulu tells a story. He has red hair with a quiff and wears a white shirt and blue overalls.
* Martha and George Moppet – Lulu&#x27;s parents. Martha is a great cook and George is always targeted by Tubby&#x27;s pursuit as a detective.
* Ellie and Jim Tompkins – Tubby&#x27;s parents.
* The West Side Boys – A gang of stronger, tougher bully boys from across town who are the rival club of the &quot;Fellers&quot; and always try to invade their club. The most frequently seen of the West Side Boys are Butch (the leader), Mickey and Spike, while other individual members include Mike, Slug, Junior and Guggy.

==Comic strips and comic books==
A daily comic strip, entitled &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, was syndicated by the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate from June 5, 1950, through May 31, 1969. Artists included Woody Kimbrell (1950–1964), Roger Armstrong (1964–1966), and Ed Nofziger (1966–1969).

Little Lulu appeared in ten issues of Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Four Color&quot; comic book series (#74, 97, 110, 115, 120, 131, 139, 146, 158, 165), before graduating to her own title: &quot;Marge&#x27;s Little Lulu&quot; in 1948.

With the Dell Comics/Western Publishing split that created Gold Key Comics, &quot;Little Lulu&quot; went to Gold Key with issue No. 165. Tubby got his own comic series from 1952 to 1961, first appearing in &quot;Four Color&quot; No. 381, 430, 444, and #461; then his own title &quot;Marge&#x27;s Tubby&quot; from No. 5 thru 49. In this series, Tubby had his own adventures without Lulu, especially with the Little Men from Mars.

Upon retirement, Marge sold &quot;Little Lulu&quot; to Western Publishing. The comic was re–named &quot;Little Lulu&quot; with No. 207 (September 1972). Publication of the comics ceased in 1984 (with issue No. 268, the last few under the Whitman Comics name), when Western discontinued publishing comics. Artist Hy Eisman retained stories intended for #269–270 (scripted by Paul Kuhn) because the artwork was returned to him after the comic was cancelled. Three of these are to be reprinted in the Lulu fanzine &quot;The HoLLywood Eclectern&quot; (HE). &quot;The Case of the Disappearing Tutu&quot;, slated to be the lead story in &quot;Little Lulu&quot; No. 270, appears in HE No. 47 (2008).

There were also two giant-sized &quot;Annual&quot;s (#1–2, 1953–1954), 14 Dell Giants (with seasonal and other themes), a regular-sized unnumbered special on visiting Japan and three Gold Key &quot;Special&quot;s (two with Lulu on Halloween and summer camp and one with Tubby and the Little Men from Mars). Lulu also appeared in 20 issues of &quot;March of Comics&quot; and was reprinted in several &quot;Golden Comics Digests&quot;.

Between 1985 and 1992 Another Rainbow Publishing published a hardbound 18-volume set, the &quot;Little Lulu Library&quot;, collecting the stories in the Four Color issues, plus the regular series through No. 87.

While Western Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Little Lulu&quot; stopped being released in 1984, in Brazil new &quot;Lulu&quot; stories, penned by local artists, kept being published by Editora Abril. Primaggio Mantovi was responsible for overseeing the production. &quot;Luluzinha&quot;, Abril&#x27;s main monthly &quot;Lulu&quot; comic series, ended in 1993.

==Advertising and merchandising==
&quot;Little Lulu&quot; was featured on numerous licensed products, and she was the centerpiece of an extensive advertising campaign for Kleenex tissues during the 1940s–50s, being the first mascot for Kleenex tissues; from 1952 to 1965 the character appeared in an elaborate animated billboard in Times Square in New York City. and she was also seen in Pepsi-Cola magazine ads during that period. Kleenex commercials featuring Little Lulu were regularly seen in the 1950s on Perry Como&#x27;s TV show. Buell (the comics&#x27; creator) played an active role in merchandising Little Lulu, often taking a hands-on role in terms and negotiations. Currently, the trademarks on Little Lulu are held by NBCUniversal (which manages the properties of DreamWorks Classics, as well as its parent company, DreamWorks Animation).

==Adaptations==
===Short films===

Between 1943 and 1948, Lulu appeared in 26 theatrical animated shorts produced by Famous Studios for Paramount Pictures, replacing the &quot;Superman&quot; shorts of the 1940s. Paramount went on to create a similar character, &quot;Little Audrey&quot;, after failing to renew the Lulu license (and therefore avoiding the payment of royalty fees). 

Lulu was voiced by Cecil Roy, while Tubby was voiced by Arnold Stang. The theme song for the shorts was written and composed by Buddy Kaye, Fred Wise, and Sidney Lippman, and performed by the singing group Helen Carroll and the Satisfiers. All musical arrangements were done by Winston Sharples and Sammy Timberg. 

====List of &quot;Little Lulu&quot; cartoons====

In the 1960s, Paramount and Famous Studios produced two new &quot;Little Lulu&quot; cartoons, &quot;Alvin&#x27;s Solo Flight&quot; (a &quot;Noveltoon&quot; cartoon), and &quot;Frog&#x27;s Legs&quot; (a &quot;Comic Kings&quot; cartoon), both based on two of John Stanley&#x27;s comic stories. Cecil Roy reprised her role as Lulu, but Arnold Stang did not return as Tubby, as by that time, he already left Famous Studios to work at Hanna-Barbera Productions where he would perform the voices for &quot;Top Cat&quot;.

=== Feature films ===
ABC aired two half-hour live-action specials based on the comic on Saturday morning as part of ABC Weekend Special. &quot;Little Lulu&quot; was released on November 4, 1978 and &quot;The Big Hex of Little Lulu&quot; on September 15, 1979. The cast included: 

* Lauri Hendler as Lulu
* Kevin King Cooper as Tubby
* Lulu Baxter as Annie
* Robbie Rist as Iggy
* Annrae Walterhouse as Gloria
* Billy &#x27;Pop&#x27; Atmore as Willie
* Nicky Manfredi as Eddie 
* Billy Jayne as Alvin
* Nita DiGiampaolo as Margie
* Shari Belafonte as Janie

=== Television adaptations ===

Lulu was interpreted by Eiko Masuyama in the first 3 episodes and Minori Matsushima for the remainder, Keiko Yamamoto interpreted to Tubby Tompkins, Alvin was performed by Sachiko Chichimatsu and Annie and Iggy Inch were performed by Junko Hori and Yoneko Matsukane respectively. The music was composed by Nobuyoshi Koshibe, The main theme in the original language was composed by and the end theme &quot;Watashi wa Lulu&quot; (I am Lulu) was composed only by Mitsuko Horie. An English-dubbed version of the anime was made for the American market by ZIV International in 1978, this same company distributed globally the TV series, the show lasted from 1976 to 1977 with 26 episodes in total.

In 1995, &quot;Little Lulu&quot; was adapted for &quot;The Little Lulu Show&quot;, an HBO animated series with the voices of Tracey Ullman (Season 1) and Jane Woods (Seasons 2–3) as Lulu Moppet. The series was produced by Canada&#x27;s CINAR (now WildBrain) after Marge&#x27;s death in 1993. The series ended in 1999, but continued to air on Family Channel and Teletoon Retro in Canada.

===Manga-style Brazilian comic===
In 2009 &quot;Luluzinha Teen e sua Turma&quot; (English: &quot;Teen Little Lulu and her Gang&quot;), a Brazilian comic book series depicting Lulu and her friends as teenagers, was launched. The book was created in an attempt to rival &quot;Monica Adventures&quot;, another comic book which also adapts a popular franchise (in this case, Brazilian &quot;Monica&#x27;s Gang&quot;) by using a manga style and presenting its original characters now as teenagers.

Lulu and Tubby have their first kiss in #50, a commemorative edition.

&quot;Luluzinha Teen e sua Turma&quot; became very popular in its introduction, being one of the best-selling comics in Brazil for a while, second only to its &quot;rival&quot;. Nevertheless, unlike &quot;Monica Adventures&quot; (which is still being published), &quot;Little Lulu&quot;&#x27;s teen spin-off was canceled in 2015, after 65 issues.

==Later days==
Lulu fans hold an annual gathering at San Diego Comic-Con in which they perform a play adapted from a classic Lulu story.

== In popular culture ==
As a cameo appearance, &quot;Little Lulu&quot; was planned for the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but rights to the character could not be obtained in time. In 1994, an organization called Friends of Lulu was founded that lasted until 2011, its name was based on Little Lulu. In 2006, Buell&#x27;s family donated a collection of Buell&#x27;s artwork and related papers as &quot;Marge Papers&quot; to the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. She makes a cameo appearing on a comic cover in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot; (2007), being read by Alan Moore.

In Brazil, the expression for &quot;boys&#x27; club&quot; (an environment that excludes women) is &quot;clube do Bolinha&quot; (meaning &quot;Tubby&#x27;s club&quot;).

<text>The Grand Palace (, ) is a complex of buildings at the heart of Bangkok, Thailand. The palace has been the official residence of the Kings of Siam (and later Thailand) since 1782. The king, his court, and his royal government were based on the grounds of the palace until 1925. King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), resided at the Chitralada Royal Villa and his successor King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X) resides at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, both in the Dusit Palace, but the Grand Palace is still used for official events. Several royal ceremonies and state functions are held within the walls of the palace every year. The palace is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Thailand, with over eight million people visiting each year.

Construction of the palace began on 6 May 1782, at the order of King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), the founder of the Chakri dynasty, when he moved the capital city from Thonburi to Bangkok. 

Throughout successive reigns, many new buildings and structures were added, especially during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). By 1925, the king, the Royal Family and the government were no longer permanently settled at the palace, and had moved to other residences. After the abolition of absolute monarchy in 1932, all government agencies completely moved out of the palace.

In shape, the palace complex is roughly rectangular and has a combined area of , surrounded by four walls. It is situated on the banks of the Chao Phraya River at the heart of the Rattanakosin Island, today in the Phra Nakhon District. The Grand Palace is bordered by Sanam Luang and Na Phra Lan Road to the north, Maharaj Road to the west, Sanam Chai Road to the east and Thai Wang Road to the south.

Rather than being a single structure, the Grand Palace is made up of numerous buildings, halls, pavilions set around open lawns, gardens and courtyards. Its asymmetry and eclectic styles are due to its organic development, with additions and rebuilding being made by successive reigning kings over 200 years of history. It is divided into several quarters: the Temple of the Emerald Buddha; the Outer Court, with many public buildings; the Middle Court, including the Phra Maha Monthien Buildings, the Phra Maha Prasat Buildings and the Chakri Maha Prasat Buildings; the Inner Court and the Siwalai Gardens quarter. The Grand Palace is currently partially open to the public as a museum, but it remains a working palace, with several royal offices still situated inside.

==History==

The construction of the Grand Palace began on 6 May 1782, at the order of King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I). Having seized the crown from King Taksin of Thonburi, King Rama I was intent on building a capital city for his new Chakri dynasty. He moved the seat of power from the city of Thonburi, on the west side of the Chao Phraya River, to the east side at Bangkok. The new capital city was turned into an artificial island when canals were dug along the east side. The island was given the name &#x27;Rattanakosin&#x27;. The previous royal residence was the Derm Palace, constructed for King Taksin in 1768. The old royal palace in Thonburi was small and sandwiched between two temples; Wat Arun and Wat Tai Talat, prohibiting further expansion.

The new palace was built on a rectangular piece of land on the very west side of the island, between Wat Pho to the south, Wat Mahathat to the north and with the Chao Phraya River on the west. This location was previously occupied by a Chinese community, whom King Rama I ordered to relocate to an area south and outside of the city walls; the area is now Bangkok&#x27;s Chinatown.

Desperate for materials and short on funds, the palace was initially built entirely out of wood, its various structures surrounded by a simple log palisade. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed the river from Thonburi to take permanent residence in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated coronation ceremony, thus becoming the first monarch of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom. Over the next few years the king began replacing wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the Emerald Buddha.

To find more material for these constructions, King Rama I ordered his men to go upstream to the old capital city of Ayutthaya, which was destroyed in 1767 during a war between Burma and Siam. They dismantled structures and removed as many bricks as they could find, while not removing any from the temples. They began by taking materials from the forts and walls of the city. By the end they had completely leveled the old royal palaces. The bricks were ferried down the Chao Phraya by barges, where they were eventually incorporated into the walls of Bangkok and the Grand Palace itself. Most of the initial construction of the Grand Palace during the reign of King Rama I was carried out by conscripted or corvée labour. After the final completion of the ceremonial halls of the palace, the king held a full traditional coronation ceremony in 1785.

The layout of the Grand Palace followed that of the Royal Palace at Ayutthaya in location, organization, and in the divisions of separate courts, walls, gates and forts. Both palaces featured a proximity to the river. The location of a pavilion serving as a landing stage for barge processions also corresponded with that of the old palace. To the north of the Grand Palace there is a large field, the &quot;Thung Phra Men&quot; (now called Sanam Luang), which is used as an open space for royal ceremonies and as a parade ground. There was also a similar field in Ayutthaya, which was used for the same purpose. The road running north leads to the Front Palace, the residence of the Vice King of Siam.

The Grand Palace is divided into four main courts, separated by numerous walls and gates: the Outer Court, the Middle Court, the Inner Court and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Each of these court&#x27;s functions and access are clearly defined by laws and traditions. The Outer Court is in the northwestern part of the Grand Palace; within are the royal offices and (formerly) state ministries. To the northeast is the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the royal chapel, and home of the Emerald Buddha. The Middle Court housed the most important state apartments and ceremonial throne halls of the king. The Inner Court, at the south end of the complex, was reserved only for women, as it housed the king&#x27;s harem.

During the reign of King Phutthaloetla Naphalai (Rama II), the area of the Grand Palace was expanded southwards up to the walls of Wat Pho. Previously this area was home to offices of various palace officials. This expansion increased the area of the palace from to . New walls, forts, and gates were constructed to accommodate the enlarged compound. Since this expansion, the palace has remained within its walls with new construction and changes being made only on the inside.


In accordance with tradition, the palace was initially referred to only as the &quot;Phra Ratcha Wang Luang&quot; () or &#x27;Royal Palace&#x27;, similar to the old palace in Ayutthaya. However, during the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV) the name &quot;Phra Boromma Maha Ratcha Wang&quot; or &#x27;Grand Palace&#x27; was first used in official documents. This change of name was made during the elevation of Prince Chutamani (the king&#x27;s younger brother) to the title of Second King Pinklao in 1851. The proclamation of his title described the royal palace as the &#x27;supreme&#x27; (; Borom) and &#x27;great&#x27; (; Maha) palace. This title was given in order to distinguish the palace from the Second King&#x27;s palace (the Front Palace), which was described as the &quot;Phra Bovorn Ratcha Wang&quot; () or the &#x27;glorious&#x27; (; Bovorn) palace.

Throughout the period of absolute monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country&#x27;s administrative and religious centre. As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers, and courtiers. The palace&#x27;s high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of palace laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.

By the 1920s, a series of new palaces were constructed elsewhere for the king&#x27;s use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual move out of the palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy.

Today the Grand Palace is still a centre of ceremony and of the monarchy, and serves as a museum and tourist attraction as well.

==Outer Court==

The Outer Court or &quot;Khet Phra Racha Than Chan Nork&quot; () of the Grand Palace is situated to the northwest of the palace (the northeast being occupied by the Temple of the Emerald Buddha). Entering through the main Visetchaisri Gate, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha is located to the left, with many public buildings located to the right.

These buildings include the headquarters and information centre of the Grand Palace and the Bureau of the Royal Household. Other important buildings inside the court include the &quot;Sala Sahathai Samakhom&quot; (), used for important receptions and meetings. The &quot;Sala Luk Khun Nai&quot; () is an office building housing various departments of the Royal Household. The main office of the Royal Institute of Thailand was also formerly located here. The Outer Court has a small museum called the Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Coins. The Phimanchaisri Gate opens directly unto the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall and is the main portal from the Outer Court into the Middle Court.

Historically this court was referred to as &quot;Fai Na&quot; (, literally &quot;In the front&quot;), and also served as the seat of the royal government, with various ministerial offices, a theatre, stables for the king&#x27;s elephants, barracks for the royal guards, the royal mint and an arsenal. By 1925, all government agencies and workers had vacated the site and all of the buildings were converted for use by the Royal Household.

==Temple of the Emerald Buddha==

The Temple of the Emerald Buddha or Wat Phra Kaew () (known formally as Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram, ) is a royal chapel situated within the walls of the palace. Incorrectly referred to as a Buddhist temple, it is in fact a chapel; it has all the features of a temple except for living quarters for monks. Built in 1783, the temple was constructed in accordance with ancient tradition dating back to Wat Mahathat, a royal chapel within the grounds of the royal palace at Sukhothai, and Wat Phra Si Sanphet at Ayutthaya. The famed Emerald Buddha is kept within the grounds of the temple.

The temple is surrounded on four sides by a series of walled cloisters, with seven different gates. Like those ancient royal temples of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya, the Wat Phra Kaew complex is separated from the living quarters of the kings. Within these walls are buildings and structures for diverse purposes and of differing styles, reflecting the changing architecture during the various reigns of the kings. Despite this, most of the buildings within adhere strictly to classical Thai architecture. The establishment of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha dates to the very founding of the Grand Palace and Bangkok itself.

==Middle Court==
The largest and most important court is the Middle Court or the &quot;Khet Phra Racha Than Chan Klang&quot; () is situated in the central part of the Grand Palace, where the most important residential and state buildings are located. The court is considered the main part of the Grand Palace and is fronted by the Amornwithi Road, which cuts right across from east to west. The court is further divided into three groups of &#x27;Throne halls&#x27; (&quot;Phra Thinang&quot;; ; ) and one Siwalai Garden quarter.

===Phra Maha Monthien group===

The &quot;Phra Maha Monthien&quot; (พระมหามณเฑียร) group of buildings are located roughly at the centre of the Middle Court, therefore at the very heart of the Grand Palace itself. The traditional Thai style building group is enclosed by a low wall, as this was once the residential and sleeping abode of kings. Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire Grand Palace. All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls in the middle and residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.

All Royal coronations since that of King Rama II have taken place within the walls of this building group. Construction began in 1785 at the order of King Rama I, the original buildings only included the Chakraphat Phimarn Throne Hall and the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall. Later King Rama II carried out major constructions including the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall and other extensions. Later in his reign he added the Sanam Chan Pavilion and the Narai Chinese Pavilion. King Nangklao (Rama III) renamed the buildings from &quot;Chakraphat Phiman&quot; (meaning &#x27;Abode of the Chakravartin&#x27;) to &quot;Maha Monthien&quot; (meaning &#x27;Great Royal Residence&#x27;). He carried out major renovations and spent most of his reign residing in these buildings. King Rama IV later added two arch-ways at the north and west side of the walls called the Thevaphibal and Thevetraksa Gate respectively. King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) added two portico extensions to eastern and western sides of the Amarin Winitchai Hall. Since then most buildings in its original plan remain, with occasional renovations being made before important anniversaries such as the Bangkok Bicentennial Celebrations in 1982. Except for the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall, the rest of the complex is closed to the public.

The Thevaphibal Gate is the central entrance to the hall, however the central doorway is reserve exclusively for use by the king, others must enter through the two other doors on either side. The gate is guarded by Chinese-style statues, including mythical warriors and lions. The gate is topped by three Thai-style spires covered in Chinese ceramics.

====Phra Thinang Amarin Winitchai====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Amarin Winitchai Mahaisuraya Phiman&quot; () or, in brief, the &quot;Phra Thinang Amarin Winitchai&quot; () is the northernmost and forward building of the Maha Monthien buildings, It is also perhaps the most important. The throne hall was constructed in Thai style as a royal audience chamber, for receiving foreign ambassadors and for conducting important state businesses and ceremonies.

The large throne hall stands on a 50 cm high base, the roof is covered in green and orange tiles. The pediment is decorated with a mural depicting the god Indra. The main central door is reserved for use by royalty, while others must enter through the adjacent side doors. Within the hall there are two rows of square columns, five on the left and six on the right, adorned with Thai floral designs. The coffered ceiling is decorated with glass mosaic stars.

At the back of the hall is the &quot;Bussabok Mala Maha Chakraphat Phiman&quot; Throne (; ), flanked by two gilded seven tiered umbrellas. The throne is shaped like a boat with a spired pavilion (&quot;busabok&quot;) in the middle. This elevated pavilion represents Mount Meru, the centre of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. The throne is decorated with coloured enamels and stones as well as deva and garuda figures. The throne was once used for giving royal audiences.

In the front of throne sits another, called the &quot;Phuttan Kanchanasinghat&quot; Throne (). The throne is topped by the massive Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella, an important symbol of Thai kingship. The different tiers represents the king&#x27;s power and prestige which extends in eight directions: the four cardinal directions and the four sub cardinal directions. The final and ninth tier represents the central direction descending into the earth. These giant umbrellas usually deposited above important royal thrones, and out of the seven of which are currently in Bangkok, six of these umbrellas are situated within the vicinity of the Grand Palace and another is situated above the throne within the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall of the Dusit Palace. The throne is made up of multi-layered squared platforms with a seat in the middle. The throne is used for the first royal audience of each king&#x27;s reign and for annual birthday celebrations and other royal receptions. It was from this throne that King Rama II received John Crawfurd (the first British Envoy to Siam in almost 200 years) in 1821. Crawfurd was sent to Bangkok by the Governor-General of India Lord Hastings to negotiate a trade treaty.

====Phra Thinang Phaisan Thaksin====

Directly behind is the &quot;Phra Thinang Phaisan Thaksin&quot; (). The rectangular-shaped hall is a ceremonial functions hall, where the most important religious and state ceremonies are held. It is the main venue where royal coronations are performed at the beginning of each king&#x27;s reign, the last coronation ceremony held here was on 4 May 2019 for King Rama X. Formerly the hall was a private reception hall and living space of King Rama I. He often hosted meetings and dinners for his closest ministers and other trusted courtiers here. After his death the hall was converted into a ceremonial space. The long rectangular hall is decorated in rich murals depicting scenes from Buddhist and Hindu mythology.

The hall houses two thrones. The &quot;Atthit Utumbhorn Raja Aarn&quot; Throne (; ) or the Octagonal Throne is situated to the eastern part of the hall. This unusually shaped wooden throne is in the form of an octagonal prism and is decorated with golden lacquer, topped by a white seven-tiered umbrella. It is used during the first part of the Coronation ceremony, where the king is anointed with holy water, just prior to the crowning ceremony; all Chakri kings have gone through this ancient ritual. Once the king is anointed he is able to sit under the Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella as a fully sovereign king.

Across the hall to the western side is the &quot;Phatharabit&quot; Throne (; ). The throne is a chair with a footstool (more akin to its European counterparts) with two high tables to its sides. The throne is topped by another Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella. This throne is used during the main part of the coronation ceremony, where the King is presented with the various objects, which make up the Royal Regalia. The king will crown himself, then be ceremonially presented with the objects of the regalia by the Royal Brahmins. These include: the Great Crown of Victory, the Sword of Victory, the Royal Staff, the Royal Flywhisk, the Royal Fan and the Royal Slippers.

Apart from being the setting of these important ceremonies, the hall houses the Phra Siam Devadhiraj figure. This figure was created during the reign of King Rama IV to symbolise and embody the Kingdom (of Siam), its well-being and safety. It exists as the personification of the nation to be used as a palladium for worship. The golden figure depicts a standing deity, dressed in royal regalia, wearing a crown and holding a sword in its right hand. The figure is about 8 inches tall, and is housed in a Chinese-style cabinet in the middle of the Phaisan Thaksin Hall facing south. There are also other figures of the same scale depicting other Hindu gods and goddesses. The figure was once worshipped almost daily; today however religious ceremonies are only held to worship the figure during times of great crisis.

====Phra Thinang Chakraphat Phiman====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Chakraphat Phiman&quot; (; ) is situated behind the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall and is at the very centre of the Maha Monthien buildings. The hall was built during the reign of King Rama I as the primary apartment and sleeping quarter of the monarch, and is the inner most part of the Grand Palace. The residential hall was formed out of three identical rectangular buildings, all inter-connected to each other. The middle section of the residential hall (out of the three), is a reception room while the other two sections, to the east and west, are divided into the personal apartments of the king. The east section is the primary bedchamber of the monarch; the hall is divided into two rooms by a golden screen. The northern room contains a canopied bed originally belonging to King Rama I; above this bed hangs a Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella. The southern room contains the dressing and privy chamber, above which hangs another Nine-tiered Umbrella. The west section was used as a multi-purpose hall for minor ceremonies and audiences; however in the reign of King Rama III the hall was converted into a bedroom. After his death it became the storage place for the various weapons and accoutrements of the monarch. The Royal Regalia of Thailand is kept here.

When the Chakraphat Phiman Hall was first built it was entirely roofed with palm leaves; later these were replaced with ceramic tiles, then with glazed tiles during the reign of King Rama V. There is a tradition that no uncrowned kings are allowed to sleep within this hall. However once they were crowned they were required to sleep there, if only for a few nights, literally on the bed of their forefathers. In 1910, prior to his coronation, King Rama VI had a well-concealed modern toilet installed near the bedchamber. The king spent many nights here near the end of his life and died here in 1925. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) and King Rama IX only spent a few nights here after their respective coronations in accordance with tradition.

Between the Chakraphat Phiman and Phaisan Thaksin Halls is a small Front Reception Hall, where the king could receive courtiers while sitting on a small platform. There are two doors on either side of the platform leading into the royal apartments behind. To the rear and south of the Chakraphat Phiman Hall is the Back Reception Hall. This rear hall is flanked by two residential halls. These are reserved for members of the Royal Family and royal consorts from the Inner Court. They are called: &quot;Thepsathan Philat&quot; Hall (พระที่นั่งเทพสถานพิลาศ) (to the east) and the &quot;Thepassana Philai&quot; Hall (พระที่นั่งเทพอาสน์พิไล; ) (to the west).

====Phra Thinang Dusidaphirom====

Apart from these grand state buildings, there are also several minor structures and pavilions surrounding the Phra Maha Monthien structures. These include four smaller halls at the sides of the Amarin Winitchai Throne hall.

Aside the wall to the northwest is the &quot;Phra Thinang Dusidaphirom&quot; (พระที่นั่งดุสิตาภิรมย์; ). Built on a raised platform, the one-story hall was used as a robing chamber for the king when arriving and departing the palace either by palanquin or by elephant. Hence the elephant-mounting platform to the west and a palanquin-mounting platform to the north. At first the structure was an open pavilion; the walls covered with rich murals were added later by King Rama III. The entrance is situated to the east and is lined with steps leading from the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall. The hall is the only structure within the Grand Palace with exterior decorations. The golden lacquer and blue glass mosaic depicts angels carrying a sword.

====Phra Thinang Racharuedee====

To the southeast is the &quot;Phra Thinang Racharuedee&quot; (พระที่นั่งราชฤดี; ), a Thai-style pavilion constructed during the reign of King Rama VI as an outdoor audience chamber. The pavilion was constructed for use especially during the birthday celebrations of the king. Originally King Rama IV had a two-story, European-style building constructed. Its purpose was to display gifts from foreign nations; however when this building became dilapidated King Rama V replaced it with a Chinese-style pavilion which was again dismantled and rebuilt. The present pavilion measures . The pediments are decorated with a gilded figures of Narayana on a garuda against a white mosaic background.

====Phra Thinang Sanam Chan====

The southwest structure is the &quot;Phra Thinang Sanam Chan&quot; (พระที่นั่งสนามจันทร์). Built during the reign of King Rama II, the pavilion is a traditional Thai pavilion with a raised platform inside. King Rama II used the pavilion for relaxation and for sitting when supervising construction projects. Measuring only , the pavilion was portable and could be moved to different sites. The wooden pediments are decorated with gilded carvings and glass mosaic in a floral design with Chinese and Western influences. The eight columns are inlaid with glass mosaic. The inner platform is decorated with black lacquer and glass mosaic. The top of the platform is made out of a single panel of teak measuring . The pavilion was strengthened and given a marble base by King Rama IX in 1963.

====Ho Sastrakhom====
To the northeast is the &quot;Ho Sastrakhom&quot; (หอศาสตราคม; ) or the &quot;Ho Phra Parit&quot; (หอพระปริตร), The hall is the same size as the Dusidaphirom Hall and the two appear to have been constructed concurrently. In accordance with ancient tradition, the hall was built for the use of Mon monks to create Holy water, which was then sprinkled around the palace ground every evening; this practice was discontinued during the reign of King Rama VII for financial reasons. Currently the ritual is only practiced during Buddhist holy days by Mon monks from Wat Chana Songkhram. The hall is divided into two rooms; the northern room is a prayer and ritual room for monks, including closets built into the walls for religious texts. The southern room is a storage room for Buddha images and religious artifacts.

During times of war, the potency of weapons was enhanced by the holy water in a special ceremony. The weapons and special amulets were then distributed to soldiers before battle. As a result of this function the windows and doors of the hall are decorated with depictions of ancient weapons.

====Ho Suralai Phiman and Ho Phra That Monthien====
On each side of the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall is a Buddha image hall. On the east side is the &quot;Ho Suralai Phiman&quot; (หอพระสุราลัยพิมาน; ), which then connects to the Dusitsasada Gate. The Ho Suralai Phiman is a small Thai-style building which is attached to the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall through a short corridor. The hall houses important and valuable Buddha images and figures, including one representing each and every reign of the Chakri dynasty. Some relics of the Buddha are also reportedly kept here.

The &quot;Ho Phra That Monthien&quot; (หอพระธาตุมณเฑียร) is located to the west side of the Phaisan Thaksin Hall and is also connected by a corridor in symmetry to the Suralai Phiman on the other side. The Phra That Montein hall contains several small gilded pagodas containing the ashes of Royal ancestors. Originally named Ho Phra Chao, the name was changed by King Rama II, who installed several valuable and ancient Buddha images in 1812. King Rama III and King Rama IV also have their own Buddha images installed here and carried out extensive renovations to the interior and exterior.

===Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat group===

The Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat buildings are composed of nine major and minor halls, structured in a similar scheme to the Maha Monthien Halls from north to south, however the two building groups contrasts greatly in styles. This group of palaces is situated at the centre, between the Maha Montein and Maha Prasat groups. The whole of the Chakri Maha Prasat group was the work of King Rama V and foreign architects in the 19th century. During the reign of King Rama I the area was once an expansive garden, later named &quot;Suan Sai&quot; (สวนซ้าย) or &#x27;Left Garden&#x27;, the twin of &quot;Suan Khwa&quot; (สวนขวา) or right garden, now the Siwalai Gardens. The two gardens were named according to their location on the left and the right of the Maha Monthien buildings. During the reign of King Rama III a new residential pavilion called &quot;Phra Tamnak Tuek&quot; (พระตำหนักตึก) was constructed for his mother, Princess Mother Sri Sulalai. The new residence was composed of several low-lying buildings and pavilions. King Rama IV expanded the residence and gave it to his consort Queen Debsirindra. Within these buildings King Rama V was born (in 1853) and lived as a child.

When King Rama V ascended the throne in 1868, he decided to build a new group of grander throne halls to replace the old structures. The first phase of construction began in 1868, then again in 1876, and the final phase between 1882 and 1887. King Rama V resided in the palace until 1910 when he gradually moved to the new Dusit Palace, to the north of the Grand Palace. King Rama VI occasionally stayed in the palace; however he preferred his other residences in the country. By the reign of King Rama VII the buildings were in dire need of renovations, but due to economic constraints only the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall was renovated. This work was carried out by Prince Itthithepsan Kritakara, an architectural graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Many of his works can still be seen today. During the reign of King Rama IX many of the buildings once more became so dilapidated that they needed to be demolished altogether. In their stead new halls were constructed in 2004 to replace them.

Formerly the site hosted eleven different residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, although they have been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None of the rooms are open to the public, as state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.

====Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งจักรีมหาปราสาท; ) is situated on the northernmost part of the Phra Thinang Chakri group. The throne hall forms the front or the façade of the entire building group. In front of the throne hall is the Rathakit Field; on either side of the throne hall are the Phrom Sopha Gates. The throne hall is constructed in an eclectic style, a blend of Thai and European (more specifically Renaissance or Italianate) styles. The lower part of the structure is European, while the upper part is in Thai-styled green and orange tiled roofs and gilded spires or &quot;prasats&quot;.

After a trip to Singapore and Java, in the East Indies (present day Indonesia) in 1875, King Rama V brought back with him two Englishmen, the architect John Clunich and his helper Henry C. Rose to design and construct the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall. Construction began on 7 May 1876. At first the King wanted an entirely European structure with domes. However at the insistence of Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag), his Chief Minister, the King decided to add the gilded spires and Thai roofs. In 1878 the King personally supervised the raising of the final central spire of the building. The throne hall was completed in 1882, on the centenary of the House of Chakri and the Grand Palace. Thus the new throne hall was given the name &quot;Phra Thinang Chakri&quot;, meaning literally &#x27;the seat of the Chakris&#x27;.

The throne hall was constructed as part of a building group in a rotated &#x27;H&#x27; shape plan, with two parallel buildings running on an east to west axis. In between is an intersecting hall, with an axis running north to south. The northerly end of the structure is the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall; all other buildings are hidden behind it. The throne hall consists of three storeys, with three seven tiered prasats on each of the three major pavilions along the axis. The central pavilion with its portico and roof extensions is taller and larger than the other two on the sides. Owing to a mix of Thai and European styles, the exterior decoration is a mixture of orders and does not follow strict classical lines. The Thai roofs are decorated with the same green and orange tiles as the other throne halls, in order for the new building to blend in harmoniously with the existing skyline. The external pediments and gates of the throne hall are decorated with the emblem of the Chakri dynasty, an intertwined Chakra and Trishula. Above the middle floor windows the western style coat of arms of Siam is used. On the semi-circular pediment of the central hall there is also a portrait of King Rama V.

The incongruous make-up between the Western lower half and Thai roof has been compared with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition emphasises the superiority of Thai architecture (a crown upon the head) over that of the West (the lower half of the body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance to Western imperialism, both in terms of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) and those of the traditional ruling elites (as espoused by some of his early ministers).

Within the interior, the upper and middle floors are State floors; they are divided into several reception rooms, throne rooms and galleries, complete with royal portraits of every Chakri monarch (including Second King Pinklao) and their consorts. In the east gallery are Buddhist images and other religious images, while to the west are reception rooms for State guests and other foreign dignitaries. In other parts of the throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their queens are housed. Many of the European-made chandeliers inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince Devavongse Varopakar. The lower floor or ground floor is reserved for servants and the Royal Guards. Currently there is also a museum displaying old weapons.

Inside the main hall (throne room), situated at the very centre of the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall, is the &quot;Bhudthan Thom&quot; Throne (พระที่นั่งพุดตานถม; ), a chair on a raised platform. The Throne is flanked by two seven-tiered umbrellas, while the throne itself is topped by a Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella. Behind the throne is a tapestry depicting a fiery intertwined chakra and trishula, or the &#x27;Chakri&#x27;, the emblem of the dynasty. The throne has been used by the king during important state occasions, such as the welcoming or accrediting of foreign diplomats and missions. The room itself has also been used by King Rama IX to welcome foreign dignitaries and heads of state, such as Queen Elizabeth II, President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II. Recently the King welcomed more than 21 world leaders inside the room during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC Summit) held in Bangkok in 2003. The wall of the throne room is decorated with four paintings depicting important scenes in the history of Thai foreign relations. On the east wall hang two paintings, titled &#x27;Queen Victoria receiving King Mongkut&#x27;s Ambassador&#x27; and &#x27;King Louis XIV receiving the Ambassador of King Narai of Ayutthaya in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles&#x27;. On the west wall hang &#x27;King Mongkut receiving British Envoy Sir John Bowring&#x27; and &#x27;Napoleon III receiving the Siamese Ambassadors at Fontainbleau&#x27;.

====Phra Thinang Moon Satharn Borom Ard====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Moon Satharn Borom Ard&quot; (พระที่นั่งมูลสถานบรมอาสน์; ) is situated behind the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall to the east side and was built as a separate wing in 1869. The hall encompasses the original area where King Rama V was born and had lived as a child. Previously King Rama I had the area set aside as a small mango tree garden. Currently the hall is set out as a small banqueting and reception venue.

====Phra Thinang Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat&quot; (พระที่นั่งสมมติเทวราชอุปบัติ; ) is situated on the opposite side of the Moon Santharn Borom Ard Hall, to the west of the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall. It was built in 1868. The hall is divided into several state rooms for use by the king: there is a reception room and a council room. It was in this hall on 12 July 1874 that King Rama V stated to his ministers his intention to abolish slavery in Siam.

====Phra Thinang Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran&quot; (พระที่นั่งบรมราชสถิตยมโหฬาร; ) is a large banquet hall at the very back of the Chakri Maha Prasat group. It was formerly the Damrong Sawad Ananwong Hall and the Niphatpong Thawornwichit Hall. The two halls were built by King Rama V as banqueting halls to host foreign guests and dignitaries. By the reign of King Rama IX, the building was so run down that the king ordered it to be demolished. Construction of a new hall began in 1996, but was interrupted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis; it eventually resumed on 1 April 2004. The new throne hall was built on a raised platform and is composed of several interconnected buildings forming two internal courtyards. These rooms function as a new banqueting hall and are used for important state functions. On 13 June 2006, the hall welcomed the royal representatives of 25 monarchies worldwide for the celebration of King Rama IX&#x27;s 60th Anniversary on the Throne. These guests included 12 ruling monarchs, 8 royal consorts and 7 crown princes.

===Phra Maha Prasat group===
The &quot;Phra Maha Prasat&quot; (พระมหาปราสาท) group of buildings is situated at the westernmost part of the Middle Court. The main buildings within this area date from the reign of King Rama I and contain some of the oldest existing edifices within the Grand Palace. The entire throne hall group is contained within a walled and paved courtyard. Similarly to the other two groups, the Maha Prasat buildings were constructed, embellished and refurbished over successive kings&#x27; reigns. The buildings form a single axis from north to south, with the public throne hall to the front and residential halls behind. Surrounding them are lesser function halls and pavilions for use by the king and his court.

After the construction of the Grand Palace, King Rama I ordered that a copy of the ancient Phra Thinang Sanphet Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งสรรเพชญมหาปราสาท) should be built at the same site. The Hall was originally located at the old palace in Ayutthaya, which had been destroyed 15 years earlier. This new throne hall was given the name &quot;Phra Thinang Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งอมรินทราภิเษกมหาปราสาท; ). Construction began in 1782 and finished in 1784. This was the hall where King Rama I celebrated his full coronation ceremony. However, in 1789 the building was struck by lightning and burnt to the ground. In its place King Rama I ordered the construction of a new hall under a different design and name.

As a result of this disaster, King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in the diary of a contemporary princess; after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. The prophecy resurfaced in the minds of many people when only three months after the dynasty&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 occurred. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri kings with a constitutional monarchy under Siam&#x27;s first constitution.

Two new halls were then built, the Dusit Maha Prasat and the Phiman Rattaya, each being designated for either ceremonial or residential use. Since then no coronations have been held inside. Upon the death of King Rama I, the hall was used for his official lying-in-state. It has since become a custom that the remains of kings, queens and other high-ranking members of the royal family are to be placed in the hall for an official mourning period.

The entrance to this group of buildings is through one of the three gates at the northern end of the wall. These gates are decorated with Chinese porcelain in floral patterns. Only the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall is open to the public.

====Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) dominates the Maha Prasat group. It was built on a symmetrical cruciform plan and the roof is topped with a tall gilded spire. The hall is considered an ideal example of traditional Thai architecture. Every aspect of its exterior decoration is imbued with symbolism. The hall is built in the shape of a tall mountain to represent Mount Meru, the mythological centre of the universe.

The spire is divided into three sections. The base is formed of seven superimposed layers, each representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is in the shape of a bell, flattened to create a four-sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha&#x27;s ashes are interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or crystal dew drop which signifies the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on each of its four sides; as well as being a symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.

The pediments are decorated with the figure of Narayana, a Hindu deity, riding a garuda. This associates the king with Narayana and further signifies his authority. According to legend, Narayana descended from heaven in human form to alleviate the suffering of mankind. He represents all the qualities of an ideal king. The throne hall stands on a high base with convex and concave mouldings. The bottom layer, according to Thai beliefs, resembles a lion&#x27;s paw; the lion is a symbol of the Buddha&#x27;s family and alludes to the Buddha&#x27;s own royal heritage.

The most unusual feature of this throne hall is the small porch projecting from the front of the building. Under this porch stands the &quot;Busabok Mala&quot; Throne (พระที่นั่งบุษบกมาลา), whose spire echoes that of the hall itself. The high base of this throne is surrounded by figures of praying deities. During the reign of King Rama I, it was used when the king appeared before the representatives of his vassal states; later, it was used for certain ceremonies. The two doors to the hall are situated on each side of the throne.

The interior walls of this throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Praying deities sit within the buds, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression of being in a heavenly abode. The interior panels of the door and window shutters depict standing deities facing each other, holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allows for the spaces between them and the shutters to be painted with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.

The wings of the hall hold thrones for use in various royal functions; these include the Mother-of-Pearl Throne (พระแท่นราชบัลลังก์ประดับมุก) which stands almost at the centre of the hall, at the intersection of the four wings. This square throne, topped with a Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella, is entirely inlaid with mother-of-pearl and dates from the reign of King Rama I. It was saved from the Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat when it burnt down in 1789.

In the eastern transept is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) which was made to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. It was once the king&#x27;s personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; once it was no longer used, it was transferred to its current location. The bed takes the form of a high platform with many layers and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the hall, members of the royal family take their seats in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. At such times the throne and bed are used as altars for images of the Buddha.

Behind the Mother-of-Pearl Throne is the &quot;Phra Banchon Busabok Mala&quot; Throne (พระบัญชรบุษบกมาลา; ). This half throne protrudes from the southern wall of the throne hall and opens into it like a window. Its style is similar to the Busabok Mala Throne on the porch outside. It was made during the reign of King Rama IV, in order for the palace women to attend important ceremonies through the window but stay behind a screen, separating them from men arriving from the outside.

====Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya&quot; (พระที่นั่งพิมานรัตยา) is located directly behind the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. It is a residential palace, built for King Rama I as his main royal apartment. Over time its use as such declined and eventually ended; now it is only used as a ceremonial venue. It was built in the traditional rectangular Thai style. The east, west and south sides of the hall are surrounded on the outside by a colonnade, and the building itself is surrounded by two gardens. During the reign of King Rama VI it was used as a meeting and function hall for members of the royal family. It also provided a venue for the investiture ceremonies whereby individuals are awarded with State orders and decorations by a member of the royal family. Currently the hall is only used, in conjunction with the Dusit Maha Prasat, as the main venue for state funerals.

====Phra Thinang Aphorn Phimok Prasat====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Aphorn Phimok Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งอาภรณ์ภิโมกข์ปราสาท; ) is an open pavilion, built on a platform at the east wall of the Maha Prasat group by King Rama IV; it was used both as a robing place for the king to change his regalia when entering the Maha Prasat, and also as the royal palanquin mounting platform. The pavilion is considered the epitome of the finest qualities of Thai traditional architecture in proportion, style and detail. A smaller replica was exhibited at the Brussels World Fair in 1958.

The pavilion has a cruciform layout with the northern and southern ends being longer. The roof is topped with a spire of five tiers, making it a prasat rather than a &#x27;maha prasat&#x27; (which has seven). The spire is supported by swans as opposed to the traditional garudas. The eastern pediment depicts the Hindu god Shiva standing on a plinth with one foot raised, holding a sword in his left hand and his right hand raised in blessing. The columns of the pavilion are decorated with gold and silver glass mosaic in a floral pattern; the capitals of these columns take the form of long lotus petals.

====Phra Thinang Rachakaranya Sapha====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Rachakaranya Sapha&quot; (พระที่นั่งราชกรัณยสภา; ) is located at the southern end of the eastern wall. A closed rectangular building, it was designed as a council chamber for use by the king and his ministers. In 1897, on his first trip to Europe, King Rama V installed Queen Saovabha Phongsri as regent, and she presided over privy council meetings here. In 1956 Queen Sirikit again presided over the privy council as regent while King Rama IX briefly entered the Sangha as a monk. The building is still used occasionally by the king for private audiences. Its projecting pediments over the roof line, common during the Ayutthaya period, are a notable feature.

====Ho Plueang Khrueang====
The &quot;Ho Plueang Khrueang&quot; (ศาลาเปลื้องเครื่อง) is a closed pavilion situated on the western wall of the Maha Prasat group. It was built by King Rama VI as a robing room. The building is a two-storied Thai style rectangular hall with a walkway leading from the top floor to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall.

====Mount Kailasa====

A miniature model of Mount Kailasa (เขาไกรลาสจำลอง; ), the mythical abode of Shiva, was built during the reign of King Rama IV. It is crowned with a miniature palace on its summit, used as the setting for an important ceremony called the royal tonsure ceremony. This ancient rite of passage would be performed for a prince or princess around the age of thirteen. Sometimes lasting seven days of festivities, the tonsure ceremony involved a purifying bath and the cutting of the traditional topknot hair of the royal child. The king himself cut the child&#x27;s hair, which was later thrown into the Chao Phraya river as an offering. The foot of the mountain is populated with statues of mythical animals from the Himavanta Forest. It is situated behind the walkway between the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall and Ho Plueng Krueng. This area is considered part of the Inner Court and is not open to the public.

===Siwalai Garden===

The Siwalai Garden (สวนศิวาลัย, &quot;Suan Siwalai&quot;) is situated to the easternmost part of the Middle court and is considered separate from the other state buildings and throne halls. The garden has been in its present form, since King Rama V, and contains both royal residences and religious buildings. Throughout the years several structures were built and demolished by various kings. The garden was first created at the behest of King Rama I as a private retreat called the &quot;Suan Kaew&quot; (สวนแก้ว) or &#x27;Crystal Garden&#x27;. The name was changed by Rama II to &quot;Suan Khwa&quot; or &#x27;Right Garden&#x27;, who also embellished the garden and transformed it into a pleasure garden for the inhabitants of the Inner Court.

The greatest change to the area occurred during the reign of King Rama IV, when the entire garden was turned into a new residential palace. This palace was composed of several interconnected buildings of various styles and sizes for the king&#x27;s use. This buildings complex was named the &quot;Phra Abhinaowas Niwet&quot; (พระอภิเนาว์นิเวศน์; ). The building group are on an east to west axis, with reception halls to the east and residential halls in the west. These buildings were built in a combination of Thai and Western styles; the principal building of the Phra Abhinaowas Niwet group was the &quot;Phra Thinang Ananta Samakhom&quot;; this European style grand audience chamber was used by the king to receive various foreign missions. Other buildings included King Rama IV&#x27;s primary residential hall, observatory and banqueting hall. By the reign of King Rama V the Phra Abhinaowas Niwet building group became so dilapidated that most were eventually demolished; the names of some of the halls were later assumed by new royal buildings (for example the new Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall in the Dusit Palace). King Rama V had the area turned once more into a private garden for use by the Inner Court and also gave the garden its present name. The new garden contained some of the old buildings as well as new additions, such as a small lawn in the south western corner called the &quot;Suan Tao&quot; or &#x27;Turtle Garden&#x27;. The layout of the Siwalai Garden remained mostly unchanged until the present day.

====Phra Thinang Boromphiman====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Boromphiman&quot; (พระที่นั่งบรมพิมาน; ) is the largest structure within the Siwalai Garden; it is located at the northernmost end. The two-storey Neo-Renaissance residence was constructed during the reign of King Rama V from 1897 to 1903. The new palace was built over the site of an old armoury, after King Rama V had it demolished. The new palace was intended as a gift to the first Crown Prince of Siam, Prince Maha Vajirunhis. It was originally named &quot;Phra Thinang Phanumart Chamroon&quot; (พระที่นั่งภานุมาศจำรูญ). However, before the construction was finished the prince died of typhoid at the age of 16. Once completed the palace was handed to the next heir, Crown Prince Maha Vajiravudh, who ascended the throne in 1910 as Rama VI. He later gave the palace its present name.

Under the supervision of foreign architects, namely the German C. Sandreczki, the Boromphiman Throne Hall became the most modern building within the Grand Palace; it was also the first to be designed to accommodate carriages and motorcars. The exterior walls are embellished with pilasters and elaborate plaster designs. The triangular and semi-circular pediments are decorated with stuccoed floral motifs. The palace&#x27;s distinctive Mansard roof is covered in dark grey slate tiles. On the façade of the building, the main and central pediment show the emblem of the crown prince.

Even though the architectural style and exterior decoration of the building is entirely Western, the interior decorations is entirely Thai. The central hall, situated under a dome, is decorated with murals of the god Indra, Varuna, Agni and Yama—all depicted in Thai style. Below them are Thai inscriptions composed by King Rama VI himself.

After his accession to the throne, King Rama VI occasionally stayed at the palace. King Rama VII stayed at the palace for a few nights before his coronation in 1925, while King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) made the palace his main place of residence upon his return to Thailand from Switzerland in December 1945. He lived in this palace with his younger brother Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (later King Rama IX) and his mother Princess Sri Sangwan. On the morning of 9 June 1946 the palace bore witness to his mysterious and unexplained death by gunshot. King Rama IX later refurbished the palace and added an extra wing extending south.

Currently the palace is not open to the public, and serves as the official guest house for visiting Heads of State and their entourage. To the southeast of the Boromphiman Throne Hall, there are also two guest houses for use by the entourage of state visitors.

====Phra Thinang Mahisorn Prasat====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Mahisorn Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งมหิศรปราสาท) is a small pavilion built on the wall between the Siwalai Garden and the Maha Monthien buildings. The pavilion has a &quot;mondop&quot;-style roof and a gilded spire, decorated in glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a monument to his father King Rama II. After its completion the ashes of King Rama II was moved and was housed in the pavilion. After the death of King Rama IV the ashes was moved back to the Ho Phra That Monthien Buddha Image Hall, currently the pavilion houses several Buddha images.

====Phra Thinang Siwalai Maha Prasat====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Siwalai Maha Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งศิวาลัยมหาปราสาท) is located on the southern-eastern end of the Siwalai Garden. The Siwalai Maha Prasat is a Thai-style edifice with a Mondop style spire of seven tiers. Built during the reign of King Rama V in 1878 to house the metal statues of his four predecessors, which were cast in 1869. The hall was to be used as a royal pantheon, where the lives of previous monarchs were to be commemorated and worshiped. Later King Rama VI had the statues removed and rehoused at the Prasat Phra Thep Bidorn in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha compound, where they would be more accessible to the public. On 6 April 1918 the first ceremony of worship was inaugurated, this ceremony continues to be performed annually. Since the removal of the statues, the Siwalai Maha Prasat has been left vacant.

====Phra Thinang Sitalaphirom====
The &quot;Phra Thinang Sitalaphirom&quot; (พระที่นั่งสีตลาภิรมย์) is a small open pavilion made of wood, built by King Rama VI. The pavilion is situated on the northern edge of the lawn south of the Boromphiman palace. The pavilion is decorated with a flame motif in gilded black lacquer. The gables bear the insignia of King Rama VI. The king used the pavilion as a place of rest and as a seat during garden parties.

====Phra Buddha Rattanasathan====
The &quot;Phra Buddha Rattanasathan&quot; (พระพุทธรัตนสถาน) is a Phra ubosot (or ordination hall), situated at the very centre of the Siwalai Garden. The religious building is a shrine to a Buddha image called the &quot;Phra Buddha Butsayarat Chakraphat Pimlom Maneemai&quot; (พระพุทธบุษยรัตน์จักรพรรดิพิมลมณีมัย; ) which was brought from Champasak in Laos. The ubosot was built for this purpose by King Rama IV. The ubosot is built of grey stone and has a two-tier green title roof. At the front there is a portico of pillars. Running around the outside of the ubosot is an open pillared gallery. Religious ceremonies have been performed here in the past.

==Inner Court==
The Inner Court or the &quot;Khet Phra Racha Than Chan Nai&quot; (เขตพระราชฐานชั้นใน), referred to simply as &quot;Fai Nai&quot; (ฝ่ายใน; ; literally &#x27;The Inside&#x27;), occupies the southernmost part of the Grand Palace complex. This area is reserved exclusively for use by the king and his harem of queens and consorts (minor wives). These women were often called &#x27;forbidden women&#x27; or &quot;Nang harm&quot; (นางห้าม; ) by the general populace. Other inhabitants of the court were the king&#x27;s children and a multitude of ladies-in-waiting and servants. The king&#x27;s royal consorts were drawn from the ranks of the Siamese: royalty and nobility. Usually there were also the daughters of rulers of tributary states. Royal polygamy ended in practice during the reign of King Rama VI, who refused to keep a polygamous household. It was ended officially by King Rama VII in the early 20th century, when he outlawed the practice for all and took only one consort: Queen Rambhai Barni. By this time the inhabitants of the court had dwindled to only a few and finally disappeared within a few decades afterwards. Historically the Inner Court was a town complete within itself, divided by narrow streets and lawns. It had its own shops, government, schools, warehouses, laws and law courts, all exclusively controlled by women for the royal women. Men on special repair work and doctors were admitted only under the watchful eyes of its female guards. The king&#x27;s sons were permitted to live inside until they reached puberty; after their tonsure ceremonies they were sent outside the palace for further education. There are currently no inhabitants within the Inner Court and the buildings within are not used for any purpose; nevertheless, the entire court is closed to the public.

The population of the Inner Court varied over different periods, but by all accounts it was large. Each queen consort had her own household of around 200 to 300 women. Her various ladies-in-waiting were usually recruited from noble families; others were minor princesses who would also have a retinue of servants. Each minor wife or consort (เจ้าจอม; &quot;Chao Chom&quot;) had a fairly large household; this would increase significantly if she gave birth to the king&#x27;s child, as she would be elevated to the rank of consort mother (เจ้าจอมมารดา; &quot;Chao Chom Manda&quot;). Each royal lady had a separate establishment, the size of which was in proportion to her rank and status in accordance with palace law. Altogether the population of the Inner Court numbered nearly 3,000 inhabitants.
The Inner Court was once populated by small low-lying structures surrounded by gardens, lawns and ponds. Over the course of the late 19th century new residential houses were constructed in this space, resulting in overcrowded conditions. Most of the buildings that remain were constructed during the reign of King Rama V in Western styles, mostly Italianate. The residences vary in size and are divided into three categories; small royal villas or &quot;Phra Thamnak&quot; (พระตำหนัก; ), villas or &quot;Thamnak&quot; (ตำหนัก; ) and houses or &quot;Ruen&quot; (เรือน; ). Each was distributed to the inhabitants in accordance with their rank and stature. The court is surrounded and separated from the rest of the Grand Palace by a second set of walls within, parallel to those that ring around the palace as a whole. These walls are punctuated by a set of gates that connects the Middle the Inner Courts to the outside and to each other; the entrance through these gates were strictly monitored. The three main building groups in the Middle Court are built so that the residential halls of each are situated to the south and straddled the boundary between the Middle and Inner Court. Thus these residential spaces of the king became the focal point of palace life and the lives of the palace women on the inside. Immediately behind these residential halls are the large royal villas of high-ranking consorts such as Queen Sukhumala Marasri and Queen Savang Vadhana. Surrounding them are smaller villas belonging to other consorts such as those belonging to Princess Consort Dara Rasmi. Finally at the lower end (the southernmost part) are the row houses or &quot;Tao Teng&quot; (แถวเต๊ง; ) for the middle- and low-ranking consorts. These residences also functioned as a de facto secondary layer of surveillance, at the very edges of the Inner Court.

The Inner Court was governed by a series of laws known as the Palace Laws (กฎมนเทียรบาล, &quot;Kot Monthien Ban&quot;; literally &#x27;Palace Maintenance Law&#x27;). Some of the laws dated back to the times of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. Most of them deal with the hierarchy and status of the women, while others deal with their behaviour and conduct. The order and discipline of the inhabitants were enforced by a regiment of all-female guards (กรมโขลน, &quot;Krom Klone&quot;; ). These guards were described by Prince Chula Chakrabongse as &quot;tough looking amazons&quot;. The head of this body was known as the &quot;Atibodi Fai Nai&quot; (อธิบดีฝ่ายใน; ) the directress of the inside, under her command were various officials. These officials had specific responsibilities concerning every facet of life within the Inner Court. These responsibilities included duties concerning: discipline and jails, the maintenance of Buddhist images, the guarding of gates, the inner treasury and expenditure. One of their main duties was to accompany men, once they were admitted into the area, and to remain with them until they left. They controlled the traffic of the court and were drilled like regular soldiers. When any person of importance passed along the streets they ran ahead and cleared the way for them. At night they patrolled the streets with lamps or torches. Misbehaviour or indiscretion on behalf of the wives was punishable by death, for the women and the man. The last such punishment was met out in 1859 to a young nobleman and a minor wife, who were having an affair.

Only the children of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child were performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court&#x27;s streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.

Although the women of &#x27;The Inside&#x27; could never have the same level of freedom to those on the outside, life inside the Inner Court was not disagreeable, as life was easier than the outside and most necessities were provided for. The women usually entered the palace as girls and remained inside for the rest of their lives. As girls they would be assigned certain duties as pages; as they grew older and became wives and mothers they would have a household to look after. During the reign of King Rama IV, the women of the palace were for the first time allowed to leave; however they were required to obtain permission from the directoress first and were strictly chaperoned. Malcolm A. Smith, physician to Queen Saovabha Phongsri from 1914 to 1919, wrote that, &quot;there is no evidence to show that they longed for freedom or were unhappy in their surroundings. Even Mrs. Leonowens, fanatical opponent of polygamy that she was, does not tell us that&quot;. Indeed, Anna Leonowens&#x27; book &quot;The English Governess at the Siamese Court&quot;, published in 1873, was set inside the Inner Court.

==Defensive walls==
The castellated walls of the Grand Palace were constructed during the reign of King Rama I in 1782. Later during the reign of King Rama II the Grand Palace and its walls were extended towards the south. Cannon emplacements were replaced with guard houses and were given rhyming names. The northern wall measures 410 metres, the east 510 metres, the south 360 metres and the west 630 metres, a total of . There are 12 gates in the outer walls. Inside the palace, there were over 22 gates and a labyrinth of inner walls; however some of these have already been demolished. Around the outer walls there are also 17 small forts. On the eastern wall, facing Sanamchai Road, there are two throne halls.

===Pavilions===
====Phra Thinang Chai Chumpol====

The &quot;Phra Thinang Chai Chumpol&quot; (พระที่นั่งไชยชุมพล; ) is located on the north of the eastern wall, opposite the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The small rectangular pavilion was built on the top of the wall of the palace. The pavilion has a roof of two tiers and is covered with grey tiles. The exterior is decorated with black lacquer and glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a viewing platform, where he could observe royal and religious processions going by along the Sanamchai Road. The pavilion was also used for a time as the main shrine of the Phra Siam Thevathiraj figure, before it was moved to its current shrine in the Phaisan Thaksin Hall.

====Phra Thinang Suthaisawan Prasat====

Situated on the south eastern wall of the Grand Palace is the &quot;Phra Thinang Suthaisawan Prasat&quot; (พระที่นั่งสุทไธสวรรยปราสาท); the hall sits between the Deva Phitak and Sakdi Chaisit Gates on the eastern wall. It was first built by King Rama I in imitation of the &quot;Phra Thinang Chakrawat Phaichayont&quot; (พระที่นั่งจักรวรรดิ์ไพชยนต์; ) on the walls of the Royal Palace in Ayutthaya. Originally called the &quot;Plubpla Sung&quot; or high pavilion, it was made entirely of wood and was an open-air structure. During the reign of King Rama III, a new structure was built out of brick and mortar. This new structure was renamed &quot;Phra Thinang Sutthasawan&quot; (พระที่นั่งสุทไธสวรรย์; ). The hall is used by the king to give audiences to the public and view military parades.

The new structure consists of two-stories, the lower in Western style and the top level in Thai design. The central pavilion has a wooden balcony, which is used by the king and royal family for the granting of public audiences. The roof over the central pavilion is topped by a five-tier prasat in Mondop style, decorated in glass mosaic. The hall&#x27;s wings stretching from the north to the south, each has nine large windows along the exterior. Later in the reign of King Rama V, the entire structure was refurbished and finally given its present name.

===Gates===

The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, &quot;Pratu&quot;, literally a door), three along each of the four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.

===Forts===
Along the walls of the Grand Palace there are seventeen forts (ป้อม, &quot;Pom&quot;); originally there were only ten, with later additions made. These small structures are usually small battlements with cannon placements and watchtower. The forts were also given rhyming names.

==Museum of the Emerald Buddha Temple==

The Museum of the Emerald Buddha Temple (พิพิธภัณฑ์วัดพระศรีรัตนศาสดาราม), despite its name, is the main artefacts repository of both the Grand Palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha complex. The museum is located between the Outer and Middle Court and sits opposite the Phra Thinang Maha Prasat Group. A building was constructed on the present location in 1857 during the reign of King Rama IV as the Royal Mint (โรงกษาปณ์สิทธิการ, &quot;Rong Kasarp Sitthikarn&quot;; ). King Rama V ordered the mint to be enlarged, but not long after this the building was destroyed by fire and needed to be rebuilt.

The two-story structure is rectangular in shape. The portico has four Ionic columns with fluted stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables of the building have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The lower part of the exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have semi-circular French windows, with pilasters on both sides. In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace&#x27;s walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer&#x27;s club.

In 1982, on the bicentennial anniversary year of the founding of Bangkok and the building of the Grand Palace, the building was selected as the site of a new museum. It was established at the instigation of Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn to hold certain architectural elements, which had to be replaced; various artefacts and Buddha images that were donated to the Grand Palace by the general public.

The ground floor of the museum displays a varied selection of artefacts. These included certain architectural elements, which were removed from various buildings within the Grand Palace during different renovations, as well as were the stone Buddha images and Chinese statues. They included many figures from Thai literature, the Ramakien, such as Suvannamaccha and Hanuman. The stone figures date from the reign of King Rama III, and were later moved to the museum to prevent damage. In the central hall are the bones of white elephants. These elephants were not actually white but have certain special characteristics such as pinkish colouring and cream eyes. The White elephant was an important symbol of kingship; the more the monarch possessed the greater was his prestige. This belief and veneration of the animal is common to many other South-east Asian cultures. 

The upper floor rooms display more artistic and precious objects. In the main hall are two architectural models of the Grand Palace, the first representing the Grand Palace during the reign of King Rama I, and another in the reign of King Rama V. Behind these are numerous Buddha images and commemorative coins. In the doorway leading to the main hall is a small mother-of-pearl seating platform known as &quot;Phra Thaen Song Sabai&quot; (พระแท่นทรงสบาย), which was once located in the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall. The platform was used for informal audiences and dates from the time of King Rama I. At the end of the main hall stands the &quot;Phra Thaen Manangsila&quot; Throne (พระแท่นมนังคศิลาอาสน์; ), which is believed to date to the Sukhothai Kingdom and was brought back to Bangkok, from Sukhothai, by King Rama IV, when he was still a monk. Against the walls on either side of the hall are four different Buddha images of Javanese style; they were purchased by King Rama V. The room to the right of the Manangsila Throne displays the various seasonal robes of the Emerald Buddha. To the left of the main hall is a lacquer ware screen depicting the crowning of Shiva, king of the gods. The screen was formerly kept in the Phra Thinang Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat; it was saved from the fire apparently by the hands of King Rama I himself. The rest of the upper floor displays various objets d′art (such as a model of Mount Kailasa) and more Buddha images.

<doc id="505387" wikidata="Q919256" url="?curid=505387" title="Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières">
<text>The  (, &quot;University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières&quot;, UQTR), also known as &quot;l&#x27;université du peuple&quot;, established in 1969 and mainly located in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada, is a public university within the network. As of April 2016, the university had 14,500 students in 9 different campuses, including the main one in Trois-Rivières. About 788 of them come from overseas, from 50 countries. The university has given more than 88,000 diplomas since its founding. The Trois-Rivières campus also holds a large library with about 400,000 documents.

==History==
UQTR was created in 1969 with the merger of the &quot;Centre d&#x27;Études universitaires de Trois-Rivières&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;école normale d&#x27;État Maurice Duplessis&quot; (named after Maurice Duplessis). The first major campus, Ringuet, was opened in 1973 and is located in the vicinity of Des Forges and Des Récollets boulevards near downtown Trois-Rivières. Over the following years, UQTR has expanded outside of the city into several towns in the Centre-du-Québec, Montérégie, Lanaudière, Quebec and Chaudière-Appalaches regions.
Over the 1973-2009 time period the university has enjoyed a period of long term growth punctuated by several periods of short term fluctuation.

===2005 student protests===
During the 2005 student protests, students narrowly voted in early March for a three-day student strike whose period included March 16, when several hundred UQTR students participated in a general protest in Montreal. Two days later, the students narrowly voted for a return to class. However, due to complaints made by some student groups, the students and some instructors boycotted again about a week later. During the first boycott, some instructors reported to work to teach classes as scheduled. Groups called &quot;commandos&quot; patrolled the Trois-Rivières area in search of these instructors who failed to honour the pickets, enticing them to stay away from UQTR during the boycott.

=== 2024 disappearance of Alexandra Martine Diengo Lumbayi ===
On October 2, 2024, Alexandra Martine Diengo Lumbayi, a 21-year-old Congolese UQTR international student went missing near Saint-Quentin Island. Search efforts began on October 4–5, involving divers, local police, and an SQ helicopter. On October 7, a slipper and bracelet suspected to be hers were recovered for DNA testing. Her body was found on October 8 in a marina near Saint-Quentin Island.

==Programs==

===Medicine===
Since 2004, the University of Montreal Faculty of Medicine has operated a satellite campus of its medical school at UQTR. The preclinical years are simulcast with the respective classes in Montreal, and the two clinical years are completed in the Centre hospitalier régional de Trois-Rivières (CHRTR) and the Centre hospitalier du centre de la Mauricie (CHCM). The degree is granted by the University of Montreal.

In 2007, the construction of a new medical education pavilion began, which was completed in 2010.

===Podiatry===
In fall of 2004, UQTR launched the first podiatry program in Canada. Upon obtaining all 195 university credits, students are awarded with a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree; thus, this makes UQTR the first French-language university in the world to offer the DPM degree. The foundation of this program was based on the American definition of podiatric medicine and was developed in association with the New York College of Podiatric Medicine. The program enrols 25 students per year.

===Chiropractic===

UQTR is home to the first public and the first university-based chiropractic school in North America. The program is limited to 47 admissions per year.

===Athletic therapy===
UQTR is home to the first French-speaking graduate athletic therapy program in North America. This applied Master program is limited to 25 admissions per year. The program is accredited by the Canadian Athletic Therapists Association since 2017.

===Midwifery===
UQTR is the only university in Quebec offering a midwifery program. It welcomes up to 24 students per year since its implementation in 1999.

===Engineering===
Students can choose to specialize in the following disciplines: chemical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering.
==Hydrogen==
UQTR hosts the Institute for Hydrogen Research (IHR), established in 1994. The mission of IHR is to advance energy transition through innovation in advanced materials, engineering, and safety. The vision of the IHR is fundamentally multidisciplinary: the research areas encompasses basic Sciences, Engineering, and Social Sciences. The object is to promote the energy transition and train a skilled and versatile workforce capable of innovating in Energy and Materials.

==Sports==
The university is represented in Canadian Interuniversity Sport by the UQTR Patriotes which has teams in swimming, golf, hockey, soccer, cheerleading, badminton, athleticism and volleyball.

<doc id="505391" wikidata="Q846735" url="?curid=505391" title="Nationwide Building Society">
<text>Nationwide Building Society is the largest retail bank in the United Kingdom (by number of branches), and the world&#x27;s largest building society, serving over 16 million members. It operates as a British mutual financial institution, meaning it is owned by and run for the benefit of its members. Nationwide is also the seventh largest cooperative financial institution globally. The Society&#x27;s headquarters are located in Swindon, England.

Nationwide Building Society was established through the amalgamation of approximately 250 smaller building societies over its history. Among the most notable mergers were the acquisition of Anglia Building Society in 1987 and the Portman Building Society in 2007. As of 2022, Nationwide ranked as the second largest provider of household savings and mortgages in the UK, holding a 10.3% market share in current accounts.

For the financial year 2021/2022, Nationwide had assets of around £272.4 billion compared to £483 billion for the entire building society sector, making it larger than the remaining 42 British building societies combined.

It is a member of the Building Societies Association, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and Co-operatives UK.

==History==
The Society&#x27;s origins lie in the Co-operative Permanent Building Society, founded in January 1884. Based at New Oxford House, High Holborn, it changed its name in 1970 after deciding to leave the British Co-operative Union. The new name &#x27;Nationwide&#x27; was put to a member vote, with members voting 135,675 to 15,585 in favour.

In 1987, the Northampton-based Anglia Building Society merged with Nationwide. The new society was known as Nationwide Anglia Building Society at first, but the Anglia name was dropped in 1991. In 1992, Nationwide moved its head office to Nationwide House, Pipers Way, Swindon. It had been operating a computer centre and administrative office in the town since 1974 and head office departments had been gradually migrating to Swindon.

Nationwide launched an early UK internet banking service on 27 May 1997.

In 1999, Nationwide, together with various UK tabloid newspapers and media, launched a campaign against controversial cash machine fees. The campaign reached a peak when Barclays Bank announced a plan to charge all customers of rival banks and financial providers, including those of Nationwide, £1 for every cash machine withdrawal made from a Barclays-owned cash machine. This prompted Nationwide to warn Barclays that it would take legal action against the bank if it did not back down. Nationwide claimed Barclays had broken the rules of the LINK network of cash machines, which the bank had joined earlier in the year. The following year, withdrawals from most cash machines owned by UK banks were made free for customers of all banks and building societies throughout the UK.

=== 2000 – 2010 ===
In 2007, Nationwide members voted at its Annual General Meeting to donate at least 1% of pre-tax profits to charitable activities each year. Nationwide completed a merger with Portman Building Society on 28 August 2007, creating a mutual body with assets of over £160 billion and around 13 million members. Portman&#x27;s earliest component was the Provident Union Building Society founded in Ramsbury, Wiltshire in 1846.

In the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the Nationwide acted to safeguard the mutual sector, acquiring the ailing Cheshire and Derbyshire building societies in September 2008, followed by the Dunfermline Building Society on 30 March 2009.

On 24 March 2009, Nationwide Building Society opened a direct savings branch in Dublin, Ireland called Nationwide UK (Ireland), to distinguish it from the unconnected and now-defunct Irish Nationwide Building Society. It ceased all operations in the Irish Republic in 2017.

=== 2010 – 2020 ===
In 2012, the Society announced that it would integrate the Cheshire, Derbyshire and Dunfermline building Societies into Nationwide. The Societies had operated under their own brands as divisions of the Society. The rebranding of each business was phased, with the Dunfermline first to be merged in June 2014. The Cheshire and Derbyshire followed in October and November 2014 respectively.

On 22 May 2015, it was announced that the Society&#x27;s chief executive, Graham Beale, intended to retire. On 16 November 2015, Nationwide announced that Joe Garner, CEO of Openreach, would succeed Graham as Nationwide CEO in Spring 2016. Joe Garner joined the Society as chief executive on 5 April 2016.

In May 2016, the Society confirmed that it would be closing its subsidiary on the Isle of Man, Nationwide International, following a review of its business. The branch, based in Douglas, provided a range of offshore savings accounts in euro, pound sterling and US dollars. It held assets in excess of £2.76 billion as at 31 March 2008, increasing to £3.69 billion by 31 March 2009, making it one of the largest deposit takers in the Isle of Man. Nationwide confirmed it would close on 30 June 2017.

On 1 October 2016, Carillion began providing services for Nationwide&#x27;s headquarters in Swindon, &#x27;specifically aligned to Nationwide&#x27;s sustainability strategy&#x27;. This contract was expected to be worth approximately £350 million, building on an existing partnership of nearly nine years. When Carillion went into liquidation in January 2018, Nationwide took on 297 staff previously employed by the contractor.

In April 2017, the Society confirmed that it would be closing its subsidiary on the Republic of Ireland, Nationwide UK (Ireland), following a review of its business. Its branch at 13 Merrion Row, Dublin 2 closed on 31 May 2017. The remainder of the business closed at the end of the year.

Nationwide announced it would be building a new community at Oakfield in Swindon working in partnership with Swindon Borough Council. Planning permission for the 239 houses was granted in 2019. The homes were planned to be EPC A rated and built on a not-for-profit model. In 2021 the development won the ‘Building for a Healthy Life’ prize as part of the Housing Design Awards.

=== 2020s rebrand and proposed acquisition of Virgin Money ===
In March 2022, Kevin Parry replaced David Roberts as chairman; and in June 2022, Debbie Crosbie, who had been CEO of TSB Bank, succeeded Joe Garner, as chief executive.

In October 2023 Nationwide Building Society committed to its biggest rebrand since 1987, replacing its iconic &#x27;village&#x27; icon. The move was part of a wider commitment to maintain a High Street presence as many banks continue to close branches. All 605 branches were to receive investment to enable the building society to protect face-to-face customer interactions.

On 7 March 2024 Nationwide announced that they had made an offer to buy Virgin Money UK for £2.9 billion. Under the terms of the deal the resulting company would be rebranded under the Nationwide banner over the next 6 years with the Virgin Money brand eventually disappearing. Nationwide intends to remain as a building society and for the &quot;medium-term&quot; the Virgin Money business would remain its own legal entity with its own banking licence. Nationwide aims to not make any material changes to Virgin Money&#x27;s 7,300 employees &quot;in the near term&quot;. Virgin Money currently issue Scottish bank notes under the Clydesdale Bank branding.

Virgin Money&#x27;s shareholders approved the deal on 22 May and it is expected to complete by the end of the year. On 31 May, the Competition and Markets Authority said that they would be investigating the proposed merger regarding the potential lessening of competition within the banking sector in the UK. On 19 July, the Competition and Markets Authority approved the acquisition. On 1 October, Nationwide completed its acquisition of Virgin Money, meaning one in three people in the UK have a connection to Nationwide.

Nationwide reported a £2.3 billion gain from its acquisition of Virgin Money, though its profits declined. Pre-tax profit dropped to £568 million for the six months to September, down from £989 million, partly due to its £100 Fairer Share Payment and competitive savings rates. CEO Debbie Crosbie noted that future profits from Virgin Money would benefit customers. Virgin Money&#x27;s profit rose to £558 million, driven by cost cuts. Richard Branson, Virgin Money&#x27;s founder, made £724 million from the deal, which includes £310 million for Nationwide&#x27;s use of the Virgin Money brand for up to six years.

==Mutual status==
Nationwide is committed to staying mutual and is keen to emphasise that it has members rather than shareholders.

Nationwide was by far the largest British building society that did not convert to a bank in the wave of demutualisations that occurred from the late 1980s to the late 1990s.

In 1998 society members seeking a windfall, branded as carpetbaggers by the UK media, required Nationwide members to vote on whether to demutualise the society and float on the London Stock Exchange. The attempt failed, despite media reports of possible pay-outs to members of around £1,000 to £1,500 each, as Nationwide members voted by a narrow margin of 1,135,587 to 1,101,887 (majority 33,700) against converting the building society into a bank.

Society members again proposed a resolution in 2001 for another vote by Nationwide members to demutualise the society to a bank. The resolution was rejected by the Nationwide board on legal grounds.

==Controversies==
In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08, executive pay practices came under increasing scrutiny at Nationwide as in the rest of the financial sector. The Building Society Members&#x27; Association began to campaign against acceptance of remuneration reports at AGMs in 2009, and with the CEO&#x27;s compensation rising 45% to £2.25 million by 2012 the board&#x27;s levels of pay attracted criticism in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

Nationwide has also had to pay out over £473 million of compensation to customers for the mis-selling of Payment protection insurance (PPI).
Nationwide had to scrap its intentions to pursue a digital business current account in April 2020, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The society has said the pandemic had driven down the medium-term interest rates, which the society believed had made the project unviable. Nationwide committed to return the £50M grant from the Banking Competition Remedies scheme, which distributes funding that Royal Bank of Scotland was ordered to set aside as a condition of its 2009 bailout. The project is estimated to have cost members £70 million, but Nationwide have said that all staff working on the project will be redeployed elsewhere. It still provides some business savings accounts.

When restrictions were lifted following the COVID-19 pandemic, Nationwide stated that its office-based staff could choose whether to work from home or return to the office. From April 2024 employees were required to come into the office for two days per week.

In June 2023, Nationwide launched its Fairer Share initiative to redistribute profits back to its members but figures reported in the media suggested only 21% of Nationwide’s 16 million members would get a pay-out in its first year. The policy called into question whether the society&#x27;s banking status now takes precedence over its advertised claims to offer fair member benefits as a building society .

In April 2024 the Advertising Standards Authority took action to ban a misleading advert by Nationwide that claimed it was not closing branches which was contrary to what the authority had found. There is no readily available information published as to why a Nationwide branch in the High Road in Tottenham closed down without replacement in the same area. The closure was verified by the Nationwide in the summer of 2024. 
Nationwide Building Society provides financial services both directly, and through 686 branches (as of 2023). Nationwide is a major provider of both mortgage loans and savings in the UK, as well as personal banking such as loans, credit cards, bank accounts and insurance products.

==Financial performance==
For the 2015/2016 Preliminary Results (April 2015–April 2016), underlying profits were up 9% to £1.337 billion, while statutory profits rose by 23% to £1.279 billion. Cost income ratio was 53.9%. Common Equity Tier 1 and leverage ratios improved to 23.2% and 4.2%. Gross and net lending were at £32.6 billion and £9.1 billion respectively. Nationwide helped 57,200 people buy their first home. Member deposits increased by £6.3 billion.

==Credit rating==
Nationwide&#x27;s long-term credit rating, as of the second half of 2022, was A1 with Moody&#x27;s, A+ with Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and A+ with Fitch Ratings.

<doc id="505392" wikidata="Q385381" url="?curid=505392" title="Ray Tabano">
<text>Ray Tabano (a.k.a. Crazy Raymond) (born December 23, 1946) is an American musician, who was a founding member of the rock band Aerosmith in 1970.

==Career==
Tabano was a founding member of the rock band Aerosmith, but was replaced by Brad Whitford in 1971, after which he managed the band&#x27;s office, hangout, and recording studio, known as The Wherehouse. Tabano started the band&#x27;s fan club and line of merchandise, designing and selling merchandise himself and writing the band&#x27;s fan club newsletters. He was fired in 1979, by Aerosmith&#x27;s managers Steve Leber and David Krebs.

===Steven Tyler===

Tabano was a childhood friend of Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler in their hometown of Yonkers in New York. The two founded Tyler&#x27;s first music band, The Strangeurs.

===The Strangeurs===

Originally called the Strangers, the Strangeurs added a &quot;u&quot; to their name to avoid confusion with another band called the Strangers. The band consisted of Ray Tabano on bass guitar, Steven Tyler on drums, Green Mountain Boys member Don Soloman on keyboards and vocals, Peter Stahl on guitar, Alan Strohmayer on bass, and Barry Shapiro on drums. The Strangeurs played in the local area as a cover band. The band focused on Top 40 hits and earned a steady wage as a party band around the New England area.

===Post-Aerosmith===
As of September 2009, Tabano was running a catering company in Yonkers, New York.

In 2014, Tabano was featured on an episode of &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;, where he sold two prototype Aerosmith tour T-shirts to Rick Harrison. One was signed by the band; the other had both Tyler&#x27;s and Tabano&#x27;s names on the sizing tag. Tabano originally asked $3000 for both shirts. After having them appraised, however, he reduced his asking price to about $2400, and Harrison bought them for $1100.

In 2018, Tabano was featured on an episode of &quot;American Pickers&quot;, where he authenticated an International Harvester Metro Van as having been used by Aerosmith in the early days of the band&#x27;s career. The van was purchased by the show&#x27;s Mike Wolfe for $25,000, after which the van was restored on behalf of the band, who then bought it back.

<text>The Irish Bulletin was the official gazette of the government of the Irish Republic. It was produced by the Department of Propaganda during the Irish War of Independence. and its offices were originally located at No. 6 Harcourt Street, Dublin. The paper&#x27;s first editor was Desmond FitzGerald, until his arrest and replacement by Erskine Childers. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; appeared in weekly editions from 11 November 1919 until the time of ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922.

==Genesis==
In April 1919, Terence MacSwiney proposed the establishment of a daily paper by the Dáil for the purpose of publicity. His suggestion was not implemented until November, when &#x27;Desmond Fitzgerald decided that some form of printed counter-propaganda was vital to republican aims and to take advantage of the success of Sinn Féin and the increasing international interest in Ireland&#x27;. Fitzgerald succeeded Laurence Ginnell in the Ministry following the latter&#x27;s arrest in April 1919, though he did not take up the position until July. At a Cabinet meeting held on 7 November, there was agreement that there should be &quot;A scheme for daily news bulletin to foreign correspondents, weekly lists of atrocities; entertainment of friendly journalists approved, and £500 voted for expenses under Mr. Griffith&#x27;s personal supervision.&quot; Four days later the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot; made its début, in a run consisting of just thirty copies. Five issues of the bulletin were issued each week for the next two years, despite efforts by the British authorities to suppress it.

==Personnel and contributors==
In the early days, the paper was produced mainly by Frank Gallagher and Robert Brennan. Brennan, as Sinn Féin&#x27;s Director of Publicity since April 1918, had played a leading role in that party&#x27;s success in the 1918 General Election.

Following Fitzgerald&#x27;s arrest in 1921, Erskine Childers was appointed Director of Propaganda taking charge of publicity and thus becoming the paper&#x27;s new editor.
On 9 May 1921, both Childers and Gallagher were arrested and taken to Dublin Castle. Following the intervention of &#x27;Andy&#x27; Cope, both were released that night and &#x27;went on the run&#x27;. The hasty release of the two led to speculation between Art O&#x27;Brien and Michael Collins that there was a rift developing between the British military authorities and the civil administration. Despite the arrests, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; &#x27;continued to appear on schedule&#x27;.
Alan J. Ellis, a journalist with the &quot;Cork Examiner&quot; made occasional contributions to the paper. Kathleen Napoli McKenna was &#x27;a key force behind the daily news-sheet.

==Content==
In the early days, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; consisted mainly of lists of raids by the security forces and the arrests of suspects. In order to stimulate interest, this was expanded in 1921 at the behest of the Irish President in his direction to Childers to give more detailed accounts of events. Extracts from foreign publications, particularly sympathetic English papers, were frequently included. A regular feature was accounts from the Dáil Courts, which were reported in detail. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; was more graphic in its coverage of violence than was usual for its time. An example was its reporting on the deaths of two prominent Sinn Féin leaders, Henry and Patrick Loughnane, from Shanaglish, Gort, County Galway. The men had been handed over by the Royal Irish Constabulary to local members of the Auxiliary Division.

On Dec 6th, the bodies were found in a pond. The skulls were battered in and the flesh was hanging loose on both bodies.The two men were evidently tied by the neck to a motor lorry and dragged after it until they were dead. Before the bodies were hidden in a pond an effort was made to burn them.
==Counterfeit edition==
On the night of 26–27 March 1921, the offices of the Irish Bulletin were discovered by the British authorities. Captured typewriters and duplicators were used to fabricate bogus issues of the paper. These were distributed to the usual subscribers using lists found at the office. Lord Henry Cavendish-Bentinck MP on receiving some of the counterfeit papers through the post, asked in the House that those responsible &#x27;not (to) waste their money in sending me any more of their forgeries.&#x27; The initial efforts of the forgers, Captains Hugh Pollard and William Darling were of poor quality and easily identified as counterfeit.

<text>Ong Teng Cheong (22 January 1936 – 8 February 2002) was a Singaporean politician, architect, and union leader who served as the fifth president of Singapore from 1993 to 1999. He was the first directly elected president in Singapore&#x27;s history. 

Born in the Straits Settlements, Ong was educated at the University of Adelaide and studied architecture. He later received a Colombo Plan scholarship and graduated from the University of Liverpool with a master&#x27;s degree in urban planning.

Prior to his presidency, he was a member of the governing People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP). Ong served as Chairman of the PAP between 1981 and 1993, after Toh Chin Chye stepped down from the position in 1981. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kim Keat Single Member Constituency between 1972 and 1991 and the Kim Keat division of Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency between 1991 and 1993, after the constituency was absorbed into the GRC. His ministerial positions included Minister for Communications between 1978 and 1981, Minister for Labour between 1981 and 1983, and Deputy Prime Minister between 1985 and 1993. During his tenure in Parliament, Ong was known for being the main advocate behind the construction of an extensive rail network in the country, known as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), the largest construction project in Singapore&#x27;s history.

In 1993, Ong resigned from the PAP and his ministerial positions to contest in the 1993 presidential election, winning 58.7% of the vote. Ong was nicknamed the &quot;People&#x27;s President&quot; and he was sworn in on 1 September 1993 as the fifth president of Singapore. He decided not to run for a second term as president in 1999, in part due to the death of his wife. He was succeeded by S. R. Nathan on 1 September 1999. Ong died in his sleep from lymphoma at his Dalvey Estate residence in Tanglin on 8 February 2002, at the age of 66.

==Early life and education==

Ong was born on 22 January 1936 to Ong Keng Wee and Chung Lai Heng in the Straits Settlements (present-day Singapore), the second of five children from a middle-class family. His English-educated father Ong Keng Wee felt that the Chinese language was important if one ever wanted to become successful in business at the time and thus sent all of his children to Chinese-medium schools. 

Ong graduated with distinctions from The Chinese High School in 1955. Having received a Chinese-language education, Ong saw little opportunity for advancing his studies in the University of Malaya, as English was the university&#x27;s language medium.

In 1956, with the help of his father&#x27;s friends, Ong ventured abroad. Those years were to shape both his beliefs and passions. Ong studied architecture at the University of Adelaide along with his childhood sweetheart and future wife, Ling Siew May. Both Ong and Ling met each other during a Christmas party while they were still studying in secondary school.

In 1965, Ong received a Colombo Plan scholarship to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in urban planning at the University of Liverpool and graduated in 1967.

==Career==
Upon graduation, Ong worked as an architect in Adelaide, Australia, and married Ling in 1963. Ong and his wife occasionally recite Chinese poetry and verses they learnt during their younger days.

In 1967, Ong joined the Ministry of National Development (MND) as a town planner. After four years of civil service, Ong resigned in 1971, and started his own architectural firm, Ong &amp; Ong Architects &amp; Town Planners, with his wife.

==Political career==
===MP and Minister===
Ong&#x27;s political career spanned 21 years. He was a Member of Parliament (MP), Cabinet minister and Deputy Prime Minister, before he resigned to become the first elected President of Singapore in 1993.

Ong&#x27;s political beginnings started when he got involved in the grassroots activities in Seletar and was then introduced to Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) subsequently fielded him as a PAP candidate contesting in Kim Keat SMC during the 1972 general election. 

====Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)====

His first political appointment came just three years later when he was appointed Senior Minister of State for Communications. At that time, he was notable for pushing for an extensive rail network in the country, now known as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), the largest construction project in Singapore&#x27;s history. During his tenure as Minister for Communications, Ong continued to be a proponent and advocate of the MRT system, often coming at odds with his fellow political colleagues who were against such an idea. He was subsequently appointed Second Deputy Prime Minister in 1985.

The origins of the MRT was first derived from a forecast by the country&#x27;s planners back in 1967 which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system by 1992. However, opposition from the government on the feasibility of the MRT from prominent ministers, among them Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Trade and Industry Minister Tony Tan, nearly shuttered the programme due to financial grounds and concerns of jobs saturation in the construction industry. 

Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, Ong came to the conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country. Ong was an architect and town planner by training and through his perseverance and dedication became the main figure behind the initial construction of the system. Ong and other pro-rail advocates eventually won the argument, with the MRT being given the go-ahead in May 1982.

===Secretary-General of the NTUC===
====Replacing Lim Chee Onn====
In 1983, Ong succeeded Lim Chee Onn as Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). Historically, the non-communist trade unions, led by the NTUC, have had a &quot;uniquely cosy relationship&quot; with the PAP government in &quot;a tripartite system&quot; and were key political allies to the PAP&#x27;s securing of power in the 1960s. Though in 1982, Lim Chee Onn, still the secretary-general, had &quot;proclaimed effusive[ly]&quot; that the &quot;PAP and the NTUC came from the same mother—the struggle with the communists and the colonialists,&quot; the relations between the unions and the government had become more strained by the 1980s.

Older grassroots union leaders had been excluded from decisions in the top NTUC leadership, which, by the analysis of Michael Barr, had come to be dominated by &quot;de facto&quot; appointed PAP technocrats foreign to the grassroots labour movement. Lee Kuan Yew felt that Lim, although his &quot;protégé&quot;, was not &quot;progressing well&quot; in the &quot;process of meshing in the [elite] scholars and the professionals with the rank-and-file union leaders&quot; in NTUC, causing &quot;increasing disquiet&quot; among the grassroots union leaders. Lim himself had been preceded by Devan Nair, founder of the NTUC and a well-known democratic socialist member of the PAP&#x27;s Old Guards, and Phey Yew Kok, a powerful union leader who was instrumental in convincing Chinese unions to join the NTUC during the 1970s, but had been forced to resign in 1980 and fled the country in a corruption scandal.

However, the leadership style of Lim and other newer top NTUC leaders had increasingly alienated elements of the union grassroots. The United Workers of Petroleum Industry (UWPI) and NTUC Triennal Delegates&#x27; Conference publicly opposed the government&#x27;s attempts to make house unions the norm, to the political chagrin of Lee Kuan Yew.

In an open letter, Lee Kuan Yew informed Lim that he would leave the NTUC to &quot;take charge of a Government ministry&quot; and that &quot;Ong Teng Cheong [will] take over from you as secretary general&quot;.

According to Barr, though the position of Secretary-General is &quot;routinely occupied by members of Cabinet&quot;, Ong &quot;stood out&quot;: Ong was Minister for Labor, Chairman of the PAP and &quot;regarded as a potential successor to Lee Kuan Yew&quot;.

====Implicit pact with unions====
Ong made many grounds in repairing the strained relationship between the unions and the government where Lim had failed. After a few months as secretary-general, &quot;he confronted the rebellious leadership of UWPI&quot; where &quot;they quickly reversed their opposition to house unions&quot;, and in 1985 the Triennial Delegates Conference endorsed the government&#x27;s push for house unions. Barr writes, &quot;Ong had a mastery of institutional power&quot;.

Although striking was prohibited and trade unions were barred from negotiating such matters as promotion, transfer, employment, dismissal, retrenchment, and reinstatement, issues that &quot;accounted for most earlier labour disputes&quot;, the government generally provided measures for workers&#x27; safety and welfare since the 1960s and serious union disputes with employers were almost always handled through the Industrial Arbitration Court, which had powers of both binding arbitration and voluntary mediation. However, the grassroots leaders in the unions had become increasingly worried about their marginalisation in Singapore politics. Peter Vincent, President of the NTUC from 1980 to 1984, stated that PAP technocrats should &quot;remain in advisory positions [in the NTUC] until they have gained the respect of the union movement&quot;. In response, Ong &quot;increased the levels of consultation with his colleagues in the NTUC&quot; and &quot;reversed the trend of excluding grassroots leaders from the upper reaches of the NTUC&quot;.

Ong was also a ferocious union activist, &quot;working actively and forcefully in the interests of the unions in a way that Lim had never seen to do&quot; and &quot;stretch[ing] union activism to the very limits of that which would be tolerated by the government&quot;; Barr argues that this activism would have been impossible to tolerate had anyone else less trusted than Ong had been charge of the NTUC. In the implicit pact, the unions would, in return, co-operate with the &quot;government&#x27;s core industrial relations strategies&quot;.

In January 1986, Ong sanctioned a strike in the shipping industry, the first for about a decade in Singapore, believing it was necessary as &quot;[the] management were taking advantage of the workers&quot;. However, he did not inform the Cabinet beforehand out of fear that the Cabinet would prevent him from going ahead with the strike. Ong recalled in a 2000 interview in &quot;Asiaweek&quot;: &quot;Some of them were angry with me about that... the Minister for Trade and Industry was very angry, his officers were upset. They had calls from America, asking what happened to Singapore?&quot; Minister for Trade and Industry Tony Tan, vigorously opposed Ong Teng Cheong&#x27;s decision to sanction the strike, being concerned with investors&#x27; reactions to a perceived deterioration of labour relations or an impact on foreign direct investment needed for jobs creation. Ong Teng Cheong viewed the strike as a success: &quot;I had the job to do... [the strike] only lasted two days. All the issues were settled. It showed the management was just trying to pull a fast one.&quot;

According to Barr, Ong justified his commitment &quot;in Confucian terms&quot; in a &quot;notion akin to &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;&quot;.

====Demonstration at the United States Embassy====
As Secretary-General of the NTUC, Ong also organised a 4,000-strong demonstration at the United States Embassy in protest against the United States First Secretary E. Mason Hendrickson&#x27;s encouragement of dissident lawyers to stand for election against the PAP.

===Presidency===
Ong became Singapore&#x27;s first elected president in 1993 and was &quot;ex officio&quot; appointed Chancellor of the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University. 

Ong&#x27;s presidency was marked by many charitable projects—the largest of which is the President&#x27;s Star Charity, an annual event initiated by Ong. It has benefited many charities, arts groups and youth organisations. He famously stepped up on stage to perform a piano recital of Teresa Teng&#x27;s famous song The Moon Represents My Heart in his final year as President with Mediacorp artistes Evelyn Tan and Kym Ng singing to the tune. Ong stepped down as president at the age of 63. 

Ong ran for the presidency under the PAP&#x27;s endorsement. He ran against Chua Kim Yeow, former Accountant-General, for the office. A total of 1,756,517 votes were polled. Ong received 952,513 votes while Chua had 670,358 votes despite the former having a higher public exposure and a much more active campaign than Chua.

However, soon after his election to the presidency in 1993, Ong was tangled in a dispute over the access of information regarding Singapore&#x27;s financial reserves. The government said it would take 56-man-years to produce a dollar-and-cents value of the immovable assets. Ong discussed this with the accountant-general and the auditor-general and eventually conceded that the government could easily declare all of its properties, a list that took a few months to produce. Even then, the list was not complete; it took the government a total of three years to produce the information that Ong requested.

In an interview with &quot;Asiaweek&quot; six months after stepping down from the presidency, Ong indicated that he had asked for the audit based on the principle that as an elected president, he was bound to protect the national reserves, and the only way of doing so would be to know what reserves—both liquid cash and assets—the government owned.

In the last year of his presidency, Ong found out, through the newspapers, that the government aimed to submit a bill to Parliament to sell the Post Office Savings Bank to The Development Bank of Singapore Limited. The POSB was a government statutory board whose reserves were under the president&#x27;s protection; the move according to Ong, was procedurally inappropriate and did not regard Ong&#x27;s significance as the guardian of the reserves; he had to call and inform the government of this oversight. Still, the sale proceeded, and The Development Bank of Singapore Limited still owns the Post Office Savings Bank.

Ong was appointed as Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in 1998.

Ong decided not to run for a second term as president in 1999 partially because of the illness and subsequent death of his wife. He was succeeded by S. R. Nathan. In his farewell speech on 30 August 1999, he stated

==Death==
Ong died in his sleep from lymphoma on 8 February 2002, at the age of 66, at his residence in Dalvey Estate at Tanglin at about 8:14pm Singapore Standard Time (UTC+08:00) after he had been discharged from hospital a few days earlier. 

Prior to his death, Ong had asked to be cremated and for the ashes to be placed at Mandai Columbarium with those of ordinary citizens instead of Kranji State Cemetery, where late dignitaries are usually buried. Despite being a former President, Ong was given a &quot;state-assisted funeral&quot;, but not an actual state funeral. In a reply to Leong Sze Hian by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Press Secretary, Chen Hwai Liang said that the decision to offer a state funeral lies with the prime minister and his Cabinet, after which they would take the family&#x27;s wishes into consideration.

As a mark of respect, state flags at all government buildings were flown at half-mast, including the Istana, on 11 February instead of on 12 February, the day of Ong&#x27;s funeral, to avoid state flags being flown at half-mast on the first day of Chinese New Year.

==Legacy==
Ong was also known as &quot;The People&#x27;s President&quot;, as he was the first president to be directly elected by Singaporeans.

<doc id="505405" wikidata="Q1249731" url="?curid=505405" title="Meru Betiri National Park">
<text>Meru Betiri National Park is a national park in the province of East Java, Indonesia, extending over an area of 580 km2 of which a small part is marine (8.45 km2). The beaches of the park provide nesting grounds for endangered turtle species such as leatherback turtles, hawksbill turtles, green turtles, and olive ridley turtles.

==Geography and climate==
Meru Betiri National Park has a varied topography reaching from a plain coast to highlands with an altitude of almost . The tallest mountains within the park are Mount Gamping (538 m), Mount Butak (609 m), Mount Sukamade Atas (801 m), Mount Gendong (840 m asl), Mount Mandilis (844 m) and Mount Betiri (1,192 m). The topography along the coast is generally hilly to mountainous. There are only a few sandy plain coasts, most of them located in the west, such as Rajegwesi Beach, Sukamade Beach, Permisan Beach, Meru Beach, and Bandealit Beach. Some rivers across Meru Betiri NP are the Sukamade River, a perennial river, the Permisan River, the Meru River, and the Sekar Pisang River which flows to the South coast.

The Meru Betiri area is influenced by monsoon wind. From November to March, the westerly wind brings rainfall to the area, whereas the dry season occurs from April to October.
The average annual rainfall is between 2300 and , with 4 dry months and 7 wet months on average.

==Vegetation==

As a result of its diverse topography, Meru Betiri NP contains five distinct vegetation types:
* Coastal vegetation is found around Sukamade Bay and Meru Bay. This vegetation includes the &quot;Barringtonia asiatica&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;, &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;, &quot;Terminalia catappa&quot;, and &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;.
* Mangrove vegetation is found on the eastern side of Rajegwesi Bay as the outlet of Lembu and Karang Tambak Rivers, Meru Bay, and Sukamade Coast. The dominant vegetations are &quot;Rhizophora&quot;, &quot;Avicennia&quot;, and &quot;Bruguiera&quot;. At the outlet of the Sukamade River, there is &quot;Nypa fruticans&quot;.
* Swamp vegetation is found at the back of the mangrove forest of Sukamade. Some tree species here are &quot;Manilkara kauki&quot;, &quot;Gluta renghas&quot;, &quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot;, and &quot;Sterculia foetida&quot;.
* Lowland tropical rain forest, including among others tree species of &quot;Pterospermum&quot;, &quot;Tetrameles nudiflora&quot;, &quot;Ficus variegata&quot;, &quot;Diospyros cauliflora&quot;, &quot;Aglaia variegata&quot;, &quot;Dracontomelon mangiferum&quot;, &quot;Bischofia javanica&quot;, &quot;Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum&quot;, &quot;Pseudobombax septenatum&quot;, &quot;Litsea&quot;, and &quot;Plectocomia elongata&quot;.
* Rheophytic vegetation is found in the wetland areas, such as at the Sukamade area. The dominant vegetation species here is the &quot;Saccharum spontaneum&quot;.

The rare parasitic plant &quot;Rafflesia zollingeriana&quot; was rediscovered in Meru Betiri NP.

==Fauna==
The park provides habitat for many other protected animals, including 29 species of mammal and 180 species of bird. Among them are the banteng, Javan leopard, wild boar, long-tailed macaque, Sumatran dhole, Javanese flying squirrel, leopard cat, Javan muntjac, and green peafowl. The beaches of the park provide a nesting ground for leatherback turtles, hawksbill turtles, green turtles, and olive ridley turtles.

Meru Betiri National Park is known as the last habitat of the Javan tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris sondaica&quot;) which is now considered extinct, with the last sighting having been recorded in 1976.
Due to research in 1997, tiger paw prints at a size of were found, so the Forestry Ministry agreed to monitor the existence of the Javanese tiger with a camera trap in 2011.

==Conservation==
The Meru Betiri Forest area was first appointed as a protected forest by the Dutch Colonial Government in 1931. In 1972 the Meru Betiri Protected Forest (500 km2) was appointed as a wildlife sanctuary, prioritized for protecting the habitat of the then endangered Javan tiger. In 1982 the sanctuary was expanded to its current extent of 580 km2 including a marine area of 845 ha. In 1982 the sanctuary was declared a National Park, which finally was designated as such in 1997.

<doc id="505416" wikidata="Q1413878" url="?curid=505416" title="Guarneri Quartet">
<text>The Guarneri Quartet was an American string quartet founded in 1964 at the Marlboro Music School and Festival. It was admired for its rich, warm, complex tone and its bold, dramatic interpretations of the quartet literature, with a particular affinity for the works of Beethoven and Bartók. Through teaching at Harpur College (which became Binghamton University), University of Maryland, Curtis Institute of Music, and at Marlboro, the Guarneri players helped nurture interest in quartet playing for a generation of young musicians. The group&#x27;s extensive touring and recording activities, coupled with its outreach efforts to engage audiences, contributed to the rapid growth in the popularity of chamber music during the 1970s and 1980s. The quartet is notable for its longevity: the group performed for 45 years with only one personnel change, when cellist David Soyer retired in 2001 and was replaced by his student Peter Wiley. The Guarneri Quartet disbanded in 2009.

==Musicians==
1st violin
:Arnold Steinhardt (b. Los Angeles, 1 April 1937) Steinhardt is the elder of two sons born to music-loving Polish parents. He began studying the violin at age 6, and when he was 17 he entered Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia as a pupil of Ivan Galamian. Prior to the founding of the Guarneri Quartet, Steinhardt spent four years as assistant concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell; he spent summers at the Marlboro Music Festival and in 1962 he studied in Switzerland with Joseph Szigeti.

:Steinhardt is 6 feet 3 inches tall, and as a result he has unusually long arms, which has made it necessary to adjust his playing posture to avoid pain. He is outgoing and articulate, and has written two books. When touring with the quartet, he liked to browse in antique shops, and he particularly collected old locks. Since the Guarneri’s dissolution he has maintained a blog containing his personal reflections and reminiscences (see External links).

2nd violin
:John Dalley (b. Madison, Wisconsin, 1 June 1936) Dalley’s parents were both musicians, and he started violin lessons at the age of 4. He spent summers at Interlochen National Music Camp, and in his teens he went to Tuscaloosa to study at the University of Alabama with Ottokar Čadek. At 18, he enrolled at Curtis Institute, working with Efrem Zimbalist. Following graduation from Curtis, Dalley taught at Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and later played alongside David Soyer in a group known as the American String Quartet.

:Dalley is thoughtful and affable, with a dry wit and occasional bursts of outright clowning; but he was the most introverted of the Guarneri musicians, often skipping post-concert social events and disappearing immediately after a concert. Dalley is a skilled maker of bows for stringed instruments; he would sometimes carry the necessary equipment on the road, so that he could work on a bow in his hotel room, while the others might be attending a reception following a performance.

Viola
:Michael Tree (b. Newark NJ, 19 Feb 1935; d. New York, 30 Mar 2018) Tree was the son of Samuel Applebaum, a respected violin teacher and the author of several books on technique. He started lessons with his father at age 5, and entered Curtis Institute at the unusually young age of 12. He studied with Leah Luboshutz, Veda Reynolds, and ultimately with Efrem Zimbalist. Following his graduation, Tree made a successful debut at Carnegie Hall and toured internationally as a violin soloist, playing with a number of orchestras. In 1959 he began spending summers at Marlboro, where he met David Soyer and played with him and pianist Anton Kuerti in a group known as the Marlboro Trio.

:Tree was described by Steinhardt as an efficient problem solver, and as &quot;one part musician, one part cutup&quot;, always ready to relieve an overly-intense moment with a joke or some kind of buffoonery. He was the most high-strung member of the quartet, particularly prone to nervousness before performances. An avid tennis player, he liked to play with local experts or with friends while on tour.

Violoncello (1964–2001)
:David Soyer (b. Philadelphia, 24 Feb 1923; d. New York, 25 Feb 2010) Soyer was, by about 12 years, the oldest of the original members of the quartet, and his pre-Guarneri experience was more extensive. The only one in the group who was not trained at Curtis, Soyer studied cello with Diran Alexanian, Emanuel Feuermann, and Pablo Casals. During World War II, he played euphonium in the United States Navy Band. Following the war, he played cello as a member of the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini, Columbia Symphony Orchestra, the Ed Sullivan Show orchestra, and various groups that recorded jingles and commercials. He played with several chamber music ensembles before the Guarneri: the Guilet and New Music Quartets, the short-lived American Quartet with John Dalley, and the Marlboro Trio with Michael Tree and Anton Kuerti.

:In rehearsals, Soyer was outspoken and forceful; Steinhardt describes him as &quot;blunt and highly opinionated&quot;. Soyer considered that his experiences performing commercial music helped him grow as an artist, and firmly believed that young musicians should be exposed to dance music, folk music, and gypsy fiddling. He was a connoisseur of art, and an avid sailor who owned a 24-foot sloop.

Violoncello (2001–2009)
:Peter Wiley (b. Utica NY, 1955) Wiley grew up in central New York State, and at age 11, he started cello lessons with David Soyer during the time the Guarneri Quartet was in residence at Harpur College in Binghamton. When Soyer joined the faculty of Curtis Institute in 1968, Wiley enrolled there and continued his cello studies. Graduating in 1974, he played with the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Cincinnati Symphony before joining the Beaux Arts Trio to replace retiring cellist Bernard Greenhouse. He left the Beaux Arts in 1998 to co-found the Opus One Piano Quartet. When Soyer retired from the Guarneri in 2001, Wiley was quickly and unanimously chosen to succeed his mentor.

==Instruments==
Despite the group&#x27;s name, only one instrument made by the celebrated Guarneri family of Cremona was played for any significant time by a member of the quartet: for many years David Soyer used an Andrea Guarneri cello made in 1669. He later switched to a Gagliano cello made in Naples in 1778. After trying several violins (including a Guarneri), Steinhardt settled on a Cremona instrument made by Lorenzo Storioni in the late 18th century. Dalley plays a French violin made in 1810 by Nicholas Lupot. In the quartet&#x27;s early years Tree played a viola (patterned after Andrea Guarneri&#x27;s &quot;Conte Vitale&quot;) made by Harvey Fairbanks, a luthier from Binghamton, New York. Later, his primary instrument became a 1750 viola made by Dominicus Busan of Venice; he also plays a modern instrument made by Hiroshi Iizuka. Wiley plays a cello made around 1700 by Matteo Goffriller of Venice.

At one point in the mid-1990s the quartet was offered the extended loan of a set of four rare Stradivarius instruments owned by the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. After considering the offer, the Guarneri musicians declined, preferring to play the instruments each had chosen for himself. Steinhardt has compared the task of finding a violin well matched to a performer&#x27;s style to that of finding a spouse, and he adds, &quot;After much trial and error, each of us has found what could aptly be called his musical soul mate.&quot;

==History and activities==
Steinhardt, Dalley, Tree and Soyer coalesced into the Guarneri Quartet at the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Marlboro VT, where all of them spent summers during the early 1960s. During the summers of 1962 and 1963, the four played chamber music together in various permutations, and with encouragement from Festival director Rudolf Serkin and from Alexander Schneider (second violinist of the Budapest String Quartet) the new quartet was launched on 20 July 1964 with a concert at Nantucket, Massachusetts. The name Guarneri was suggested by Boris Kroyt (violist of the Budapest String Quartet), who had played with a short-lived group of that name in Germany before World War II.

In the fall of 1964, the quartet began a four-year residency at Harpur College (now known as Binghamton University) in Binghamton, New York, where they taught advanced students, held a series of open rehearsals, and played 15 public concerts per year. Steinardt relates that the group found the situation attractive because Binghamton was within driving distance of their base in New York City, and it would provide an opportunity to rapidly build a repertoire, gain performing experience, and develop working relationships among themselves.

The Guarneri&#x27;s New York City debut took place on 28 February 1965 at the New School for Social Research as part of a concert series arranged by Alexander Schneider. The enthusiastic audience included Fritz Steinway, of the concert management firm Judson, O’Neill, Beall and Steinway (which would shortly become the group&#x27;s manager) and Max Wilcox, a record producer for RCA Victor, who quickly secured a recording contract for the Guarneri. Soon afterward, the group replaced the retiring Budapest String Quartet in a series of concerts at the Metropolitan Museum of Arta series that extended across the Guarneri&#x27;s lifespan, ending only when the quartet disbanded in 2009. They appeared at the Mostly Mozart Festival beginning in 1966, and an ongoing series at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Alice Tully Hall began in 1975. Other frequent New York venues included the Frick Collection, the 92nd Street Y, Rockefeller University and Washington Irving High School.

The Guarneri began touring almost immediately, with a concert in Cleveland on 20 April 1965. In the summer of that year they embarked upon their first European tour, performing in Geneva, Basel, Amsterdam, Cologne, and at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. As the quartet&#x27;s reputation grew, both domestic and international tours became a way of lifeoften a grueling one. In the early years they played as many as 130 concerts per year, although by the 1980s they were attemptingnot always successfullyto limit their appearances to 100 per year.

While the members of the quartet unanimously and emphatically preferred live performances to studio recordings, they were, from the beginning, prolific recording artists. Their first session for RCA Victor took place in June 1965, and included quartets by Mozart, Dvořák and Mendelssohn. By 1998 the Guarneri&#x27;s catalog exceeded 50 LPs and CDs, including numerous recordings with pianist Arthur Rubenstein. A partial discography can be found below.

The Guarneri musicians were active in teaching throughout the quartet&#x27;s life. The affiliation with Harpur College continued until 1968, and in that year Steinhardt, Tree and Soyer were appointed to the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. The members continued summer teaching at Marlboro, and in 1983, all four were appointed artists-in-residence at the University of Maryland at College Park, where they continued teaching up to and beyond the formal dissolution of the Guarneri Quartet in 2009.

David Soyer, who was about a dozen years older than his colleagues, retired in 2001, and his place was taken by Peter Wiley, Soyer&#x27;s former student. The transition was symbolized in a Carnegie Hall concert that year, in which the Guarneri performed the Beethoven Quartet in B-flat major, op. 130, with Soyer playing cello, followed by the String Quintet in C by Schubert, with Soyer and Wiley taking the two cello parts. The incorporation of Wiley as cellist was a smooth one: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like the new guy,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I was a fan of the quartet since I was 11 years old…It was a very natural transition for me.&quot; Dalley added &quot;It was actually very good for us when Peter came in, even though the quartet field was new to him…I think I learned more from Peter than he learned from us. He had a lot of good ideas that were brand new to us.&quot;

The members of the quartet decided to disband at the end of the 2009 season, with the intention of going out on a high note. Steinhardt remarked on the difficulty of their work, and added &quot;We all had the sense that we&#x27;re still playing pretty well, and it&#x27;s better to quit at that point than to go past our time. We had surprisingly little discussion; everybody came to that conclusion rather quickly.&quot; Critics agreed that it was time to bow out; while still praising the Guarneri&#x27;s tone and style, they perceived increasing technical imperfections and a decrease in the intensity of the group&#x27;s emotional connection with the music. For some of the final concerts, David Soyer rejoined the Guarneri as the group once again played the Schubert Quintet in C, which is scored for two cellos.

David Soyer died on 25 February 2010, and Michael Tree died on 30 March 2018. As of 2018, the other Guarneri musicians continue to teach and perform under their own names.

==Musical style and repertoire==

The Guarneri&#x27;s musical style was distinctive and widely admired. It has been described as &quot;suave, elegant, highly nuanced, technically flawless&quot;, as &quot;lush and vibrant sound married to an intensity of purpose&quot;, and as &quot;seamless, warm and impassioned playing [with] a unanimity that did not efface individual personalities.&quot; Philadelphia critic Daniel Patrick Stearns remarked that:
Audiences kept coming back for the warmth of tone that was built from the inside out, with an unusually strong presence from second violin and viola, but with soft attacks and releases. Steinhardt&#x27;s leaner tone defined that cloud of sound with a laserlike precision.

The quartet took a dramatic, even rambunctious approach to performing music; Steinhardt called it &quot;swashbuckling and boisterous&quot; when contrasting it with the Orion String Quartet, whose style he admiringly described as &quot;refined and thoughtful.&quot; In another context he stated that &quot;our top priority is to try and deliver the essence of the music and create goosebumpsgive a performance that will be as memorable and vital and energetic as possible. I&#x27;d like to think we set caution slightly to the side in favor of emotional impact.&quot; The high-voltage performance style mellowed somewhat as the group matured; in a 2009 review of the quartet&#x27;s performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Quartet in E-flat, op. 127, Oregon critic David Stabler reported:
Instead of the feel of discovery, freshness and unpredictability, we heard more tempered playing. Instead of sharpness and strength in the opening of the E-Flat Quartet, the soft-pedaled sounds suggested a different way of engaging with the music. Less about surprise and urgency, more about knowing and acceptance. For the Guarneri, it was ground well trodden.

Many quartets strive to present a clean and cohesive tone, working to coordinate phrasing, bowing and intonation so as to create the sense of a single instrument with four registers. David Blum notes that the Guarneri explicitly followed a different path:
They readily admit that other quartets look for and achieve a more consistent blend of timbre and unity of style. They enter into the music’s expressive stream and let it work upon them, even if, in so doing, an occasional rough edge appears. Their goal is always to communicate the music as a living experience.
In a similar vein, Dalley expressed the Guarneri musicians’ intent as follows:
[Y]ou heard four individual voices rather than four people trying to play alike. We liked to stand out individually in the quartet rather than play in a unified way. We wanted to have our own personalities come through rather than be submissive.
Tree agreed:
I think in view of many of our colleagues we&#x27;ll be best known for never making a fuss about playing the same bowings. Some players would come backstage and wonder if we were fighting, because our bowings were different. We were unorthodox from the beginning, having a strong notion that we should play as best we can individually in our own comfort zone in terms of bowings and fingerings and so forth.

In its early years, the Guarneri&#x27;s repertoire focused primarily on music of 18th and 19th century composers, and they became particularly known for their interpretations of Beethoven’s quartets. However, by the 1980s the quartet was incorporating more music from the 20th century in its programs. The musicians took a selective approach to modern musicthey were not enthusiastic about what Tree called &quot;very experimental, avant-garde music&quot; and they had mixed feelings about Schoenberg and Shostakovichbut they became champions of the quartets of Bartók and their repertoire eventually included music by Webern, Berg, Stravinsky, Vincent Persichetti, Paul Hindemith, Witold Lutosławski, Hans Werner Henze, Leon Kirchner, and William Klenz. Several original compositions were written for the group, by Ned Rorem, Lukas Foss, Mario Davidovsky, and Richard Danielpour. The group also made a point of performing seldom-heard quartets by earlier composers, including those of Jean Sibelius, Leoš Janáček, Zoltán Kodály, and Juan Crisóstomo de Arriaga.

==Group dynamics==
Unlike most performing ensembles, the Guarneri permitted, and even encouraged, public awareness of their work as they prepared concerts, and they allowed backstage glimpses of the interpersonal dynamics within the group. From the beginning they conducted &quot;genuine&quot; open rehearsals, in which audiences could listen as they argued over the best way to play a passage or whether a piece they were considering ought to become part of their repertoire. They frequently held interactive sessions with audiences and they regularly made themselves available for interviews by journalists and writers. On several occasions they allowed observers to travel with the quartet and to publish detailed accounts of their activities onstage, in rehearsal, and during their travel time and free hours. In addition, Arnold Steinhardt published a book of memoirs in 1998 under the title &quot;Indivisible by Four: A String Quartet in Search of Harmony&quot; (see Resources). As a result of all this, a good deal is known about the way the group worked, musically and psychologically.

From the beginning, the Guarneri members rejected the then-common notion that the first violinist was the leader of the ensemble. The group insisted that all of the players were equals, and as a symbol of this, determined that whenever a piece called for one violin (for example, a piano quartet), second violinist John Dalley would play that part unless he chose not to do so. Similarly, all decisions were to be made by the group as a wholeand since four is an even number, that stance guaranteed a great deal of discussion when two members favored one option and two others preferred a different one. Dalley expressed the group&#x27;s position as follows:You have to be able to bend or give up some of your ideas. If you don&#x27;t compensate and give in and compromise, you just don&#x27;t get along. I think we had four strong personalities, and that&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s one way for a quartet to mature. The other way is to have a dictator who rules over the other three. That&#x27;s the way it was in Europe, but Americans don&#x27;t like that. It works faster, but the democratic way is more satisfying.

Thus the Guarneri&#x27;s rehearsals were marked by vigorous give-and-take, with disagreements frequent and forcefully expressed. No point was too small for debate: in musical notation, a dot over a note means that it should be played staccato, and Steinhardt describes one public rehearsal in which the group argued for 20 minutes over precisely how much shortening one particular staccato-marked note ought to have. In general majority opinions prevailed, but a minority voice was listened to, and occasionally when one member had extremely strong feelings on a matter, he was allowed veto power. When the group&#x27;s decision process hit a deadlock, they would sometimes play the passage one way for a Monday concert and a different way on Tuesday. The players came to accept and expect the constant flow of criticism without resentment, and the rehearsals were also laced with friendly banter and corny jokes. But praise was almost never expressed; Steinhardt describes the Guarneri as a &quot;compliment-free zone,&quot; noting that this reduced competitiveness and eliminated any pressure to offer congratulations in return.

However, the frequency and intensity with which the players had to work together forced them to adopt measures to preserve their individual identities and maintain some degree of personal privacy. They seldom socialized outside of concert-related events, and while touring they often made independent travel and hotel arrangements. They would frequently split up during off days while on tour, and consciously avoided asking about the activities of the others. The musicians maintained a firewall between the quartet&#x27;s activities and their family lives, and summers were protected as Guarneri-free time.

The devices the players used to resolve problems and maintain their personal privacy, combined with their genuine fondness for each other and for the music they played, made possible an unusually long life for the quartet. The four original musicians performed together for 37 consecutive years, &quot;a remarkable record of longevity for a string quartet, in which tensions over music making, money and personal differences often cause breakups.&quot; After Soyer retired, the group continued, with Wiley playing cello, for another 8 years, bringing the Guarneri&#x27;s total life to 45 years with only one personnel change. The quartet&#x27;s longevity, along with the readily-available material about the group&#x27;s interpersonal dynamics, has made it possible for the Guarneri to be used as a model in studies and pedagogy regarding collaborative leadership.

==Cultural impact==
There were only about a dozen American string quartets in 1964 when the Guarneri was born. Just 16 years later, there were over 250. While that growth cannot be attributed to any single cause, the Guarneri is frequently cited as a significant force assisting the boom. For one thing, the members’ active work as teachers increased student interest in playing string quartets. One need look no further than Peter Wiley, who began his cello studies with Soyer, to see an example. The group&#x27;s teaching at Harpur, at University of Maryland, and particularly at Marlboro and Curtis certainly helped young musicians to develop an appetite for quartet music. James Reel quotes a Curtis student&#x27;s thoughts:
&quot;There was always an excitement in the air at Curtis when they were about to show up,&quot; recalls Lucy Chapman Stoltzman, who studied particularly with Steinhardt, often in lessons lasting more than two hours…&quot;It was the pure beauty of their sound and legato, and the sense of the inner voices was so strong, the sense of every voice being important in the way you want it to be,&quot; she says. &quot;The Guarneri brought it to some new level that I hadn&#x27;t heard before.&quot;

Another way in which the Guarneri facilitated the growth of interest in playing chamber music was through the example they set. In the early 1960s, music students aspired primarily to careers as soloists or orchestral musicians. The four Guarneri players took a substantial financial risk by establishing themselves as a professional string quartet in the absence of bookings, recording contracts, concert management, or even certainty of sufficient public interest. In the wake of their success, however, other musicians have been able to launch new quartets with more confidence that they can make a living playing chamber music, and by commanding significant fees, the Guarneri raised the payment baseline for all string quartets.

Finally, the Guarneri helped to build public awareness of chamber music, and thus increase demand for it. Their eagerness to communicate with their audiences, their interviews, open rehearsals, question-and-answer sessions all helped to make string quartets less esoteric, more familiar to listeners. Helen Drees Ruttencutter put it this way:
They are said to have done for quartet music in America what Leonard Bernstein did for symphonic music – made it accessible and appealing to everyone open to a new musical experience. Audiences get a quadruple dose of what many managers consider one of the most important elements for a career in music: charisma. They have been hailed all over the world as &quot;the Great American Quartet of the era&quot; and &quot;the greatest string quartet in the world.&quot;

<text>Alas Purwo National Park is situated on Blambangan Peninsula in the Banyuwangi Regency, at the southeastern tip of East Java province. The park is famous for its wild Banteng and surfing location at Grajagan Bay.

The park&#x27;s name means &quot;first forest&quot; or &quot;ancient forest&quot;, following a Javanese legend that says the earth first emerged from the ocean here.

==Geography==
The park is located in Blambangan Peninsula at the southeastern tip of Java island, along the shore of the strait across Bali.

With an area of 434 km2, the park is made up of mangroves, savanna, lowland monsoon forests, and coral-fringed beaches. An internationally renowned surf break peels along the edge of the park at Plengkung on Grajagan Bay. Mount Linggamanis (322m) is also located in this national park.

==Flora and fauna==
The flora protected in this national park include &quot;Terminalia catappa&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;, &quot;Sterculia foetida&quot;, &quot;Barringtonia asiatica,&quot; and &quot;Manilkara kauki&quot;.

It is home to some of Java’s endangered species, such as the banteng (&quot;Bos javanicus&quot;). In April 2004, there were only 57 bantengs found in the savanna of Sadengan, while the population in the previous year was estimated to be 80 to 100, but in August 2010, the scientists found 73 bantengs in the 80-hectare savanna area, a big increase in 6 years, although they faced threats of poaching and loss of habitat. Herds of bantengs usually come to Sadengan in the morning and afternoon in search of plants.

The biggest threat to the bantengs are humans. Poachers set traps outside the park during the dry season to snare bantengs wandering outside the park in search of water. The bantengs are slaughtered and the meat is sold.

Other threatened animal species protected in Alas Purwo include the dhole, Javan langur, green peafowl, red junglefowl, olive ridley, hawksbill turtle, and green turtle.

==Surfing==

Between the months of March and November, thousands of surfers from all over the world visit the park for its surf break. The destination is Plengkung Beach in Grajagan Bay, also known as G-Land, which is about half a day&#x27;s travel from Bali.

The beach is considered one of the best surfing spots in Asia. With rideable waves up to 5 meters, it is considered a spot for experienced surfers only. The place is listed as Quicksilver World Tour Circuit.

<text>Ribonuclease H (abbreviated RNase H or RNH) is a family of non-sequence-specific endonuclease enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of RNA in an RNA/DNA substrate via a hydrolytic mechanism. Members of the RNase H family can be found in nearly all organisms, from bacteria to archaea to eukaryotes.

The family is divided into evolutionarily related groups with slightly different substrate preferences, broadly designated ribonuclease H1 and H2. The human genome encodes both H1 and H2. Human ribonuclease H2 is a heterotrimeric complex composed of three subunits, mutations in any of which are among the genetic causes of a rare disease known as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome. A third type, closely related to H2, is found only in a few prokaryotes, whereas H1 and H2 occur in all domains of life. Additionally, RNase H1-like retroviral ribonuclease H domains occur in multidomain reverse transcriptase proteins, which are encoded by retroviruses such as HIV and are required for viral replication.

In eukaryotes, ribonuclease H1 is involved in DNA replication of the mitochondrial genome. Both H1 and H2 are involved in genome maintenance tasks such as processing of R-loop structures.

==Classification and nomenclature==
Ribonuclease H is a family of endonuclease enzymes with a shared substrate specificity for the RNA strand of RNA-DNA duplexes. By definition, RNases H cleave RNA backbone phosphodiester bonds to leave a 3&#x27; hydroxyl and a 5&#x27; phosphate group. RNases H have been proposed as members of an evolutionarily related superfamily encompassing other nucleases and nucleic acid processing enzymes such as retroviral integrases, DNA transposases, Holliday junction resolvases, Piwi and Argonaute proteins, various exonucleases, and the spliceosomal protein Prp8.

RNases H can be broadly divided into two subtypes, H1 and H2, which for historical reasons are given Arabic numeral designations in eukaryotes and Roman numeral designations in prokaryotes. Thus the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; RNase HI is a homolog of the &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; RNase H1. In &quot;E. coli&quot; and many other prokaryotes, the &quot;rnhA&quot; gene encodes HI and the &quot;rnhB&quot; gene encodes HII. A third related class, called HIII, occurs in a few bacteria and archaea; it is closely related to prokaryotic HII enzymes.

== Structure ==

The structure of RNase H commonly consists of a 5-stranded β-sheet surrounded by a distribution of α-helices. All RNases H have an active site centered on a conserved sequence motif composed of aspartate and glutamate residues, often referred to as the DEDD motif. These residues interact with catalytically required magnesium ions.

RNases H2 are larger than H1 and usually have additional helices. The domain organization of the enzymes varies; some prokaryotic and most eukaryotic members of the H1 group have an additional small domain at the N-terminus known as the &quot;hybrid binding domain&quot;, which facilitates binding to RNA:DNA hybrid duplexes and sometimes confers increased processivity. While all members of the H1 group and the prokaryotic members of the H2 group function as monomers, eukaryotic H2 enzymes are obligate heterotrimers. Prokaryotic HIII enzymes are members of the broader H2 group and share most structural features with H2, with the addition of an N-terminal TATA box binding domain. Retroviral RNase H domains occurring in multidomain reverse transcriptase proteins have structures closely resembling the H1 group.

RNases H1 have been extensively studied to explore the relationships between structure and enzymatic activity. They are also used, especially the &quot;E. coli&quot; homolog, as model systems to study protein folding. Within the H1 group, a relationship has been identified between higher substrate-binding affinity and the presence of structural elements consisting of a helix and flexible loop providing a larger and more basic substrate-binding surface. The C-helix has a scattered taxonomic distribution; it is present in the &quot;E. coli&quot; and human RNase H1 homologs and absent in the HIV RNase H domain, but examples of retroviral domains with C-helices do exist.

== Function ==
Ribonuclease H enzymes cleave the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in a double-stranded RNA:DNA hybrid, leaving a 3&#x27; hydroxyl and a 5&#x27; phosphate group on either end of the cut site with a two-metal-ion catalysis mechanism, in which two divalent cations, such as Mg2+ and Mn2+, directly participate in the catalytic function. Depending on the differences in their amino acid sequences, these RNases H are classified into type 1 and type 2 RNases H. Type 1 RNases H have prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNases H1 and retroviral RNase H. Type 2 RNases H have prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNases H2 and bacterial RNase H3. These RNases H exist in a monomeric form, except for eukaryotic RNases H2, which exist in a heterotrimeric form. RNase H1 and H2 have distinct substrate preferences and distinct but overlapping functions in the cell. In prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, neither enzyme is essential, whereas both are believed to be essential in higher eukaryotes. The combined activity of both H1 and H2 enzymes is associated with maintenance of genome stability due to the enzymes&#x27; degradation of the RNA component of R-loops.

===Ribonuclease H1===

Ribonuclease H1 enzymes require at least four ribonucleotide-containing base pairs in a substrate and cannot remove a single ribonucleotide from a strand that is otherwise composed of deoxyribonucleotides. For this reason, it is considered unlikely that RNase H1 enzymes are involved in the processing of RNA primers from Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. RNase H1 is not essential in unicellular organisms where it has been investigated; in &quot;E. coli&quot;, RNase H1 knockouts confer a temperature-sensitive phenotype, and in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, they produce defects in stress response.

In many eukaryotes, including mammals, RNase H1 genes include a mitochondrial targeting sequence, leading to expression of isoforms with and without the MTS present. As a result, RNase H1 is localized to both mitochondria and the nucleus. In knockout mouse models, RNase H1-null mutants are lethal during embryogenesis due to defects in replicating mitochondrial DNA. The defects in mitochondrial DNA replication induced by loss of RNase H1 are likely due to defects in R-loop processing.

===Ribonuclease H2===

In prokaryotes, RNase H2 is enzymatically active as a monomeric protein. In eukaryotes, it is an obligate heterotrimer composed of a catalytic subunit A and structural subunits B and C. While the A subunit is closely homologous to the prokaryotic RNase H2, the B and C subunits have no apparent homologs in prokaryotes and are poorly conserved at the sequence level even among eukaryotes. The B subunit mediates protein-protein interactions between the H2 complex and PCNA, which localizes H2 to replication foci.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic H2 enzymes can cleave single ribonucleotides in a strand. however, they have slightly different cleavage patterns and substrate preferences: prokaryotic enzymes have lower processivity and hydrolyze successive ribonucleotides more efficiently than ribonucleotides with a 5&#x27; deoxyribonucleotide, while eukaryotic enzymes are more processive and hydrolyze both types of substrate with similar efficiency. The substrate specificity of RNase H2 gives it a role in ribonucleotide excision repair, removing misincorporated ribonucleotides from DNA, in addition to R-loop processing. Although both H1 and H2 are present in the mammalian cell nucleus, H2 is the dominant source of RNase H activity there and is important for maintaining genome stability.

Some prokaryotes possess an additional H2-type gene designated RNase HIII in the Roman-numeral nomenclature used for the prokaryotic genes. HIII proteins are more closely related to the H2 group by sequence identity and structural similarity, but have substrate preferences that more closely resemble H1. Unlike HI and HII, which are both widely distributed among prokaryotes, HIII is found in only a few organisms with a scattered taxonomic distribution; it is somewhat more common in archaea and is rarely or never found in the same prokaryotic genome as HI.

==Mechanism==
The active site of nearly all RNases H contains four negatively charged amino acid residues, known as the DEDD motif; often a histidine e.g. in HIV-1, human or E. coli is also present.

The charged residues bind two metal ions that are required for catalysis; under physiological conditions these are magnesium ions, but manganese also usually supports enzymatic activity, while calcium or high concentration of Mg2+ inhibits activity.

Based on experimental evidence and computer simulations the enzyme activates a water molecule bound to one of the metal ions with the conserved histidine. The transition state is associative in nature and forms an intermediate with protonated phosphate and deprotonated alkoxide leaving group. The leaving group is protonated via the glutamate which has an elevated pKa and is likely to be protonated. 
The mechanism is similar to RNase T and the RuvC subunit in the Cas9 enzyme which both also use a histidine and a two-metal ion mechanism.

The mechanism of the release of the cleaved product is still unresolved. Experimental evidence from time-resolved crystallography and similar nucleases points to a role of a third ion in the reaction recruited to the active site. 
== In human biology ==
The human genome contains four genes encoding RNase H:
* RNASEH1, an example of the H1 (monomeric) subtype
* RNASEH2A, the catalytic subunit of the trimeric H2 complex
* RNASEH2B, a structural subunit of the trimeric H2 complex
* RNASEH2C, a structural subunit of the trimeric H2 complex

In addition, genetic material of retroviral origin appears frequently in the genome, reflecting integration of the genomes of human endogenous retroviruses. Such integration events result in the presence of genes encoding retroviral reverse transcriptase, which includes an RNase H domain. An example is ERVK6. Long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons are also common in the genome and often include their own RNase H domains, with a complex evolutionary history.

===Role in disease===

In small studies, mutations in human RNase H1 have been associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, a common feature of mitochondrial disease.

Mutations in any of the three RNase H2 subunits are well-established as causes of a rare genetic disorder known as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS), which manifests as neurological and dermatological symptoms at an early age. The symptoms of AGS closely resemble those of congenital viral infection and are associated with inappropriate upregulation of type I interferon. AGS can also be caused by mutations in other genes: TREX1, SAMHD1, ADAR, and MDA5/IFIH1, all of which are involved in nucleic acid processing. Characterization of mutational distribution in an AGS patient population found 5% of all AGS mutations in RNASEH2A, 36% in 2B, and 12% in 2C. Mutations in 2B have been associated with somewhat milder neurological impairment and with an absence of interferon-induced gene upregulation that can be detected in patients with other AGS-associated genotypes.

==In viruses==
Two groups of viruses use reverse transcription as part of their life cycles: retroviruses, which encode their genomes in single-stranded RNA and replicate through a double-stranded DNA intermediate; and dsDNA-RT viruses, which replicate their double-stranded DNA genomes through an RNA &quot;pregenome&quot; intermediate. Pathogenic examples include human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus, respectively. Both encode large multifunctional reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins containing RNase H domains.

Retroviral RT proteins from HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus are the best-studied members of the family. Retroviral RT is responsible for converting the virus&#x27; single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA. This process requires three steps: first, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity produces minus-strand DNA from the plus-strand RNA template, generating an RNA:DNA hybrid intermediate; second, the RNA strand is destroyed; and third, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity synthesizes plus-strand DNA, generating double-stranded DNA as the final product. The second step of this process is carried out by an RNase H domain located at the C-terminus of the RT protein.

RNase H performs three types of cleaving actions: non-specific degradation of the plus-strand RNA genome, specific removal of the minus-strand tRNA primer, and removal of the plus-strand purine-rich polypurine tract (PPT) primer. RNase H plays a role in the priming of the plus-strand, but not in the conventional method of synthesizing a new primer sequence. Rather RNase H creates a &quot;primer&quot; from the PPT that is resistant to RNase H cleavage. By removing all bases but the PPT, the PPT is used as a marker for the end of the U3 region of its long terminal repeat.

Because RNase H activity is required for viral proliferation, this domain has been considered a drug target for the development of antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and other conditions caused by retroviruses. Inhibitors of retroviral RNase H of several different chemotypes have been identified, many of which have a mechanism of action based on chelation of the active-site cations. Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors that specifically inhibit the polymerase function of RT are in widespread clinical use, but not inhibitors of the RNase H function; it is the only enzymatic function encoded by HIV that is not yet targeted by drugs in clinical use.

==Evolution==
RNases H are widely distributed and occur in all domains of life. The family belongs to a larger superfamily of nuclease enzymes and is considered to be evolutionarily ancient. In prokaryotic genomes, multiple RNase H genes are often present, but there is little correlation between occurrence of HI, HII, and HIII genes and overall phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer may have played a role in establishing the distribution of these enzymes. RNase HI and HIII rarely or never appear in the same prokaryotic genome. When an organism&#x27;s genome contains more than one RNase H gene, they sometimes have significant differences in activity level. These observations have been suggested to reflect an evolutionary pattern that minimizes functional redundancy among RNase H genes. RNase HIII, which is unique to prokaryotes, has a scattered taxonomic distribution and is found in both bacteria and archaea; it is believed to have diverged from HII fairly early.

The evolutionary trajectory of RNase H2 in eukaryotes, especially the mechanism by which eukaryotic homologs became obligate heterotrimers, is unclear; the B and C subunits have no apparent homologs in prokaryotes.

==Applications==
Because RNase H specifically degrades only the RNA in double-stranded RNA:DNA hybrids, it is commonly used as a laboratory reagent in molecular biology. Purified preparations of &quot;E. coli&quot; RNase HI and HII are commercially available. RNase HI is often used to destroy the RNA template after first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription. It can also be used to cleave specific RNA sequences in the presence of short complementary segments of DNA. Highly sensitive techniques such as surface plasmon resonance can be used for detection. RNase HII can be used to degrade the RNA primer component of an Okazaki fragment or to introduce single-stranded nicks at positions containing a ribonucleotide. A variant of hot start PCR, known as RNase H-dependent PCR or rhPCR, has been described using a thermostable RNase HII from the hyperthermophilic archaeon &quot;Pyrococcus abyssi&quot;. Of note, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein commonly used as a reagent is not effective at inhibiting the activity of either HI or HII.

==History==
Ribonucleases H were first discovered in the laboratory of Peter Hausen when researchers found RNA:DNA hybrid endonuclease activity in calf thymus in 1969 and gave it the name &quot;ribonuclease &quot;H&quot;&quot; to designate its &quot;hybrid&quot; specificity. RNase H activity was subsequently discovered in &quot;E. coli&quot; and in a sample of oncoviruses with RNA genomes during early studies of viral reverse transcription. It later became clear that calf thymus extract contained more than one protein with RNase H activity and that &quot;E. coli&quot; contained two RNase H genes. Originally, the enzyme now known as RNase H2 in eukaryotes was designated H1 and vice versa, but the names of the eukaryotic enzymes were switched to match those in &quot;E. coli&quot; to facilitate comparative analysis, yielding the modern nomenclature in which the prokaryotic enzymes are designated with Roman numerals and the eukaryotic enzymes with Arabic numerals. The prokaryotic RNase HIII, reported in 1999, was the last RNase H subtype to be identified.

Characterizing eukaryotic RNase H2 was historically a challenge, in part due to its low abundance. Careful efforts at purification of the enzyme suggested that, unlike the &quot;E. coli&quot; RNase H2, the eukaryotic enzyme had multiple subunits. The &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; homolog of the &quot;E. coli&quot; protein (that is, the H2A subunit) was easily identifiable by bioinformatics when the yeast genome was sequenced, but the corresponding protein was found not to have enzymatic activity in isolation. Eventually, the yeast B and C subunits were isolated by co-purification and found to be required for enzymatic activity. However, the yeast B and C subunits have very low sequence identity to their homologs in other organisms, and the corresponding human proteins were conclusively identified only after mutations in all three were found to cause Aicardi–Goutières syndrome.

<text>Ronquils (sometimes spelt ronchils) is a small family marine ray-finned fish, the Bathymasteridae. These fishes are found only in Arctic and North Pacific waters. This family contains just seven species in three genera. The larger species are important to commercial fisheries as food fish. Ronquils are most closely related to the eelpouts and prowfish in the suborder Zoarcoidei of the order Scorpaeniformes.

==Taxonomy==
The Bathymasteridae was first proposed as a family in 1883 by the American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies this family within the suborder Zoarcoidei, within the order Scorpaeniformes. Other authorities classify this family in the infraorder Zoarcales within the suborder Cottoidei of the Perciformes because removing the Scorpaeniformes from the Perciformes renders that taxon non monophyletic. The monophyly of the Zoarcoidei has still not been fully ascertained but it is generally accepted that the most basal family is Bathymasteridae.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;ronquil&quot; is said to be an anglicization from the Spanish &quot;ronco&quot;, &quot;ronquillo&quot; being a diminutive, and which means &quot;one who grunts&quot;. The family name &quot;Bathymasteridae&quot; is derived from the type genus &quot;Bathymaster&quot; and this can be translated from the Greek to mean &quot;deep searcher&quot;.

==Genera==
The ronquil family contains seven species divided into three genera as follows:
==Characteristics==
Ronquils have elongate with long dorsal and anal fins which are even in height along all of their length. These fins are separated from the large, truncate to round caudal fin by a clear caudal peduncle. There are between 43 and 49 branched and unbranched rays in the dorsal fin while the anal fin contains between 31 and 36 rays. These ray counts include between 1 and 6 weak, pliant to the front of the dorsal fin and 1 or 2 similar spines in the front of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large and rounded while the pelvic fins are located on the thorax, and have a single spine and 5 soft rays. There is a single pair of nostrils. The scales vary from weakly ctenoid, nearly smooth, to strongly ctenoid. There are sensory pores on the upper head of head and on the cheeks and these are obvious. The lateral line is clearly visible and runs on the upper body, straight to the rear of the dorsal fin, and has between 75 and 105 scales. The roof of the mouth has palatine and vomerine teeth. The bill membrane is separate from the isthmus, in most cases. There is no swim bladder. These fishes may be olive brown to dull red, bluish black, or purplish in their overall colour, they can be marked with bright green, blue, yellow, red, orange, and white bars, spots or other markings. The colour and patterns often vary between populations or be an expression of sexual dimorphism. Ronquins vary in size from a total length of in &quot;Ronquilus jordani&quot; to more over for &quot;Bathymaster signatus&quot;.

==Distribution, habitat and behaviour==
Ronqulis inhabit cold waters in the North Pacific where they have a wide range from Baja California to the Sea of Japan, ronquils are benthic animals, spending most of their time on or near the bottom. These fishes are typically found in shallow coastal waters down to depths of around , however, &quot;Bathymaster signatus&quot; has been taken from depths in excess of in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.

Ronquils feed primarily on small benthic crustaceans and mollusks, and the stomachs of some specimens sampled contained only nudibranch]s. Little is known about predators of ronqulis but it is presumed that most larger carnivores that occur in the same areas as them, especially predatory fishes, will prey on them. Although considered fairly common, ronquils are rarely observed; this is likely owing to their secretive nature.

Few specifics are recorded regarding ronquil spawning, but the males are known to guard the brood. The males have been known to cannibalize some of the eggs they are guarding.

<text>DNA polymerase I (or Pol I) is an enzyme that participates in the process of prokaryotic DNA replication. Discovered by Arthur Kornberg in 1956, it was the first known DNA polymerase (and the first known of any kind of polymerase). It was initially characterized in &quot;E. coli&quot; and is ubiquitous in prokaryotes. In &quot;E. coli&quot; and many other bacteria, the gene that encodes Pol I is known as polA. The &quot;E. coli&quot; Pol I enzyme is composed of 928 amino acids, and is an example of a processive enzyme — it can sequentially catalyze multiple polymerisation steps without releasing the single-stranded template. The physiological function of Pol I is mainly to support repair of damaged DNA, but it also contributes to connecting Okazaki fragments by deleting RNA primers and replacing the ribonucleotides with DNA.

== Discovery ==
In 1956, Arthur Kornberg and colleagues discovered Pol I by using &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;) extracts to develop a DNA synthesis assay. The scientists added 14C-labeled thymidine so that a radioactive polymer of DNA, not RNA, could be retrieved. To initiate the purification of DNA polymerase, the researchers added streptomycin sulfate to the &quot;E. coli&quot; extract. This separated the extract into a nucleic acid-free supernatant (S-fraction) and nucleic acid-containing precipitate (P-fraction). The P-fraction also contained Pol I and heat-stable factors essential for the DNA synthesis reactions. These factors were identified as nucleoside triphosphates, the building blocks of nucleic acids. The S-fraction contained multiple deoxynucleoside kinases. In 1959, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Arthur Kornberg and Severo Ochoa &quot;for their discovery of the mechanisms involved in the biological synthesis of Ribonucleic acid and Deoxyribonucleic Acid.&quot;
== Structure and function ==

=== General structure ===
Pol I mainly functions in the repair of damaged DNA. Structurally, Pol I is a member of the alpha/beta protein superfamily, which encompasses proteins in which α-helices and β-strands occur in irregular sequences. &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA Pol I consists of multiple domains with three distinct enzymatic activities. Three domains, often referred to as thumb, finger and palm domain work together to sustain DNA polymerase activity. A fourth domain next to the palm domain contains an exonuclease active site that removes incorrectly incorporated nucleotides in a 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction in a process known as proofreading. A fifth domain contains another exonuclease active site that removes DNA or RNA in a 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction and is essential for RNA primer removal during DNA replication or DNA during DNA repair processes.

&quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria produces 5 different DNA polymerases: DNA Pol I, DNA Pol II, DNA Pol III, DNA Pol IV, and DNA Pol V.

=== Structural and functional similarity to other polymerases ===
In DNA replication, the leading DNA strand is continuously extended in the direction of replication fork movement, whereas the DNA lagging strand runs discontinuously in the opposite direction as Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerases also cannot initiate DNA chains so they must be initiated by short RNA or DNA segments known as primers. In order for DNA polymerization to take place, two requirements must be met. First of all, all DNA polymerases must have both a template strand and a primer strand. Unlike RNA, DNA polymerases cannot synthesize DNA from a template strand. Synthesis must be initiated by a short RNA segment, known as RNA primer, synthesized by Primase in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction. DNA synthesis then occurs by the addition of a dNTP to the 3&#x27; hydroxyl group at the end of the preexisting DNA strand or RNA primer. Secondly, DNA polymerases can only add new nucleotides to the preexisting strand through hydrogen bonding. Since all DNA polymerases have a similar structure, they all share a two-metal ion-catalyzed polymerase mechanism. One of the metal ions activates the primer 3&#x27; hydroxyl group, which then attacks the primary 5&#x27; phosphate of the dNTP. The second metal ion will stabilize the leaving oxygen&#x27;s negative charge, and subsequently chelates the two exiting phosphate groups.

The X-ray crystal structures of polymerase domains of DNA polymerases are described in analogy to human right hands. All DNA polymerases contain three domains. The first domain, which is known as the &quot;fingers domain&quot;, interacts with the dNTP and the paired template base. The &quot;fingers domain&quot; also interacts with the template to position it correctly at the active site. Known as the &quot;palm domain&quot;, the second domain catalyses the reaction of the transfer of the phosphoryl group. Lastly, the third domain, which is known as the &quot;thumb domain&quot;, interacts with double stranded DNA. The exonuclease domain contains its own catalytic site and removes mispaired bases. Among the seven different DNA polymerase families, the &quot;palm domain&quot; is conserved in five of these families. The &quot;finger domain&quot; and &quot;thumb domain&quot; are not consistent in each family due to varying secondary structure elements from different sequences.

=== Function ===
Pol I possesses four enzymatic activities:

# A 5&#x27;→3&#x27; (forward) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, requiring a 3&#x27; primer site and a template strand
# A 3&#x27;→5&#x27; (reverse) exonuclease activity that mediates proofreading
# A 5&#x27;→3&#x27; (forward) exonuclease activity mediating nick translation during DNA repair.
# A 5&#x27;→3&#x27; (forward) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Pol I operates on RNA templates with considerably lower efficiency (0.1–0.4%) than it does DNA templates, and this activity is probably of only limited biological significance.
In order to determine whether Pol I was primarily used for DNA replication or in the repair of DNA damage, an experiment was conducted with a deficient Pol I mutant strain of &quot;E. coli&quot;. The mutant strain that lacked Pol I was isolated and treated with a mutagen. The mutant strain developed bacterial colonies that continued to grow normally and that also lacked Pol I. This confirmed that Pol I was not required for DNA replication. However, the mutant strain also displayed characteristics which involved extreme sensitivity to certain factors that damaged DNA, like UV light. Thus, this reaffirmed that Pol I was more likely to be involved in repairing DNA damage rather than DNA replication.

== Mechanism ==
In the replication process, RNase H removes the RNA primer (created by primase) from the lagging strand and then polymerase I fills in the necessary nucleotides between the Okazaki fragments (see &quot;DNA replication&quot;) in a 5&#x27;→3&#x27; direction, proofreading for mistakes as it goes. It is a template-dependent enzyme—it only adds nucleotides that correctly base pair with an existing DNA strand acting as a template. It is crucial that these nucleotides are in the proper orientation and geometry to base pair with the DNA template strand so that DNA ligase can join the various fragments together into a continuous strand of DNA. Studies of polymerase I have confirmed that different dNTPs can bind to the same active site on polymerase I. Polymerase I is able to actively discriminate between the different dNTPs only after it undergoes a conformational change. Once this change has occurred, Pol I checks for proper geometry and proper alignment of the base pair, formed between bound dNTP and a matching base on the template strand. The correct geometry of A=T and G≡C base pairs are the only ones that can fit in the active site. However, it is important to know that one in every 104 to 105 nucleotides is added incorrectly. Nevertheless, Pol I can fix this error in DNA replication using its selective method of active discrimination.

Despite its early characterization, it quickly became apparent that polymerase I was not the enzyme responsible for most DNA synthesis—DNA replication in &quot;E. coli&quot; proceeds at approximately 1,000 nucleotides/second, while the rate of base pair synthesis by polymerase I averages only between 10 and 20 nucleotides/second. Moreover, its cellular abundance of approximately 400 molecules per cell did not correlate with the fact that there are typically only two replication forks in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Additionally, it is insufficiently processive to copy an entire genome, as it falls off after incorporating only 25–50 nucleotides. Its role in replication was proven when, in 1969, John Cairns isolated a viable polymerase I mutant that lacked the polymerase activity. Cairns&#x27; lab assistant, Paula De Lucia, created thousands of cell free extracts from &quot;E. coli&quot; colonies and assayed them for DNA-polymerase activity. The 3,478th clone contained the polA mutant, which was named by Cairns to credit &quot;Paula&quot; [De Lucia]. It was not until the discovery of DNA polymerase III that the main replicative DNA polymerase was finally identified.

== Research applications ==

DNA polymerase I obtained from &quot;E. coli&quot; is used extensively for molecular biology research. However, the 5&#x27;→3&#x27; exonuclease activity makes it unsuitable for many applications. This undesirable enzymatic activity can be simply removed from the holoenzyme to leave a useful molecule called the Klenow fragment, widely used in molecular biology. In fact, the Klenow fragment was used during the first protocols of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification until &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;, the source of a heat-tolerant &quot;Taq&quot; Polymerase I, was discovered in 1976. Exposure of DNA polymerase I to the protease subtilisin cleaves the molecule into a smaller fragment, which retains only the DNA polymerase and proofreading activities.

<text>The Penobscot River (Abenaki: &quot;Pαnawάhpskewtəkʷ&quot;) is a river in the U.S. state of Maine. Including the river&#x27;s West Branch and South Branch increases the Penobscot&#x27;s length to , making it the second-longest river system in Maine and the longest entirely in the state. Its drainage basin contains .

It arises from four branches in several lakes in north-central Maine, which flow generally east. After the uniting of the West Branch with the East Branch at Medway (), the Penobscot flows south, past the city of Bangor, where it becomes navigable. Also at Bangor is the tributary Kenduskeag Stream. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Penobscot Bay. It is home to the Penobscot people that live on Indian Island, and considered to be The People&#x27;s lifeblood.

==History==

===Norumbega===
Most historians have accepted the Penobscot region as Jean Allefonsce&#x27;s source for Norumbega, though the matter was hotly contested by some nineteenth century antiquarians, who argued that the name should be identified with their own river or region.

===Navigation===
The Penobscot River was an early trade corridor to interior Maine from the Atlantic coast. Ocean ships could navigate upstream to Bangor. The cities of Rockland, Belfast, Brewer and Bangor, and the towns of Rockport, Camden, Northport, Searsport, Stockton Springs, Castine, Bucksport, Frankfort, Winterport, Orrington, and Hampden developed adjacent to the Penobscot River estuary. The river upstream of Bangor became an important transportation corridor for log driving to bring wooden logs and pulpwood from interior forests to sawmills and paper mills built to use water power where the city of Howland and the towns of Veazie, Orono, Old Town, Milford, Passadumkeag, West Enfield, Lincoln, Winn, Mattawamkeag, Medway, and Millinocket developed.

===European colony===
The first European known to have explored the river in 1524 was Estêvão Gomes, a Portuguese navigator who sailed in the service of Spain in the 1520s. The Spaniards, led by Gomez, were the first Europeans to make landfall in what is now Maine, followed by the Frenchman Samuel de Champlain in 1605. A few years later French Jesuit priests came among the Penobscot people as missionaries and converted them to Catholicism. The French settlement of Pentagouet, now Castine, was founded at the point where the river becomes Penobscot Bay, and the Penobscot people made a permanent settlement at Indian Old Town, Maine on an island above the head of navigation, around the Catholic mission. Throughout the first half of the 17th centuries, these were likely the only permanent settlements on the river, although the Penobscots considered the entire river and bay their hunting ground and maintained other seasonal villages along its banks.

In 1669, the Mohawk made several raids from the west that were very destructive to the Penobscot people. During Father Rale&#x27;s War, New England settlers from Massachusetts also sent periodic raiding parties to the Penobscot, destroying the primary native village in 1723. In a treaty of 1752, however, Massachusetts laid claim to the entire Penobscot watershed, and in 1759 the Pownall Expedition, led by Governor Thomas Pownall, established Fort Pownall on Cape Jellison in what is now Stockton Springs. This signaled the end of French influence over the Penobscot, and the incorporation of the Penobscot River valley into New England.

===British colony===
The first permanent settler from British North America on the river was Joshua Treat (1726–1802), who was initially the armorer and translator at Fort Pownall. His oldest son, Joshua Treat, Jr., built a log house and sawmill at Marsh Bay in what is now Frankfort, and other members of their extended family, joined by additional settlers from Massachusetts and New Hampshire, pushed ever further up-river, eventually restricting the Penobscot people to Indian Island (Old Town, Maine), the present Penobscot Indian Reservation.

===American Revolution and modern history===

During the American Revolutionary War, the river and bay were the site of the disastrous 1779 Penobscot Expedition, where an entire American fleet was destroyed in a botched attempt to retake Maine from the British. During the War of 1812, the British again invaded Maine and defeated an American force at the Battle of Hampden, sacking the town of Bangor in the process. To prevent this from happening a third time, and because the nearby boundary between the United States and British Canada was still contested into the 1840s, the Federal government in 1844 began constructing a huge granite fort, Fort Knox, opposite the town of Bucksport, near the mouth of the river. The fort never fired a shot in anger, but remains one of the Penobscot&#x27;s major man-made landmarks.

In the 19th century the river was a conduit for the transport of logs from Maine&#x27;s Great North Woods, to be sawed into lumber at mills around Old Town and Orono, and transported on ships from Bangor, at the head of tide. (The average high tide at Bangor is as of 2009.) A secondary economic use made of the river late in the century was as a source of sawed ice for urban markets.

In 1931 the Waldo-Hancock Bridge was opened to carry US Route 1 across the river at the Penobscot Narrows between Prospect, in Waldo County, and Verona Island just below Bucksport.

During the 20th century, lumbering was largely supplanted by papermaking, in the form of large wood pulp and paper mills located all along the river from Millinocket and East Millinocket in the north, to South Brewer and Bucksport in the south. Wood pulp and paper mills create dioxins as a byproduct of the chlorine bleaching process in making paper. This substance was discharged from seven mills located close to the Tribal community of Penobscot people, along the Penobscot river. Dioxins, which are highly potent toxic chemicals that may cause cancer and other health problems, were being poured daily into this adjacent river, the Penobscot. Rebecca Sockbeson, a Penobscot, is quoted saying that her people have survived on fish from this river, but &quot;now we are dying from it.&quot; She continued on to say that &quot;neither dioxin nor cancer is indigenous to the Penobscot people, however they are both pervasive in my tribal community.&quot; As an Indigenous community trying to maintain traditional subsistence living and eating such as fishing or foraging, their way of life and their physical bodies are unequally burdened by issues of water quality and pollution. The health and survival of the Penobscot people is further threatened by the impact that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have on reproduction and the health of their children. The 2015 collaborative report, The Penobscot River and Environmental Contaminants: Assessment of Tribal Exposure Through Sustenance Lifeways, confirms through a four-year quantitative study that these unequal burdens and harmful level of toxins are very real threats and realities faced by the community&#x27;s indigenous people. Sockbeson concludes that a treaty is required to ensure that &quot;the breast and spoon we feed our babies with is not filled with cancer, diabetes, learning disabilities, and attention deficit [disorder].&quot;

Paper making was an industry which was responsible for a large amount of the contamination in the Penobscot River. The problem was traced back to HoltraChem, a chemical plant located in Orrington, Maine HoltraChem was responsible for producing many of the chemicals used in papermaking, such as chlorine and mercury. Beginning in 1967, HoltraChem dumped up to 13 tons of mercury into the Penobscot river rather than safely disposing of the chemicals. These chemicals were dumped both legally and illegally, resulting in mass contamination of the river. HoltraChem was the company behind 11 massive chemical spills into the Penobscot River in only 12 months, from 1998 to 1999. Because the Penobscot Tribe is a river based tribe, their culture is directly tied to the River which has become polluted. Through hunting, trapping, fishing, and many other traditional practices, the culture is sustained. Without the continuation of these activities, their culture will begin to become lost. Due to the pollution of the Penobscot river, the waterways, plants, and environment which the nation relies on for their way of life have become contaminated. The Penobscot Nation dates back to more than 9,500 years, and because of the constant pollution, their way of life is soon to be lost. 
June Sapiel, an activist and member of the Penobscot Nation, is quoted describing the importance of the river, saying &quot;Our water is sacred. That was our highways and our byways... It&#x27;s our relative.&quot; Pollution has been gathering in the Penobscot River for at least 150 years, making the consumption of various fish toxic to those who eat them, such as members of the Penobscot nation. In 1987, recommendations for limited fish consumption were given to the Penobscot Nation. It is recommended that members of the Penobscot Nation eat no more than a single serving of fish from the Penobscot River each month.

The development of cheap hydropower also attracted other types of light manufacturing, like textiles and shoes.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, with the continuing decline of the Maine paper industry, and the divestiture of its woodlands, the Penobscot watershed has become more and more associated with recreational use (fishing, hunting, boating, and tourism) and less with manufacturing. 

In 2001, the Old Town Paper Mill won a case against the Penobscot Nation, under the Maine Freedom Access Act, where they were given access to documented tribal correspondence with the EPA in regards to the regulations of water quality. It was announced in 2007 that a study would be conducted by the EPA in regards to the Penobscot river system. This study would examine the levels of contamination from PCBs, mercury, and dioxin in various culturally important species.

In 2006 the Waldo-Hancock Bridge was closed and replaced by the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, a 2,120 foot long, $85,000,000 structure with 135 feet between the water and the bridge&#x27;s deck, and the original bridge was subsequently demolished in 2013. A bridge observatory in the support tower on the Waldo County side 420 feet above the surface of the river is open to the public, the only bridge observatory in the United States, and only one of four bridge observatories in the world. The two 447 foot tall granite towers of the bridge are patterned after the Washington Monument which had been largely built with granite quarried from nearby Mt. Waldo.

As part of the Penobscot River Restoration Project, several dams were modified or removed to improve river conditions. Demolition began on the Great Works Dam in 2012, and the Veazie Dam in 2013. A fish ladder was installed at Milford Dam. A fish bypass was installed at Howland Dam. This led to an increase in the number of Atlantic Salmon, Shad, and other fish species in the river.

The Old Town Paper Mill, located in Old Town, Maine, has had a long history of environmental issues. The mill has a long history of environmental concerns and has been cited for numerous violations of environmental regulations, including air and water pollution, hazardous waste management, and chemical spills. The mill has also been the subject of numerous citizen complaints and legal actions over the years.
On October 7th, 2020, it was discovered that the Nine Dragons (ND) Paper Mill in Old Town, Maine had spilled chemicals into the Penobscot River. The spill was discovered after elevated pH levels were discovered in the water, in which ND decided to investigate further. It was found that over 30,000 gallons of chemicals, which were used for pulping, had spilled into the river due to a ruptured sewer line. ND Paper Mill reported the spill to the Department of Environmental Protection who assisted in cleanup and repairs to the damaged sewer line. The DEP conducted an investigation into the incident, and found that the spill was caused by a failure in the mill&#x27;s equipment. It was also found that the mill had failed to properly train employees on the correct way to handle and store hazardous materials. The spill occurred when a pipeline carrying a mixture of chemicals, including hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide, ruptured, releasing an estimated 15,000 gallons of the mixture into the Penobscot River. The spill created a large plume of foam and smoke, and local residents reported a strong chemical odor in the air. The spill was leaking into the Penobscot river from approximately September 29th to October 7th 2020. It was also noted that the leak was occurring intermittently for about 56 days during 2021 before being discovered. In response to the issue, ND Paper replaced multiple failed floor drains and about 400 feet of steel piping for the sewer system. Since these issues, the company has decided to complete more routine maintenance and inspections in order to prevent future occurrences. Alongside routine inspections, shut-off valves were installed along with alarms to detect the flow of any chemicals which might come through. Finally, unused pipes were sealed off, as they were helping the chemicals to flow through into the river. While ND Paper has taken steps to improve its environmental performance since the spill, concerns remain about its impact on the environment and the local community. The Penobscot River is an important resource for fishing, boating, and a food source, and the spill posed a threat to the river&#x27;s ecosystem. The chemicals released in the spill can cause significant harm to aquatic life, and can also contaminate drinking water supplies. The spill also had a significant impact on the local economy, as many businesses rely on the river for their livelihoods. The lasting effects that this spill has had on the Penobscot Nation has caused them to lose one of their main food sources, as it has been recommended that less fish be consumed from the river.

The introduction of mercury into the Penobscot River is extremely dangerous and was described as &quot;imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment,&quot; as this watershed is a main source of shellfish and fish alike. Mercury is a neurotoxin which is extremely dangerous to ingest, especially for young, developing children or fetuses. Because of this, the elderly, children, and pregnant women must be extremely careful about ingesting anything which could potentially contain mercury. 
A court ordered study was completed by the company Mallinckrodt, which over the course of nine years found that the Penobscot River had levels of mercury which were up to 20 times higher than the surrounding areas. From this study, high levels of mercury were detected in wildlife as well, such as ducks, fish, and snapping turtles. Because of these extremely high levels of mercury which were discovered, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), recommend that members of the Penobscot Indian Nation, (PIN), limit consumption of fish and snapping turtles caught in the river to 1-2 meals per month. Due to this recommendation, the overall consumption rates of fish have decreased for the Penobscot Nation The pollution of the Penobscot River has taken a very large toll on the amount of food and resources which can be collected from the river. Mauian Dana, a Tribal Ambassador, said &quot;[T]he pollution has taken a toll on the vitality of our people. We have sustenance fishing rights but cannot live on the fish. When I was a child, the river was thick with foam, had an odor at all times, and if you swam in it, your clothing would be stained and skin would break out.&quot;

The Penobscot River Restoration Trust was a nonprofit organization consisting of many organizations including the Penobscot Nation, Maine Audubon, and many more. From this, the Penobscot River Restoration Project was created, with the goals of a cleaner, healthier river, supporting the PIN culture as well as traditions, and restoring the ecosystem for native plants and animals. The project was discontinued in 2016, however they were able to help the river&#x27;s ecosystem and the health of the areas around it. The Penobscot Nation has been fighting big polluters to help restore the Penobscot River back to its original condition. This is being done through lawsuits against big pollution companies, restoring water quality, and removing dams. In 2018, the Penobscot River was voted to become a citizen of the Penobscot Nation, as the river is viewed as a relative to the tribe, with its own fundamental rights. Member of the Penobscot Nation John Banks highlighted the importance and value of the river, saying &quot;It was our life source. For thousands of years, it provided a means for the tribe to sustain itself. And our history, traditions, and cultural identity are very much intertwined with it,&quot; In 2021, a cleanup plan was set into place 22 years after a lawsuit was filed against Mallinckrodt US LLC. This cleanup plan consists of long term monitoring as well as cleaning up the area, along with providing funding to projects for communities and environments which have been affected by this pollution.

In 2022, after more than a half century of mercury contamination, Maine&#x27;s longest river is finally getting cleaned up.

== River flow and gauges ==
The United States government maintains three river flow gages on the Penobscot river. The first is on the East Branch in Grindstone (an unincorporated settlement approximately south of Stacyville) () where the rivershed is . Flow here has ranged from 400 to . The second is in West Enfield () where the rivershed is . Flow here has ranged from 4,410 to . The third is in Eddington (), downstream from the Veazie Dam where the rivershed is .

==Angling==
Angling, including fly fishing, is common on the river. The West Branch is known as a world class landlocked salmon river, while the East Branch is known for its smallmouth bass fishery. In 2008, the Atlantic Salmon Commission opened the main stem of the river to catch and release fly fishing for Atlantic salmon.

The West Branch is home to landlocked salmon and Brook Trout. There are many deep pools within the river, due to the many slate ledges, making the river ideal for fishing from shore, though there are still areas that are good for canoe fishing. With the Ripogenus Dam by Chesuncook Lake, the West Branch is able to sustain the large landlocked salmon found there, with twelve miles of heavy rapids, deep runs, large pools, and slower moving water in some sections. Baxter State Park is located to the north.

Some of the river&#x27;s rapids are class IV or even V, making this one of the roughest rivers in the area, and attracting whitewater rafters. Until 1971 the West Branch was a main thoroughfare for the Great Northern Paper Company to sluice its logs to its mill in Millinocket, Maine. In 1971 Great Northern opened the Golden Road (Maine) for transporting the logs. The road parallels the river. The paper industry has been greatly diminished and the Millinocket mill was torn down in 2013. The Golden Road, still a private road, continues to be used by logging trucks and also people using the Penobscot.

May to June are usually when mayflies begin their first hatch. Caddisflies also start their massive hatch around this time, but it can extend into the fall at times. Stoneflies tend to hatch throughout the season. In the West Branch, fishermen are often required to use a variety of different techniques.

<text>Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for &quot;Gaul of Narbonne&quot;, from its chief settlement) was a Roman province located in Occitania and Provence, in Southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (&quot;Our Province&quot;), because it was the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (&quot;Transalpine Gaul&quot;), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in Northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Gallia Narbonensis was bordered by the Pyrenees Mountains on the west, the Cévennes to the north, the Alps on the east, and the Gulf of Lion on the south; the province included the majority of the Rhone catchment. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania. The province was a valuable part of the Roman Empire, owing to the Greek colony and later Roman Civitas of Massalia, its location between the Spanish provinces and Rome, and its financial output.

==Names==
The province of &quot;Gallia Transalpina&quot; (&quot;Transalpine Gaul&quot;) was later renamed &quot;Gallia Narbonensis&quot;, after its newly established capital of Colonia Narbo Martius (colloquially known as Narbo, at the location of the modern Narbonne), a Roman colony founded on the coast in 118 BC. The name Gallia Narbonensis most likely originates in the Augustan era. Its first recorded use was in a census conducted by Gnaeus Pullius Pollio. The Romans had called it &quot;Provincia Nostra&quot; (&quot;our province&quot;) or simply &quot;Provincia&quot; (&quot;the province&quot;). The term has survived in the modern name of Provence for the eastern part of the area (French &quot;Provence&quot;, Occitan &quot;Provença&quot;), now a region of France.

==Founding==
The Greek colony of Massalia was founded in approximately 600 BC, by which the Hellenisation of Celtic Gaul began. The Roman involvement in the so-called transalpine Gaul occurred in 218 BC; according to Livy, the Romans tried to establish the alliance against Carthage in Gaul and Spain, but gained no success. Hannibal led the Carthaginian forces and routed the local Gallic tribes, crossing the Rhône. Massalia had already formed an alliance with Rome, which agreed to protect the town in exchange for supplying vital information and providing the fleet as Rome needed. Rome also demanded Massalia a small strip of land in order to build a road to Hispania, to assist in troop transport. The Romans therefore landed their troops on Massalia to protect the city. After Rome held territories in Hispania, the Romans left control of the route to the city, causing praetor Lucius Baebius to be killed by the Ligures while en route to Hispania in 189 BC.

During this period, the Mediterranean settlements on the coast were threatened by the powerful Gallic tribes to the north, especially the tribes known as the Arverni and the Allobroges. In the First Transalpine War (125–121 BCE), the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus (later additionally named Allobrogicus) campaigned in the area and defeated the Allobroges and the Arverni under king Bituitus in the Battle of the Isère River. This defeat substantially weakened the Arverni and ensured the further security of Gallia Narbonensis. The area became a Roman province in 121 BCE. 

The province had come into Roman control originally under the name Gallia Transalpina (Transalpine Gaul), which distinguished it from Cisalpine Gaul on the near side of the Alps to Rome. In this strip of land, the Romans founded the town of Narbonne in 118 BC. At the same time, they built the Via Domitia, the first Roman road in Gaul, connecting Gaul to Hispania, and the Via Aquitania, which led toward the Atlantic through Tolosa (Toulouse) and Burdigala (Bordeaux). Thus, the Romans built a crossroads that made Narbonne an optimal trading center, and Narbonne became a major trading competitor to Massalia. From Narbonne, the Romans established the province of Transalpine Gaul, later called Gallia Narbonensis.

During the Sertorian War (80–72 BCE) against the breakaway state of former Roman senator and general Sertorius, Gallia Narbonensis was an important base for military activities. This was an important event in the Romanization of Narbonese Gaul, as it resulted in the Romans organizing the province.

==Later history==
Control of the province, which bordered directly on Italia, gave the Roman state several advantages: control of the land route between Italy and the Iberian Peninsula; a territorial buffer against Gallic attacks on Italy; and control of the lucrative trade routes of the Rhône valley between Gaul and the markets of Massalia. It was from the capital of Narbonne that Julius Caesar began his Gallic Wars. Caesar rebuilt Narbo and built the cities of Forum Julium and Arles. Julius Caesar also granted many communities in Gallia Narbonensis citizenship. In 49 BC, the city of Massalia sided with the Pompeians during the civil war. After the war ended, the city of Massalia lost all of its independence and was fully subject to Roman rule.

In 40 BC, during the Second Triumvirate, Lepidus was given responsibility for Narbonese Gaul (along with Hispania and Africa), while Mark Antony was given the balance of Gaul. After becoming Emperor, Augustus made Gallia Narbonensis a senatorial province governed by a proconsul. 

Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s administrative reorganization of the Empire in 314 merged the provinces Gallia Narbonensis and Gallia Aquitania into a new administrative unit called &quot;Dioecesis Viennensis&quot; (Diocese of Vienne) with the capital more to the north in Vienne. The new diocese&#x27;s name was later changed to &quot;Dioecesis Septem Provinciarum&quot; (Diocese of the Seven Provinces), indicating that Diocletian had demoted the word &quot;province&quot; to mean a smaller subdivision than in traditional usage.

Galla Narbonensis and surrounding areas were incorporated into the Visigothic Kingdom between AD 462 and 477, permanently ending Roman political control. After the Gothic takeover, the Visigothic dominions were to be generally known as Septimania, while to the east of the lower Rhone the term Provence came into use.

<doc id="505434" wikidata="Q24724024" url="?curid=505434" title="DnaB helicase">
<text>DnaB helicase is an enzyme in bacteria which opens the replication fork during DNA replication. Although the mechanism by which DnaB both couples ATP hydrolysis to translocation along DNA and denatures the duplex is unknown, a change in the quaternary structure of the protein involving dimerisation of the N-terminal domain has been observed and may occur during the enzymatic cycle. Initially when DnaB binds to dnaA, it is associated with dnaC, a negative regulator. After DnaC dissociates, DnaB binds dnaG.

The N-terminal has a multi-helical structure that forms an orthogonal bundle. The C-terminal domain contains an ATP-binding site and is therefore probably the site of ATP hydrolysis.

In eukaryotes, helicase function is provided by the MCM (Minichromosome maintenance) complex.

The DnaB helicase is the product of the &quot;dnaB&quot; gene. DnaB is expressed as a monomer and oligomerises into hexamer through N-terminal interactions. Replicative helicases have a central ring and that feature is conserved across bacterial to eukaryotes.
The energy for DnaB activity is provided by NTP hydrolysis. Mechanical energy moves the DnaB into the replication fork, physically splitting it in half.

==&quot;E. coli&quot; dnaB==
In &quot;E. coli&quot;, dnaB is a hexameric protein of six 471-residue subunits, which form a ring-shaped structure with threefold symmetry. During DNA replication, the lagging strand of DNA binds in the central channel of dnaB, and the second DNA strand is excluded. The binding of NTPs causes a conformational change and subsequent hydrolysis allows the dnaB to translocate along the DNA, thus mechanically forcing the separation of the DNA strands.

== Mechanism of initiation of replication ==
At least 10 different enzymes or proteins participate in the initiation phase of replication. They open the DNA helix at the origin and establish a prepriming complex for subsequent reactions. The crucial component in the initiation process is the DnaA protein, a member of the AAA+ ATPase protein family (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities). Many AAA+ ATPases, including DnaA, form oligomers and hydrolyze ATP relatively slowly. This ATP hydrolysis acts as a switch mediating interconversion of the protein between two states. In the case of DnaA, the ATP-bound form is active and the ADP-bound form is inactive.

Eight DnaA protein molecules, all in the ATP-bound state, assemble to form a helical complex encompassing the R and I sites in oriC. DnaA has a higher affinity for the R sites than I sites, and binds R sites equally well in its ATP or ADP-bound form. The I sites, which bind only the ATP-bound DnaA, allow discrimination between the active and inactive forms of DnaA. The tight right-handed wrapping of the DNA around this complex introduces an effective positive supercoil. The associated strain in the nearby DNA leads to denaturation in the A:T-rich &#x27;DUE&#x27; (DNA Unwinding Element) region. The complex formed at the replication origin also includes several DNA-binding proteins- Hu, IHF and FIS that facilitate DNA bending.

The DnaC protein, another AAA+ ATPase, then loads the DnaB protein onto the separated DNA strands in the denatured region. A hexamer of DnaC, each subunit bound to ATP, forms a tight complex with the hexameric, ring-shaped DnaB helicase. This DnaC-DnaB interaction opens the DnaB ring, the process being aided by a further interaction between DnaB and DnaA. Two of the ring-shaped DnaB hexamers are loaded in the DUE, one onto each DNA strand. The ATP bound to DnaC is hydrolyzed, releasing the DnaC and leaving the DnaB bound to the DNA.

Loading of the DnaB helicase is the key step in replication initiation. As a replicative helicase, DnaB migrates along the single-stranded DNA in the 5&#x27;→3&#x27; direction, unwinding the DNA as it travels. The DnaB helicases loaded onto the two DNA strands thus travel in opposite directions, creating two potential replication forks. All other proteins at the replication fork are linked directly or indirectly to DnaB.

<doc id="505437" wikidata="Q720242" url="?curid=505437" title="Bill Weld">
<text>William Floyd Weld (born July 31, 1945) is an American attorney, businessman, author, and politician who served as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997.
A Harvard graduate, Weld began his career as legal counsel to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary before becoming the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and later, the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. He worked on a series of high-profile public corruption cases and later resigned in protest of an ethics scandal and associated investigations into Attorney General Edwin Meese.

Weld was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1990. In the 1994 election, he was reelected by the largest margin of victory in Massachusetts history. In 1996, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Massachusetts, losing to Democratic incumbent John Kerry. Weld resigned as governor in 1997 to focus on his nomination by President Bill Clinton to serve as United States Ambassador to Mexico; due to opposition by socially conservative Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms, he was denied a hearing before the Foreign Relations committee and withdrew his nomination. After moving to New York in 2000, Weld sought the Republican nomination for Governor of New York in the 2006 election; when the Republican Party instead endorsed John Faso, Weld withdrew from the race.

Weld became involved in presidential politics in later years. In 2016, he left the Republican Party to become the Libertarian Party running mate of former governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson. They received nearly 4.5 million votes, the highest number for a Libertarian ticket, and the best for any third-party ticket since 1996 with Ross Perot&#x27;s Reform Party.

Returning to the Republican Party, Weld announced in April 2019 that he would challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 Republican primaries, launching his campaign. He won his first and only delegate of the primaries in the Iowa caucus in February, making him the first Republican since Pat Buchanan in 1992 to win a delegate while running against an incumbent president. Weld suspended his campaign on March 18, 2020, shortly after Trump&#x27;s delegate count made him the presumptive Republican nominee, and ultimately placed second in 22 states and second overall with 2.4% of the popular vote, collecting relevant percentages of up to 13% in protest-votes against Trump in several states. He also placed second in allocated delegates. He endorsed Democrat Joe Biden seven months later.

== Early life and family ==

Weld was born in Smithtown, New York. Weld&#x27;s father, David (1911–1972), was an investment banker; his mother, Mary Nichols Weld (1913–1986), was a descendant of William Floyd, a signatory of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His ancestor Edmund Weld was among the earliest students (Class of 1650) at Harvard College; eighteen other Welds have attended Harvard, and two Harvard buildings are named for the family. A distant cousin, General Stephen Minot Weld Jr., fought with distinction in the Civil War.

Weld attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in classics from Harvard College in 1966. He studied economics at University College, Oxford. On return to the US he graduated with a J.D., &quot;cum laude&quot;, from Harvard Law School in 1970.

His siblings are Francis &quot;Tim&quot; Weld, David Weld, and Anne (married name Collins). His maternal grandfather was the ichthyologist and ornithologist John Treadwell Nichols, and his first cousin is the novelist John Nichols.

==Early career==
===Nixon impeachment inquiry===
Weld began his legal career as a junior counsel on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee&#x27;s impeachment inquiry staff during the 1974 impeachment process against Richard Nixon. He contributed to the groundbreaking &quot;Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment&quot; report, which detailed the historical basis and standards for impeachment of a president. He also worked on researching whether impoundment of appropriated funds was an impeachable offense. Among his colleagues was Hillary Clinton.

===U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts===
Weld&#x27;s experience serving on the impeachment inquiry staff sparked his interest in criminal law. He returned afterward to Massachusetts, where he ran unsuccessfully for Massachusetts Attorney General in 1978. He lost to Democratic incumbent Francis X. Bellotti by 1,532,835 votes (78.4%) to 421,417 (21.6%).

In 1981, Weld was recommended to President Reagan by Rudy Giuliani, then Associate U.S. Attorney General, for appointment as the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. During Weld&#x27;s tenure, the Attorney General&#x27;s office prosecuted some of New England&#x27;s largest banks in cases involving money-laundering and other white-collar crimes. Weld expanded an ongoing public corruption investigation of the administration of Boston Mayor Kevin White. More than twenty city employees were indicted, pleaded guilty, or were convicted of a range of charges, including several key political supporters of the Mayor. In 1985, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said Weld &quot;has been by far the most visible figure in the prosecution of financial institutions.&quot;

Weld gained national recognition in fighting public corruption: he won 109 convictions out of 111 cases.

In 1983, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; stated: &quot;The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office has not lost a single political corruption case since Weld took over, an achievement believed to be unparalleled in the various federal jurisdictions.&quot;

===Promotion to Justice Department===

In 1986, President Reagan promoted Weld to head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department in Washington, where Weld oversaw 700 employees. Serving from September 15, 1986, until March 29, 1988, Weld was responsible for supervising all federal prosecutions, including those investigated by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as the work of the 93 U.S. Attorneys (who by then included Rudy Giuliani in Manhattan). During this time, Weld worked on some of the Reagan administration&#x27;s most significant prosecutions and investigations, including the capture of Panama&#x27;s Manuel Noriega on drug trafficking charges. Bill Weld was on the prosecution team against James Beggs, Administrator of NASA, and General Dynamics that caused Beggs to take a leave of absence shortly before the Challenger Disaster. After the trial completely exonerated Beggs, Weld was asked to apologize to Beggs. He refused.

While serving as the Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department Criminal Division, Weld wrote a memorandum in 1988 to the House Judiciary Committee that formally reviewed the recommendations of the House Select Committee on Assassinations final report and reported conclusions of active investigations on the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. In light of investigative reports from the FBI&#x27;s Technical Services Division and the National Academy of Sciences Committee determining that &quot;reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman&quot; in the Kennedy assassination, and that all investigative leads known to the Justice Department for both assassinations had been &quot;exhaustively pursued&quot;, the Department concluded &quot;that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in either the assassination of President Kennedy or the assassination of Dr. King.&quot;

In March 1988, Weld resigned from the Justice Department, together with Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and four aides, in protest of improper conduct by Attorney General Edwin Meese. In July 1988, Weld and Burns jointly testified before Congress in favor of a potential prosecution of Edwin Meese for his personal financial conduct, following a report by a special prosecutor investigating Edwin Meese. Meese resigned from office in July 1988 shortly after Weld&#x27;s and Burns&#x27;s testimony.

Weld was a senior partner at Hale and Dorr from 1988 until 1990.

==Governor of Massachusetts (1991–1997)==

In 1990, Weld announced his candidacy for Governor of Massachusetts to replace the outgoing Michael Dukakis. Although Republicans made up under 14% of the Massachusetts electorate and a Republican had not won the gubernatorial election since 1970, Weld&#x27;s liberal stances on social issues made him a viable candidate for office in the heavily Democratic state. At the state Republican convention, party officials backed Steven Pierce over Weld, and initial polling had Pierce ahead by 25 percentage points. However, Weld gained enough support to force a primary, and in an upset election, he won the Republican nomination over Pierce by a 60–40% margin.

In the general election, he faced John Silber, the president of Boston University. Polls showed Weld anywhere from a statistical tie to trailing by as many as ten points. Voter dissatisfaction with the state&#x27;s Democratic majority gave Weld support for his promises to reduce the state deficit, lower the unemployment rate, and cut taxes, while Silber&#x27;s statements to the right of Weld on social issues caused many Democratic voters to vote for Weld. On November 6, 1990, he was elected as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts by a 50–47% margin, to become the first Republican governor of Massachusetts since Francis W. Sargent left office in 1975. Governor Weld is generally considered to have been a moderate or liberal Republican governor. He is fiscally conservative and socially liberal.

The business community reacted strongly to Weld&#x27;s leadership. In a 1994 survey of chief executives conducted by the Massachusetts High Technology Council, 83% of those polled rated the state&#x27;s business climate as good or excellentup from 33% at the beginning of his term. Proponents might claim that Weld&#x27;s leadership changed the minds of 50% of the CEOs surveyed while others would note the national economic trends or other factors might play a part. Weld also reaped the benefits of the 1990s&#x27; prosperity, as the state&#x27;s unemployment rate fell by more than 3 percentage points during his first term, from 9.6% in 1991 to 6.4% in 1994. As a result, Weld received grades of A in 1992, B in 1994, and B in 1996 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors. In 1993 he supported adoption of a gun control bill in Massachusetts that included limits on gun purchases under age 21, as well as prohibiting certain types of weapons, which was not ultimately passed. He has since renounced this proposal. Weld is pro-choice and helped to introduce legislation to make it easier for women to access abortion procedures. As Governor, he supported gay rights. In 1992, he signed an executive order to recognize domestic partnership rights for same-sex couples. In 1993, he signed into law legislation protecting the rights of gay students. He also said he would recognize same-sex marriages that might be performed out of state following a court decision in Hawaii. Weld signed into law the Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 that created the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) and the legal framework for charter schools in Massachusetts. During his term, he launched a successful effort to privatize many state&#x27;s human services, laying off thousands of state employees. One of the social services Weld opposed and eventually ended was a program providing higher education to prison inmates. He also worked to expand Medicaid access by requesting more federal funding and, then, allowing more residents to qualify for the plan to both solve budget problems and increase access to health care in the state. After cutting state spending year-over-year for his first two years, the Republican Party lost its ability to sustain a veto in the legislature due to losses in the Massachusetts State Senate, forcing Weld to make greater concessions to Democratic legislators.

In 1994, Weld won reelection with 71% of the vote in the most one-sided gubernatorial contest in Massachusetts electoral history. Weld carried all but five towns in the whole state, even carrying Boston.

In 1995, Weld eulogized one of his longtime supporters, former Massachusetts House member Mary B. Newman, stating, &quot;Mary Newman, for years the grande dame both of Cambridge and its Republican party, launched me in politics by serving as chair of my statewide campaign in 1978.&quot;

Following his landslide victory as governor, Weld briefly considered running for the presidency in 1996.

=== Cabinet and administration ===
===1996 Senate election===
On November 30, 1995, Weld announced that he would challenge incumbent Democratic Senator John Kerry in the 1996 election. Weld, who was among the first reasonably well-funded Republican Senate candidates in Massachusetts since Edward Brooke was unseated in 1978, said of the race, &quot;I&#x27;ve spent some time recently considering where I can do the most good for the people of Massachusetts, and right now the fights that matter most to the people of this state are in another arena, Congress.&quot;

The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Noted for how civil their respective campaigns were of one another, Kerry and Weld negotiated a campaign spending cap and agreed to eight separate debates leading up to the election. Though facing a traditional uphill battle in a state where Democrats outnumbered Republicans 3-to-1, and running the same year as the presidential election, Weld was a popular incumbent governor and polled even with Kerry throughout the election.

In the end, Kerry won re-election by a vote of 1,334,135 (52%) to 1,143,120 (45%), the last seriously contested Senate race in Massachusetts until the special election for Ted Kennedy&#x27;s seat in 2010. Notably, President Bill Clinton won Massachusetts in 1996 with 61.5% of the vote.

===Ambassadorship nomination and resignation===
In July 1997, Weld was nominated to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused to hold a hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld&#x27;s moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former attorney general and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld&#x27;s investigation of Meese during the Iran–Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: &quot;It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up.&quot; Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld&#x27;s chances of being confirmed weren&#x27;t &quot;very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for.&quot; There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination &quot;die&quot;, but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton &quot;does not plan to give in to ideological extortion&quot; and that &quot;I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [the nomination] even if it&#x27;s going to bottom.&quot; Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of people come up to me on the street and say, &#x27;Give &#x27;em hell. That&#x27;s the Bill Weld we know and love.&#x27;&quot;

Weld resigned the governorship on July 29, 1997, to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship, even though few thought he would be successful; there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor. A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused. After an intensive six-week battle, Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented, &quot;I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate so I can go back to New England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty.&quot;

==Later career==
===Law firm, lobbyist, private equity partner, and 2004 election===
Weld was a partner in the Boston and Manhattan offices of the international law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery from 1997 to 2001, and head of the New York office from 2000 to 2001. Weld was registered as a lobbyist for McDermott Will &amp; Emery. Between 2007 and 2011, Weld was a lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon, CNX Gas Corporation, Sony Electronics and shoemaker New Balance. In December 2000, the private equity firm Leeds Equity Partners announced that Weld would join the firm, to be renamed Leeds Weld &amp; Co., as a general partner, effective on January 1, 2001. At the private equity firm, Weld later &quot;reduced his role to a senior advisor while considering a run for New York governor&quot; in 2005. Weld rejoined McDermott Will &amp; Emery in 2006. Weld was admitted to the bar in New York in 2008. In 2012, Weld moved to the Boston law firm of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo, becoming a partner there and a principal with the firm&#x27;s government relations affiliate, ML Strategies LLC.

During the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, who was running against Weld&#x27;s old foe John Kerry, Weld helped Bush to prepare for the debates.

===Kentucky college management===
From January to October 2005, Weld was chief executive of Decker College in Louisville, Kentucky. His term ended as the college was closing under bankruptcy protection following a disagreement with the U.S. Department of Education about accreditation of its construction-related courses and online instruction. This matter would follow Weld into the 2006 race for Governor of New York, with former U.S. senator from New York Alfonse D&#x27;Amato asserting that Weld was responsible and oversaw &quot;multimillion dollar looting&quot;.

On March 27, 2016, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported as part of an opinion article that &quot;Bankruptcy trustee Robert Keats alleged [Ralph] LoBosco&quot;, a Department of Education employee, &quot;was trying to exact revenge against Decker CEO William Weld&quot;. The article continued: &quot;Education Department administrative law judge Robert Layton recently affirmed a 2012 bankruptcy court finding that the Council on Occupational Education had failed to tell the truth in stating that Decker&#x27;s online programs were never accredited. The Council&#x27;s &#x27;factually erroneous&#x27; assertion caused the Education Department to withdraw federal student aid in 2005, which precipitated Decker&#x27;s bankruptcy.&quot;

===Candidacy for Governor of New York, 2005–06===
After being Governor of Massachusetts, Weld moved to New York in 2000. On April 24, 2005, it was reported that he was in talks with the New York Republicans to run for Governor of New York in 2006, against likely Democratic nominee Eliot Spitzer. Incumbent GOP Governor George Pataki announced on July 27 that he would not seek a fourth term. On August 19, 2005, Weld officially announced his candidacy for Governor of New York, seeking to become the second person after Sam Houston to serve as governor of two different U.S. states.

In December 2005, Weld received the backing of the Republican county chairs of New York State during a county chairs meeting. On April 29, 2006, Weld received the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nomination for Governor Of New York. Weld reportedly offered his chief rival for the nomination, former Republican Assembly leader John Faso, the chance to join his ticket as a candidate for lieutenant governor, an offer Faso reportedly declined. Faso gained increasing support from party leaders in various counties, including Westchester and Suffolk, both of which had large delegate counts to the state convention.

On June 1, 2006, the Republican State Convention voted 61% to 39% to endorse Faso over Weld. On June 5, Stephen J. Minarik (the chairman of the state Republican Party, and Weld&#x27;s most prominent backer), called on Weld to withdraw from the race in the interest of party unity. Weld formally announced his withdrawal from the race the following day and returned to private life. Spitzer would go on to defeat Faso by the largest margin in New York gubernatorial history.

===Later political involvement===
Weld publicly endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for the presidency on January 8, 2007; he was a co-chairman for Romney&#x27;s campaign in New York State. On the same day that Weld endorsed Romney, Gov. and Mrs. Weld also raised $50,000 for Romney&#x27;s exploratory committee. Weld personally made a donation of $2,100, the maximum allowed per person per election at the time. After the maximum allowed rose to $2,300, Weld donated another $200.

Weld was also active in campaigning for Romney in New Hampshire, where both governors have been known to travel together. Weld went on to endorse Barack Obama over John McCain in the general election. Weld endorsed Romney in the 2012 presidential election.

In February 2016, Weld endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for the Republican presidential nomination.

===2016 Libertarian vice presidential nomination===

On May 17, 2016, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party&#x27;s 2012 presidential nominee and the leading candidate for its 2016 nomination, announced his selection of Weld to be his choice for running mate. The vice-presidential candidate is formally nominated separately from and after the presidential candidate under the Libertarian Party&#x27;s rules, although as the presidential nominee Johnson was first allowed to speak about his endorsement of Weld. Both candidates won their nominations on a second ballot after narrowly failing to attain an absolute majority on the first ballot. Weld accepted the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nomination for vice president at the Libertarian National Convention in Orlando, Florida on May 29.

During the campaign, Weld took the lead on fundraising operations, as well as appearing on national television and at campaign rallies across the nation. Together, Johnson and Weld were the first presidential ticket to consist of two governors since the 1948 election when Thomas Dewey of New York ran as a Republican with Earl Warren of California and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina ran as a States&#x27; Rights Democrat with Fielding L. Wright of Mississippi. Despite polling higher than any third-party campaign since Ross Perot in 1992, Johnson and Weld were excluded from the debates controlled by the Commission on Presidential Debates and their poll numbers subsequently declined.

Nationwide, the Johnson/Weld ticket received 4,488,919 votes (3.3%), breaking the Libertarian Party&#x27;s record for both absolute vote total (previously 1,275,923 for Johnson in 2012) and percentage (previously 1.1% for Ed Clark and David Koch in 1980).

===2020 presidential campaign===
On January 17, 2019, Weld rejoined the Republican Party, increasing speculation that he would run for president. On February 14, 2019, Weld announced that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee for the 2020 Republican primary, against incumbent Republican president Donald Trump. Appearing on Bloomberg News, Weld suggested that he could beat Trump in 2020 with help from independent voters. He accused Trump on CNN the same weekend of having &quot;showed contempt for the American people.&quot; Weld challenged Trump on the issue of climate disruption, saying that he had made no effort to combat the effects of global warming. &quot;We&#x27;ve got the polar ice cap that&#x27;s going to melt with devastating consequences if we don&#x27;t get carbon out of the atmosphere&quot;, Weld told America&#x27;s Newsroom, noting that he would plan ahead for an &quot;environmental catastrophe.&quot;

On April 15, 2019, Weld formally announced his candidacy for President of the United States on &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot;. Weld received 1.3% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses and one pledged delegate on February 3.

Weld suspended his campaign on March 18, 2020.

After ending his campaign, Weld announced that he voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

===Other activities===
Weld is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He co-chaired its Independent Task Force on North America, which studied the liberalization of markets and free trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. He was a principal at Leeds, Weld &amp; Co., which describes itself as the United States&#x27;s largest private equity fund focused on investing in the education and training industry. Weld serves on the board of directors of Acreage Holdings. For a time, he wrote thrillers and works of historical fiction.

In February 2013, Weld publicly supported legal recognition for same-sex marriage in an amicus brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Weld joined Our America Initiative&#x27;s 2016 Liberty Tour a number of times, speaking alongside other libertarian leaders and activists such as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition executive director and former Baltimore Police Chief Neill Franklin, Free the People&#x27;s Matt Kibbe, Republican activists Ed Lopez and Liz Mair, Conscious Capitalism&#x27;s Alex McCobin, Reason Foundation&#x27;s David Nott, Foundation for Economic Education&#x27;s Jeffrey Tucker, and the Libertarian Party&#x27;s Carla Howell (as well as some speakers not ordinarily associated with libertarianism, such as author and journalist Naomi Wolf); the tour raised &quot;awareness about third party inclusion in national presidential debates&quot; and &quot;spread the message of liberty and libertarian thought.&quot;

Throughout 2017 and 2018, Weld appeared at several state Libertarian Party conventions and endorsed various Libertarian candidates in the 2018 United States elections. In January 2019, Weld changed his party affiliation back to Republican, in preparation for his presidential run as a Republican.

Weld currently works as a lobbyist for ML Strategies. Weld&#x27;s primary areas of focus as a lobbyist are helping c-level executives navigate competition, white collar investigation and litigation, and &quot;dealing with government at all levels&quot;. Weld also specializes in ESG consulting at ML Strategies.

Weld also sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center.

After President Joe Biden ended his campaign, Weld announced that he is voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 election.

<doc id="505440" wikidata="Q181737" url="?curid=505440" title="Baluran National Park">
<text>Baluran National Park is located in Situbondo Regency, East Java, Indonesia. It has a relatively dry climate and mainly consists of savanna (40%), as well as lowland forests, mangrove forests and hills, with Mount Baluran (1,247m) as its highest peak.

Baluran National Park is situated at the north-eastern extremity of Java, close to the islands of Bali and Madura. The park is bordered by the Madura Strait to the north, the Bali Strait to the east, the river Bajulmati (Wonorejo village) to the west and the river Klokoran (Sumberanyar village) to the south. The park is a rough circle, with the extinct volcano, Baluran, at its centre. Its total area is 25,000 ha. It consists of five zones: the Main Zone (12,000 ha), the Wilderness Zone (5,537 ha, comprising 1,063 ha water and 4,574 ha land), the Intensive Utilization Zone (800 ha), the Specific Utilization Zone (5,780 ha) and the Rehabilitation Zone (783 ha).

==Flora and fauna==

There have been 444 plant species recorded in the park, including some endangered plant species such as: &quot;Ziziphus rotundifolia&quot;, &quot;Tamarindus indica&quot;, &quot;Dioscorea hispida&quot;, &quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot; and &quot;Corypha utan&quot;.

Baluran National Park hosts 26 mammal species, including the endangered Banteng, Sumatran dhole, Indian muntjac, Java mouse-deer, Sunda leopard cat, Javan leopard and Javan lutung.
The banteng population decreased from 338 in 1996 to just 26 in 2012. This is caused by invasive species such as &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot; and the water buffalo. However, intensive breeding efforts have increased the population to around 200 individuals by 2020. 

Avifauna in the park include the green peafowl, red junglefowl, Malabar pied hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill and lesser adjutant. Until 2010 there had been 155 species of bird recorded in the park, but following a bird photography competition in 2012, the number of species was revised to 196.

===Extinct===
Javan tigers survived in the protected area until the mid-1960s.

==Conservation and threats==
The area has been protected since 1928, first initiated by the Dutch hunter A.H. Loedeboer. In 1937 it was declared a wildlife refuge by the Dutch colonial government. In 1980 the area was declared a national park.

Poaching poses a major threat to the wildlife in the park, especially to the decreasing banteng population. According to ProFauna Indonesia, not only locals but also members of the military have been involved in poaching.

The thorny acacia, which occupied at least 6,000 hectares of savannah at the Baluran National Park, has made it increasingly difficult for bantengs to find food. In 2013, there were only 35 bantengs, while in 1996 there were still 320 bantengs.

<text>In mathematics, the sign function or signum function (from &quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;sign&quot;) is a function that has the value , or according to whether the sign of a given real number is positive or negative, or the given number is itself zero. In mathematical notation the sign function is often represented as formula_1 or formula_2.

==Definition==
The signum function of a real number formula_3 is a piecewise function which is defined as follows:
formula_4

The law of trichotomy states that every real number must be positive, negative or zero.
The signum function denotes which unique category a number falls into by mapping it to one of the values , or which can then be used in mathematical expressions or further calculations.

For example:
formula_5

== Basic properties ==
Any real number can be expressed as the product of its absolute value and its sign:
formula_6

It follows that whenever formula_3 is not equal to 0 we have
formula_8

Similarly, for &quot;any&quot; real number formula_3,
formula_10
We can also be certain that:
formula_11
and so
formula_12

== Some algebraic identities ==
The signum can also be written using the Iverson bracket notation:
formula_13

The signum can also be written using the floor and the absolute value functions:
formula_14
for any complex number formula_15 except formula_16. The signum of a given complex number formula_15 is the point on the unit circle of the complex plane that is nearest to formula_15. Then, for formula_19,
formula_20
where formula_21 is the complex argument function.

For reasons of symmetry, and to keep this a proper generalization of the signum function on the reals, also in the complex domain one usually defines, for formula_16: 
formula_23

Another generalization of the sign function for real and complex expressions is formula_24, which is defined as:
formula_25
where formula_26 is the real part of formula_15 and formula_28 is the imaginary part of formula_15.

We then have (for formula_19):
formula_31

=== Polar decomposition of matrices ===
Thanks to the Polar decomposition theorem, a matrix formula_32 (formula_33 and formula_34) can be decomposed as a product formula_35 where formula_36 is a unitary matrix and formula_37 is a self-adjoint, or Hermitian, positive definite matrix, both in formula_38. If formula_39 is invertible then such a decomposition is unique and formula_36 plays the role of formula_39&#x27;s signum. A dual construction is given by the decomposition formula_42 where formula_43 is unitary, but generally different than formula_36. This leads to each invertible matrix having a unique left-signum formula_36 and right-signum formula_43.

In the special case where formula_47 and the (invertible) matrix formula_48, which identifies with the (nonzero) complex number formula_49, then the signum matrices satisfy formula_50 and identify with the complex signum of formula_51, formula_52. In this sense, polar decomposition generalizes to matrices the signum-modulus decomposition of complex numbers.

=== Signum as a generalized function ===
At real values of formula_3, it is possible to define a generalized function–version of the signum function, formula_54 such that formula_55 everywhere, including at the point formula_56, unlike formula_57, for which formula_58. This generalized signum allows construction of the algebra of generalized functions, but the price of such generalization is the loss of commutativity. In particular, the generalized signum anticommutes with the Dirac delta function
formula_59
in addition, formula_54 cannot be evaluated at formula_56; and the special name, formula_62 is necessary to distinguish it from the function formula_57. (formula_64 is not defined, but formula_65.)

<text>A wedge issue in politics is any issue used to create a division within a political party. These issues are usually employed as a tactic by a minority party against a governing majority party, with the aim of splitting the majority&#x27;s electorate into two or more camps. Although any issue could potentially be used as a wedge, some of the most common examples are often concerned with social justice, such as abortion or civil rights. Due to the prevalence of social justice issues as a wedge, the tactic is often most effectively employed by Conservative parties against Liberal parties. American political strategist Lee Atwater has been noted as an early champion of wedge issue politics during the Reagan era.

== Examples ==

=== Australia ===

During the 2001 federal election campaign in Australia, there was a controversy regarding Afghan asylum seekers arriving on unauthorized vessels, there having been several widely publicized landings of hundreds of people. On August 24, 2001, a ship bearing 460 such people became distressed, and its passengers were picked up by the Norwegian cargo vessel MV Tampa.

The governing Liberal Party of Australia took the opportunity to appear tough on asylum seekers. The opposition Australian Labor Party (ALP) had a slight majority of people strongly favoring more sympathetic treatment and was perceived as internally split. This provoked a debate within the ALP on the merits of siding with national opinion (in favor of the Government&#x27;s actions) or opposing. With over 90% of some television polls supporting the government&#x27;s stance, the leader of the ALP Kim Beazley chose to go against the majority and agree to the former policy—though it ended up opposing certain elements of proposed legislation, which the Liberal Party framed as weak on border security.

The Liberal Party campaigned largely on a platform of border security and increased its support at the federal election that November despite being the incumbent. Some who would typically vote Labor voted instead for the Greens and the Democrats in protest against what they saw as the ALP&#x27;s complicity.

It was later claimed that the controversial campaign strategists Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor had an active role in making the Tampa incident a wedge issue for Howard to exploit.

=== United States ===
During the Civil Rights era, Republicans attempted to drive a wedge between Democrats on the issue of race. In the 1968 US Presidential election, northern Democratic support of the Civil Rights Act caused a cleavage with southern Democrats which led to Democratic Alabama Governor George Wallace mounting a third party campaign.

Gay marriage was considered a wedge issue in 1990s Democratic politics, with President Bill Clinton signing into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 amidst pressure from Centrist Democrats, but its efficacy was lost in later years as support for gay marriage in the electorate grew. President Joe Biden is another example of a Democrat who voted in favor of DOMA, but signed the bill&#x27;s antithesis, the Respect for Marriage Act, into law over 20 years later. 

Reform of the laws regarding illegal immigration to the United States operated as a wedge issue in 2007. Some Republican legislators, with the backing of President George W. Bush, sought to address the dual issues of ongoing illegal immigration to the United States and the illegal status of an estimated 12 million people currently living in America. Other Republicans opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants, out of fear that their constituents were unsupportive of immigration reform. Some Democrats pitched in to keep the issue alive as they recognized the issue was dividing the Republican party between advocates of reform and advocates of the status quo. The result was a division in Republican ranks and a stalled bill in Congress. After the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the views of American voters shifted to align more closely with their parties along partisan lines, reducing immigration policy&#x27;s status as a wedge issue.

Covid-19 served as wedge issue for both political parties in the 2020 US Presidential election, with both the Democratic and Republican electorate divided over whether candidates Joe Biden or Donald Trump could effectively handle the pandemic. Biden sought to divide the Republican base by claiming Trump had mismanaged the response to the Covid-19 crisis, while Trump contended that Biden, if elected, would shut down the economy.

During the 2024 election cycle, Republicans sought to drive a wedge between Democratic voters by portraying Democrats as taking a radical stance by aligning themselves with the transgender rights movement. In that same election, the Gaza war became a wedge issue among Democrats who increasingly opposed sending military aid to Israel.

=== United Kingdom ===
Both Labour (PLP) and Conservative Members of Parliament struggled to handle internal divisions within their party in the beginning stages of Brexit policy decisions. The split caused the emergence of two different sub-groups: pro-Remain (or pro-EU) and pro-Leave (Eurosceptics). The divide was heightened in the face of leadership changes. While 90% of Labour members were pro-remain, the Leader of the PLP, Jeremy Corbyn, attempted to sideline the issue in several interviews, which provoked a vote of no confidence. A similar situation occurred within the Conservative Party, when Theresa May, who had supported Remain during the Referendum, was elected as Prime Minister despite her party&#x27;s majority leaning towards pro-Leave. In an attempt to unify the party, May led with a &quot;Brexit means Brexit&quot; mantra, switching positions and attempting to appease both divisions by finding compromise in her proposed legislation. However, her policies only further polarized the two factions and weakened the party, which resulted in her resignation after a devastating loss of seats.

=== New Zealand ===
In the 2005 New Zealand general election, the National Party sought to capitalize on the foreshore and seabed issue by employing wedge tactics to drive racial divisions between Mäori and Non-Mäori. The strategy was prominently highlighted by in a speech by party leader Don Brash at the Orewa Rotary Club, where he called for &quot;One Law for All&quot; and the removal of Mäori parliamentary seats, and resulted in a rise of 17-points for the National Party. In an attempt to compete with the party&#x27;s growing popularity, the Labour Party proposed the Foreshore and Seabed Legislation, which declared the properties to be in the legal possession of the Crown, but offered an avenue for the Mäori to apply for customary reservation. Infighting ensued between the Mäori members of the Labour Party when three of them refused to vote in support of the bill. One MP in particular, Tariana Turia, resigned from her position to form the Mäori party, eventually winning back her seat in Parliament- and four more for the new party in the general election, won from Labour.

<text>Black 47 was an American Celtic rock band from New York City, formed in 1989 by Larry Kirwan and Chris Byrne, and derives its name from a traditional term for the summer of 1847, the worst year of the Great Famine in Ireland.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Kirwan originally arrived in New York City from Wexford at age 19, and played in a succession of bands before teaming with Byrne, a Brooklyn policeman, in 1989. The combination of Kirwan&#x27;s electric guitar and Byrne&#x27;s use of traditional Irish instruments initially received a poor reception, but a year later, with the addition of new members Geoff Blythe (founding member of Dexy&#x27;s Midnight Runners), Fred Parcells and Thomas Hamlin, they were playing regularly at Paddy Reilly&#x27;s bar on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side. The band began to play three to five nights a week, and garnered praise for both the socio-political lyrics and &quot;off-the-wall&quot; live shows, quickly drawing a fan base from both the political left and right. Kirwan stated in an interview that the band was &quot;formed to be political&quot;, with the socialist lyrics attracting one half of the political spectrum, and the songs of the day-to-day life in America attracting traditionally right-leaning &quot;cops, firemen and construction workers.&quot;

===Breakout===
The band got their first big break when their debut release, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;, launched as a cassette at a St. Patrick&#x27;s day gig at Reilly&#x27;s in 1990. It was heard by Frank Murray, manager of The Pogues, who signed them to his newly launched label. They went on to open for The Pogues at Brixton Academy in December of the same year, and following the collapse of Murray&#x27;s label the band released an eponymous independent album in 1991, which brought them to the attention of EMI. They went into the studio with Ric Ocasek of The Cars, where they re-recorded parts of their self-titled album for the 1992 release of &quot;Fire of Freedom&quot;, which was described as &quot;the most fun you can squeeze out of a five-inch disc.&quot; and drew comparisons with Kevin Rowland and Bruce Springsteen. Black 47 gained access to a significantly wider audience when &quot;Funky Céilí (Bridie&#x27;s Song)&quot;, a track from &quot;Fire of Freedom&quot; gained extended air-play on music channel MTV, becoming the band&#x27;s breakout single. The song was praised for the use of a traditional jig, riotous conclusion and as &quot;a knockout example of how Irish music can rock.&quot; A second song from the album, &quot;Black 47&quot;, caused a stir amongst older fans of Irish music who had maintained close emotional ties to their ancestors who lived during the famine, traditionally a subject rarely addressed in song. The band followed up with &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; in 1994 with Jerry Harrison serving as producer, and a move from EMI to Mercury Records in 1996 followed with the release of &quot;Green Suede Shoes&quot;.

Throughout the late 1990s the band continued to perform around 150 nights a year both on tour and at Reilly&#x27;s, but was plagued by a series of tragedies behind the scenes, and their political stance on affairs in Northern Ireland resulted in UK record companies being unwilling to support or promote the band, restricting a potentially lucrative market. At the 1996 St. Patrick&#x27;s Day gig a very inebriated 22-year-old off-duty police officer, Christopher Gargan, used his department issued 9mm pistol to shoot himself in the head and the single bullet also injured Sharon Callahan-Wormworth and June Anderson, tour manager Nico Wormworth&#x27;s wife and Kirwan&#x27;s wife, respectively. In 1997 one of the band&#x27;s sound engineers, Johnny Byrne (immortalised in the band&#x27;s single &quot;Johnny Byrne&#x27;s Jig&quot;), died from injuries suffered after falling from his apartment window in New York City not long after recording an album of children&#x27;s songs with Kirwan. The late 1990s also saw band member Thomas Hamlin&#x27;s apartment burn down, Kevin Jenkins retire after a car crash whilst on tour and John Murphy, a close friend of the band, die after falling into a coma after a motorcycle accident. These events are reflected upon in &quot;Those Saints&quot;, a song on the &quot;Trouble in the Land&quot; album, released in 2000. 2000 also saw the release of the band&#x27;s first compilation album to mark their tenth anniversary, &quot;Ten Bloody Years&quot;, and the departure of Byrne who amicably left the band to concentrate on his solo project, Seanchai and the Unity Squad.

===Post Byrne===

Black 47 went on an unofficial recording hiatus, although they maintained their live performances, influenced as much by the events of 9/11 as the departure of Byrne. The release of &quot;New York Town&quot; in 2004 reflected the city before and after the attacks, where a number of Black 47 fans, such as FDNY chaplain Mychal Judge, honoured in the song &quot;Mychal&quot;, were casualties. Post-9/11 Black 47 had started to play regularly at Connolly&#x27;s Pub in midtown Manhattan, playing shows Kirwan described as intense in order to allow fans who had lost loved ones an outlet for their emotions, and this was channelled into making the album. &quot;New York Town&quot; was a critical success, drawing parallels to Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Dubliners&quot; due to it being a series of short, unrelated stories centered around New York City, and Kirwan was praised for painting a picture of the everyday life of New Yorkers, although the appearance of guest singers such as David Johansen of the New York Dolls and Christine Ohlman was noted for highlighting the weakness in Kirwan&#x27;s own voice.

Following the release of &quot;Elvis Murphys Green Suede Shoes&quot;, a companion to Kirwan&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Green Suede Shoes - An Irish-American Odyssey&quot; in 2005, the band released a second greatest hits album, &quot;Bittersweet Sixteen&quot; in 2006 to celebrate sixteen years. &quot;Elvis Murphy&quot; was generally well received, as despite the lyrics at times having literary &#x27;problems&#x27; it was considered challenging yet enjoyable and for making &quot;real emotional sense&quot; and touching both the heart and soul. &quot;Bittersweet Sixteen&quot; was praised for being both a great introduction to the band and a treasure for seasoned fans, containing rare tracks such as the original version of &quot;Funky Céilí&quot;.

Prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the band became outspoken critics of the potential war, speaking out regularly at gigs. When the invasion was announced they were playing live, and due to the political mix the band attracted some fans begun to scuffle and walk out in response to the left-leaning lyrics of the anti-war songs. They released a collection of such songs in 2008 on an album simply titled &quot;Iraq&quot;. Inspiration for the lyrics came from Kirwan&#x27;s communication with fans serving on the front line, as a significant demographic of the fanbase is young men who enlist to fund their futures. Kirwan called the album a response to the war being forgotten about, as stories moved away from the front pages, drawing similarities in the way violence in Northern Ireland became &#x27;acceptable&#x27;.

The band returned to drawing from a wider ranger of subjects with their 2010 album &quot;Bankers and Gangsters&quot;. It was noted that this album, unsurprisingly, was less political than its predecessor, and was also criticised for returning to the safe haven and not bringing anything new to the band&#x27;s discography. However the album was generally well received, with praise going to the high standard of Kirwan&#x27;s storytelling ability so far into the band&#x27;s lifetime as well as the &quot;rollicking spirit&quot; of the bands. Kirwan relates his noted ability and passion in biographical songs such as &quot;Bobby Sands MP&quot; to his time spent as a playwright, likening his performance singing them to method acting. The album has also been considered one of the band&#x27;s best, referencing the &quot;sharp social commentary and genre-bending sounds.&quot;

===Disbanding===

On September 18, 2013 Black 47 issued this statement:
&quot;In early November 2014, exactly 25 years after our first gig, Black 47 will disband. There are no fights, differences over musical policy, or general skulduggery, we remain as good friends as when we first played together. We just have a simple wish to finish up at the top our game after 25 years of relentless touring and, as always, on our own terms. The last gig we played at the South Buffalo Irish Festival was as good as any we&#x27;ve ever performed. Our goal now is to play another full year plus and dedicate all of those gigs to you who&#x27;ve supported us through thick and thin. Rather than just running out the clock we will be recording &quot;Last Call,&quot; an album of new songs in November and as usual will be working out the material onstage. We would like to say goodbye to you all personally and will make every effort to come play in your city, town, college, pub, club, [and] performing arts center. 
Black 47 has always been more than a band, we&#x27;ve spoken out for the nationalist population in the North of Ireland, against the war but for the troops in Iraq, for our gay brothers &amp; sisters, immigrants, legal and undocumented, as well as for the voiceless of 1845-47; but in the end it all comes down to the music, the songs, and the desire to give audiences the time of their lives and send them home smiling and, perhaps, with a question on their lips. We look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming gigs. Thanks for the support and the memories - lets make many more over the next year.&quot;

==Politics==
A 1993 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article on Irish rock in America said it was &quot;the proletariat passion of Black 47&#x27;s songs that make the group stand out.&quot;

===Irish Republicanism===
In an early interview Kirwan spoke of the British &quot;attempt at racial cleansing&quot; and exploitation in Ireland, and many of the band&#x27;s songs directly relate to Irish republicanism, such as &quot;James Connolly&quot;, &quot;Bobby Sands MP&quot; and &quot;Vinegar Hill&quot;. The presence of this content has at times brought criticism on the band from listeners who are politically neutral to the situation, as well as restricting their promotion in the UK. Speaking of the period that inspired the band name, Kirwan said, &quot;I&#x27;m not one of those people who believe the British did [the famine] on purpose... But what they did do was they allowed millions of people to starve and leave the land because they didn&#x27;t want to change the particular economic system they had at the time.&quot;

They have been described as &#x27;the musical wing of the IRA’.

===Iraq War===
On top of the &quot;Iraq&quot; album, Kirwan noted that the war was one which &quot;the working class is fighting&quot;. He also stated that politicians wasted an opportunity (after 9/11) to change the world for the better, placing most blame on the shoulders of then-president Bush Kirwan argued that had there been a Churchill-esque leader then America would have taken the opportunity to rid themselves of dependence on foreign oil, and change the way America communicated with the rest of the world. He also criticised Bush for using the memory of the victims of 9/11 to justify war as the biggest tragedy that came out of the event.

===Concert recording===
Kirwan actively encourages the videotaping, recording and photography of Black 47&#x27;s live shows, citing that no two shows are the same and its good to have a record of it. The band&#x27;s official website has also encouraged US soldiers posted in the Middle East to pass around bootlegged copies of albums.

==Criticism==
Black 47 band has been criticized as most members only have a tenuous link to Ireland. Ed Power of The Guardian noting their minuscule connection with Ireland as being ‘sweet feck all to do with Oscar Wilde, Christy Ring or Samuel Beckett.’

They have been described as &#x27;the musical wing of the IRA’, which was a paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland and was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland. The IRA have been held responsible for the killing of 1,705 people during The Troubles, including many civilians.

==Influence==
They have been recognised as &quot;the premier Irish-American rock group&quot; who created an environment where bands such as Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly have been able to flourish.

<doc id="505455" wikidata="Q394497" url="?curid=505455" title="Firedamp">
<text>Firedamp is any flammable gas found in coal mines, typically coalbed methane. It is particularly found in areas where the coal is bituminous. The gas accumulates in pockets in the coal and adjacent strata and when they are penetrated the release can trigger explosions. Historically, if such a pocket was highly pressurized, it was termed a &quot;bag of foulness&quot;.

== Name ==
Damp is the collective name given to all gases (other than air) found in coal mines in Great Britain and North America. 

As well as firedamp, other damps include &quot;blackdamp&quot; (nonbreathable mixture of carbon dioxide, water vapour and other gases); whitedamp (carbon monoxide and other gases produced by combustion); poisonous, explosive &quot;stinkdamp&quot; (hydrogen sulfide), with its characteristic rotten-egg odour; and the insidiously lethal &quot;afterdamp&quot; (carbon monoxide and other gases) which are produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.

== Etymology ==
Often hyphenated as fire-damp, this term for a flammable type of underground mine gas in first part derives via the Old English &quot;fyr&quot;, and from the proto-Germanic &quot;fūr&quot; for &quot;fire&quot; (the origin of the same word in Dutch and German, with similar original spellings in Old Saxon, Frisian, and Norse, as well as Middle Dutch and Old High German). In the second part, the meaning of &quot;damp&quot; (most commonly understood to imply humidity) presents evidence of having been separated from that newer, irrelevant meaning at least by the first decade of the 18th century, where the original relevant meaning of &quot;vapor&quot; also derives from a Proto-Germanic origin, &quot;dampaz&quot;, which gave rise to its immediate English predecessor, the Middle Low German &quot;damp&quot; (with no record of an Old English intermediary). As with the derivation of the first, the proto-Germanic &quot;dampaz&quot; gave rise to many other cognates, including the Old High German &quot;damph&quot;, the Old Norse &quot;dampi&quot;, and the modern German &quot;Dampf&quot;, the last of which still translates as &quot;vapor&quot;.

==Contribution to mine deaths==
Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused many deaths in coal mines before the invention of the Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. Even after the safety lamps were brought into common use, firedamp explosions could still be caused by sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp and could cause explosions even in the absence of firedamp. The Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites and there was a great number of deaths in accidents caused by firedamp explosions, including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835.

The problem of firedamp in mines had been brought to the attention of the Royal Society by 1677 and in 1733 James Lowther reported that as a shaft was being sunk for a new pit at Saltom near Whitehaven there had been a major release when a layer of black stone had been broken through into a coal seam. Ignited with a candle, it had given a steady flame &quot;about half a Yard in Diameter, and near two Yards high&quot;. The flame being extinguished and a wider penetration through the black stone made, reigniting of the gas gave a bigger flame, a yard in diameter and about three yards high, which was extinguished only with difficulty. The blower was panelled off from the shaft and piped to the surface, where more than two and a half years later it continued as fast as ever, filling a large bladder in a few seconds. The society members elected Sir James Fellow but were unable to come up with any solution nor improve on the assertion (eventually found to be incorrect) of Carlisle Spedding, the author of the paper, that &quot;this sort of Vapour, or damp Air, will not take Fire except by Flame; Sparks do not affect it, and for that Reason it is frequent to use Flint and Steel in Places affected with this sort of Damp, which will give a glimmering Light, that is a great Help to the Workmen in difficult Cases.&quot;
A great step forward in countering the problem of firedamp came when safety lamps, intended to provide illumination whilst being incapable of igniting firedamp, were proposed by both George Stephenson and Humphry Davy in response to accidents such as the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne, which killed 92 people on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with brass gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. Stephenson&#x27;s lamp (the &quot;Geordie lamp&quot;) worked on a different principle: the flame was enclosed by glass; air access to the flame was through tubes sufficiently narrow that the flame could not burn-back in incoming firedamp and the exiting gases were too low in oxygen to allow the enclosed flame to reach the surrounding atmosphere. Both principles were combined in later versions of safety lamps.

Even after the widespread introduction of the safety lamp, explosions continued because the early lamps were fragile and easily damaged. For example the iron gauze on a Davy lamp needed to lose only one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor (compared with a naked flame) and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.

The Firedamp whistle was developed by Fritz Haber in 1913, as a prophylactic indicator of firedamp, but calibration in a working colliery ultimately proved impractical.

<doc id="505456" wikidata="Q964439" url="?curid=505456" title="Robert Barton">
<text>Robert Childers Barton (14 March 1881 – 10 August 1975) was an Anglo-Irish politician, Irish nationalist and farmer who participated in the negotiations leading up to the signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. His father was Charles William Barton and his mother was Agnes Alexandra Frances Childers. His wife was Rachel Warren of Boston, daughter of Fiske Warren. His double first cousin and close friend was Erskine Childers.

==Early life==
He was born in County Wicklow into a wealthy Irish Protestant land-owning family; namely of Glendalough House. Educated in England at Rugby and Oxford, he became an officer in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers on the outbreak of World War I. He was stationed in Dublin during the 1916 Easter Rising and came into contact with many of its imprisoned leaders in the aftermath while on duty at Richmond Barracks. He resigned his commission in protest at the heavy-handed British government suppression of the revolt. He then joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

===Family===
Charles William Barton (father) was born on 13 July 1836. He married Agnes Alexandra Frances Childers, daughter of Rev. Canon Charles Childers, on 26 October 1876. He died on 3 October 1890, aged 54. Robert&#x27;s two younger brothers, Erskine and Thomas, died in the British Army during World War I.

==Politics==
At the 1918 general election to the British House of Commons Barton was elected as the Sinn Féin member for Wicklow West. In common with all Sinn Féin members, he boycotted the Westminster parliament and sat instead in Dáil Éireann (the First Dáil). Arrested in February 1919 for sedition, he escaped from Mountjoy Prison on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day (leaving a note to the governor explaining that, owing to the discomfort of his cell, the occupant felt compelled to leave, and requesting the governor to keep his luggage until he sent for it). He was appointed as Director of Agriculture in the Dáil Ministry in April 1919. He was recaptured in January 1920 and sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment, but was released under the general amnesty of July 1921.

In May of that year, prior to his release, he was elected as a Sinn Féin member for Kildare–Wicklow in the 1921 Irish election to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Once again all Sinn Féin members boycotted this parliament, sitting as the Second Dáil. In August 1921, he was appointed to cabinet as Secretary for Economic Affairs.

Barton was one of the Irish plenipotentiaries to travel to London for the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. His cousin was a secretary to the delegation. Barton reluctantly signed the Treaty on 6 December 1921, defending it &quot;as the lesser of two outrages forced upon me and between which I had to choose&quot;.

Although he had signed the Treaty and voted for it in the Dáil, he stood for election in June 1922 for Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, the only TD who had voted for the Treaty to do so, and won a seat in the Third Dáil. In common with other Anti-Treaty TDs, he did not take his seat. In October 1922 he was appointed Minister for Economic Affairs in de Valera&#x27;s &quot;Emergency Government&quot;, a shadow government in opposition to the Provisional Government and later to the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Barton&#x27;s memoir of this period was completed in 1954, and can be seen on the Bureau of Military History website. He was arrested and interned for most of the war at the Curragh Camp.

Barton was defeated at the 1923 general election, and retired from politics in favour of the law. He practiced as a barrister, and later became a judge. He was chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation from 1934 to 1954. Barton died at home in County Wicklow on 10 August 1975, at the age of 94, the last surviving signatory of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Éamon de Valera died only nineteen days later, on 29 August 1975.

==Interview==
In 1969, RTÉ Television interviewed Barton, alongside Ernest Blythe and James Ryan, about the 1918 general election.

==Glendalough House==
Glendalough House, run by Barton for over 70 years until his death, is still considered one of Ireland&#x27;s most notable properties, alongside nearby Powerscourt Estate. The house was the center of numerous political meetings and gatherings from 1910 to 1922. It&#x27;s also been featured as a location in many large Hollywood films including &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;.

Barton&#x27;s grandfather Thomas Johnston Barton, who acquired Glendalough House in 1838, was a younger son of Hugh Barton, owner of the Langoa Barton and Léoville Barton vineyards in France and co-founder of the Bordeaux wine house of Barton &amp; Guestier. The vineyards are now owned by Lilian Barton, a descendant of Hugh Barton’s eldest son, and she and her husband Michel Sartorius added Château Mauvesin Barton to these domaines in 2011.

<text>DnaA is a protein that activates initiation of DNA replication in bacteria. Based on the Replicon Model, a positively active initiator molecule contacts with a particular spot on a circular chromosome called the replicator to start DNA replication. It is a replication initiation factor which promotes the unwinding of DNA at oriC. The DnaA proteins found in all bacteria engage with the DnaA boxes to start chromosomal replication. The onset of the initiation phase of DNA replication is determined by the concentration of DnaA. DnaA accumulates during growth and then triggers the initiation of replication. Replication begins with active DnaA binding to 9-mer (9-bp) repeats upstream of oriC. Binding of DnaA leads to strand separation at the 13-mer repeats. This binding causes the DNA to loop in preparation for melting open by the helicase DnaB.

== Function ==
DnaA consists mainly in two different forms, the active ATP-form and the inactive ADP. The level of active DnaA within a cell is low immediately after a cell has divided. Although the active form of DnaA requires ATP, the formation of the &quot;oriC&quot;/DnaA complex and subsequent DNA unwinding does not require ATP hydrolysis.

The &quot;oriC&quot; site in &quot;E. coli&quot; has three AT rich 13 base pair regions (DUEs) followed by four 9 bp regions with the sequence TTAT(C or A)CA(C or A)A. DnaA molecules bind to the 9 bp regions, which wrap around the proteins causing the DNA at the AT-rich region to unwind. There are currently 11 DnaA binding sites identified within &quot;oriC&quot;, to which DnaA binds with differential affinity. When DNA replication is about to commence, DnaA occupies all of the high and low affinity binding sites. The denatured AT-rich region allows for the recruitment of DnaB (helicase), which complexes with DnaC (helicase loader). DnaC helps the helicase to bind to and to properly accommodate the ssDNA at the 13 bp region; this is accomplished by ATP hydrolysis, after which DnaC is released. Single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the single DNA strands in order to maintain the replication bubble. DnaB is a 5&#x27;→3&#x27; helicase, so it travels on the lagging strand. It associates with DnaG (a primase) to form the only primer for the leading strand and to add RNA primers on the lagging strand. The interaction between DnaG and DnaB is necessary to control the longitude of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. DNA polymerase III is then able to start DNA replication.

DnaA is made up of four domains: the first is the N-terminal that associates with regulatory proteins, the second is a helical linker region, the third domain is a AAA+ region that binds to ATP, and the fourth domain is the C-terminal DNA binding region. DnaA contains two conserved regions: the first is located in the central part of the protein and corresponds to the ATP-binding domain, the second is located in the C-terminal half and is involved in DNA-binding.

== DnaA mutants ==
The first strains to have the dnaA gene mutated were the temperature-sensitive K-12 strains CRT46 and CRT83, with the corresponding strain numbers beingdnaA46 and dnaA83. In contrary to dnaA mutants, the PC2 strain has a mutation in the dnaC gene, which codes for the loading factor for the DNA helicase dnaB.

== Synthesis ==
DnaA has the ability to bind its own promoter. When DnaA binds to its own promoter it blocks RNA polymerase from binding the promoter and inhibits initiation of transcription. In this way, DnaA is able to regulate its own expression. This process is called autoregulation.

== Regulation ==
Each cell division cycle triggers a new round of chromosome replication with the accumulation of DnaA, the initiator protein, on the OriC region of DNA. It is crucial to regulate DnaA-ATP monomer interactions with oriC during helicase loading and unwinding of origin DNA for precise timing. DnaA recognition sites in Escherichia coli are arranged in OriC to facilitate staged pre-replication complex assembling, with DnaA interacting with low affinity sites as it oligomerizes to fill the gaps between high affinity sites as it oligomerizes. There may be numerous gap-filling strategies to link OriC functions to bacterial lifestyles in nature, which may account for the wide variability of OriC DnaA recognition site patterns. The two forms of DnaA, the active ATP- and ADP-form are regulated. The ATP-form is converted to the ADP-form through either Regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA), which in turn consists of the Hda protein and the β sliding clamp (DnaN) and &quot;datA-&quot;dependent DnaA-ATP hydrolysis. The ADP-form is converted to the ATP-form by DnaA-reactivating sequences 1 and 2 (DARS1 and DARS2). 

Regulation of DnaA binding to DNA at OriC 

Since DNA replication must occur irreversibly and only once per cycle, the binding behavior of DnaA complexes to OriC is a highly regulated, and therefore dependent on many other cellular mechanisms. While all OriC sites are bound at replication initiation, there are three high-affinity binding sites–R1, R2, and R4–that are typically occupied by DnaA for the majority of the cell cycle, thus making their binding somewhat less dependent of other events happening within the cell at a given point in time. By contrast, the lower affinity sites are typically only bound to DnaA complexes right before replication begins. There are currently eight identified sites with lower DnaA/OriC binding affinity: R5 (or R5M), I1, I2, I3 and R3, tau2, C1, C2 and C3. Between the R1 and R2 high affinity sites exist the R5M, tau2, I1, and I2 low affinity sites, and C3, C2, 13, and C1 exist between the R2 and R4 sites. The I sites, tau2, C2, and C3 sites preferentially bind with and are more efficient at binding to DnaA in its ATP-bound active form (DnaA-ATP) prior to DNA strand separation, whereas the R1-R5 sites and C1 site have not demonstrated a preference for binding with DnaA-ATP over DnaA-ADP. OriC binding with active DnaA-ATP complexes at the lower affinity I sites, as well as the tau2, C2, and C3, sites is required for the strand separation process to initiate in a time regulated manner, meaning DnaA-ATP cannot be substituted with inactive DnaA-ADP complexes to initiate replication properly and with sufficient regulation. Recent studies suggest that while OriC sites bound entirely to DnaA-ADP complexes are capable of preparing the cell for DNA replication, they struggle to maintain the healthy and consistent replication frequency regulation cells continuing OriC sites bound to DnaA-ATP complexes achieve, perhaps explaining why some sites bind preferentially to the active DnaA conformation over the inactive conformation. Two other proteins, an integration host factor (IHF) protein and a DnaA initiator associating (DiaA) protein, help facilitate the binding of DnaA-ATP complexes to the OriC sites and set the stage for replication initiation to occur.

IHF plays a key functional role positively regulating the binding of DnaA complexes to the lower affinity OriC sites as the cell prepares for replication, essentially evening the playing field between the high and low affinity OriC sites in terms of their ability to bind with DnaA complexes. Cooperative binding is thought to be a mechanism in which the high-affinity sites supply the lower-affinity sites within their vicinity with DnaA-ATP complexes in the moments leading up to replication initiation. While DnaA can saturate all OriC binding sites in systems lacking IHF, a much higher concentration of DnaA is needed in the cellular environment for this to be achieved. However, in these situations, cells also experience a loss of synchronization in their replication initiation timing, indicating how important IHF is for maintaining consistent regulation of this process in cells and preventing a lag in the initiation of replication. When IHF is present in a cellular system, IHF enhances DnaA binding to low affinity OriC sites without any need for increasing the baseline concentration of DnaA present, further highlighting its importance in maintaining replication initiation timing. 

Conformationally, IHF assists in promoting the process of DnaA-ATP complexes binding to the low affinity OriC binding sites at the right time by binding to a different site on OriC ahead of replication initiation, causing DNA it to bend in such a way that facilitates efficient binding with DnaA-ATP complexes. Prior to IHF binding to OriC, a different protein, factor for inversion stimulation (FIS) protein, is bound to DNA for the majority of the cell cycle (with the exception of the events leading up to replication initiation), inhibiting the binding of IHF to DNA. Consequently, the binding of DnaA complexes to the lower affinity OriC sites is also inhibited, thus, preventing the chromosomal replication process from starting prematurely and thereby demonstrating how FIS positively regulates the maintenance of a consistent cell cycle progression via inhibition. As FIS binding to OriC weakens, IHF begins to bind to OriC, therefore increasing the low affinity sites’ ability to bind to DnaA-ATP complexes, concurrent with IHF binding. The switch from FIS binding to IHF binding to DNA is hypothesized to be brought about by the generation of more DnaA-ATP complexes, promoted by the existence of the high affinity sites bound to DnaA while FIS is concurrently bound to DNA, which are then recruited to the high affinity region and build up, exerting a conformational stress on bound FIS (especially by accumulation at the R2 site, as it is closest to the FIS binding site), thereby deteriorating its binding ability with DNA. As a result, IHF can take advantage of the weakened state of FIS binding so that it can then bind to its own respective OriC site, causing DNA to bend and essentially align the accumulated DnaA-ATP complexes better with the low affinity binding sites, thus aiding in the facilitation of their binding with DnaA-ATP. In the absence of the switch-like behavior that occurs with the transition from FIS to IHF binding to DNA, cells are unable to maintain a control over the sequence of events that ensure replication initiation happens both irreversibly and only once per cell cycle. 

DiaA positively regulates the replication initiation timeline by facilitating the binding of DnaA-ATP complexes on OriC sites. DiaA binds to DnaA in its tetrameric form (consisting of four DiaA protomers (individual proteins) bound to one another), specifically to the first domain of DnaA–in the same region where another protein, replicative DNA helicase (DnaB), is presumed to bind with DnaA. Due to its tetrameric structure, DiaA has the ability to bind to multiple DnaA-ATP complexes at a time, as each protamer within the homotetramer consists of an DnaA-ATP binding site. This beneficial characteristic of DiaA tetramers can aid in promoting the cooperative binding behavior of transferring DnaA-ATP molecules to different sites on the OriC region of DNA as the cell prepares to undergo chromosomal replication. DiaA also negatively regulates the chromosomal replication process by inhibiting the binding of the DnaB protein, whose presence and function is required for chromosomal replication, from binding to DnaA-ATP complexes assembled on OriC, therefore helping to preserve the inflexible regulation sequence of events needed for a controlled replication process and prevents asynchronous initiation within the overall cycle cycle. Thus, taken together, IHF and DiaA, along with the proteins they interact with in their respective binding mechanisms, are very both important for helping DnaA-ATP complexes bind to all the identified binding sites on OriC, including the low affinity sites, within a timely manner that ensures replication initiation occurs irreversibly and only a single time during the cell cycle. 

Once replication initiation has occurred and DNA has undergone strand separation successfully, a different process commences to make sure DnaA-ATP cannot bind directly to DNA again with a protein that negatively regulates replication initiation–the locus of datA–SeqA. When DNA unwinds post-initiation, new replication forks are generated, a process that subsequently leads to the unbinding of DnaA complexes from the OriC sites. DNA’s GATC sites within OriC and at the region where the &quot;dnaA&quot; promoter exists become hemimethylated, and therefore experience a reduced ability to function and express the same way as they would while methylated. SeqA is able to physically prevent replication from starting up again prematurely by binding to the hemimethylated GATA sites on OriC–many of which somewhat overlap with a couple of the low affinity binding DnaA binding sites, as well as IHF’s binding site on OriC–essentially shielding IHF and DnaA from binding to OriC. However, the high affinity OriC DnaA complex binding sites are not blocked by SeqA binding to DNA, thus explaining how DnaA stays bound to the three high affinity sites throughout the majority of the cycle cycle duration. When GATC sites are bound to SeqA while hemimethylated, they are limited in their ability to synthesize new DnaA proteins as well, thus causing DnaA concentration within the cell to decline post initiation. Thus, with these sites blocked by SeqA, DnaA-ATP binding to some of the lower affinity sites is not possible for a combination of reasons. In studies performed with strains lacking the ability to produce SeqA, cells were unable to synchronously initiate replication once per cycle, mirroring the effects of what happens when cells lack IHF. Since the binding of the low affinity sites on OriC are basically the key event that kick start replication initiation and DNA’s unraveling, SeqA’s blocking of DnaA-ATP complex binding during the majority of the cell cycle is vital for keep cells healthy by maintaining a consistent cycle.

== DnaA protein structure ==
There are four disciplines within the DnaA protein. An initial comparison of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; proteins led to the discovery of a sphere structure, which revealed a relatively conserved N-terminus and a largely conserved large C-terminus separated by a region that was mostly variable. As an example, the Enterobacterial proteins have nearly identical N- and C-terminal sequences, however they are characterized by numerous amino acid adjustments, elisions, and insertions in the variable regions. There is an AAA+ family ATPase motif and an independent DNA binding sphere in the C-terminal region. It was determined by NMR that Escherichia coli sphere IV had a crystal-clear structure when complexed with a DnaA- box. As a result, it was confirmed that the DNA list is intermediated by a combination of a helix-turn-helix motif and an introductory circle. When bound to ATP, but not to ADP, DnaA forms a super-helical structure with four monomers per turn. The structure of sphere I has been determined from three additional bacterial species and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; by NMR.

== Autoregulation of DnaA protein synthesis ==

The research on dnaA(Ts) mutants provided the first proof that the dnaA gene is autoregulated. DnaA protein is still produced at non-permissive temperatures where it is inactive, but in some mutants it can be made active again by returning to a temperature that is conducive to development. This reversible initiation capacity—which was larger than anticipated given the mass gain of the culture—could be seen in the absence of protein synthesis at the permissive temperature and suggested that the DnaA protein synthesis was derepressed at the high growth temperature. These results prompted a thorough investigation of the dnaA46 mutant under permissive, intermediate, and non-permissive development conditions. The study&#x27;s findings revealed that as growth temperature increased, the DnaA46 protein&#x27;s activity decreased, leading to progressively decreasing DNA and origin concentrations at intermediate temperatures. An increase in initiation capacity was seen concurrently with a decrease in DnaA protein activity. Hansen and Rasmussen (1977) argued that the DnaA protein had a positive effect in replication initiation aing transcripts entering the dnaA gene were found as a result of sequencing the dnaA promoter region and the dnaA gene. The DnaA promoter region has nine GATC sites within 225 base pairs, and a sequence that is similar to nd a negative role in its own synthesis based on these observations. Two promoters providrepetitions (DnaA-boxes) in the oriC region was found between the two promoters. According to several studies, the DnaA protein negatively regulates both promoters. In these research, it was discovered that the dnaA transcription was upregulated by 4- to 5-fold at non-permissive temperatures in dnaATs mutants and repressed by the same amount when DnaA protein was overproduced. The autoregulation of the dnaA gene requires the DnaA-box. The sequence of the dnaA2p promoter region has some intriguing characteristics that can be seen more clearly. This promoter contains two GATC sites, one in the 10 sequence and the other in the 35 sequence, and both in vivo and in vitro, methylation increases transcription from this promoter by a factor of two. In addition, DnaA protein binds to regions upstream of the dnaA2p promoter with a high affinity.

<doc id="505463" wikidata="Q2340387" url="?curid=505463" title="Eyeglass prescription">
<text>An eyeglass prescription is an order written by an eyewear prescriber, such as an optometrist, that specifies the value of all parameters the prescriber has deemed necessary to construct and/or dispense corrective lenses appropriate for a patient. If an eye examination indicates that corrective lenses are appropriate, the prescriber generally provides the patient with an eyewear prescription at the conclusion of the exam.

The parameters specified on spectacle prescriptions vary, but typically include the patient&#x27;s name, power of the lenses, any prism to be included, the pupillary distance, expiration date, and the prescriber&#x27;s signature. The prescription is typically determined during a refraction, using a phoropter and asking the patient which of two lenses is better, or by an automated refractor, or through the technique of retinoscopy. A dispensing optician will take a prescription written by an optometrist and order and/or assemble the frames and lenses to then be dispensed to the patient.
==Components of a sphero-cylindrical correction==

===Sphere component===

Every corrective lens prescription includes a spherical correction in diopters. Convergent powers are positive (e.g., +4.00 D) and condense light to correct for farsightedness/long-sightedness (hyperopia) or allow the patient to read more comfortably (see presbyopia and binocular vision disorders). Divergent powers are negative (e.g., −3.75 D) and spread out light to correct for nearsightedness/short-sightedness (myopia). If neither convergence nor divergence is required in the prescription, &quot;plano&quot; is used to denote a refractive power of zero.

The term &quot;sphere&quot; comes from the geometry of lenses. Lenses derive their power from curved surfaces. A spherical lens has the same curvature in every direction perpendicular to the optical axis. Spherical lenses are adequate correction when a person has no astigmatism. To correct for astigmatism, the &quot;cylinder&quot; and &quot;axis&quot; components specify how a particular lens is different from a lens composed of purely spherical surfaces.

===Cylinder component===
Patients with astigmatism need a cylindrical lens, or more generally a toric lens to see clearly. The geometry of a toric lens focuses light differently in different meridians. A meridian, in this case, is a plane that is incident with the optical axis. For example, a toric lens, when rotated correctly, could focus an object to the image of a horizontal line at one focal distance while focusing a vertical line to a separate focal distance.

The power of a toric lens can be specified by describing how the cylinder (the meridian that is most different from the spherical power) differs from the spherical power. Power evenly transitions between the two powers as you move from the meridian with the most convergence to the meridian with the least convergence. For regular toric lenses, these powers are perpendicular to each other and their location relative to vertical and horizontal are specified by the axis component.

There are two different conventions for indicating the amount of cylinder: &quot;plus cylinder notation&quot; and &quot;minus cylinder notation&quot;. In the former, the cylinder power is a number of diopters more convergent than the sphere power. That means the spherical power describes the most divergent meridian and the cylindrical component describes the most convergent. In the minus cylinder notation, the cylinder power is a number of diopters more divergent than the sphere component. In this convention, the sphere power describes the most convergent meridian and the cylinder component describes the most divergent. Europe typically follows the plus cylinder convention while in the United States the minus cylinder notation is used by optometrists and the plus cylinder notation is used by ophthalmologists. Minus cylinder notation is also more common in Asia, although either style may be encountered there. There is no difference in these forms of notation and it is easy to convert between them: 
* Add the sphere and cylinder numbers together to produce the converted sphere
* Invert the sign of cylinder value
* Add 90° to axis value, and if the new axis value exceeds 180°, subtract 180° from the result
For example, a lens with a vertical power of −3.75 and a horizontal power of −2.25 could be specified as either −2.25 −1.50 × 180 or −3.75 +1.50 × 090.

===Axis component===
The axis defines the location of the sphere and cylinder powers. The name &quot;axis&quot; comes from the concept of generating a cylinder by rotating a line around an axis. The curve of that cylinder is 90° from that axis of rotation. When dealing with toric lenses, the axis defines the orientation of the steepest and flattest curvatures relative to horizontal and vertical. The &quot;3 o&#x27;clock&quot; position is defined as zero, and the 90th meridian is a vertical line. A horizontal line passes through both zero and the 180th meridians. By convention, a horizontal axis is recorded as 180.

In a regular toric lens, the flattest and steepest curvatures are separated by 90°. As a result, the axis of the cylinder is also the meridian with the same power as the recorded sphere power. The cylinder power, as defined above is the power that is most different from the sphere power. Because they are defined relative to each other, it is important to know if the lens is being described in minus cylinder notation, where the sphere power is the most convergent / least divergent power. When using plus cylinder notation, the opposite is true.

If the lens is spherical (there is no cylinder component) then there is no need for an axis. A prescription like this is written with D.S. (diopters sphere) after the sphere power (e.g., −3.00 D.S.). This verifies that the prescription is truly spherical rather than the cylinder power being omitted in error. 

====Summary====
* correction power is measured in diopters
* by convention, an axis of 90° is vertical, 0° or 180° are horizontal
* if the cylinder power is positive, the lens is most convergent 90° from the axis
* if the cylinder power is negative, the lens is most divergent 90° from the axis
* if the cylinder power is zero, the lens is spherical and has the same power in every meridian

=====Sample prescription=====
A prescription of &quot;−1.00 +0.25 × 180&quot; describes a lens that has a horizontal power of −1.00 D and a vertical power of −0.75 D. Only ophthalmologists write prescriptions in + cylinder. An optometrist would write a prescription in - (minus) cylinder. All spectacle and contact lenses would be made in minus cylinder. Therefore, the above prescription would be written as −0.75 −0.25 × 90.

==Abbreviations and terms==
Similar to medical prescriptions, eyeglass prescriptions are written on paper pads or included in a patient&#x27;s electronic health record, and contain a number of different abbreviations and terms:
*&quot;DV&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;distance vision&quot;. This specifies the part of the prescription designed primarily to improve far vision. In a bifocal lens, this generally indicates what is to be placed in the top segment.
*&quot;NV&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;near vision&quot;. This may represent a single-vision lens prescription to improve near work, or the reading portion of a bifocal lens. 
*&quot;OD&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;oculus dexter&quot;, Latin for &quot;right eye&quot; from the patient&#x27;s point of view. &quot;Oculus&quot; means &quot;eye&quot;.
*&quot;OS&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;oculus sinister&quot;, Latin for &quot;left eye&quot; from the patient&#x27;s point of view.
*&quot;OU&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;oculi uterque&quot;, Latin for &quot;both eyes&quot;.
*:N.B.: In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, &quot;RE&quot; (right eye), &quot;LE&quot; (left eye), and &quot;BE&quot; (both eyes) are used. Sometimes, just &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; are used.
*&quot;SPH&quot;, &quot;CYL&quot;, and &quot;AXIS&quot; are values for describing the power of the lens using plus cylinder or minus cylinder notation.
*&quot;ADD&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Near Addition&quot;. This is the additional refractive power to be combined, or added, to the distance power to achieve the ideal near power.
*&quot;Prism&quot; and &quot;Base&quot; Prism refers to a displacement of the image through the lens, often used to treat strabismus and other binocular vision disorders. The prism value is measured in prism diopters, and &quot;Base&quot; refers to the direction of displacement.
* PL is an abbreviation for plano or plain, meaning no prescription
*&quot;PD&quot; or &quot;IPD&quot; Pupillary Distance or Interpupillary Distance, respectively. It is the distance between pupil centers.
*&quot;BVD&quot; Back vertex distance is the distance between the back of the spectacle lens and the front of the cornea (the front surface of the eye). This is significant in higher prescriptions (usually beyond ±4.00D) as slight changes in the vertex distance for in this range can cause a power to be delivered to the eye other than what was prescribed.
