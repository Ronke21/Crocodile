<text>HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; was the third of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

After the Grand Fleet was dissolved in early 1919, &quot;Conqueror&quot; was transferred back to the Home Fleet for a few months before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The ship was sold for scrap in late 1922 and subsequently broken up.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Orion&quot;-class ships were designed in response to the beginning of the Anglo-German naval arms race and were much larger than their predecessors of the to accommodate larger, more powerful guns and heavier armour. In recognition of these improvements, the class was sometimes called &quot;super-dreadnoughts&quot;. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load as built; by 1918 &quot;Conqueror&quot;″s deep displacement had increased to . Her crew numbered 752 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials on 7 June 1912, &quot;Conqueror&quot; reached a maximum speed of from . The ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. These guns were split evenly between the forward and aft superstructure, all in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 20 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;Orion&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===
In 1914 the shelter-deck guns were enclosed in casemates. By October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been added. A fire-control director was installed on a platform below the spotting top before May 1915. Additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, three 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure. Two flying-off platforms were fitted aboard the ship during 1917–1918; these were mounted on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turret roofs and extended onto the gun barrels. A high-angle rangefinder was fitted in the forward superstructure by 1921.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Conqueror&quot;, named after a French fire ship, , that had been captured in 1745, was the seventh ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down by William Beardmore and Company at their shipyard in Dalmuir on 5 April 1910 and launched on 1 May 1911. She was commissioned with a partial crew on 23 November 1912, but was not completed until March 1913, after which the remainder of her crew arrived. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,891,164 or £1,860,648. The last of the four &quot;Orion&quot;s to be completed, &quot;Conqueror&quot; and her sister ships comprised the Second Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) of the Home Fleet.

===World War I===

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Conqueror&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and the dreadnought struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German auxiliary minelayer . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Conqueror&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====
The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender&#x27;s 2nd BS, including &quot;Conqueror&quot; and her sisters and &quot;Monarch&quot;, and Beatty&#x27;s four battlecruisers.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness of 16 December in heavy weather. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces.

====1915–1916====
The Grand Fleet conducted another fruitless sweep of the North Sea in late December and, while trying to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, &quot;Monarch&quot; was accidentally rammed by &quot;Conqueror&quot; on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at the entrance and &quot;Conqueror&quot; could not avoid her. The latter ship&#x27;s bow was badly damaged and she received temporary repairs at Scapa and Invergordon before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs, rejoining the Grand Fleet in March 1915.

On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April. Jellicoe&#x27;s ships swept the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Conqueror&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December.
The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Conqueror&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Conqueror&quot;, under the command of Captain Hugh Tothill, was the seventh ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. The ship may have had engine problems during the battle because she was having trouble maintaining 20 knots as a signal from Jellicoe at 17:17 instructed &quot;Thunderer&quot; to overtake &quot;Conqueror&quot; if she could not maintain speed. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired three salvos from her main guns at one battleship at 18:31 without visible effect. She then shifted her fire to the crippled light cruiser , although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. At 19:12, &quot;Conqueror&quot; fired her main guns at enemy destroyers without result and then again, at different destroyers at 19:25 with her aft turrets. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle, having expended a total of 57 twelve-inch shells (41 common pointed, capped and 16 armour-piercing, capped).

====Subsequent activity====

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November and she remained part of the 2nd BS through 1 March 1919.

By 1 May, &quot;Conqueror&quot; had been assigned to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet. On 1 November, the 3rd BS was disbanded and &quot;Conqueror&quot; was transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, together with her sisters. The ship was still in Portland as of 18 December 1920, but was transferred to Portsmouth before June 1921 when she relieved &quot;Orion&quot; as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet there. &quot;Conqueror&quot; was listed for disposal in June 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. On 19 December the ship was sold for scrap to the Upnor Shipbreaking Co. and she arrived at Upnor on 30 January 1923 to begin demolition.

<text>HMS &quot;Thunderer&quot; was the fourth and last dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

After the Grand Fleet was dissolved in early 1919, &quot;Thunderer&quot; was transferred back to the Home Fleet for a few months before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The ship was converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and served in that role until she was sold for scrap in late 1926. While being towed to the scrapyard, &quot;Thunderer&quot; ran aground; the ship was refloated and subsequently broken up.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Orion&quot;-class ships were designed in response to the beginnings of the Anglo-German naval arms race and were much larger than their predecessors of the to accommodate larger, more powerful guns and heavier armour. In recognition of these improvements, the class was sometimes called &quot;super-dreadnoughts&quot;. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load as built; by 1918 &quot;Thunderer&quot;″s deep displacement had increased to . Her crew numbered 738 officers and ratings when completed in 1912 and 1,107 in 1917.

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by 18 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials on 5 March 1912, &quot;Thunderer&quot; reached a maximum speed of from , although hampered by a boiler malfunction. The ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. These guns were split evenly between the forward and aft superstructure, all in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 20 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;Orion&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===

A prototype fire-control director was installed sometime before November 1912, on a platform below the spotting top. In 1914 the shelter-deck guns were enclosed in casemates and by October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns were installed aboard each ship. Additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, a pair of four-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure. Two flying-off platforms were fitted aboard the ship during 1917–1918; these were mounted on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turret roofs and extended onto the gun barrels. A high-angle rangefinder was fitted in the forward superstructure by 1921.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Thunderer&quot; was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy and was laid down by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at their shipyard in Poplar, London on 13 April 1910 and launched on 1 February 1911. She was commissioned on 15 June 1912 at Devonport. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,892,823 or £1,885,145. &quot;Thunderer&quot; and her sister ships comprised the Second Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) of the Home Fleet. The ship, together with her sisters and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres with Vice-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg commanding the &quot;Blue Fleet&quot; aboard &quot;Thunderer&quot;. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with &quot;Orion&quot; to evaluate the effectiveness of the former&#x27;s gunnery director. &quot;Thunderer&quot; decisively outshot the latter ship, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from &quot;Orion&quot;″s guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and &quot;Orion&quot; performed much better, apparently beating &quot;Thunderer&quot;. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913. During the annual manoeuvres in August, &quot;Thunderer&quot; was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the &quot;Red Fleet&quot;. On 4 November, &quot;Thunderer&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, the dreadnought and the predreadnought fired at and sank the target ship to give their crews experience in firing live ammunition against a real ship.

===World War I===

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Thunderer&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and the dreadnought struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German armed merchant cruiser . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Thunderer&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. On 8 December, she sailed to Devonport for a brief refit to fix problems with her condensers.

====1915–1916====
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Thunderer&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Thunderer&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.
The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Thunderer&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December.

The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Thunderer&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six predreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Thunderer&quot;, under the command of Captain James Fergusson, was the eighth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. At 18:27 the ship briefly fired at the crippled light cruiser , although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown, until her view was blocked by other British ships. Less than an hour later, &quot;Thunderer&quot; sighted two German dreadnoughts visible between and at about 19:15. She fired three salvoes of common pointed, capped (CPC) at the leading ship, but no hits were made and the second salvo was actually fired over the top of &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, before her view was totally obscured. After sunset, the battlecruiser spotted the four &quot;Orion&quot;-class ships at 22:30 and signalled a challenge to &quot;Thunderer&quot; before . Fergusson chose not to engage without an obvious threat lest he reveal the location of the battlefleet. &quot;Thunderer&quot; fired just thirty-seven 13.5-inch shells (all CPC) during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November and she remained part of the 2nd BS through 1 March 1919.

By 1 May, &quot;Thunderer&quot; had been assigned to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet. On 1 November, the 3rd BS was disbanded and &quot;Thunderer&quot; was transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, together with her sisters. She was temporarily recommissioned during the summers of 1920 to ferry troops to the Mediterranean and back. The ship was still in Portland as of 18 December 1920, but was converted into a naval cadet training ship at Rosyth beginning in February 1921. &quot;Thunderer&quot; recommissioned on 5 May, but did not begin her first training cruise until 24 June. The ship was relieved by the monitor on 31 August 1926 and paid off at Portsmouth.

On 6 November, &quot;Thunderer&quot; was sold for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow &amp; Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their scrapyard in Blyth and so was partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, she went back to Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep to allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.

<doc id="488496" wikidata="Q470572" url="?curid=488496" title="Jesus of Nazareth (TV series)">
<text>Jesus of Nazareth () is a 1977 epic television drama serial directed by Franco Zeffirelli and co-written by Anthony Burgess and Suso Cecchi d&#x27;Amico, which dramatizes the birth, life, ministry, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. It stars Robert Powell as Jesus, and features an all-star ensemble cast of renowned actors, including eight who had won or would go on to win Academy Awards: Anne Bancroft, Ernest Borgnine, Laurence Olivier, Christopher Plummer, Anthony Quinn, Rod Steiger, James Earl Jones and Peter Ustinov.

Some scenes were added during the writing process, with some characters (such as Zerah) added for brevity or dramatic effect. &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; depicts Judas Iscariot as initially well-intentioned, but later as a selfish dupe of Zerah&#x27;s who betrays Jesus largely as a result of Zerah&#x27;s false platitudes and pretexts. However, in accordance with the Gospels, the film depicts Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea as sympathetic members of the Sanhedrin. Many of the miracles of Jesus, such as the changing of water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the transfiguration, and the calming of the storm, are not shown, although Jesus&#x27;s healing of Jairus&#x27;s daughter, healing the centurion&#x27;s servant, the blind man and the crippled woman on the Sabbath, the feeding of the multitude, and the raising of Lazarus from the dead are presented.

&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; premiered on 27 March 1977, on the Italian channel Rai 1, and was first aired in the United Kingdom, on 3 April 1977, on the ITV Network. It was a huge ratings success and received acclaim, with particular praise for Powell&#x27;s portrayal of Jesus.

==Plot summary==
The narrative of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; is a kind of cinematic &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, or Gospel harmony, blending all four New Testament accounts. It presents Jesus as both God and man. During the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, John speaks God&#x27;s words &quot;this is my beloved son.&quot; The familiar Christian episodes are presented chronologically: the betrothal, and later marriage, of Mary and Joseph; the Annunciation; the Visitation; the circumcision of John the Baptist; the Nativity of Jesus; the visit of the Magi; the circumcision of Jesus; the Census of Quirinius; the flight into Egypt and Massacre of the Innocents; the Finding in the Temple; the Baptism of Jesus.

Gospel accounts depicted also include the woman caught in adultery; the healing of Jairus&#x27; daughter; Jesus helping Peter catch the fish; the Parable of the Prodigal Son; a dialogue between Jesus and Barabbas (non-Biblical); Matthew&#x27;s dinner party; the Sermon on the Mount; debating with Joseph of Arimathea; the curing of the blind man at the pool; the Raising of Lazarus (John 11:43); the Feeding of the Five Thousand; the entry into Jerusalem; Jesus and the money changers; the Parable of the Two Sons; healing the centurion&#x27;s servant; dialogue with Nicodemus; the Last Supper; the
betrayal of Jesus by Judas.

At the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus, Jesus is accused of blasphemy for calling himself the son of the God of Israel. Caiaphas announces &quot;the LORD our God, the LORD is one&quot;, denying the God of Israel has a son. Ensuing scenes include Peter&#x27;s denial of Christ and subsequent repenting; the judgment of Jesus by Pilate (&quot;Ecce Homo&quot;); the Johannine Passion Narrative (John 18–19; including the Agony in the Garden); the Carrying of the Cross; the Crucifixion of Christ (Sir Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Nicodemus recites the &quot;Suffering Servant&quot; passage (Isaiah 53:3-5) as he looks helplessly on the crucified Messiah); the discovery of the empty tomb; and an appearance of the Risen Christ to his Disciples. The storyline concludes with the non-Biblical character Zerah and his colleagues gazing despairingly into the empty tomb. Zerah laments, &quot;Now it begins. It all begins&quot;.

===Previous collaborations with Zeffirelli===
Several cast members had already featured in previous Zeffirelli productions. British actors Hussey, York, Holder, Lovell and Skinner had featured in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as Juliet, Tybalt, Peter, Sampson and Balthasar respectively. Additionally, Olivier did uncredited work as the narrator and dubbing voice of Lord Montague. Colizzi, who appeared as Jobab, had previously dubbed York&#x27;s Tybalt in the Italian version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
The drama was conceived when Lew Grade was received by Pope Paul VI, who congratulated him on the making of &quot;Moses the Lawgiver&quot;, a 1974 television film starring Burt Lancaster and produced by Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment and the Italian television network RAI. At the end of the interview, the Pope told him he hoped his next project would be about the life of Jesus. Two weeks later, while dining with an RAI executive, Grade told him he intended their companies to prepare such a film. Directing duties were offered to Franco Zeffirelli – a religious Roman Catholic who knew the Pontiff from his days as the Archbishop of Milan, when he often visited Zeffirelli&#x27;s school – on the Pope&#x27;s initiative, who insisted that either he would make &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; or no one else. The director rejected the proposal at first, but Grade finally convinced him to agree; he accepted the job shortly before Christmas 1973.

Screenwriter Anthony Burgess later recounted the launching of the project in an essay entitled &quot;Telejesus (or Mediachrist)&quot;:The notion of making a six-hour television film on the life of Jesus Christ was proposed by an ennobled British Jew, with the golden blessing of an American automobile corporation. The project struck some as blasphemous, others as ecumenical. Lord Grade, then Sir Lew Grade, presided over a massive press conference in the Holy City, (Rome), and said all that was available to be said—namely, that there would be this film, that Zeffirelli would direct it, and that Burgess would write it. Fired by this announcement, the Romans laid on a great, as it were, First Supper, which the Chief Rabbi of Rome attended, as well as various cricket-playing British ecclesiastics. Sir Lew Grade was made a Cavaliere of the Republic. The Pope was noticeably absent.

Both Grade and Zeffirelli insisted their adaptation of Jesus&#x27;s life should be &quot;ecumenical&quot;, coherent, even to non-believers, and &quot;acceptable to all denominations&quot;. To ensure the film&#x27;s accuracy, the producers consulted experts from the Vatican, the Leo Baeck Rabbinical College of London, and the Koranic School at Meknes, Morocco. However, when Zeffirelli asked Rabbi Albert Friedlander to help him create Jesus&#x27;s Bar Mitzvah scene, the latter replied that such ceremonies were practised only from the 15th century. The director, however, insisted on including it, and Friedlander tried to teach child actor Lorenzo Monet to read a short portion of the Pentateuch in Hebrew. Monet, however, mumbled it and the director was not satisfied (in the film, boy Jesus reads mostly in English).

===Filming===
Principal photography was carried out in Morocco and Tunisia from September 1975 to May 1976. The synagogue scenes were shot with extras from the Jewish community in the island of Djerba. The city of Monastir in Tunisia served as 1st-century Jerusalem. Ernest Borgnine, who portrayed Cornelius the Centurion, recalled that since regulations required hiring local extras—most with poor English—for many of the smaller roles, they had to be dubbed. Zeffirelli decided to avoid recording sound altogether in many parts, and simply send the principal actors to dub their own characters in the studio later. The standing sets of the film were later used by the British comedy troupe Monty Python for their religious satire &quot;Life of Brian&quot; (1979).

Reports regarding the size of the drama&#x27;s budget vary: &quot;Presbyterian Survey&quot; stated it was $12 million, &quot;The Listener&quot; cited the figure of £9 million (roughly $16 million), while &quot;Third Way&quot; stated it cost £11.5 million (roughly $20 million). Other sources give the sum of $18 million. In his autobiography, Grade wrote that &quot;in the final accounting, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; took $45 million.&quot;

===Casting Powell as Jesus===
The producers at first considered choosing a well-known star, who would draw a large audience, for the role of Christ. The first actor thought of was Dustin Hoffman, and Al Pacino was also a candidate. Zeffirelli decided to look for an actor whom the audience would immediately identify as Jesus. For example, Hoffman and Pacino both stand at just 5&#x27;6&quot;, and neither man&#x27;s face bears a resemblance to Jesus as depicted in art, which has been based for many centuries on the image found on The Shroud of Turin. The image on the shroud is that of a man who is six feet tall. Eventually, the character&#x27;s likeness was influenced by Warner Sallman&#x27;s portrait painting &quot;Head of Christ&quot;: Paul Harvey and Edward J. Blum wrote the show &quot;put Sallman&#x27;s imagination in motion&quot;. The Virgin Mary was depicted by Olivia Hussey.

The idea to cast Robert Powell originated with Grade&#x27;s wife, Kathie Moody, who told her husband the actor had &quot;wonderful blue eyes&quot; after watching his performance in a BBC television adaptation of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;. Powell came under criticism from religious groups for &quot;living in sin&quot; with his companion, dancer Barbara Lord of Pan&#x27;s People, while intending to portray Jesus. The couple married shortly before production began. As of 2023, Powell and Lord have been married for 48 years.

Powell rarely blinks throughout the entire film, mimicking, in this respect, H. B. Warner in 1927&#x27;s &quot;The King of Kings&quot; and Max von Sydow in 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. This effect was a deliberate decision by Zeffirelli. James Houlden commented that the result was &quot;a penetrating, unrelenting eye contact with Jesus&#x27;s.&quot; A dark blue eyeliner was applied on set to accentuate Powell&#x27;s blue eyes. Powell&#x27;s portrayal has since become an often-used image in popular devotional art, and &quot;defined the visual image of Christ in the minds of the audience... Perhaps more than any other Jesus film.&quot;

For the crucifixion scene, Powell starved himself on a diet of only cheese for twelve days prior to shooting &quot;in order to look worn&quot;.

==Broadcasts and ratings==
&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; premiered on the Italian channel Rai 1 on 27 March 1977. It was broadcast in five episodes, one shown every week until 25 April. On Palm Sunday, 3 April 1977 – the date of the airing of the second episode – the Pope endorsed the programme in his public address for the holiday and recommended the faithful to view it. The series enjoyed high ratings: the German Dominican friar and film critic Ambros Eichenberger reported that according to local surveys, 84% of the television owners in the larger cities watched the series. For example, the number of viewers for the third episode, aired on 10 April, was estimated to have been 28.3 million.

In the United Kingdom and in the United States, it was broadcast in two parts, albeit in different lengths, by the ITV network in the UK and by NBC in the US. In both countries, the first part was aired on 3 April and the second on Easter, 10 April 1977. During its original showing in the UK, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; had an estimated audience of 21 million viewers.

When the first episode was broadcast in the US, it was a major success. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported it &quot;swamped all competing programs on Sunday night&quot;, with overnight Nielsen ratings of 53% in Los Angeles and 46% in New York City. The miniseries as a whole received a Nielsen rating of 30.8 points, with each point representing approximately 712,000 television-owning homes, and an audience share of 50% nationwide, on both nights. The company calculated that &quot;Jesus&quot; attracted about 90 million viewers.

In West Germany, it was broadcast by ZDF in four episodes on the 19th, 21st, 23rd and 24 March 1978; 40% of the audience have viewed it.

&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; turned into a massive commercial success and is one of the most widely marketed, most critically acclaimed and best-known productions about Christ&#x27;s life. Lew Grade stated that it made &quot;a net profit of $30 million.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Famously, Pope Paul VI praised Zeffirelli&#x27;s film, both in private comment and in a public address on Palm Sunday prior to the miniseries’ Holy Week debut on Italian television.

Reviews were also notably positive. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Tom Shales was effusive: “One is tempted to call it a miracle… [Zeffirelli] has an eye for composition and lighting that is unprecedented in television films…There may never have been a religious film with so pervasive a sense of place and period…. The intrinsic dramatic and symbolic values of the story, which have eluded past filmmakers, come through with striking clarity”. Shales praised Olivia Hussey as Mary for being “simultaneously fragile, mystified and strong”. However, “Powell&#x27;s appearance [as Jesus] is a drawback here. Though it may be commendable that he in no way resembles the fair-haired Aryan stereotype dominant in such films for years, Powell looks so wan and gaunt that one fears for his health. The work is, despite flaws, a truly impressive accomplishment.” 

Robert Powell&#x27;s performance as Jesus in particular has been praised by critics.

==Controversy==
Before its initial broadcast, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; came under ideological fire from some American Protestant fundamentalists, led by Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones University in South Carolina, and Dr. Bill Bright, because they felt the TV movie had to have the resurrection of Jesus Christ to be true to the Gospel account. Zeffirelli had told an interviewer from &quot;Modern Screen&quot; that the film would portray Jesus as &quot;an ordinary man – gentle, fragile, simple&quot;. Jones interpreted this as meaning that the portrayal would deny Christ&#x27;s divine nature. Having never seen the film, Jones denounced it as &quot;blasphemy&quot;. Others picked up the cry and 18,000 letters were sent to General Motors, which had provided $3 million of the film&#x27;s cost. Sacrificing its investment, GM backed out of its sponsorship. Procter and Gamble eventually took it over, buying the U.S. rights for a relatively low price of some $1 million. Their financial support allowed the mini-series to be screened after a simulated resurrection was added at the suggestion of Dr. Ted Baehr, a theologian and media pundit, who was friends with the producer, Vincenzo Labella, and acquainted with the protesters. The scenes showed the empty tomb, and then cuts to Jesus discussing his death and resurrection with his disciples.

==Narrative deviations from the Gospels==

Although the film has been received as generally faithful to the Gospel sources, and more comprehensive than previous film versions, Zeffirelli and his screenwriters found it necessary to take some liberties with the scriptures for purposes of brevity and narrative continuity. Some of these deviations have a basis in time-honoured, extra-Biblical traditions (e.g., that the infant Jesus was visited by three &quot;kings&quot;; the Bible calls them magi or &quot;astrologers&quot;, yet does not state how many there were). Other deviations were invented for the script:
* Perhaps the greatest liberties taken in the screenplay are interpretations of the motivation of Judas Iscariot in betraying Jesus to the authorities prior to his arrest and execution. In contrast to the Gospels – which vilify Judas as a thief who stole from the Disciples’ money purse (John 12:6) and betrayed his Master simply for money (Luke 22:5) – the film portrays Judas as a much-misunderstood political person who, in several scenes, conspires with the Zealots for the sake of Jewish liberation in a way that could be interpreted as honourable, albeit misguided.
* The film introduces a number of entirely original characters. Of these, Ian Holm&#x27;s Zerah, who is essentially the series &quot;main villain&quot;, has the most screen time. Zerah is used primarily to supply Judas Iscariot with a motive for his treachery: he persuades him that an appearance before the Sanhedrin will offer Jesus an opportunity to prove himself. He is also used to create a main lead villain when Jesus personally confronts the temple priesthood, in particular during the cleansing of the Temple and the Gethsemane arrest scene. Other invented characters include Quintillius, Yehuda and Amos.
* In the Bible, the only mention of Jesus in childhood is his trip to the temple in Jerusalem as a 12-year-old. In the film, the boy Jesus is also portrayed at his bar mitzvah, which is interrupted by a raid of Roman soldiers plundering supplies. The portrayal of a Bar Mitzvah is anachronistic as the ceremony most likely did not exist at that time. It was deliberately included by Zeffirelli because a modern non-Jewish audience might not be aware of that obscure fact and would expect to see it, and he did not want to defy audience expectation. The boy Jesus is also portrayed as climbing a ladder and looking out over the landscape of Judea after Joseph makes the analogy of a ladder reaching to heaven.
* The prostitute and the woman who anoints Jesus&#x27;s feet with ointment and her hair are combined into one person. The Bible indicates that Mary Magdalene (who is never actually said to be a prostitute) is the woman from whom seven demons were cast out, while the ointment-bearing woman is Mary of Bethany, a sister of Lazarus (John 11:2). Nevertheless, the identification of the three women is present in many Christian traditions and is not particular to the film.
* In the film, Nicodemus visits Jesus in the late afternoon, not at night as in John 3:3.
* The Apostle Andrew introduces Simon to Jesus as &quot;My brother, Simon Peter.&quot; But &quot;Peter&quot; is the name that Jesus later gave to Simon (John 1:42, Matthew 16:18) after he was well acquainted with him, not his original given name. Later in the drama, Jesus does give Simon the name of &quot;Peter&quot;.
* The Apostle Thomas, prior to his calling, is depicted as a servant of Jairus, the synagogue leader whose 12-year-old daughter Jesus raises from the dead. Nowhere in the three gospel accounts of this resurrection is Thomas the Apostle described as Jairus&#x27;s servant. This was done in the movie to conveniently introduce Thomas as the doubter when Jesus said Jairus&#x27;s dead daughter is &quot;only sleeping.&quot;
* Barabbas is portrayed in the film as a Zealot (political extremist and agitator). The meeting and dialogue between Jesus and Barabbas are made up.
* The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–32) is used as a plot device which simultaneously redeems the disciple Matthew and reconciles him to his bitter enemy, Simon Peter. Although not in the Bible, this has been praised as one of the film&#x27;s particularly felicitous innovations. (The Gospels do not record either a conflict or a particular friendship between Matthew and Simon Peter.)
* In the film, Pontius Pilate, having convicted Jesus of treason, sentences him to be crucified. The Gospels record that Pilate acquitted Jesus but sentenced Him under pressure from the crowd. The film implies such pressure to convict was applied prior to the trial, by the Sanhedrin, but does not explicitly state it. The film also shifts Pilate washing his hands to the scene in which he is introduced, rather than during the trial itself.
* The Gospels and the film both relate an account of a Roman centurion who petitions Jesus to heal his sick servant. The film, but not the Gospels, presents the same officer (portrayed by Ernest Borgnine) as one of the soldiers standing at the foot of the Cross, where he sympathetically allows Mary to approach her son.
* In the Bible Judas is paid 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. Full of remorse, he later gives the silver back to the priests (Matthew 27:3–5). In the film, Judas is given silver coins as an afterthought by Zerah; he does not return them and they are shown lying on the ground under the tree from which he hangs himself.
* The film depicts a scene that shows Joseph dying. The Gospels never mention anything about Joseph after the story of Jesus, as a boy, in the Temple. There is however a popular tradition in Roman Catholic religious art that shows Joseph dying in the presence of Jesus and Mary.
*In the film, Jesus continues wearing the red robe of a king, with which the Roman soldiers have dressed him up in order to mock him, up until the crucifixion. In the Gospel account, he is wearing his own clothes on the way to Calvary.
* The film depicts the Crown of Thorns being removed from Jesus&#x27;s head during the crucifixion process. This removal is never mentioned in the Gospels, and goes against the usual depiction of Jesus continuing to wear it whilst on the cross.
* The healing of the blind beggar scene, where Jesus spat on dirt and rubbed the mud in the blind man&#x27;s eyes, was set in the Temple; the whole of John 9 places this episode after Jesus had left the Temple and was &quot;walking along.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Special Drama. Additionally, James Farentino, who portrayed the apostle Peter, received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Drama Special.

The drama was nominated for six British Academy Television Awards: Best Actor, Best Cameraman, Best Single Television Play, Best Editor, Best Costume Design and Best Sound. It won none.

&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; won awards for Best Cinematography to Armando Nannuzzi, Best Costume Design to Lucia Mirisola and Best Production Design, to Mirisola again, from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.

==Subsequent broadcasts and home media==
NBC rebroadcast the series in 1979, 1980, 1984, 1987 and 1990.

It was originally released in the early 1980s in the US as a three-tape VHS edition under the Magnetic Video label. It was released later under the mainstream video label of CBS/Fox in 1986. Another three-tape VHS edition was released by LIVE Home Video in 1992 and again on 22 February 1995. Artisan Entertainment released the DVD version on two discs in February 2000. In the UK, the original 1986 Polygram VHS (four tapes) was fully uncut and featured the full 386-minute version. The 2000 Carlton video (two tapes) featured a heavily abridged print running for 270 minutes. The Granada DVD is credited as the unedited print and runs for 374 minutes, but this is due to the PAL speed up and is the full version. The two additional scenes – a private meeting between Judas Iscariot and Zerah, and the opening betrayal sequence during the Last Supper – were actually added in the repeat UK screening 2 years later and therefore are not included as the DVD is the original 1977 cut.

The serial is broadcast every Easter and Christmas in many countries, including Greece on ANT1, and in the United States on History Channel and TBN.

In Chile, the full serial has been broadcast every Good Friday since 1982 by the public service television broadcaster Televisión Nacional de Chile.

The Region 1 DVD is the original 1977 broadcast. The Region 2 Carlton DVD released in the UK is substantially cut and runs to 270 minutes. The Dutch DVD release (also Carlton Region 2) has a running time of 365 minutes (the 399-minute running time stated on the cover is a misprint).

The drama has been released on digital download (or streaming) for both Google Play and the Apple Store. The version released is the completed original 4-part 1977 broadcast, though only in its original Standard Definition. Similar to other special interest content, the film&#x27;s copyright has only been loosely enforced in more recent years, resulting in it appearing on Google&#x27;s advertising-paid platform YouTube in its entirety.

For Easter 2016, and again in 2018, the UK&#x27;s Sky Arts channel showed one part a day over the four days of Easter. The version they used was the extended four-part edition, totaling eight hours with advertising.

The serial ran on NBC as &quot;The Big Event&quot; in two three-hour installments with limited commercials on Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday. Additional footage was added for a 1979 re-run and broadcast in four two-hour installments. In the 1980s and 1990, the film was re-broadcast on NBC in three installments of two- and three-hour episodes, released on VHS and DVD as one complete presentation with one set of credits.

In 2022, the full series was made available on BritBox in the UK in time for Easter.

==Books==
Two adaptations of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; have been published. &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), by Scottish theologian William Barclay, is a novelisation of the miniseries, published as a conventionally-sized paperback novel as well as a large-format hardback with extensive colour photographs from the miniseries. &quot;Man of Nazareth&quot; (1979) is Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel based upon his original script for the &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; miniseries. The novel allowed Burgess to retain and expand upon elements of his script that the miniseries altered or omitted, and as a result, &quot;Man of Nazareth&quot; contains significant differences to &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. Burgess&#x27; direct sequel to &quot;Man of Nazareth&quot;, the novel &quot;The Kingdom of the Wicked&quot; (1985), was adapted to television in 1985 as &quot;A.D.&quot; (which features some actors who had appeared in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, albeit in different roles).

Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s account of filming &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; was published in 1984 as &quot;Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s Jesus: A Spiritual Diary&quot; (1984).

<text>Colonel George Francis Gillman Stanley (July 6, 1907September 13, 2002) was a Canadian author, soldier, historian at Mount Allison University, public servant, and designer of the Canadian Flag.

==Early life and education==
George F. G. Stanley was born in Calgary, Alberta, in 1907 and received a BA from the University of Alberta in Edmonton. He studied at Keble College, University of Oxford, in 1929 as the Rhodes Scholar from Alberta, and held a Beit Fellowship in Imperial Studies and a Royal Society of Canada Scholarship. He earned a BA, MA, MLitt and DPhil. Always a keen athlete, he played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club, which won the Spengler Cup in 1931. At Oxford, he wrote his book, &quot;The Birth of Western Canada: A History of The Riel Rebellions&quot;, and began his lifelong work on Louis Riel.

==Academic career==

===Beginnings===
Stanley returned to Canada in 1936 and was appointed a professor of history at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick. He joined the military upon arriving there and qualified as a lieutenant in the New Brunswick Rangers. He served as an infantry training officer in Fredericton and then proceeded overseas during World War II as historian (rising to Deputy-Director) in the Historical Section at Canadian Army Headquarters in London, England; he was also responsible for administering the War Artist Program, whose staff included Bruno Bobak, Molly Lamb Bobak, Alex Colville, Charles Comfort, Lawren P. Harris and Will Ogilvie. Stanley was discharged as a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1947. He then taught at the University of British Columbia, holding the first chair in Canadian history in Canada. He came out of military retirement in 1948 to help fight floods in the Fraser Valley and was on the Reserve of Officers until 1967. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1949) to do research into the history of Canadian government policy in dealing with Aboriginal people.

In 1949, Stanley began teaching at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, where he remained for twenty years. At RMC, he became head of the History Department, served as the first Dean of Arts for seven years (1962–1969), and began building a faculty in the humanities and social sciences. He taught the first undergraduate course in military history ever given in Canada and wrote a textbook, entitled &quot;Canada&#x27;s Soldiers, 1604-1954: The Military History of An Unmilitary People&quot; (1954), which became required reading for every service person for three decades. His students included John de Chastelain, Jack Granatstein, and Desmond Morton. Thanks in part to Stanley&#x27;s efforts as RMC Dean of Arts, the Royal Military College of Canada Pipes and drums were equipped in 1965 with most of their highland kit, including the Mackenzie tartan (RMC was established in 1876 when Alexander Mackenzie was prime minister).

While in Kingston he served as secretary and president of the Kingston Historical Society and edited &quot;Historic Kingston&quot; for several years. He was president of the Arts Society, director of the Art Collection Society, served on various committees working to save Kingston&#x27;s old limestone buildings, was president of the St. Andrew&#x27;s Society, and acted as clerk of his church&#x27;s vestry council. Stanley was president of the Canadian Historical Association (1955–1956), a member of the Massey Commission&#x27;s Committee on Historic Sites and Monuments (1950–1951), and a founding member of the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Ontario (1953–1969). He was chairman of the federal government&#x27;s Centennial Publications Committee and acted as chairman of centennial celebrations in Pittsburgh Township, Ontario. While Stanley was at the Royal Military College, he suggested the design for the Canadian flag, which was adopted on 15 February 1965.

In 1969, Stanley returned to Mount Allison University to become founding director of the new Canadian Studies program, the first of its kind in Canada. He was also the first holder of the Edgar and Dorothy Davidson Chair of Canadian Studies (1969–1975). At Mount Allison, Stanley taught courses in Canadian civilization, dealing with literature, music, architecture and culture. He served as a member of the Commission de Planification Académique de l&#x27;Université de Moncton (1969–1972), and a member of the advisory panel on the Symons Commission on Canadian Studies (1972–1975). He was a founding member of the Atlantic Canada Institute. He also served as member of the Federal Government Advisory Board on Canadian Military Colleges (1973–1979), on the Council of the New Brunswick Army Cadet League and of the Maritime Automobile Association, and as president of the New Brunswick Council of St. John Ambulance. He was a director of the Canadian Association of Rhodes Scholars (1983–1987) and of SEVEC, served as a member of the Advisory Board of the Canadian War Museum (1988–1990) and as Honorary Colonel of the Royal New Brunswick Regiment (1982–1992), and continued his long-standing role as corresponding member of the Institut d&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;Amérique française.

===Retirement and after===

George Stanley retired from teaching in 1975, but remained active in public life. From 1981 to 1987, he was Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, a post in which he served with great distinction. While Lieutenant-Governor, Stanley continued to act as General Editor of &quot;The Collected Writings of Louis Riel&quot; in five volumes, which appeared in 1985 after seven years of work by five Canadian scholars; this project was published ahead of schedule and under budget. Well into his nineties, Stanley continued to research, write, read manuscripts, review books, give interviews and talks, encourage young scholars, and maintain an active interest in the militia, cadets, St. John Ambulance, and SEVEC. He answered a steady flow of letters from school children asking about the Canadian flag. He never missed an opportunity to promote Canadian citizenship and love of country. In 1998, he donated his book collection to the Special Collections of the MacKimmie Library at the University of Calgary; his personal papers are now also deposited there. Stanley died in 2002 and was buried with full military honours in Sackville, New Brunswick.

===Influence===
In 2003, a former student reflected: &quot;George Stanley was a scholar revered by his peers throughout the world and equally he was held in the same regard by all his former students, many of whom became professional historians and leaders in their fields across Canada. Stanley was the Head of the History Department when I was a young cadet at RMC. In a highly organized and rigidly structured environment, he stood out to us as the perfect role model - a gentleman, a scholar, a friend and later a confidant. He led by example and set his students on a path of personal and individual achievement unhampered by his own prejudices and influences. As a result, Stanley sent his students into the world equipped to make up their own minds and not just echo what they had been taught.&quot;

Desmond Morton, one of Stanley&#x27;s students at RMC in the 1950s, a Canadian military historian and author, and formerly the founding director of Montreal&#x27;s McGill Institute for the Study of Canada observed: &quot;George&#x27;s books and their non-conventional wisdom are a great contribution to this country. When you do the unexpected, you make a difference, and George always argued differently -- especially for the rights of French Canada, which wasn&#x27;t a popular thing to do at the time.&quot;

The historian, R.C. [Rod] Macleod of the University of Alberta, has written that: &quot;Much of English Canada&#x27;s understanding of the formative years of the Canadian West comes from George Stanley&#x27;s remarkable work, &quot;The Birth of Western Canada&quot;. Considering that it was one of the earliest works by an academically trained historian in this country, it has stood the test of time remarkably well. No other work of Canadian history published before the Second World War is as regularly read by historians, students and the general public…. [This] subject will always be identified with his name.&quot; In 2015, a Supreme Court of Canada decision on language rights cited &quot;The Birth of Western Canada&quot;.

Serge Bernier, Director of the Directorate of History and Heritage of the Department of National Defence, noted in Stanley&#x27;s obituary for the Royal Society of Canada: &quot;George Stanley était un grand érudit, mais aussi un « honnête homme ». Plusieurs générations d&#x27;historiens canadiens ont été, et sont toujours, influencées par son travail. Des milliers de Canadien(ne)s, étudiant(e)s ou autres, ont appris à connaître et à apprécier ses qualities humaines. La SRC a perdu en George Stanley un de ses plus prestigieux membres, un de ceux qui font que notre Société brille si bien au Canada comme à l&#x27;étranger.&quot;

==Public life==
In 1981, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau advised the appointment of George Stanley to be the 25th Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick since Confederation. The mid-1980s were a festive time as New Brunswickers marked their province&#x27;s bicentennial and many other historic events. During those years, eminent visitors from around the world, such as Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II, also came to help New Brunswick celebrate. George and Ruth Stanley, with their strong sense of tradition and their comfortable manner with people from all walks of life, brought &quot;a new level of decorum&quot; to this viceregal role. When George Stanley retired from his post as Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick in 1987, a testimonial dinner was given in his honour at CFB Gagetown; the guests at the head table were all Canadian generals, who had flown in to honour their former professor from the Royal Military College.

==Family life==

In 1946, George Stanley married Ruth L. Hill (1922–2017), ONB, BA, BCL, LLD, DCLJ, MMLJ, FRSA, a Montreal lawyer (she was gold medalist in law at McGill University). They had three daughters: Della M.M. Stanley [Hon. Thomas Cromwell], Professor Marietta R.E. Stanley (1952–2008) [formerly married to Maurice McAtamney], and Laurie C.C. Stanley-Blackwell [John D. Blackwell]. The Stanleys also have two grandchildren: Thomas E.G.S. Cromwell [Megan Ormshaw] and Ruth L.H.Q. Stanley-Blackwell.

==Honours==
In 1976, George Stanley was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1994. He was also the recipient of twelve honorary degrees (Laval, Mount Allison, St. Dunstan&#x27;s, Alberta, Royal Military College, St. Francis Xavier, University of New Brunswick, Dalhousie, Calgary, Ottawa, Moncton and St. Thomas), in addition to his five earned degrees. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) and of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS). In 1983, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada (FRHSC). In 1950, he was awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal. In 1955, he was elected president of the Canadian Historical Association; his landmark presidential address, entitled &quot;Act or Pact? Another Look at Confederation,&quot; has been frequently reprinted and remains a core reading for students of Canadian history. He was Professor Emeritus of both the Royal Military College and Mount Allison University.

Early in his career, Stanley received an Army Efficiency Medal, but in 1992 he was awarded a Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration (CD); at 85, he was almost certainly the oldest Canadian soldier so to be honoured. Stanley was an Honorary Ex-Cadet #H889 of the Royal Military College. He was made a Knight of Justice of the Order of Saint John (and held the Victoria Medal with bar of the Order), a Knight Grand Cross of the &quot;Acadia Commandery of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem, Grand Priory in Canada&quot;, which he helped establish, and a Comendador of the Brazilian Order of São Paulo. He was a Fellow of the Company of Military Historians and a Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International. He was a Life Member of the Royal Canadian Legion, the New Brunswick Teachers&#x27; Association, the York-Sunbury Historical Society, the Kingston Historical Society, the United Empire Loyalists&#x27; Association of Canada, the Military Institute of Fredericton, the Fredericton Garrison Club, and the Union Club of Saint John. While he was the Queen&#x27;s Representative in New Brunswick, he was made an honorary citizen of the &quot;Republic of Madawaska&quot;. In 1994, Stanley was awarded a special certificate of merit by the Kingston Historical Society to mark the 100th anniversary of the Society and to recognize his long devotion to their work and to historical research and architectural conservation.

Historical plaques honouring Stanley have been erected in the Public Library, Stoney Creek, Ontario (includes a bronze bust by Elizabeth Bradford Holbrook), in front of the Public Library, Sackville, New Brunswick, at his boyhood home in Calgary, Alberta, and on the Parade Square, Royal Military College, Kingston, Ontario. Sergeant J.A. Scobbie, 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, composed a march for bagpipes to mark the occasion of Col. Stanley&#x27;s official visit to Edinburgh Castle in 1986. Lisa Lapointe has composed and recorded a ballad, entitled &quot;One Single Leaf,&quot; honouring Stanley&#x27;s role in designing the Canadian maple leaf flag. A street is named for him in Sackville, NB. In 2003, the annual George F.G. Stanley Lecture series in Canadian Studies was established at Mount Allison University to honour his legacy to the university. Stanley&#x27;s name was added the RMC Wall of Honour in 2015. The Dr. George Stanley School was officially opened in Calgary in 2017. As a Canada 150 project, the town of Sackville, New Brunswick, erected in 2018 a life-size bronze sculpture of Stanley designed by Christian Toth.

==Designer of the Canadian Flag==

On 23 March 1964, Stanley wrote a formal four-page memorandum to John Matheson, a member of the multi-party parliamentary flag committee, suggesting that the new flag of Canada should be instantly recognizable, use traditional colours, and be a simple design. He included a rough sketch of his design in the memorandum.

Stanley had become friends with Matheson in Kingston, Ontario, where their children learned Scottish dancing together. Two months before the Great Flag Debate erupted on 17 May 1964 with Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s speech at the Royal Canadian Legion&#x27;s national convention in Winnipeg, Matheson had paid a visit to Stanley at Royal Military College of Canada. Over lunch at the RMC mess hall, the two discussed heraldry, the history and the future of Canada, and the conundrum of the flag. And as the two men walked across the parade grounds, Stanley gestured toward the roof of the Mackenzie Building and the college flag flapping atop its tower. &quot;There, John, is your flag,&quot; Stanley remarked, suggesting the RMC College Flag&#x27;s red-white-red as a good basis for a distinctive Canadian flag. At the centre, Stanley proposed, should be placed a single red maple leaf instead of the college emblem: a mailed fist holding a sprig of three green maple leaves.

The suggestion was followed by Stanley&#x27;s detailed memorandum of 23 March 1964 on the history of Canada&#x27;s emblems, in which he warned that any new flag &quot;must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature&quot; and that it would be &quot;clearly inadvisable&quot; to create a flag that carried either a Union Jack or a fleur-de-lis. His vision provided a sound rationale and brought together all the key components of the new flag design. Stanley wrote the pivotal flag memorandum in his study at Cluny House, Pittsburgh Township, just east of Kingston; this fine stone residence was built in 1820 by Colonel Donald Macpherson (c.1755-1829), a maternal uncle of Sir John A. Macdonald. Stanley was forbidden by his superiors at RMC from appearing in person before the Parliamentary Flag Committee, which was made up of 15 MPs from various federal political parties.

The Stanley proposal was placed on a wall of the Flag Committee&#x27;s meeting room in Ottawa with hundreds of other flag designs, and eventually was selected as one of the final three designs for consideration. In a classic Canadian compromise, the Stanley design, which was supported by the sole NDP member (Reid Scott) on the Flag Committee, beat out John Diefenbaker&#x27;s flag (a combination of fleurs-de-lis, a maple leaf and the Union Flag) and the Pearson Pennant (three red leaves conjoined on a stem set against a white background with blue bars on either side—a flag proposal designed by Alan Beddoe).

Stanley&#x27;s design was slightly modified by Jacques Saint-Cyr, a graphic artist with the Canadian Government Exhibition Commission (and ironically a Quebec sovereigntist), who reduced the number of points on the stylized maple leaf from 13 to 11. The Stanley design was officially adopted as the national flag of Canada (replacing the Canadian Red Ensign) by the House of Commons on 15 December 1964 and by the Senate on 17 December 1964, and proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, taking effect on 15 February 1965. At 2:00 am on 15 December 1964, following the historic vote in the House of Commons to adopt Stanley&#x27;s maple leaf design as Canada&#x27;s new flag, Matheson wrote to Stanley: &quot;Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag that will serve Canada well.&quot;

Many Canadians did not yet share this sentiment. Shortly before the official flag raising on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on 15 February 1965 (February 15 was declared National Flag of Canada Day in 1996), Stanley received an anonymous death threat. Unperturbed, he attended the ceremony in a colourful and quintessentially Canadian Hudson&#x27;s Bay coat, which stood out dramatically in a sea of dark formal attire worn by the other dignitaries.

Support for the new flag grew quickly, including in Quebec. As Matheson noted in his book &quot;Canada&#x27;s Flag&quot; (1980), &quot;when in June 1965, Dr. George F.G. Stanley of [the] Royal Military College ... was granted an honorary doctorate at Université Laval, he was loudly applauded by the student body when the Canadian flag was referred to in his citation. The applause interrupted the citation.&quot; French-Canadian nationalists had long demanded that the Union Jack (Union Flag) be removed from any future Canadian flag.

Some debate lingered over whether Stanley or Saint-Cyr should get credit for the flag, but it was settled in 1995 when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien officially recognized Stanley as the designer of Canada&#x27;s flag. Stanley also suggested the name for the Canadian pale, an original vexillological and heraldic device first used in the Maple Leaf flag.

In a feature article for &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, entitled &quot;The Stanley Flag,&quot; Richard Foot observed: &quot;The main players in the flag saga are now gone. Pearson died in 1972, Stanley in 2002 and Matheson in 2013. But what they created has lasted for nearly half a century and counting – flown from the top of the Peace Tower and from thousands of public and private buildings across the country, from embassies around the world, and recently, at Olympic medal ceremonies in Sochi, Russia. The Stanley flag is now a universally-recognized Canadian symbol.&quot; Former Governor-General David Johnston has written in a &quot;letter&quot; to George Stanley, &quot;Our flag dares us to press on with the unfinished work of our country: to be ever more free and fair, just and inclusive; to be keener of mind and kinder of heart. ... Amazing what the right flag – your flag, our flag – can do.&quot;

==Opposition to immigration in 1938==
In their book, &quot;None Is Too Many: Canada and the Jews of Europe 1933-1948&quot; (1982), Irving Abella and Harold Troper quote a letter George Stanley wrote on 29 December 1938 to the federal Conservative leader, Robert James Manion, in support of a speech Manion had recently given in Quebec, opposing any immigration &quot;so long as any Canadian remained unemployed.&quot; As a novice academic, Stanley had returned to Canada from the University of Oxford in 1936 during the Great Depression and was distressed by the destitution he encountered, particularly in his native western Canada. At that moment (late December 1938), he found it difficult to sympathize with &quot;those who shed tears over the fate of Jews in Europe and who raised funds for the assistance of foreign refugees ... [while they] ignore the distress on their own doorstep. ... Charity begins at home.&quot;

Defenders of Stanley on this matter generally note that his opinions, while wrong in retrospect, were also largely irrelevant as Stanley had little personal control over Canadian immigration policy. The exact nature of the Nazi regime was not entirely clear at the time, with many wrongly assuming that their anti-Jewish rhetoric would eventually cool rather than escalate to mass murder. The Canadian government of the era turned away the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot; from Halifax in June 1939 and sent it back to Europe, where many of the Jewish refugees on board would eventually be murdered in the Holocaust. Stanley served in the Canadian military during World War II, a cause to which he was profoundly committed. One of his responsibilities was supervising the Canadian War Artists, some of whom made depictions of the concentration camps to the world after they were liberated.

<doc id="488508" wikidata="Q2301913" url="?curid=488508" title="HMS Neptune (1909)">
<text>HMS &quot;Neptune&quot; was a dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century, the sole ship of her class. She was the first British battleship to be built with superfiring guns. Shortly after her completion in 1911, she carried out trials of an experimental fire-control director and then became the flagship of the Home Fleet. &quot;Neptune&quot; became a private ship in early 1914 and was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron.

The ship became part of the Grand Fleet when it was formed shortly after the beginning of the First World War in August 1914. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and the inconclusive action of 19 August several months later, her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. &quot;Neptune&quot; was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve before being sold for scrap in 1922 and subsequently broken up.

==Background and description==
The launch of in 1906 precipitated a naval arms race when Germany accelerated its naval construction plans in response. Despite this sudden expansion of another nation&#x27;s fleet, the British Admiralty felt secure in the knowledge that Germany would have only four modern capital ships in commission by 1910, while the Royal Navy would have eleven. Accordingly, they proposed the construction of only a single battleship and a battlecruiser in the 1908–1909 naval budget that they sent to the government in December. The Liberals, committed to reducing military expenditures and increasing social welfare spending, wished to cut the budget by £1,340,000 below the previous year&#x27;s budget, but were ultimately persuaded not to do so after the Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, was thoroughly briefed on each part of the budget in February 1908. The debates over the budget in March were heated; critics were dissatisfied with the number of ships being built, arguing that the Government was too complacent about the superiority of the Royal Navy over the Imperial German Navy, but they were satisfied when H. H. Asquith, Chancellor of the Exchequer, filling in for the fatally ill Prime Minister, announced that the government was prepared to build as many dreadnoughts as required to negate any possible German superiority as of the end of 1911.

&quot;Neptune&quot; was an improved version of the preceding with additional armour and the armament rearranged for greater efficiency. She was the first British dreadnought that differed in her gun turret layout from &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. Unlike the earlier ships, her wing turrets were staggered &quot;en echelon&quot; so all five turrets could shoot on the broadside, although in practise the blast damage to the superstructure and boats made this impractical except in an emergency. This was done to match the 10-gun broadside of the latest foreign designs like the American , although the all-centreline turret configuration of the American ships eliminated the blast problems that compromised the effectiveness of the &quot;en echelon&quot; arrangement. &quot;Neptune&quot; was also the first British dreadnought to be equipped with superfiring turrets, in an effort to shorten the ship and reduce costs. A further saving in length was achieved by siting the ship&#x27;s boats on girders over the two wing turrets to reduce the length of the vessel. The drawback to this arrangement was that if the girders were damaged during combat, they could fall onto the turrets, immobilising them. The bridge was also situated above the conning tower, which similarly risked being obscured if the bridge collapsed.

&quot;Neptune&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a deep draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of at deep load. Her crew numbered about 756 officers and ratings upon completion and 813 in 1914.

The ship was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine room. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts. The turbines used steam from eighteen Yarrow boilers at a working pressure of . They were rated at and gave &quot;Neptune&quot; a maximum speed of . She carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament===

&quot;Neptune&quot; was equipped with ten 50-calibre breech-loading (BL) Mark XI guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ship carried 100 shells per gun.
&quot;Neptune&quot; was the first British dreadnought with her secondary armament of sixteen 50-calibre BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII guns installed in unshielded single mounts in the superstructure. This change was made to address the problems that plagued the turret-roof locations used in earlier battleships. Notably, the exposed guns were difficult to work when the main armament was in action as was replenishing their ammunition. Furthermore, the guns could not be centrally controlled to coordinate fire at the most dangerous targets. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four quick-firing three-pounder () Hotchkiss saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 18-inch (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 18 torpedoes were provided.

===Fire control===

The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting tops at the head of the fore and mainmasts. Data from a Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination.

&quot;Neptune&quot; was the first British dreadnought to be built with a gunnery director, albeit an experimental prototype designed by Vice-Admiral Sir Percy Scott. This was mounted on the foremast, underneath the spotting top and electrically provided data to the turrets via pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. The ship&#x27;s director was later replaced as a new one was ordered in 1913 and installed by May 1916.

Additional nine-foot rangefinders, protected by armoured hoods, were added for each gun turret in late 1914. Furthermore, the ship was fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables by early 1916 in each transmission station that combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

===Armour===
&quot;Neptune&quot; had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes that reduced to before it reached the ships&#x27; ends. It covered the side of the hull from the middle deck down to below the waterline where it thinned to amidships. Above this was a strake of 8-inch armour. The forward oblique bulkheads connected the amidships portion of waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the forward barbette. Similarly the aft bulkhead connected the armour belts to the rearmost barbette, although it was 8 inches thick. The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with 3-inch roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively. The torpedo control tower aft had 3-inch sides and a 2-inch roof. &quot;Neptune&quot; had two longitudinal anti-torpedo bulkheads that ranged in thickness from and extended from the forward end of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette to the end of &#x27;Y&#x27; magazine. She was the first British dreadnought to protect her boiler uptakes with 1-inch armour plates. The compartments between the boiler rooms were used as coal bunkers.

===Modifications===
Gun shields were fitted to the forward four-inch guns after September 1913 and the upper forward four-inch guns were enclosed. In 1914–1915, the upper amidships four-inch guns were enclosed, the forward boat girder was removed and a three-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the quarterdeck. Approximately of deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. By early 1917, four guns had been removed from the aft superstructure and a single four-inch AA gun had been added, for a total of a dozen four-inch guns. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 as was the aft spotting top. A high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the remaining spotting top and a flying-off platform was installed on the &#x27;A&#x27; turret in 1918.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Neptune&quot;, named after the Roman god of the sea, was ordered on 14 December 1908. She was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 19 January 1909, launched on 30 September and completed in January 1911 at the cost of £1,668,916, including her armament. The ship was commissioned on 19 January 1911 for trials with Scott&#x27;s experimental gunnery director that lasted until 11 March and were witnessed by Rear-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Neptune&quot; relieved &quot;Dreadnought&quot; as the flagship of the Home Fleet and of the 1st Division on 25 March and then participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS); &quot;Neptune&quot; was relieved as the squadron&#x27;s flagship on 22 June. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. &quot;Neptune&quot; became a private ship on 10 March 1914 when she was replaced by as the flagship of the Home Fleet and rejoined the 1st BS.

===First World War===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914 &quot;Neptune&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack. In August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Neptune&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November and the ship began a refit on 11 December.
&quot;Neptune&quot;″s refit had concluded by the evening of 23 January 1915 as she joined the rest of the Grand Fleet when it sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but the fleet was too far away participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March; while returning home after the conclusion of the exercises, &quot;Neptune&quot; was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarine . While manoeuvring for another attack, the submarine was spotted by &quot;Dreadnought&quot; which rammed and cut it in half. There were no survivors. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet, including &quot;Neptune&quot;, made a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetland Islands on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet practised gunnery and battle exercises west of Shetland, and trained off Shetland three days later. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea, conducting gunnery drills, and spent the rest of the month performing numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, made another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Neptune&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Neptune&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. During the night of 22/23 April, &quot;Neptune&quot; was accidentally rammed by the neutral merchant ship in thick fog, but the battleship was only lightly damaged. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but arrived in the area only after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet made another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
The German High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May in an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet. The High Seas Fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Neptune&quot;, under the command of Captain Vivian Bernard, was assigned to the 5th Division of the 1st BS and was the nineteenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired two salvos from her main guns at a barely visible battleship at 18:40. Around the time that the High Seas Fleet was reversing course beginning at 18:55 to re-engage the Grand Fleet, &quot;Neptune&quot; fired one salvo at the crippled light cruiser with unknown effect. After the turn the ships of the 1st BS were the closest ones to the Germans and, at approximately 19:10, she fired four salvos at the battlecruiser , claiming two hits, although neither can be confirmed. Shortly afterwards, the ship fired her main and secondary guns at enemy destroyers without result and then had to turn away to dodge three torpedoes. This was the last time &quot;Neptune&quot; fired her guns during the battle. She expended a total of 48 twelve-inch shells (21 high explosive and 27 common pointed, capped) and 48 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====
After the battle, the ship was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

On 22 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet sailed north for the last time in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept a convoy to Norway, and had to turn back two days later after the battlecruiser suffered engine damage. The Grand Fleet sortied from Rosyth on the 24th when the operation was discovered, but was unable to catch the Germans. &quot;Neptune&quot; was present at Rosyth when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November and was reduced to reserve there on 1 February 1919 as she was thoroughly obsolete in comparison to the latest dreadnoughts. The ship was listed for disposal in March 1921 and was sold for scrap to Hughes Bolckow in September 1922. She was towed to Blyth, Northumberland on 22 September to begin demolition.

<doc id="488509" wikidata="Q2855975" url="?curid=488509" title="HMS Hercules (1910)">
<text>HMS &quot;Hercules&quot; was the second and last of the two dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy at the end of the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve. &quot;Hercules&quot; was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up the following year.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;Colossus&quot; class was derived from that of the earlier with redistributed armour and more powerful torpedoes. &quot;Hercules&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1911 her crew numbered 778 officers and ratings and 791 in July 1916.
&quot;Hercules&quot; was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her full-power, eight-hour sea trials on 2–3 March 1911, she reached a top speed of from in a moderate storm. The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Colossus&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mark XI guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The wing turrets were staggered &quot;en echelon&quot; so all five turrets could shoot on the broadside, although in practice the blast damage to the superstructure and boats made this impractical except in an emergency. The ability to fire all ten 12&quot; guns in broadside equaled the all centerline arrangement of the contemporary US battleships, but the centerline arrangement was less problematic to the superstructure.

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mark VII guns. Ten of these were mounted in the forward superstructure and six in the aft superstructure in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 18 torpedoes were provided.

They had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes that did not cover the full length of the ships. Above this was a strake of armour. The forward oblique 4-inch bulkheads connected the forward barbette to the side armour. Similarly, the aft bulkhead connected them to the rearmost barbette, although it was 8 inches thick. The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to 4 inches below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 11 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had 11-inch faces and sides with roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively. The torpedo control tower aft had 3-inch sides and a 2-inch roof. In an effort to reduce weight, the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships reverted to the inadequate underwater protection scheme of and their anti-torpedo bulkheads only protected the shell rooms and magazines, although they had a maximum thickness of 3 inches.

====Modifications====

Sometime in 1912, the compass platform was extended forward to accommodate a rangefinder. In 1913–1914, a small rangefinder was added to the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret and gun shields were fitted to the 4-inch guns in the forward superstructure. After the start of the war in August 1914, a pair of 3-inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. A fire-control director was installed on a rear extension of the compass platform by December 1915. Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, four 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure. By April 1917, &quot;Hercules&quot; was equipped with single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns and the forward group of 4-inch guns had been enclosed in casemates. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and a high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the spotting top in 1918.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Hercules&quot;, named after the mythic demigod Hercules, was the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 1 June 1909 and laid down at Palmers at their shipyard in Jarrow on 30 July. She was launched on 10 May 1910 and completed in August 1911 at the cost of £1,661,240, including her armament. The ship was commissioned on 4 July for trials with a partial crew. &quot;Hercules&quot; recommissioned with a full crew on 31 July and was assigned as the flagship of the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet. On 19 December Vice-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe assumed command of the division, which was renamed the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead and was refitted at Portsmouth in November–December. During this time, Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender, Bt relieved Jellicoe as commander of the 2nd BS. &quot;Hercules&quot; was relieved as the squadron&#x27;s flagship on 7 March 1913 and became a private ship in the squadron. On 22 March she collided with and damaged of Glasgow in Portland Harbour during a gale, suffering only minor damage herself. In May, the ship was transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron.

===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Hercules&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Hercules&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Hercules&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Hercules&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetlands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Hercules&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Hercules&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.

On 19 March 1916 the ship completed repairs to her turbines, which had kept her at Scapa for nearly six weeks. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Hercules&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.
On 31 May, &quot;Hercules&quot;, now under the command of Captain Lewis Clinton-Baker, was the twenty-third ship (or second from the rear) from the head of the battle line after deployment as part of the 6th Division of the 1st BS. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship was by five shells fired by a German dreadnought at 18:16. Shortly afterward, she fired at the crippled light cruiser around 18:20. &quot;Hercules&quot; engaged a German dreadnought beginning at 18:25 with seven or eight salvos of her own. The poor visibility greatly hampered her return fire and was a problem for the entire battle. At 19:12, the ship opened fire at the battlecruiser , and probably scored two hits. One of her high-explosive (HE) shells penetrated through the upper superstructure and caused minor splinter damage. The second HE shell burst on hitting the upper hull armour, which dished in the armour plates and caused moderate flooding. About five to ten minutes later, she engaged several German destroyer flotillas with a few salvos from her main armament without result. &quot;Hercules&quot; was then forced to turn away to avoid several torpedoes, one of which was believed to have passed very close. , flagship of the division, was hit by a torpedo and forced to reduce speed, which caused the division to fall behind the main body of the Grand Fleet. They did not rejoin until the afternoon of 1 June, as the fleet was headed for home. &quot;Hercules&quot; received no damage and fired a total of 98 twelve-inch shells (82 HE, 4 armour-piercing, capped, and 12 common pointed, capped) and 15 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====

After the battle, the ship was transferred to the 4th BS and became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. During this foray, &quot;Hercules&quot; carried out the first test of a towed kite balloon (without observers). Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

On 24 April 1918, &quot;Hercules&quot; were ordered north to Orkney to support the dreadnought and the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when the High Seas Fleet sortied north for the last time to intercept a convoy to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. The British ships were not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November. On 3 December, she was detached to take the Allied Naval Armistice Commission to Kiel, Germany, returning to Rosyth on 20 December. &quot;Hercules&quot; was reduced to reserve in February 1919 at Rosyth and listed for disposal in October 1921. On 8 November, she was sold to the Slough Trading Co. and was resold to a German company in September 1922. The ship departed Rosyth, under tow, for Kiel in October and was subsequently broken up.

==Museum holdings==
The National Maritime Museum&#x27;s collection includes several paintings of &quot;Hercules&quot; by William Lionel Wyllie and the Imperial War Museums&#x27; collection includes a builders&#x27; model of &quot;Hercules&quot;, made by Palmers in 1910.

<doc id="488517" wikidata="Q248188" url="?curid=488517" title="Milton Keynes Dons F.C.">
<text>Milton Keynes Dons Football Club, usually abbreviated to MK Dons, is a professional association football club based in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. The club was founded in 2004, following Wimbledon F.C.&#x27;s controversial relocation to Milton Keynes from south London, when it adopted its present name, badge and home colours.

Initially based at the National Hockey Stadium, the club competed as Milton Keynes Dons from the start of the 2004–05 season. The club moved to their current ground, Stadium MK, for the 2007–08 season, in which they won the League Two title and the Football League Trophy. After seven further seasons in League One, the club won promotion to the Championship in 2015 under the management of Karl Robinson; however, they were relegated back to League One after one season.

Milton Keynes Dons have built a reputation for youth development, run 16 disability teams and their football trust engages around 60,000 people; between 2012 and 2013 the club produced 11 young players who have been called into age group national teams and between 2004 and 2014 the club also gave first-team debuts to 14 local academy graduates, including the England international midfielder Dele Alli.

The club also operates a women&#x27;s team, Milton Keynes Dons Women, who groundshare Stadium MK with their male counterparts, and currently play in the third tier of the English women&#x27;s football pyramid.

==Origins==

Milton Keynes, about north-west of London in Buckinghamshire, was established as a new town in 1967. In the absence of a professional football club representing the town—none of the local non-league teams progressed significantly through the English football league system or &quot;pyramid&quot; over the following decades—it was occasionally suggested that a Football League club might relocate there. There was no precedent in English league football for such a move between conurbations and the football authorities and most fans expressed strong opposition to the idea. Charlton Athletic briefly mooted moving to &quot;a progressive Midlands borough&quot; during a planning dispute with their local council in 1973, and the relocation of nearby Luton Town to Milton Keynes was repeatedly suggested from the 1980s onwards. Another team linked with the new town was Wimbledon Football Club.

Wimbledon, established in south London in 1889 and nicknamed &quot;the Dons&quot;, were elected to the Football League in 1977. They thereafter went through a &quot;fairytale&quot; rise from obscurity and by the end of the 1980s were established in the top division of English football, as well as winning the 1988 FA Cup final. Despite Wimbledon&#x27;s new prominence, the club&#x27;s modest home stadium at Plough Lane remained largely unchanged from its non-league days. The club&#x27;s then-owner Ron Noades identified this as a problem as early as 1979, extending his dissatisfaction to the ground&#x27;s very location. Interested in the stadium site designated by the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, Noades briefly planned to move Wimbledon there by merging with a non-league club in Milton Keynes, and bought debt-ridden Milton Keynes City. However, Noades then decided that the club would not gain sufficient support in Milton Keynes and abandoned the idea.

In 1991, after the Taylor Report was published recommending the redevelopment of English football grounds, Wimbledon left Plough Lane to groundshare at Crystal Palace&#x27;s ground, Selhurst Park, about away. Sam Hammam, who then owned Wimbledon, said the club could not afford to redevelop Plough Lane and that the groundshare was a temporary arrangement while a new ground was sourced in south-west London. A new stadium for Wimbledon proved difficult to achieve. Frustrated by what he perceived as a lack of support from Merton Council, Hammam began to look further afield and by 1996 was pursuing a move to Dublin, an idea that most Wimbledon fans strongly opposed. Hammam sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, in 1997, and a year later sold Plough Lane to Safeway supermarkets. Wimbledon were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 1999–2000 season.
Starting in 1997, a consortium led by music promoter Pete Winkelman and supported by Asda (a Walmart subsidiary) and IKEA proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium. The consortium originally proposed that the stadium be located at the National Bowl but later altered their proposal to change the site of the proposed stadium to Denbigh North, the same site as the mooted retail development.

The consortium proposed that an established league club move to use this site; it approached Luton, Wimbledon, Crystal Palace, Barnet, and Queens Park Rangers. In 2001 Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who was in favour of this idea, saying it was necessary to stop the club going out of business. To the fury of most Wimbledon fans, Koppel announced on 2 August 2001 that the club intended to relocate to Milton Keynes. After the Football League refused permission, Wimbledon launched an appeal, leading to a Football Association arbitration hearing and subsequently the appointment of a three-man independent commission to make a final and binding verdict. The league and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one, on 28 May 2002.

Having campaigned against the move, a group of disaffected Wimbledon fans reacted to this in June 2002 by forming their own non-league club, AFC Wimbledon, to which most of the original team&#x27;s support defected. AFC Wimbledon entered a groundshare agreement with Kingstonian in the borough of Kingston upon Thames, adjacent to Merton. The original Wimbledon intended to move to Milton Keynes immediately but were unable to do so until a temporary home in the town meeting Football League criteria could be found. The club remained at Selhurst Park in the meantime and in June 2003 went into administration. With the move threatened and the club facing liquidation, Winkelman decided to buy it himself. He secured funding for the administrators to keep the team operating with the goal of getting it to Milton Keynes as soon as possible. The club arranged the temporary use of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes and played its first match there in September 2003. Nine months later Winkelman&#x27;s Inter MK Group bought the club out of administration and announced changes to its name, badge and colours—the team was renamed Milton Keynes Dons Football Club.

==History==
===2004–2006: Struggles and relegation===

The first season for the club as Milton Keynes Dons was 2004–05, in Football League One, under Stuart Murdoch, who had managed Wimbledon F.C. since 2002. The team&#x27;s first game was on 7 August 2004, a 1–1 home draw against Barnsley, with Izale McLeod equalising with their first competitive goal. Murdoch was sacked in November and replaced by Danny Wilson, who kept Milton Keynes Dons in the division on the final day of the season — largely due to Wrexham&#x27;s 10-point deduction for going into administration. The following season, Milton Keynes Dons struggled all year, and were relegated to League Two; Wilson, as a result, was sacked.

===2006–2010: Promotion and first silverware===
Wilson&#x27;s successor for 2006–07 was Martin Allen, who had just taken Brentford to the brink of a place in the Football League Championship. Milton Keynes Dons were in contention for automatic promotion right up to the last game of the season, but eventually finished fourth and had to settle for a play-off place. They then suffered a defeat to Shrewsbury Town in the play-off semi-finals. During the 2007 summer break, Allen left to take over at Leicester City.

For the 2007–08 season, former England captain Paul Ince took over as manager. Milton Keynes Dons reached the final of the Football League Trophy, while topping the table for most of the season. The final was played on 30 March 2008 against Grimsby Town — Milton Keynes Dons won 2–0 at Wembley to bring the first professional trophy to Milton Keynes. The club capped the trophy win with the League Two championship, and the subsequent promotion to League One. Following his successes, Ince left at the end of the season to manage Blackburn Rovers.

Ince&#x27;s replacement was former Chelsea player Roberto Di Matteo, taking his first role as a manager. In the 2008–09 season, they missed out on an automatic promotion spot by two points, finishing third behind Peterborough United and Leicester City. They were knocked out of the play-offs by Scunthorpe United, who defeated MK Dons by penalty shootout at Stadium MK. Di Matteo left at the season&#x27;s end for West Bromwich Albion. A year after leaving, Ince returned as manager for the 2009–10 season. He resigned from the club on 16 April 2010, but remained manager until the end of the season.

===2010–2016: Karl Robinson era===
On 10 May 2010, Karl Robinson was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager, with former England coach John Gorman as his assistant. At 29 years of age, Robinson was at the time of his appointment the youngest manager in the Football League. In his first season in the club Milton Keynes Dons finished fifth in 2010–11 League One. They faced Peterborough United in the play-off semifinals. Although they won the first leg 2–1, a 2–0 defeat at London Road meant they missed out on the play-off final, losing the Semi-Final 3–2 on aggregate goals.

The 2011–12 season brought similar results to the previous season with the Dons finishing fifth in 2011–12 League One facing Huddersfield in the play-offs. Losing the first leg 2–0 followed by winning 2–1 at The Galpharm saw Milton Keynes Dons lose 3–2 on aggregate against the eventual play-off winners. The away leg was John Gorman&#x27;s last match in football after announcing his retirement a few weeks beforehand. Gorman&#x27;s replacement was announced on 18 May 2012 as being ex-Luton manager Mick Harford along with new part-time coach Ian Wright.

Milton Keynes Dons experienced their best ever FA Cup campaign in the 2012–13 season by beating a spirited Cambridge City (0–0 and 6–1), League Two fierce rivals AFC Wimbledon (2–1), Championship Sheffield Wednesday (0–0 and 2–0) and Premier League Queens Park Rangers (4–2) to reach the fifth round of the competition for the first time in their history. Their record-breaking run ended in the fifth round at Stadium MK on 16 February 2013, losing 3–1 to Championship side Barnsley. After being in the top five for most of the season, the club finished the 2013–14 League One season in tenth place.

The 2014–15 season began well. The highlight event of the season&#x27;s first month was being drawn against Manchester United in the League Cup second round, having dispatched AFC Wimbledon in the first. The Dons recorded a shock 4–0 victory over Manchester United in front of a sell out crowd at Stadium MK. A few weeks later, the Dons recorded their record win, a 6–0 thrashing of Colchester United at home. That record did not last long as it was broken once again with a 7–0 demolition of Oldham Athletic on 20 December 2014. Just over a month later, on 31 January 2015, the Dons recorded a joint record 5–0 away win against Crewe Alexandra, earning a short-lived top spot. On 3 May the club secured promotion to the Football League Championship for the first time, beating Yeovil Town 5–1 and leapfrogging Preston North End (who lost 1–0 at Colchester United) on the final day of the season.

The Dons started life in the Championship by beating Rotherham United away 4–1 on the opening day of the season and gaining seven points from a possible 12 in their first four games. They were not able to sustain this form throughout the season – the Dons did not win any of their final 11 games and they returned to League One after finishing 23rd in the Championship.

On 23 October 2016, Karl Robinson left the club by mutual consent, following a 3–0 home defeat by Southend United the previous day, which had extended the Dons&#x27; winless run to four games and left them 19th in the League One table.

===2016–2018: Slow decline===
Robbie Neilson joined MK Dons as manager from Scottish Premiership club Heart of Midlothian in his native Scotland, with his first official game in charge coincidentally an FA Cup tie against Karl Robinson&#x27;s new club Charlton Athletic. Neilson&#x27;s reign started off well, with his second game in charge a win over AFC Wimbledon, and in late January 2017 a local derby win against Northampton Town.

The following season started badly; however, on 30 December 2017 the team was noted for a remarkable 1–0 derby win against Peterborough, playing with 9 men for 68 minutes after controversial refereeing decisions and 13 minutes of added time. Neilson left by mutual consent on 20 January 2018 after a run of one win in eleven league games with the club 21st in the table; he was sacked the same day as his last game, a disappointing away 2–1 derby defeat against relegation rivals Northampton Town.

Under Neilson&#x27;s successor, Dan Micciche, the club continued to struggle in the relegation places. Following a run of poor results with only three wins in sixteen matches in charge, Micciche left the club on 22 April 2018, with assistant manager Keith Millen taking over as a caretaker. On the penultimate weekend of the season another defeat relegated them to League Two (leaving them seven points from safety with one game to play).

===2018–2023: Bounce-back and search for stability===
Former Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale was appointed in June 2018 after 12 years at his previous club. After a season where the Dons were tipped to be favourites for promotion, the club spent most of the season around the automatic promotion and play-off places. Going top after a 2–0 win over Macclesfield Town in November, the club sunk to 8th in February before being one win way away from automatic promotion against play-off hopefuls Colchester United in the penultimate game. The Dons lost 2–0 which led to a &quot;winner takes all&quot; game against 3rd placed Mansfield Town, who were separated by goal difference, to determine who was promoted. MK Dons won 1–0 in front of nearly 21,000 fans meaning they returned to League One at the first attempt.

Following a poor start to the 2019–20 season in which the Dons achieved only one point from a possible 27, the worst run of results in the club&#x27;s history, Tisdale&#x27;s contract with the club was mutually terminated on 2 November 2019 following a 1–3 home defeat to fellow relegation-threatened Tranmere Rovers. The next day, Russell Martin was announced as the new permanent first-team manager; he had joined as a player earlier in the year.
Fixtures were suspended on 13 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the clubs later voted to end the season prematurely with immediate effect on 9 June 2020, with the final table decided upon by an unweighted points-per-game system resulting in the club finishing the season in 19th place, thus avoiding relegation.

The &quot;Dons&quot; went into the final weekend of the 2021–22 League One season with a chance of gaining automatic promotion to the Championship, and even had a slim chance of becoming Champions if they won by a big score and other results went their way. They comfortably beat Plymouth Argyle 5–0, but both Wigan Athletic and Rotherham United won their games against Shrewsbury Town and Gillingham, respectively, to claim the two automatic promotion berths. The &quot;Dons&quot; finished third and faced Buckinghamshire rivals Wycombe Wanderers in the play-offs. Despite the &quot;Dons&quot; having home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final, Wycombe won 2–1 on aggregate to reach the final at Wembley.

MK Dons suffered relegation to League Two in the 2022–23 League One season. Liam Manning was replaced as manager in December 2022, but successor Mark Jackson registered just six wins in 25 games and was sacked after the side were relegated following a final day 0–0 draw at Burton Albion.

===2023–present: Return to League Two===

On 27 May 2023, MK Dons appointed Graham Alexander as their new head coach. After an eight-match winless run, Alexander was sacked with MK Dons in 16th place. On 17 October 2023, MK Dons announced that they had appointed Gateshead manager Mike Williamson as their new head coach. He led MK Dons to a 4th-placed finish, where they faced Crawley Town in the play-off semi-finals. Crawley won 8–1 on aggregate, inflicting the largest play-off defeat in EFL history on the club. This was the sixth time MK Dons had competed in the play-offs without reaching a final.

On 9 August 2024, the owner, Pete Winkelman, sold the club to a Kuwait-based consortium, with Fahad Al Ghanim becoming the club&#x27;s new chairman, representing the first change in ownership since the club&#x27;s inception. After four losses in the opening six games, including a 3-0 defeat to arch-rivals AFC Wimbledon, Mike Williamson was appointed as the manager of Carlisle United on 19 September, with the Cumbrians meeting the release clause in his contract. MK Dons appointed Williamson&#x27;s replacement, the Crawley Town boss Scott Lindsey, on 25 September 2024.

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s first stadium was the National Hockey Stadium, which was temporarily converted for football for the duration of the club&#x27;s stay. Their lease on the venue ended in May 2007.

On 18 July 2007, the club&#x27;s new 30,500 capacity stadium, Stadium MK in Denbigh hosted its first game, a restricted-entrance event against a young Chelsea XI. The stadium was officially opened on 29 November 2007 by Queen Elizabeth II. The stadium features an open concourse at the top of the lower tier, an integrated hotel with rooms looking over the pitch and conference facilities. The complex was to include a 3,000 capacity indoor arena, where the MK Lions basketball team would be based, but completion of this arena was delayed due to deferral of proposed commercial developments around the site.

In May 2009, the stadium was named as one of 15 stadia put forward as potential hosts for the England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid, which would include increasing capacity to 44,000, however England&#x27;s bid was later unsuccessful. In recent years Stadium MK has played host to the 2014 FA Women&#x27;s Cup final, three Rugby World Cup 2015 fixtures and four matches (including a semi-final) of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022.

==Supporters==

===Initial supporters&#x27; club recognition===

On 4 June 2005, at the 2005 Football Supporters&#x27; Federation &quot;Fans&#x27; Parliament&quot; (AGM), the FSF refused the Milton Keynes Dons Supporters Association (MKDSA) membership of the FSF in a debate that, among other arguments, questioned why the Football League had yet to introduce any new rules to prevent the &quot;franchising&quot; of other football clubs in the future. In addition, the FSF membership agreed with the Wimbledon Independent Supporters&#x27; Association (WISA) that the MKDSA should not be entitled to join the FSF until they give up all claim to the history and honours of Wimbledon FC. With this in mind, the FSF began discussions aimed at returning Wimbledon FC&#x27;s honours to the London Borough of Merton.

Shortly afterwards, following heavy criticism for allowing the move, the Football League announced new tighter rules on club relocation. At its AGM on 5 June 2006, the FSF again considered a motion proposed by the FSF Council to allow Milton Keynes Dons Supporters Association membership if the honours and trophies of Wimbledon FC were given to the London Borough of Merton. In October 2006, agreement was reached between the club, the Milton Keynes Dons Supporters Association, the Wimbledon Independent Supporters&#x27; Association and the Football Supporters Federation. The FA Cup trophy plus all club patrimony gathered under the name of Wimbledon Football Club would be returned to the London Borough of Merton. Ownership of trademarks and website domain names related to Wimbledon would also be transferred to the borough. As part of the same agreement it was agreed that any reference made to Milton Keynes Dons should refer only to events subsequent to 7 August 2004 (the date of the first league game of Milton Keynes Dons).

As a result of this deal, the FSF announced that the supporters of Milton Keynes Dons would be permitted to become members of the federation, and that it would no longer appeal to the supporters of other clubs to boycott Milton Keynes Dons&#x27; matches. On 2 August 2007, Milton Keynes Dons transferred ownership of all Wimbledon Football Club trophies and memorabilia to the London Borough of Merton.

===Rivalries===
AFC Wimbledon
Due to their shared ancestry in Wimbledon F.C., there is an unavoidably acrimonious rivalry with AFC Wimbledon since the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes;

The first fixture between the two clubs took place on 2 December 2012 in the second round of the 2012–13 FA Cup, where they were drawn to play each other at Stadium MK. Milton Keynes Dons won the match 2–1, with a winner scored in injury time by Jon Otsemobor and later dubbed by MK Dons fans as &quot;The Heel of God&quot; (a reference to Maradona&#x27;s &quot;Hand of God&quot;). Kyle McFadzean&#x27;s opening goal for MK Dons in the second match between the two clubs, a 3–1 Milton Keynes win in the first round of the League Cup in August 2014, was also scored with his heel, and was consequently labelled &quot;Heel of God II&quot;. Two months later, in the Football League Trophy Southern section second round, AFC Wimbledon defeated MK Dons 3–2 with a winning goal by Adebayo Akinfenwa.

On 10 December 2016, the sides met for the first time in a competitive league fixture following MK Dons&#x27; relegation from the Championship and AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s promotion from League Two the previous season. Milton Keynes Dons won 1–0, with Dean Bowditch scoring the only goal of the game with a 63rd-minute penalty. The first visit of MK Dons to AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s home ground for a League One match on 14 March 2017 resulted in a 2–0 victory for AFC Wimbledon. The 2018–19 season saw AFC Wimbledon remain in League One, in a higher league than MK Dons for the first time.

In 2017, AFC Wimbledon, in the club&#x27;s programme for their home game against the Dons, played on 22 September, failed to recognise their opponents by their full name for the second successive season. AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s official Twitter feed also referred to their opponents as &quot;Milton Keynes&quot; throughout their match coverage. AFC Wimbledon were subsequently threatened by the EFL with disciplinary action, and eventually charged with breaching EFL regulations. The charges were dropped. AFC Wimbledon were forced to refer to MK Dons by their full name ahead of the 2019–20 season, after the EFL stepped in to mediate.

Peterborough United

MK Dons have a rivalry with Peterborough United, since the two clubs have vied head-to-head for promotion to the Championship in recent years. A rivalry also exists between MK Lightning and Peterborough Phantoms in ice hockey that pre-dates the football rivalry.

Northampton Town

Northampton is geographically the closest urban area to Milton Keynes with a professional football team, Northampton Town, the two places separated by a little over . Former MK Dons Supporters&#x27; Association Chairman John Brockwell had stated that the fans were looking forward to hosting Northampton Town, the club that, geographically at least, are their nearest rivals. Although Peterborough United have been traditionally Northampton&#x27;s main rivals, the &quot;Cobblers&quot; spokesman has stated, in 2008, that, &quot;with MK Dons now on the fixture list, it gives [Northampton] supporters the chance to develop another rivalry.&quot;

In January 2016 police arrested a Milton Keynes fan for setting off pyrotechnics in the away end, and two Northampton fans and three more Milton Keynes fans were ejected from the ground. In 2018, before the 30 January 3pm kick-off in the League One game between the two clubs, Northamptonshire Police arrested seven travelling supporters of the Dons, with one Northampton fan also arrested. Four arrests were for public order offences, one for criminal damage, one for pitch encroachment, one for obstructing the police, and one for affray.

Wycombe Wanderers

Wycombe Wanderers are the only other professional team in Buckinghamshire, so games between the two teams are labelled &quot;the Bucks derby&quot;.

==Community==
Through the work of its charity, Milton Keynes Dons SET (Sport and Educational Trust), the club works locally in the fields of education, social inclusion, participation and football development. It works with schools, has 14 disability teams playing in regional or national competitions, works with BME (black and minority ethnic) community groups and runs many activities for women and girls.

Milton Keynes Dons&#x27; work in the community has been recognised by the award of the Football League Awards Community Club of the Season for the South East &amp; East in both 2012 and 2022, and in the award of an honorary doctorate to chairman Pete Winkelman by the Open University in June 2013. The club have also been awarded Family Excellence status by the EFL every year since the award&#x27;s inception in 2008, recognising continuing improvement and best practice in family engagement.

==Youth academy==

Striker Sam Baldock was the first notable academy graduate who, after making 102 appearances, moved on to West Ham United for a seven-figure sum. He later became captain of Bristol City and also played for Derby County. , Daniel Powell, Tom Flanagan and George Baldock, brother of Sam, all played regularly for the MK Dons first team.

On 2 February 2015, Milton Keynes Dons academy graduate and first team midfielder Dele Alli was sold to Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £5 million. Alli became the first Milton Keynes Dons academy graduate to make a full England senior team debut, on 9 October 2015.

Kevin Danso is a graduate of the academy who went on to play for Austria and became the youngest player to make a league appearance in FC Augsburg&#x27;s history, when making his Bundesliga debut.

Other notable youth graduates who have gone on to play at a higher level include George Williams, Brendan Galloway, Scotland international Liam Kelly and England youth team international Sheyi Ojo.

On 9 August 2016, in a first-round EFL Cup match against Newport County, manager Karl Robinson selected a first-team squad composed of 13 academy graduates and players, giving eight of those players their full debuts for the club including Brandon Thomas-Asante. The game ended with a 2–3 away win for the club.

==Players==

===Notable players===

Mark Wright finished the 2007–08 season as the club&#x27;s top goalscorer, helping the Dons win both the League Two title and the Football League Trophy. Jon Otsemobor made 44 appearances for the club and scored the winning goal in the first match against AFC Wimbledon with a back-heel that was later dubbed the &quot;Heel of God&quot;.

Milton Keynes Dons were former Premier League player Jimmy Bullard&#x27;s last club before his retirement from football, making only three appearances for the club. Similarly Dietmar Hamman made 12 appearances as a player-coach before retiring.

Notable players loaned from other clubs were strikers Patrick Bamford, who scored 18 goals in 37 games, Benik Afobe, who became the league&#x27;s top scorer in just six months, and Ángelo Balanta, whose loan spell lasted three years. Former Ireland international Clinton Morrison and former Premiership players Paul Rachubka and James Tavernier also had short loan spells with the club.

Alan Smith, most known for his time at Leeds United and Manchester United, joined the club on loan, signing from Newcastle United before making the move permanent totalling 67 appearances for the club. Other international players who have worn the Dons shirt include Tore André Flo, Ali Gerba, Michel Pensée, Cristian Benavente, Richard Pacquette, Keith Andrews, Russell Martin, Tom Flanagan, Drissa Diallo, Pelé and Ousseynou Cissé. Joe Walsh, Brendan Galloway, Jordan Houghton, Connor Furlong, Gboly Ariyibi, Gareth Edds all represented their countries at youth level.

<text>Kingstonian Football Club is an English semi-professional football club based in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, south west London which currently plays in the Isthmian League South Central Division.

The club was founded in 1885 by YMCA, named Kingston &amp; Surbiton YMCA, and began competing properly in 1893 in the Surrey Junior Cup. There was a split before the start of the 1908–09 season which damaged the club, the two clubs were named Old Kingstonians and Kingston upon Thames A.F.C. After period of quiet during World War I, the two clubs re-united and joined the Athenian League in 1919, named Kingstonian. In 1929, their application to join the Isthmian League was accepted, and they have competed there to the present day. The club, nicknamed the Ks or the K&#x27;s, spent three seasons at the highest level of non-league football, 1998–99, 1999–2000 and 2000–01, and have won the FA Trophy twice, in consecutive seasons, in 1999 and 2000.

The club is currently without a home ground, and from 2024 will groundshare with Raynes Park Vale at Prince George&#x27;s Playing Fields in Raynes Park. They have twice previously had their own stadium, Richmond Road from 1902 to 1988 and Kingsmeadow from 1989 to 2017. After Kingstonian went into administration in 2001, Kingsmeadow was bought by AFC Wimbledon two years later, who allowed Kingstonian to stay. With AFC Wimbledon looking to move to a new ground, Kingsmeadow was sold to Chelsea in 2016, who stipulated that Kingstonian could not remain there.

==History==

===Kingston and Surbiton YMCA===
Kingstonian was formed in autumn 1885, under the name Kingston &amp; Surbiton YMCA. In the period, rugby was the dominant sport in the town, but YMCA was unable to support a rugby club. This influenced their decision to create a club to play &quot;Football under Association rules&quot;. The new club played their first fixture on 28 November 1885 losing 3–1 to Surbiton Hill with home games played at Bushy Park before moving to the Spring grove the following season. Over the two years the club played only friendly matches against other football teams in the region.

===Saxons F.C.===
In 1887 the club changed its name to Saxons FC and opened up its membership to players who were not also members of YMCA. The club however maintained its links to YMCA and only allowed YMCA members to serve on the decision making committee. In the Summer of 1888 William Carn, the founder of the club, resigned from YMCA after tensions developed where YMCA were concerned that the organization was becoming more like a sporting club than a religious organization. As non YMCA members were not allowed to serve on the committee this would have meant Carn also resigning his duties with the club. The members decided however to sever links with YMCA which allowed Carn to continue. At the same time the club also moved to a ground in Oil Mill Lane (modern day Villiers Road).

===Kingston Wanderers F.C.===
At the club&#x27;s annual general meeting in 1890, the secretary at the time, William G. Carn, proposed that the name became &quot;one more identified with the town&quot;. His proposal was successful, and the club became Kingston Wanderers F.C. in the 1890–91 season. The club&#x27;s first season as Kingston Wanderers also heralded a change of home ground to the Fairfield Recreation Ground.

===Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C.===
In the Summer of 1893, the association clubs of Kingston considered a proposal to amalgamate and produce one larger club that would represent the whole town. Because many of the clubs had already arranged fixtures for the coming season it was only Kingston Wanderers who moved forward with the plan, although several other clubs were to amalgamate with them in future seasons. On 13 September 1893, the club changed its name to Kingston upon Thames A.F.C. They entered the Surrey Junior Cup affiliated to the Surrey Football Association. The first competitive match in Kingston&#x27;s history was in November 1893 and resulted in a loss, after a replayed game, to Hampton Court &amp; East Molesey.

When Kingston upon Thames ventured into the Surrey Senior Cup in 1894, the heaviest loss of the club to date was recorded, a 12–0 loss to Weybridge F.C. The club re-entered the Surrey Junior Cup and in 1896 joined the Kingston &amp; District League as founder members. In their first season, they won the league but lost the Surrey Junior Cup 2–1 in the final, to Chertsey F.C. after a replay. They spent two years in the Kingston and District league, coming runners up to Brentford &#x27;A&#x27; Team in their second season before moving into the East and West Surrey League at the start of the 1898–1899 season. The club also underwent several ground changes during this period and from 1898 to 1899 season spent 3 years at Dinton Road before one season playing at Lower Marsh Lane in 1901–1902 season. In 1902–1903 they made a final move to Thorpe Road which was virtually on the site of the Richmond Road ground that was to become their home for much of the Twentieth Century. The club continued to compete in the East and West Surrey League and also had a one-season foray into the London League in 1903 alongside the East and West Surrey League but the &quot;experiment&quot; backfired with fixture congestion and selection difficulties caused by having too many games and Kingston upon Thames withdrew from the London League after one season. In 1905–1906 season, the club won the newly renamed West Surrey League, a feat which was replicated in 1906–1907 season. In addition the 1906–1907 season saw them finish runners up in the Surrey Senior Cup which was lost to Clapham F.C. 3–1.

===Old Kingstonians===

The newfound success in Surrey amateur football was soon lost when the club split before the start of the 1908–09 season after increasing tensions between the First Team members and the &quot;A&quot; Team members. This reached a head after elections for representation on the committee that ran the club. This resulted in treasurer David Judd forming Old Kingstonians F.C. and taking much of the first team with him to a new ground at Norbiton. Kingston upon Thames continued to compete on the old ground at Thorpe Road, and were made up of the former members of the &quot;A&quot; team as well as two members of the first team who chose to stay. Judd&#x27;s team became known as the &quot;OKs&quot;, the &quot;Rupert&#x27;s&quot; or the &quot;Juddites&quot; while the Kingston upon Thames team was known as &quot;The Boys&quot; or simply &quot;The Town club&quot;. Initially Kingston upon Thames had the upper hand both in league and cup success and in matches between the two clubs. To some extent this justified the belief of the former &quot;A&quot; Team members that they were the better team despite effectively representing the club at a lower Junior level than the first team. It also somewhat justified their opinion that the first team had been holding back progress at the club. Gradually however Old Kingstonians improved, winning the West Surrey League in 1910, followed by the Surrey Senior Cup in both 1911 and 1914 and the Southern Suburban League in the two seasons before the war.

By the start of World War One, Old Kingstonians held a definite supremacy of the two clubs, and in 1913–1914 won three trophies including the Southern Suburban League and Surrey Senior Cup. The rivalry between these two clubs was intense and to some extent the competition helped both clubs with their standard of football and improvements to facilities. However, there were occasions in which this rivalry spilled over into more serious incidents. Over the period of the split several appeals had been made by both clubs concerning eligibility of players in matches between the two sides, and in two cases the result of the game was overturned. In the 1913–1914 season the Surrey Charity Shield match between the two clubs saw a number of incidents involving players and spectators and this led to the Surrey FA taking responsibility for the running of the replay with warning notices posted at the ground and a large police presence. An FA enquiry into incidents at the first game led to one of the witnesses being attacked on their return to Kingston after giving evidence. Both teams competed in the West Surrey League in 1908–1909 but in 1909–1910 season Kingston upon Thames FC moved into the Southern Suburban League with Old Kingstonians remaining in the West Surrey League. Kingston upon Thames did however again try a failed &quot;experiment&quot; by re-entering two first teams in both the Southern Suburban League and West Surrey League for the 1910–1911 season but again this resulted in selection problems and was dropped at the end of the season. At the start of the 1911–1912 season Old Kingstonians also moved to the Southern Suburban League where both teams stayed until the outbreak of World War One.

===World War One===

At the outbreak of the First World War, Kingston upon Thames FC immediately cancelled all football. However Old Kingstonians did attempt to continue playing despite heavy political pressure to stop. The club had joined the Athenian League and played two games before the league was cancelled. They also played three rounds in the FA Cup qualifying stages before losing to Redhill. They then joined the Metropolitan League which had been set up for wartime football and also played in the London Senior Cup (losing to Walthamstow Grange) and were entered for the FA Amateur Cup. However. despite resisting political pressure, attendances dropped and in December 1914 the club announced that it was ceasing activities.

===Kingstonian F.C.===
In 1919 football returned in Kingston. The war had dimmed the rivalry between the teams, and they re-united as Kingstonian F.C. Their first match after unification was on 6 September 1919 competing in the Athenian League against Southall F.C. However, the season was plagued with issues regarding their home ground at Richmond Road and a finish in the bottom half of the league meant the team were forced to apply to re-enter the league. Their application was successful, and heralded a change of fortunes for Kingstonian. Before the 1920–1921 season it seemed they had lost their ground after confusion over their desire to renew the rent. This meant that Leyland Motors had been given exclusive use but an agreement was reached to allow for a groundshare with Leyland Motors, who took over the fixtures of the Kingstonian Reserve team who had signed up for the Southern Suburban League. The following season Kingstonian were successful in purchasing the Richmond Road ground, although the groundshare arrangement with Leyland Motors continued. They had a more successful spell from 1923 up to the outbreak of World War II, winning the league in 1924, and in 1926 with a record number of points. The club progressed to several finals of the London and Surrey Senior Cups.

In 1929, Kingstonian were successful in their application to join the Isthmian League after the withdrawal of Civil Service F.C. In 1933, Kingstonian won the FA Amateur Cup, they won the League in 1934 and 1937, and the club won the Surrey Senior Cup in 1935 and 1939. &quot;Competitive Amateur Football&quot; was called off in September 1939 for World War II and Kingstonian were to play only one game at the start of the 1939/1940 season. Their ground was requisitioned by the Civil Defence for the duration of the war and no further games were played until 1945. Depleted of the majority of their pre-war players, Kingstonian came last in the first league after the war in 1945–1946 season, and had to resort to fundraising to gather money to renovate both the stadium and the changing rooms. In 1949, the all-time top goalscorer Johnny Whing arrived at the club, and was top scorer in nine different seasons for the club. In 1955, Kingstonian&#x27;s heaviest ever home defeat, 12–3, was recorded at the hands of Bishop Auckland FC in front of the club&#x27;s record attendance of 8,960.

In the 1959–60 season, the Ks had their first Wembley Stadium appearance in the FA Amateur Cup final, which was lost to Hendon F.C. 2–1. In 1963, Kingstonian won the double; the Surrey and London Senior Cup. The 1970s were a period of decline for the club, and despite becoming professional in 1975, they were relegated to Division One in 1979. In 1985 Kingstonian were once again promoted to the Isthmian League, finishing second. In 1987, 20 years without silverware was ended by the Ks winning the London Senior Cup.

Kingstonian won the Isthmian League in 1998 and the FA Trophy in 1999 and 2000 at Wembley Stadium under manager Geoff Chapple, and then managed to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2001. Entering the competition at the Fourth Qualifying Round, they beat Devizes Town before beating two Football League clubs – Brentford and Southend United, either side of a win over fellow Conference team Southport – on their way to the FA Cup fourth round, where they were drawn with Bristol City before succumbing to a late winner in the replay, losing 1–0.

Relegation and, moreover, financial problems as a result of severe overspending in the chase for success, saw a sharp downturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes between 2001 and 2005, and in 2003 the then manager Kim Harris said that the owner, property developer Rajesh Khosla, was &quot;raping us&quot; after Khosla sold the Kingsmeadow ground for £2 million in personal profit. However, in February 2005 Khosla stepped down as chairman, selling the club to Jimmy Cochrane, whilst making a profit. While this did not save Kingstonian from relegation that year, the 2005–06 season saw Kingstonian Football Club revitalised. They only narrowly missed out on the promotion playoffs and finished their season by beating AFC Wimbledon in the final of the Surrey Senior Cup at Woking&#x27;s ground 1–0.

Changes continued during mid-2006 with Mark Anderson and Malcolm Winwright taking charge of the club, installing Stuart McIntyre as successor to Ian McDonald in the role of head coach. However, McIntyre&#x27;s stay in the role was brief and &quot;unsuccessful&quot;, with he himself being replaced by Alan Dowson at the start of 2007. Under Dowson the club was promoted back to the Isthmian Premier in 2009. However, after the 2013–14 Isthmian League in which Kingstonian finished second but missed out on promotion, on 11 May 2014 Dowson resigned, being replaced by Tommy Williams.

With former Ks midfielder Tommy Williams installed as manager, the club again reached the FA Cup Third Qualifying Round, losing 3–2 to a last minute goal against Eastbourne Borough. The league campaign saw the club make late challenge for the play-offs falling short in the last couple of weeks of the season. In his second season, the 2015-16 campaign saw the Ks lift their first cup in ten years, winning the Isthmian League Cup with a 5–0 victory over Faversham Town. The 2016–17 season started poorly with the club just outside the relegation zone with six games remaining. Tommy Williams was replaced as manager by former Billericay Town man Craig Edwards. He led the club to a 16th-place finish after a five match unbeaten run to end the season. Ks left the Kingsmeadow Stadium at the end of the season and moved to Fetcham Grove to groundshare with Leatherhead. Edwards resigned in October 2017 and was replaced by former Whyteleafe manager Leigh Dynan.

At the beginning of the 2018–19 season, Kingstonian moved back to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and started a ground share with Corinthian-Casuals at King George&#x27;s Field. A difficult season saw Ks have three managers, as Leigh Dynan was replaced by Dean Brennan and then very quickly by stand-in manager Kim Harris - the Ks moved from second place in the table on New Year&#x27;s Day to escaping relegation by a single place. New manager Hayden Bird joined the club in 2019, only for the 2019–20 season to be curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In that season&#x27;s FA Cup the Ks reached the first round for the first time since 2000–01, where they defeated Macclesfield Town 4–0 at Moss Rose, before losing 2–0 at home to AFC Fylde in the second round. The 2023–24 season saw Kingstonian relegated from the Premier Division, 15 years after their promotion to that level.

==Colours and badge==
The team&#x27;s current crest contains the motto &quot;Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat&quot;, the motto of Lord Nelson which translates as &quot;Let he who has earned it carry the palm&quot;, and is inscribed on the Britannia Monument. Kingstonian&#x27;s home kit is red and white hooped shirts, black shorts and red socks. Their away kit is yellow shirts, shorts, and socks.

==Stadiums== 


The early precursors to Kingstonian F.C. played home matches at various locations around the town including Oil Mill Lane (now Villiers Road) and the Fairfield, near Kingston town centre. In 1891 they participated in a tournament at the rugby club ground in Richmond Road, later to become their home.

In 1898 the club moved to their first private enclosed ground at Dinton Road, next to Kingston Barracks, moving again at the turn of the century to Lower Marsh Lane in 1902, specifically to part of the rugby ground in Richmond Road. The split in 1908–09 between Kingston upon Thames A.F.C. and Old Kingstonians led to the breakaway group Old Kingstonians playing at Norbiton Sports Ground, Kingston upon Thames A.F.C. remaining at Richmond Road. Reunited after World War I, the club continued to play at Richmond Road but, in 1920, the site&#x27;s owners, the Dysarts, leased the site to Leyland Motors, then establishing a factory base at nearby Ham. The club managed to negotiate a ground-sharing arrangement and were eventually able to buy the land, but the issue impacted their performance.

Kingstonian remained at Richmond Road for most of the 20th century, it thus being referred to as the club&#x27;s &#x27;traditional home&#x27;. The club&#x27;s record home attendance of 8,960 was attained there in 1955 in a match against Bishop Auckland. The maintenance of the site increasingly became more than the club&#x27;s income could support and parts of the site were sold off for redevelopment; the &#x27;Kingstonian petrol station&#x27; occupying much of the Richmond Road frontage since 1956, and the former running track and reserve pitch redeveloped for housing in the 1970s. The club eventually sold the site and moved out of Richmond Road in 1988. The stadium was demolished after 1989 and the remainder of the site redeveloped for housing.
After a season and a half ground-sharing at Hampton F.C.&#x27;s Beveree ground, Kingstonian opened its new Kingsmeadow Stadium (on the site of the old Norbiton Sports Ground owned by Kingston Council) in August 1989. After Kingstonian entered administration to avoid bankruptcy and lost the Kingsmeadow lease in October 2001. It was assigned in April 2002 by the administrators to a property developer, Rajesh Khosla, who was also by then owner of the club. The fans of AFC Wimbledon, who at that point were already sub-tenants at Kingsmeadow, raised £2.4 million to enable them to buy the lease from Khosla in June 2003, with a view to making Kingsmeadow their home in the short term until their intended move to a site in Wimbledon became more feasible for them. Kingstonian secured a financially favourable 25-year sub-tenancy agreement with AFC Wimbledon, with customary break clauses. The clubs operated a ground-sharing arrangement, with Kingstonian receiving preferentially cheap rental terms.

In 2015, AFC Wimbledon sold Kingsmeadow to Chelsea to help finance their plans to move back to a new stadium in Wimbledon. Chelsea&#x27;s intention was to use Kingsmeadow as a base for their own youth and women&#x27;s teams, and were unwilling to accommodate Kingstonian. The sale proved detrimental to Kingstonian, unable to play in a ground where the new owners did not want them. and the club was forced to relocate as a result, starting a groundshare with Leatherhead F.C. at their ground at Fetcham Grove for the 2017–18 season. The following season they moved again to King George&#x27;s Field in Tolworth, sharing with Corinthian-Casuals Kingstonian reached agreement with Tooting &amp; Mitcham United to play at their Imperial Fields stadium for the 2022–23 season.

In February 2024 it was announced that, starting with the 2024/25 season, Kingstonian would be groundsharing with Raynes Park Vale at Prince George&#x27;s Playing Fields, Grand Drive for at least two seasons.

==Honours==

Kingstonian&#x27;s first final came in 1896, when they came second in the Surrey Junior Cup. A notably prolific spell for the club came in the 1930s, when they won seven, and came runners up in two competitions. The dual FA Trophy victories in 1998–99, 1999–2000 were both at Wembley Stadium, and the 2000 final was the last ever FA Trophy final at the old Wembley before the current stadium was built.

<doc id="488520" wikidata="Q932417" url="?curid=488520" title="St Vincent-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;St Vincent&quot;-class battleships were a group of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. The sister ships spent their entire careers assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August several months later, their service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. was destroyed in 1917 by a magazine explosion with the near total loss of her crew. The remaining pair were obsolete by the end of the war in 1918, and spent their remaining time either in reserve or as training ships before being sold for scrap in the early 1920s.

&quot;Vanguard&quot;″s wreck was extensively salvaged before it was declared a war grave. Since 2002, it has been designated as a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 and diving on the wreck is generally forbidden.

==Background and description==
The Admiralty&#x27;s 1905 draft building plan called for four capital ships in the 1907–1908 Naval Programme, but the new Liberal government cut one of these ships in mid-1906 and postponed another to the 1908–1909 Naval Programme, pending the conclusion of the ongoing Hague Peace Convention. The failure of the Germans to agree to any sort of naval arms control caused the government to reinstate the third ship. The Admiralty took until 12 June 1907 to decide not to build one of them as a battlecruiser, in favour of a squadron of four homogeneous battleships. Three of these would be part of the &quot;St Vincent&quot; class, while the single battleship planned for the 1908–1909 Naval Programme was later authorised as .
The design of the &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was derived from the preceding , with more powerful guns and a slight increase in size and armour. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. In comparison to the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class, the displacement of the &quot;St Vincent&quot;s was increased by , the length by and the beam by ; their crews numbered about 755 officers and ratings upon completion and 835 during the war.

The &quot;St Vincent&quot;-class ships were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine room. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts. Separate cruising turbines were provided for each shaft. The turbines used steam from eighteen water-tube boilers at a working pressure of . They were rated at and were intended to give the ships a maximum speed of . During their sea trials, the &quot;St Vincent&quot;s handily exceeded their designed speed and horsepower, reaching from . They carried of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament===

These ships were the first to carry the new 50-calibre breech-loading (BL) Mark XI gun, which was 5 calibres longer and had a muzzle velocity about higher than the 45-calibre Mark X gun used in the earlier dreadnoughts. They had a reputation for drooping at the muzzle, which was believed to have an adverse effect at long range, but testing at sea showed the muzzle droop to be within normal tolerances and the accuracy at long range to be satisfactory. The increased muzzle velocity of the Mark XI gun gave it a longer range over the Mark X gun as well as increasing the distance at which it could penetrate 12 inches of armour from using the same shell. The higher velocity reduced its service life by increasing the wear in the barrel.

The &quot;St Vincent&quot; class were equipped with ten Mark XI guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were named &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ships carried between 80 and 100 shells per gun.

The secondary armament of the &quot;St Vincent&quot;s consisted of twenty 50-calibre BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII guns. Pairs of these guns were installed in unshielded mounts on the roofs of &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets and the other dozen were positioned in single mounts at forecastle-deck level in the superstructure. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of firing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun; the wartime allowance for each gun was 200 rounds. Four 3-pounder saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 18-inch (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which nine torpedoes were provided.

===Fire control===

The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting tops at the head of the fore and mainmasts. Data from a Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder located at each control position, together with the target&#x27;s speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was called down to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered telephone. The range clock integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. As a backup, two turrets in each ship (&#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; in &quot;St Vincent&quot;) could take over if necessary.

In 1910–1911, the four-inch guns on the roof of the forward turret of &quot;Vanguard&quot; were replaced by a rangefinder. This was removed about a year later, roughly at the same time when the rooftop guns were removed from the forward turrets of the other two ships. In late 1914, the remaining rooftop guns were replaced on the three sister ships by 9-foot rangefinders protected by armoured hoods.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years between the &quot;St Vincent&quot;s&#x27; commissioning and the start of World War I and the most important development was the director firing system. Mounted high in the ship, a fire-control director electrically provided data to the turrets via a pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, &quot;St Vincent&quot; was equipped with a director by December 1915 and the others by May 1916. The ships were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables in the transmission stations by early 1916, which combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

===Armour===
The &quot;St Vincent&quot;-class ships had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes that reduced to before it reached the ships&#x27; ends. It covered the side of the hull from the middle deck down to below the waterline where it thinned to amidships. Above this was a strake of 8-inch armour. Transverse bulkheads thick terminated the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the endmost barbettes. The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with 3-inch roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greatest thickness outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the forward conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively. The aft conning tower had 8-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The &quot;St Vincent&quot;s had two longitudinal anti-torpedo bulkheads thick that extended from the forward end of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette to the end of &#x27;Y&#x27; magazine. In the vicinity of the boiler rooms, the compartments between them were used as coal bunkers.

===Modifications===

The guns on the forward turret roof were replaced in 1910–1911 by a rangefinder on &quot;Vanguard&quot;, and on her sisters in 1911–1912. About two years later, gun shields were fitted to most of the guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house eight 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced their secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns; a pair of 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. Approximately of additional deck armour were added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. By April 1917, the sisters mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and &quot;St Vincent&quot; was equipped to operate kite balloons. In 1918, a high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the forward spotting top of the surviving ships and flying-off platforms were installed on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets of &quot;Collingwood&quot;.

==Careers==
Upon commissioning, all three ships were assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet and &quot;St Vincent&quot; became the flagship of the division&#x27;s second-in-command. In July, they were present when King George V visited the fleet in Torbay and participated in his Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911. Less than a year later, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. &quot;Collingwood&quot; became the squadron flagship on 22 June and reverted to a private ship again two years later. Each of the sisters underwent a lengthy refit before the First World War began in mid-1914.
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the sisters took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review. Arriving in Portland afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet, but German reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force led to indecisive operations. The Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. In April 1916, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron while her sisters remained in the 1st Battle Squadron.

===Battle of Jutland===

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers, which were to act as bait. The British code breakers of Room 40 at the Admiralty had decoded German radio traffic containing plans of the operation and the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before the Germans, to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

The Grand Fleet rendezvoused with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, on the morning of 31 May and Jellicoe organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of four-ship divisions. The two divisions of the 2nd BS were on his left (east), the 4th BS was in the centre and the 1st BS on the right. &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;St Vincent&quot; were the rear ships of their divisions while &quot;Collingwood&quot; was the second ship in its division. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 4th and 1st Battle Squadrons in the centre and rear of the line of battle, respectively, which meant that the sisters were in the rear of the Grand Fleet once it was deployed. This limited their ability to engage the German ships in the poor visibility. All three ships fired at the crippled light cruiser , possibly scoring some hits, but only &quot;St Vincent&quot; and &quot;Collingwood&quot; were able to engage any of the German capital ships. The former hit the battlecruiser twice, inflicting only minor damage, while &quot;Collingwood&quot; hit the battlecruiser once, also with little effect. &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Collingwood&quot; also fired at German destroyers, but failed to achieve any hits. None of the sisters fired more than 98 rounds from their main guns during the battle.

===Subsequent activity===
After the battle, &quot;St Vincent&quot; and &quot;Collingwood&quot; joined &quot;Vanguard&quot; in the 4th BS. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of communication failures and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide not to risk the major units of the fleet to German submarines and mines south of 55° 30&#x27; North. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. The Admiralty order meant that the Grand Fleet spent far less time at sea. In late February 1917, the 4th BS conducted tactical exercises for a few days. In January 1918, &quot;Collingwood&quot; and some of the older dreadnoughts cruised off the coast of Norway for several days, possibly to provide distant cover for a convoy to Norway. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April when radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea, after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught and no shots were fired. &quot;St Vincent&quot; was under repair at Invergordon, Scotland, and could not sortie, but was present at Rosyth when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November; &quot;Collingwood&quot; was refitting in Invergordon.

====&quot;Vanguard&quot; explosion====

In the evening of 9 July 1917, &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s magazines exploded while she was anchored in the northern part of Scapa Flow; she sank almost instantly, with only three survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards; 842 men aboard were lost. &quot;Collingwood&quot;″s crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. The Board of Inquiry concluded that a fire of unknown origin began in a 4-inch magazine and spread to one or both of the nearby 12-inch magazines, which detonated and sank the ship.

===Postwar years===
In March 1919, &quot;St Vincent&quot; was reduced to reserve and became a gunnery training ship at Portsmouth. She then became flagship of the Reserve Fleet in June and was relieved as gunnery training ship in December, when she was transferred to Rosyth. There she remained until listed for disposal in March 1921; she was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921 and demolished.

In January 1919, &quot;Collingwood&quot; was transferred to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon the dissolution of the Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was renamed the Third Fleet and &quot;Collingwood&quot; became its flagship. She became a tender to HMS &quot;Vivid&quot; on 1 October and served as a gunnery and wireless telegraphy training ship until early August 1920, when the ship returned to the reserve. &quot;Collingwood&quot; served as a boys&#x27; training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was paid off on 31 March 1922. &quot;Collingwood&quot; was sold for scrap on 12 December and was broken up.

Much of &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s wreck was salvaged before it was declared a war grave in 1984. The amidships portion of the ship is almost completely gone and &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets are some away, presumably blown there by the magazine explosions. The bow and stern areas are almost intact as has been revealed by a survey authorised by the Ministry of Defence in 2016 in preparation for the centenary commemoration planned for 2017. The wreck was named a controlled site in 2002 and cannot be dived upon, except with permission from the Ministry.

<text>Zhang Jue (; died October 184) was a Chinese military general and rebel. He was the leader of the Yellow Turban Rebellion during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was said to be a follower of Taoism and a sorcerer. His name is sometimes read as Zhang Jiao (), since the Chinese character of Zhang&#x27;s given name can be read as either &quot;Jiao&quot; or &quot;Jue&quot;. &quot;Jue&quot; is the traditional or literary reading, while &quot;Jiao&quot; is the modern or colloquial one.

==Yellow Turban Rebellion==
The Yellow Turbans originated as a Taoist movement called the &quot;Tàipíng Dào&quot; or &quot;Way of the Great Peace&quot; (太平道), which had started well over a decade prior to the rebellion. Zhang Jue&#x27;s followers hailed him as being able to cure patients who sought his help by giving them water blessed by his rituals; those who recovered then believed in him and his teachings, and his fame spread by word of mouth. Professor Rafe de Crespigny noted that disease outbreaks were reported in Han dynasty China in 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185 CE, with the potential cause theorized as the Antonine Plague of 165 to 180CE of smallpox or measles spreading along the Silk Road.

Giving himself the title of &quot;Great Teacher&quot; (), Zhang Jue led the rebellion with his younger brothers Zhang Bao () and Zhang Liang (). He and his brothers gave themselves titles: Zhang Bao was the &quot;General of Earth&quot; (), Zhang Liang was the &quot;General of the People&quot; (); and Zhang Jue was the &quot;General of Heaven&quot; (). The Yellow Turbans claimed to be Taoists, and rebelled against the Han dynasty in response to burdensome taxes, rampant corruption, and famine and flooding, which were seen as indications that the Han emperor had lost the mandate of heaven.

During this time, Zhang spoke of the magic he thought himself capable of to his followers, and &quot;promised that if they took his medicines, they would be immune from wounds and could fight in battle without fear&quot;.

The rebellion began in March 184. The Yellow Turbans conquered much in the early years of the rebellion, but later could not hold out against Han imperial forces led by He Jin, Lu Zhi, Dong Zhuo, Huangfu Song, Zhu Jun and others. However, Zhang Jue died from sickness later in October 184.

Although the Yellow Turbans still remained capable even in face of their more powerful foe, they were nonetheless torn apart upon the death of their leader, and were eventually defeated and dispersed. Zhang Bao was defeated and killed by imperial forces led by Huangfu Song and Guo Dian () in December 184 or January 185 at Xiaquyang County (; west of present-day Jinzhou, Hebei), while Zhang Liang also met his end in November or December 184 at the hands of imperial forces led by Huangfu Song at Guangzong County (; southeast of present-day Guangzong County, Hebei).

Large groups of Yellow Turbans roamed through China for years after the rebellion&#x27;s defeat, most of them eventually joining the army of the warlord Cao Cao, whose agrarian reform policies closely matched Zhang Jue&#x27;s own programme.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Zhang Jue is also featured in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. He is introduced in Chapter 1 as follows:

Zhang Jue then goes on to start the Yellow Turban Rebellion with his brothers. Little time is devoted to Zhang Jue in the book, and his death is given a line in the second chapter: &quot;Zhang Jue had died before his (Huangfu Song&#x27;s) arrival.&quot; After his death, his body was beheaded and his head sent to the capital Luoyang. In the novel, his brother Zhang Bao does not die in battle against imperial forces, but meets his end at the hands of a subordinate, Yan Zheng (), who cuts off his head and surrenders to imperial forces.

==In popular culture==
Zhang Jue appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video games series, as well as serving as an antagonist in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System. He is referred to as &quot;Zhang Jiao&quot; in these games. He is also seen as one of the antagonists of the light gun shooting game &quot;SEGA Golden Gun&quot;.

In &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;″ fourth DLC installment, &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;, Zhang Jue and his brothers lead the playable Yellow Turban factions who seek to overthrow the failing Han dynasty and establish a new order in China.

In the action role-playing game &quot; Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty&quot;, Zhang Jue and his brothers appear as separate boss fights.

In the Japanese mobile gacha game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, Zhang Jue is a summonable character the player can use in battles. According to the game&#x27;s story, Zhang Jue is a magic-user who serves an alien life form in Area 51.

<doc id="488524" wikidata="Q1258630" url="?curid=488524" title="HMS St Vincent (1908)">
<text>HMS &quot;St Vincent&quot; was the lead ship of her class of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. After commissioning in 1910, she spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, during which she damaged a German battlecruiser, and the inconclusive action of 19 August several months later, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship. &quot;St Vincent&quot; was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up the following year.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was derived from that of the previous , with more powerful guns and slight increases in size and protection. &quot;St Vincent&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Her crew numbered 756 officers and ratings in 1911, and 835 in 1915.
&quot;St Vincent&quot; was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines each driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 18 coal-burning Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 17 December 1909, the ship reached a top speed of from . &quot;St Vincent&quot; carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mk XI guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat armament, comprised twenty BL Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

The &quot;St Vincent&quot;-class ships were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

====Modifications====
The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the superstructure were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition, a pair of three-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.

Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland. By April 1917, &quot;St Vincent&quot; mounted 13 four-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as one four-inch and one three-inch AA gun, and the ship was modified to operate a kite balloon around the same time. In 1918 a high-angle rangefinder was fitted and the stern torpedo tube was removed before the end of the war.

==Construction and career==

&quot;St Vincent&quot;, named after Admiral of the Fleet John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent (1735 – 1823), was ordered on 26 October 1907. She was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth, on the same date, launched on 10 September 1908 and completed in May 1909. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,721,970 or £1,754,615. She was commissioned on 3 May 1910 and assigned as the junior flagship of the 1st Division of the Home Fleet. She was commanded by Captain Douglas Nicholson and was present in Torbay when King George V visited the fleet in late July. &quot;St Vincent&quot; also participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead before beginning a lengthy refit late in the year. On 21 April 1914, she was recommissioned and resumed her role as the flagship of the second-in-command of the 1st Battle Squadron, Rear-Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas.

===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;St Vincent&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;St Vincent&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;St Vincent&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;St Vincent&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of the Orkney and Shetland Islands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but the fleet was too far away to participate in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland. King George V inspected all of the personnel of the 2nd Division aboard &quot;St Vincent&quot; during his visit to Scapa on 8 July and the Grand Fleet conducted training off Shetland beginning three days later. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;St Vincent&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. She became a private ship that month when she was relieved by as flagship.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;St Vincent&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s 5 battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. &quot;St Vincent&quot;, under the command of Captain William Fisher, was assigned to the 5th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron at this time. Shortly after 14:20, Fisher semaphored the Grand Fleet&#x27;s flagship, , that his ship was monitoring strong radio signals on the frequency used by the High Seas Fleet that implied the Germans were nearby. Detection of further signals was communicated at 14:52.

As the Grand Fleet began deploying from columns into a line of battle beginning at 18:15, the 5th Division was near the rear. &quot;St Vincent&quot;, the twentieth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment, was briefly forced to stop to avoid overrunning ships further forward as the fleet had been forced to slow to to allow the battlecruisers to assume their position at the head of the line. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship began firing a few salvos from her main guns at the crippled light cruiser at 18:33, although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. Between 18:40 and 19:00 the ship turned away twice from what were thought to be torpedoes that stopped short of the ship. From 19:10 &quot;St Vincent&quot; began firing at what was initially identified as a German battleship, but proved to be the battlecruiser , hitting her target twice before she disappeared into the mist. The first armour-piercing, capped (APC) shell was probably a ricochet and struck the upper hull abreast the bridge. It wrecked the sickbay and slightly damaged the surrounding superstructure and hull, which caused some minor flooding. One man in the conning tower was wounded by a splinter. The second hit penetrated the rear armour of the superfiring turret at the rear of the ship, wrecking it and starting a small fire that was easily extinguished by the crew. This was the last time that &quot;St Vincent&quot; fired her guns during the battle. The ship fired a total of 98 twelve-inch shells (90 APC and 8 common-pointed, capped) during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====
After the battle, the ship was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation; Jellicoe decided not to risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the threat from submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

On 24 April 1918, &quot;St Vincent&quot; was under repair at Invergordon, Scotland, when she and the dreadnought were ordered north to reinforce the forces based at Scapa Flow and Orkney when the High Seas Fleet sortied north for the last time to intercept a convoy to Norway. She was unable to leave port before the Germans turned back after &quot;Moltke&quot; suffered engine damage. The ship was present at Rosyth when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November. In March 1919, she was reduced to reserve and became a gunnery training ship at Portsmouth. &quot;St Vincent&quot; then became flagship of the Reserve Fleet in June and was relieved as gunnery training ship in December when she was transferred to Rosyth. There she remained until listed for disposal in March 1921 as obsolete. She was sold to the Stanlee Shipbreaking &amp; Salvage Co. for scrap on 1 December 1921 and towed to Dover for demolition in March 1922.

<doc id="488525" wikidata="Q2699764" url="?curid=488525" title="HMS Collingwood (1908)">
<text>HMS &quot;Collingwood&quot; was a dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets and often served as a flagship. Prince Albert (later King George VI) spent several years aboard the ship before and during World War I. At the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, &quot;Collingwood&quot; was in the middle of the battleline and lightly damaged a German battlecruiser. Other than that battle, and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war; she was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship before being sold for scrap in 1922.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was derived from that of the previous , with a slight increase in size, armour and more powerful guns, among other more minor changes. &quot;Collingwood&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1911 her crew numbered 758 officers and ratings.
&quot;Collingwood&quot; was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her full-power, eight-hour sea trials on 17 January 1910, she only reached a top speed of from . &quot;Collingwood&quot; carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
The &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) 12-inch (305 mm) Mk XI guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat, armament comprised twenty BL 4-inch (102 mm) Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

The &quot;St Vincent&quot;-class ships had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes, reducing to a thickness of before it reached the ships&#x27; ends. Above this was a strake of armour thick. Transverse bulkheads inches thick terminated the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the endmost barbettes.

The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck that thinned to below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with roofs. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from . The front and sides of the forward conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick, respectively.

===Alterations===
The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the superstructure were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house eight 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition, a pair of 3-inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.

By April 1917, &quot;Collingwood&quot; mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns. Approximately of additional deck armour had been added after the Battle of Jutland. Before the end of the war the AA guns were moved from the deckhouse between the aft turrets to the stern and the stern torpedo tube was removed. In 1918, a high-angle rangefinder was fitted and flying-off platforms were installed on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Collingwood&quot;, named after Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, was ordered on 26 October 1907. She was laid down at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 3 February 1908, launched on 7 November 1908 and completed in April 1910. Including her armament, the ship&#x27;s cost is quoted at £1,680,888 or £1,731,640.

On 19 April 1910, &quot;Collingwood&quot; was commissioned and assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet under the command of Captain William Pakenham. She joined other members of the fleet in regular peacetime exercises, and on 11 February 1911 damaged her bottom plating on an uncharted rock off Ferrol. On 24 June the ship was present at the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead. Pakenham was relieved by Captain Charles Vaughan-Lee on 1 December. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron. On 22 June, Vaughan-Lee was transferred to the battleship and Captain James Ley assumed command; Vice-Admiral Stanley Colville hoisted his flag in &quot;Collingwood&quot; as commander of the 1st Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead before beginning a refit late in the year. In March 1913, &quot;Collingwood&quot; and the 1st Battle Squadron undertook a port visit to Cherbourg, France. Midshipman Prince Albert (later King George VI) was assigned to the ship on 15 September 1913. &quot;Collingwood&quot; hosted Albert&#x27;s older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, during a short cruise on 18 April 1914. She became a private ship when Colville hauled down his flag on 22 June.

===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Collingwood&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Collingwood&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Collingwood&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
The Grand Fleet, including &quot;Collingwood&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Collingwood&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. The ship sailed for Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on 2 February to begin a brief refit and returned on 18 February. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. From 25 March to 14 April 1915, Rear-Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas temporarily hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Collingwood&quot;. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland. &quot;Collingwood&quot; was briefly docked at Invergordon from 23 to 25 June. King George V inspected the ship on 8 July, and the Grand Fleet conducted training off Shetland beginning three days later. Rear-Admiral Ernest Gaunt temporarily used &quot;Collingwood&quot; as his flagship from 24 August to 24 September and from 10 December to 16 January 1916. On 2–5 September 1915, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Collingwood&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. On 21 November, she sailed for Devonport Royal Dockyard for a minor and arrived back at Scapa on 9 December.

The Grand Fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Collingwood&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response, the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Collingwood&quot; was the eighteenth ship from the head of the battle line after the Grand Fleet deployed for battle.

The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. The transition from cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions, forcing many ships to reduce speed to to avoid colliding with each other. During the first stage of the general engagement, &quot;Collingwood&quot; fired eight salvos from her main guns at the crippled light cruiser from 18:32, although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. Her secondary armament then engaged the destroyer , which was attempting to come to &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;″s assistance, but failed to hit her. At 19:15 &quot;Collingwood&quot; fired two salvoes of high explosive (HE) shells at the battlecruiser , hitting her target once before she disappeared into the mist. The shell detonated in the German ship&#x27;s sickbay and damaged the surrounding superstructure. Shortly afterwards, during the attack of the German destroyers around 19:20, the ship fired her main armament at a damaged destroyer without success and dodged two torpedoes that missed by behind and in front. This was the last time she fired her guns during the battle.

Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and &quot;Collingwood&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. &quot;Collingwood&quot; fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.

====Subsequent activity====
After the battle the ship was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee, who inspected &quot;Collingwood&quot; on 8 August 1916. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

&quot;Collingwood&quot; received a brief refit at Rosyth in early September before rejoining the Grand Fleet. On 29 October Sturdee came aboard to present the ship with her battle honour, &quot;Jutland 1916&quot;. Captain Wilmot Nicholson briefly assumed command on 1 December before transferring to the new battlecruiser upon his relief by Captain Cole Fowler on 26 March 1917. Together with the rest of the 4th Battle Squadron, &quot;Collingwood&quot; put to sea for tactical exercises for a few days in February 1917. The ship was present at Scapa Flow when her sister ship ″s magazines exploded on 9 July and her crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. In January 1918, &quot;Collingwood&quot; and other of the older dreadnoughts cruised off the coast of Norway for several days, possibly to provide distant cover for a convoy to Norway. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. By early November, &quot;Collingwood&quot; was at Invergordon to receive a brief refit in the floating dock based there, and missed the surrender of the High Seas Fleet on the 21st. She was slightly damaged on 23 November while attempting to come alongside the oiler RFA &quot;Ebonol&quot;.

In January 1919, &quot;Collingwood&quot; was transferred to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon the dissolution of the Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was redesignated the Third Fleet and &quot;Collingwood&quot; became its flagship. She became a tender to HMS &quot;Vivid&quot; on 1 October and served as a gunnery and wireless telegraphy (W/T) training ship. The W/T school was transferred to &quot;Glorious&quot; on 1 June 1920 and the gunnery duties followed in early August; &quot;Collingwood&quot; returned to the reserve. She became a boys&#x27; training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was paid off on 31 March 1922. &quot;Collingwood&quot; was sold to John Cashmore Ltd for scrap on 12 December and arrived at Newport, Wales, on 3 March 1923 to be broken up.

==Relics==
Battle ensigns flown by the ship during Jutland survive at the shore establishment of the same name and at the Roedean School in East Sussex.

<doc id="488526" wikidata="Q1565641" url="?curid=488526" title="HMS Vanguard (1909)">
<text>HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; was one of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August several months later, her service during World War I mostly consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

Shortly before midnight on 9 July 1917 at Scapa Flow, &quot;Vanguard&quot; suffered a series of magazine explosions. She sank almost instantly, killing 843 of the 845 men aboard. The wreck was heavily salvaged after the war, but was eventually protected as a war grave in 1984. It was designated as a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, and diving on the wreck is generally forbidden.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was derived from that of the previous , with a slight increase in size, armour and more powerful guns, among other minor changes. &quot;Vanguard&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1910 her crew numbered 753 officers and ratings.
&quot;Vanguard&quot; was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 17 December 1909, she unofficially reached a top speed of from , although she must have been lightly loaded to reach this speed. &quot;Vanguard&quot; carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .
The &quot;St Vincent&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mk XI guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat armament, comprised twenty BL Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

The &quot;St Vincent&quot;-class ships were protected by a waterline armoured belt thick that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes thick.

===Modifications===

The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1910–1911. About three years later, gun shields were fitted to most of the 4-inch guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of World War I, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house eight 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. A fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Approximately of additional deck armour were added afterwards. By April 1917, &quot;Vanguard&quot; mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as one 4-inch and one 3-inch AA gun.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Vanguard&quot;, the eighth ship of that name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered on 6 February 1908. She was laid down by Vickers Armstrong at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 2 April 1908, launched on 22 February 1909, and completed on 1 March 1910. Including armament, the ship cost about £1.6 million. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was commissioned on 1 March 1910, under the command of Captain John Eustace, and assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet. She was present in Torbay when King George V visited the fleet in late July. &quot;Vanguard&quot; also participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 and she trained with the Atlantic Fleet the following month before beginning a refit. Captain Arthur Ricardo relieved Eustace on 23 September.

The ship was recommissioned on 28 March 1912 and rejoined the 1st Division shortly before it was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron on 1 May. She participated in exercises with the 1st Fleet in October. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was refitted in December, with new bilge keels being installed. On 5 June 1913, Captain Cecil Hickley replaced Ricardo upon the latter&#x27;s promotion to commodore, second class.

===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Vanguard&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to forestall a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. On 1 September, the Grand Fleet was anchored at Scapa Flow when the light cruiser spotted a suspected German submarine, provoking a panic across the fleet. &quot;Vanguard&quot; also spotted what was believed to be a periscope and opened fire, but the whole incident proved to be a false alarm. Submarine scares such as this caused the fleet to be briefly (22 October to 3 November) based at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Vanguard&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and exercised their guns on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Vanguard&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet made another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Vanguard&quot;, conducted gunnery drills west of Orkney and Shetland on 10–13 January 1915. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but they were too far away to participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the fleet patrolled the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet swept the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet practised gunnery and battle exercises west of Shetland, and on 11 July there was more training off Shetland. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet was performing numerous training exercises before making another sweep into the North Sea on 13–15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Vanguard&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.
Captain James Dick relieved Hickley on 22 January 1916. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Vanguard&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. In April the ship was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy re-laid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

===Battle of Jutland===
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers managed to bait Scheer and Hipper into a pursuit as they fell back upon the main body of the Grand Fleet. After Jellicoe deployed his ships into line of battle, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was the eighteenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. Shortly after deploying from column into line ahead, her crew recorded that shells from the High Seas Fleet were falling nearby. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired 42 rounds from her main guns at the crippled light cruiser beginning at 18:32, claiming several hits. Between 19:20 and 19:30, &quot;Vanguard&quot; engaged several German destroyer flotillas with her main armament without result. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle, as the poor visibility hindered Jellicoe&#x27;s ability to close with the Germans before Scheer was able to disengage under the cover of darkness. &quot;Vanguard&quot; fired a total of 65 high-explosive and 15 common-pointed, capped, twelve-inch shells and 10 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====
The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet, while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was refitted in Rosyth in December.

==Explosion==

The ship anchored in Scapa Flow at about 18:30 on 9 July 1917 after having spent the morning exercising general evolutions concluding practising the routine for abandoning ship. The Captain made a speech to the ship&#x27;s company in which he stated that under present conditions a ship would either blow up in a matter of seconds, or would take several hours to sink. Practically this meant that all would go down with the ship or that everybody would be saved. It is a remarkable coincidence that his words were to be so tragically proved in less than 12 hours. There is no record of anyone detecting anything amiss until the first detonation at 23:20. &quot;Vanguard&quot; sank almost instantly, with only three of the crew surviving, one of whom died soon afterwards. A total of 843 men were lost, including two Australian stokers from the light cruiser who were serving time in the battleship&#x27;s brig. Another casualty was Commander Eto Kyōsuke, a military observer from the Imperial Japanese Navy, which was allied with the Royal Navy at the time through the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The bodies of 17 of the 22 men recovered after the explosion, plus that of Lieutenant Commander Alan Duke, who died after being rescued, were buried at the Royal Naval Cemetery at Lyness, not far from the site of the explosion. The others are commemorated on the Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth Naval Memorials.

A Court of Inquiry heard accounts from many witnesses on nearby ships. They accepted the consensus that there had been a small explosion with a white glare between the foremast and &#x27;A&#x27; turret, followed after a brief interval by two much larger explosions. The court decided, on the balance of the available evidence, that the main detonations were in either &#x27;P&#x27; magazine, &#x27;Q&#x27; magazine, or both. A great deal of debris thrown out by the explosions landed on nearby ships; a section of plating measuring approximately landed on board the battleship . It was found to be from the No. 2 Hydraulic Room abaft &#x27;A&#x27; barbette. It showed no signs of a blast from &#x27;A&#x27; magazine, which reinforced the visual evidence suggesting that the explosion took place in the central part of the ship.

Although the explosion was obviously a detonation of the cordite charges in a main magazine, the reason for it was less clear. There were several theories. The inquiry found that some of the cordite on board, which had been temporarily offloaded in December 1916 and catalogued at that time, was past its stated safe life. The possibility of spontaneous detonation was raised, but could not be proved. It was also noted that a number of ship&#x27;s boilers were still in use, and some watertight doors, which should have been closed in wartime, were open as the ship was in port. It was suggested that this might have contributed to a dangerously high temperature in the magazines. The final conclusion of the court was that a fire started in a four-inch magazine, perhaps when a raised temperature caused spontaneous ignition of cordite, spreading to one or the other main magazines, which then exploded.

==Wreck==

&quot;Vanguard&quot;″s wreck was heavily salvaged in search of non-ferrous metals before it was declared a war grave in 1984. Some of the main armament and armour plate was also removed.

The wreck and its associated debris cover a large area and lies at a depth of approximately at . The amidships portion of the ship is almost completely gone and &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets were blown some away. The bow and stern areas are almost intact as has been revealed by an extensive survey, carried out by a team of volunteer specialist divers and authorised by the Ministry of Defence in 2016. A report of the survey was published in April 2018.

The wreck was designated as a controlled site in 2002 and cannot be dived upon except with permission from the Ministry of Defence. The centenary of &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s loss was commemorated on 9 July 2017: descendants of the crew laid 40 wreaths above her wreckage, Royal Navy divers placed a new Union Jack on the wreck, and Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery—where some of the crew were buried—held a wreath-laying ceremony.

<text>Lifebook is a line of laptop computers made by Fujitsu, which also offers a range of notebooks and tablet PCs within the same Lifebook family.

== History ==
In partnership with Poqet Computer Corporation, Fujitsu launched the world&#x27;s first hand-held, one-pound, IBM/PC-XT-compatible computer in 1989. It launched its first single-spindle convertible Tablet PC, the Lifebook T3000 Series, in 2003; the T3010 was a launching pad for its current tablet PCs.

==Models==
All series, including former series, are listed here; currently (2017) the Lifebook A series is being continued more for the cheaper private sector and the series E, P, S, T, U mostly more for the business sector. Fujitsu is traditionally strong in the touch screen and tablet area (in the Lifebook S, T, and U series). In addition, reference is also made to the Stylistic series.

=== Lifebook A ===
The &quot;A Series&quot; was launched in 2010 and initially consisted of the &quot;all-round&quot; models A530, AH530 and AH550, which are offered in different variants. Similarities were displays with 39.6 cm (15.6 inches) diagonal, false led backlighting and 1366 × 768 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio, with or without anti-glare protection), as well as the built-in Intel HM55 chipset and keyboards with a numeric keypad. The devices are mainly equipped with mobile processors from the Intel Core i series offered. Even today (2017), the A series, for example with the models A555 and A557, are relatively inexpensive larger laptops (15.6 inches) that are offered as &quot;all-rounders&quot; or as private laptops.

=== Lifebook B ===
The &quot;B series&quot; was the Biblo class for subnotebooks. The first models (B110 and B112, 1998) were very compact (DIN A5 size and 1.1 kg) and had an 8.4&quot; color display. The special thing about the larger (DIN A4 format) successor models B213x (1999) was the touch-sensitive 10.4&quot; TFT screen and the input pen. The B series is no longer built and has been replaced by the T series or P series.

=== Lifebook C ===
Until 01/2008, the &quot;C series&quot; was the entry-level series for professional users. It had a simple and robust design, but some additional options such as 3D graphics cards were not available, and on the outside it hardly differed from the E series.

=== Lifebook E ===
The &quot;E Series&quot; is a line of desktop replacement notebooks. They are particularly robust and usually have more powerful components than the C series (faster processors, more RAM, etc.), which is also reflected in the price. The E series usually has a high-quality, high-contrast 15/15.4-inch screen that is specially designed for office use, since no reflective displays are used and 4:3 formats are mostly available.

=== Lifebook NH ===
46.7 cm screen width. multimedia and gaming.

=== Lifebook P ===

Several ultraportable notebooks are available under the &quot;P-series .&quot; This includes e.g. B. the P1620, which is one of the lightest convertible tablet PC with a weight of 1 kg . The P stands for piccolo .

=== Lifebook Q ===
The &quot;Q series&quot; are lifestyle notebooks that stand out from the other series with their piano finish and ergonomic covers in stainless steel design and are intended to appeal to a demanding group of buyers. This series is particularly optimized for mobile operation, which is why only ultra-low-voltage processors from the Intel core architecture are used, the main memory is soldered and two batteries with a runtime of more than 10 hours can be used.

=== Lifebook S ===
The &quot;S Series&quot; is a line of notebooks originally intended for frequent travelers. The performance is roughly comparable to the E series, but the construction is a bit lighter and the notebooks are smaller due to 14/13 inch displays.

=== Lifebook T ===

The &quot;T series&quot; consists of convertible tablet PCs. By rotating the screen, they transform into a &quot;tablet&quot;. The &quot;T&quot; here stands for tablet. The T-Series was introduced in September 2003 with the T3010, which was FTS&#x27; most powerful tablet PC and first ever convertible at launch. Although FTS had been building computers that could be operated with a pen ( stylistic ) for a long time, these were only suitable for pen input without any additional devices (cf. slate tablet PCs).

Released in June 2006, the T4210 was the first tablet PC to feature an Intel Core Duo processor. The Toshiba Tecra M7 was launched about a month later. The LIFEBOOK T4215 was the first convertible tablet PC with embedded UMTS. Currently (2017) the T936 and T937 are narrow but powerful &#x27;convertibles&#x27; in the range.

=== Lifebook U ===

In May 2007, Fujitsu Japan presented an extremely small and light convertible tablet PC. The device, which weighs only 580 g, was marketed as a UMPC and is about the size of a PDA . Today (2017), powerful notebooks that are light but not extremely small are sold in the series, which usually have a 13.3 or 14 inch screen diagonal (U747, U757, U937).

== Other series ==
Other series from Fujitsu are:

* Esprimo Mobile – affordable business series
* Amilo-PRO - another inexpensive business series
* Amilo - Consumer series; also with special variants for computer players
* Celsius – Mobile workstations especially for CAD etc.
* Stylistic ST - pen-operated computers (slate tablets) without a keyboard
* NH - Laptops with 46.7 cm screen width, for multimedia and gaming

<doc id="488530" wikidata="Q1971112" url="?curid=488530" title="Alpha TV">
<text>Alpha TV is a Greek free-to-air channel, one of the biggest stations in Greece. The station features a mix of Greek and foreign shows with an emphasis on information. The studios are located in Kifissia and Pallini. Alpha TV is owned by Alpha Satellite Television S.A. In Cyprus, private broadcaster Sigma TV used to broadcast a number of Alpha&#x27;s programs. In the past, public service broadcaster CyBC used to broadcast Alpha TV programs. In 2015, Alpha TV Cyprus was founded, and broadcast the Alpha TV Programs and others of its own. Alpha Cyprus is now one of the highest-rated Cypriot channels.

==History==

*1993: Skai TV was launched to compete with Mega and ANT1 similar to ERT Channels. It began broadcasting with a heavy emphasis on news and sports. At the time, its sister station was the #1 ranked radio station in Athens, Skai 100.4.
*1994: Skai TV began to exchange family/children&#x27;s programmes from Star Channel with Alpha&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming.
*1999: Skai TV sold, renamed Alpha Sky, later A-Sky during a transition period and now to Alpha TV.
*2002: Alpha TV begins broadcast of its international network called Alpha Australia and signs up with UBI World TV to make it available outside of Australia as well as Asia and Africa.
*2007: Alpha TV launches its channel Alpha Sat into North America on DirecTV.
*2008: Alpha Australia debuts in New Zealand via UBI World TV. Alpha TV &amp; Alpha Radio are sold to RTL Group, who now control the majority share in the company.
*2012: RTL Group sell their share to Dimitris Kontominas, giving him full control of the channel.
*2016: On 4 April, makes premiere the Cypriot version, called Alpha TV Cyprus.

When the channel was called Skai TV, it was written using Greek letters. It was Latinized and changed to a blue font in 1999 when Tsotsoros bought it from Giannis Alafouzos. In September 1999, it became Alpha-Sky before changing to its present name in October of the same year. The logo was retained despite the changes in the channel&#x27;s name.

In 2006, the logo was changed to Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, to reflect the channel&#x27;s popularity. The font letters in 2003 changed and a circle was added over Alpha, but the two As (alphas) remain. In 2005, a new version was introduced and is coloured with red. The logo was updated prior to the launch of the 2007-2008 season.

In December 2008, Dimitris Kontominas sold a majority share (66.6%) of Alpha TV to Luxembourg media company RTL Group. Kontominas will continue to be involved with Alpha as he still owns 33.4% and has been named the president of the new holding company called &quot;Alpha Media Group&quot;.

In March 2009, the company made significant changes to the news programming output. The afternoon news show has been cut to 15 minutes in duration and now airs at 13:00. The main evening news has also moved from the highly competitive slot of 20:00 and instead broadcasts at 19:00.

On 5 January 2012, RTL Group announced that they had reached an agreement to sell their share to minority owner Dimitris Kontominas, making him once again the full owner of the channel. The deal was finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2012.

In the summer of 2018, some of its shows moved to Star Channel facilities and on October 30, the purchase of 50.1% of his shares by the Vardinogiannis group was announced, which later acquired the remaining shares, making him the full owner.

In mid-2022, Primos Media, owned by an investment group in Luxembourg, acquired half of the channel&#x27;s shares, with the other half and management remaining with the Vardinogiannis group.

<doc id="488532" wikidata="Q815925" url="?curid=488532" title="Bellerophon-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class battleship was a group of three dreadnought battleships that were built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. The sister ships spent most of their careers assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and the inconclusive action of 19 August several months later, their service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

In late 1918, and were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and supported Allied forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea after the war ended in November. The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s were deemed obsolete by this time and were reduced to reserve in 1919 and were then used as training ships. &quot;Superb&quot; was used for gunnery experiments in 1920 and then became a target ship in 1922 before being sold for scrap later that year. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Temeraire&quot; were sold in late 1921 and subsequently broken up.

==Background and description==
The Admiralty&#x27;s 1905 draft building plan envisioned four battleships in the 1906–1907 Naval Programme, but the new Liberal government cut one of these ships in mid-1906. The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class design was a slightly larger and improved version of the revolutionary preceding , with better underwater protection and a more powerful secondary armament.

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crews numbered about 680 officers and ratings upon completion and 840 in 1914.

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine room. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts. Separate cruising turbines were provided for each shaft. The turbines used steam from eighteen water-tube boilers at a working pressure of . They were rated at and were intended to give the ships a maximum speed of . Refinements to the hull shape allowed the larger &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class to match &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s speed despite the same horsepower rating. During their sea trials, the ships handily exceeded their designed speed and horsepower. To save weight, they carried slightly less fuel than &quot;Dreadnought&quot;: of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

In the interest of saving time, the &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s retained the same main battery and turret layout as &quot;Dreadnought&quot;: ten breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining pair as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The guns could initially be depressed to −5° and elevated to +13.5°, although the turrets were modified to allow 16° of elevation during the First World War. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at +13.5°, this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing (AP) 2 crh shells. Using the more aerodynamic, but slightly heavier, 4 crh AP shells at the same elevation, the range was extended to . The rate of fire of these guns was about two rounds per minute and the ships carried 80 shells per gun.
The 12-pounder () guns with which &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was equipped to provide protection from torpedo boats were recognised as being insufficiently powerful and sixteen guns replaced the twenty-eight guns on &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. These were 50-calibre BL 4-inch Mark VII guns. Pairs of these guns were installed in unshielded mounts on the roofs of &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets, and the other eight were positioned in single mounts at forecastle-deck level in the superstructure. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 200 rounds per gun. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 18-inch (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which fourteen torpedoes were provided.

In order to accommodate the weight of the enlarged anti-torpedo bulkheads, the thickness of the waterline belt of the &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class ships was reduced from in thickness. The belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour that extended between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes, reducing to a thickness of forward and aft before it reached the ships&#x27; ends. It covered the side of the hull from the middle deck down to below the normal waterline where it tapered to on the bottom edge. Above this was a strake of armour 8 inches thick that had its top edge above the waterline. An 8-inch oblique bulkhead connected the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts to the rear barbette; there was no forward equivalent.

The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck that thinned to below it, except for the rear barbette which was 9 inches thick for its entire height. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with 3-inch roofs. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from to 4 inches. The front and sides of the forward conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick, respectively. The aft conning tower had 8-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. While &quot;Dreadnought&quot; had torpedo bulkheads that protected only the magazines, the &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s had complete longitudinal bulkheads, 0.75 to 3 inches thick, that covered the sides of the hull between the fore and aft magazines.

===Fire control===
&quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s tripod foremast was positioned behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to serve as a support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.

The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting tops at the head of the fore and mainmasts. Data from a Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. As a backup, &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.

An experimental fire-control director was fitted in the forward spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. This electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. The director was subsequently removed, but &quot;Superb&quot; had a production model installed by May 1915 and both &quot;Temeraire&quot; and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; received theirs by May 1916. The latter&#x27;s director, however, was not fully installed by the date of the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month and she fought without it. Furthermore, they were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables by early 1916 in the transmission stations. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

===Modifications===

The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 on &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and on her sisters in 1914. During the first year of the war, the guns on the wing turrets were moved into the aft part of the superstructure. Sometime around 1915, the guns on the stern turret were removed as were a pair from the superstructure, which reduced their secondary armament to a total of twelve guns. About that time, a pair of 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. Approximately of additional deck armour were added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. By April 1917, the sisters mounted single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns and the stern torpedo tube had been removed. One additional 4-inch gun was removed from &quot;Superb&quot; in 1917–1918. In 1918, a high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the forward spotting top and flying-off platforms were installed on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets of &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. After the war, &quot;Temeraire&quot; had four 4-inch guns removed to make space for naval cadets and the AA guns were stripped from her and &quot;Superb&quot;.

==Careers==

Upon commissioning, all three ships were assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet and were reviewed by King Edward VII and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during Cowes Week on 31 July 1909. They participated in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead on 24 June 1911. Less than a year later, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. &quot;Superb&quot; and &quot;Temeraire&quot; visited Cherbourg, France, in July 1913. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was transferred to the 4th BS in March 1914, followed by &quot;Temeraire&quot; in July. Each of the sisters underwent a lengthy refit before the First World War began in August.

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the sisters took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans&#x27; reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. &quot;Superb&quot; joined her sisters in the 4th BS in November 1915.

===Battle of Jutland===

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers which were to act as bait. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, so the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

Once Jellicoe&#x27;s ships had rendezvoused with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, on the morning of 31 May, he organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd BS were on his left (east), the 4th BS was in the centre and the 1st BS on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 4th and 1st Battle Squadrons in the center and rear of the line of battle, respectively, which meant that the sisters were in the middle of the Grand Fleet once it finished deploying. All three ships fired at the crippled light cruiser , possibly scoring some hits, as well as the battlecruiser . &quot;Temeraire&quot; was the only one of the sisters to score a hit on the battlecruiser, although it did little damage. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Temeraire&quot; also fired at German destroyers, but failed to make any hits. None of the sisters fired more than 62 rounds from their main guns during the battle.

===Subsequent activity===
The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.
During June–September 1917, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; served as the junior flagship of the 4th BS while the regular flagship was being refitted. The Grand Fleet sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, &quot;Superb&quot; and &quot;Temeraire&quot; were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and &quot;Superb&quot; became the fleet flagship. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November and she became a gunnery training ship in March 1919 at the Nore as the class was obsolescent.

&quot;Superb&quot; and &quot;Temeraire&quot; returned home the following month after supporting Allied operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea and were placed into reserve. Later that year, &quot;Temeraire&quot; was converted into a cadet training ship and continued on that duty until early 1921 when she was paid off. In the meantime &quot;Superb&quot; relieved &quot;Bellerophon&quot; as a gunnery training ship in late 1919 and the latter was reduced to reserve. &quot;Superb&quot; was relieved in her turn at the end of 1919 and was paid off in early 1920. The ship was used for gunnery trials beginning at the end of the year and was used as a target ship during 1922 before being sold, the last of the sisters still in existence as &quot;Temeraire&quot; and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had been sold for scrap in late 1921.

<text>HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was the lead ship of her class of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was used as a training ship before she was placed in reserve. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up beginning the following year.

==Design and description==

The design of the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class was derived from that of the revolutionary battleship , with a slight increase in size, armour and a more powerful secondary armament. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1909 her crew numbered 680 officers and ratings and 720 in 1910.

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s sea trials on 2 November 1908, she reached a top speed of from . The ship carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat armament, comprised 16 BL Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other eight were positioned in the superstructure. All secondary guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class ships had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from . The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

====Modifications====

An experimental fire-control director was fitted in the forward spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun was added to the aft turret roof.

By May 1916, a director had been installed high on the forward tripod mast, but it was not fully wired up by the end of the month when the Battle of Jutland was fought. After the battle approximately of additional deck armour was added. Sometime during the year, the ship was fitted to operate kite balloons. By April 1917, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had exchanged the three-inch AA gun on &#x27;Y&#x27; turret for a four-inch gun and the stern torpedo tube had been removed. In 1918 a high-angle rangefinder was fitted, the starboard aft four-inch gun was removed and the four-inch AA gun was moved to the quarterdeck. After the war ended, both AA guns were removed.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; was named after the mythic Greek hero Bellerophon and was the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 30 October 1906 and was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 3 December 1906. She was launched on 27 July 1907 and completed in February 1909. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,763,491 or £1,765,342. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was commissioned on 20 February 1909, under the command of Captain Hugh Evan-Thomas, and assigned to the Nore Division of the Home Fleet, before it was renamed the 1st Division the following month. She was a participant in combined fleet manoeuvres in June–July and was reviewed by King Edward VII and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during Cowes Week on 31 July. The ship took part in fleet manoeuvres in April and July and Evan-Thomas was relieved by Captain Trevylyan Napier on 16 August before she began a refit in late 1910 at Portsmouth. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; participated in the combined exercises for the Mediterranean, Home and Atlantic Fleets in January 1911 and she was lightly damaged in a collision with the battlecruiser on 26 May. The ship was present during the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead on 24 June and then participated in training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet. She was refitted again later in the year. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS). The ship was present in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. Captain Charles Vaughan-Lee relieved Napier on 16 August and then &quot;Bellerophon&quot; participated in manoeuvres in October. In November, she exercised with the Mediterranean Fleet and visited Athens, Greece. Vaughan-Lee was relieved by Captain Edward Bruen on 18 August 1913 and the ship was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron on 10 March 1914.

===First World War===

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review between 17 and 20 July 1914 as part of the British response to the July Crisis. The ship was en route for her scheduled refit at Gibraltar on 26 July when she was recalled to join the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. She collided with the merchantman off Orkney the following day, but suffered little damage. In August, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Bellerophon&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. On 16 December, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the 4th BS conducted target practice north of the Hebrides on 24 December and then rendezvoused with the rest of the Grand Fleet for another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but they were too far away to participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the fleet patrolled the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

In May, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was refitted at Devonport. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet was performing numerous training exercises before making another sweep into the North Sea on 13–15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Vice Admiral Franz Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was the fourteenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired intermittently on the crippled light cruiser from 18:25, and may have engaged the German dreadnoughts during this time, but did not claim to have hit anything. At 19:17, the ship opened fire at the battlecruiser and scored one hit that glanced off the conning tower. The only significant damage that the armour-piercing, capped (APC) shell caused was from a splinter that destroyed the rangefinder in &#x27;B&#x27; turret. About ten minutes later, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; engaged several German destroyer flotillas with her main armament without result. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle. She was not damaged and fired a total of 62 twelve-inch shells (42 APC and 21 common pointed, capped) and 14 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====
The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. On 31 August Bruen was relieved by Captain Hugh Watson.
During June–September 1917, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; served as the junior flagship of the 4th BS, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Roger Keyes and then Rear-Admiral Douglas Nicholson, while the regular flagship, , was being refitted. The ship was present in Scapa Flow when the battleship &#x27;s magazines exploded on 9 July and her boats rescued two of the three survivors. A large piece of wreckage landed on her deck. Captain Vincent Molteno assumed command on 13 February 1918. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. Captain Francis Mitchell relieved Molteno on 12 October. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; became a gunnery training ship in March 1919 at the Nore as she was thoroughly obsolete in comparison to the latest dreadnoughts. Mitchell was relieved by Captain Humphrey Bowring on 15 March. She was replaced as a training ship by her sister ship, , on 25 September and was reduced to reserve at Devonport where &quot;Bellerophon&quot; began a refit that lasted until early January 1920. The ship was scheduled for disposal in March 1921 and listed for sale on 14 August. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was sold to the Slough Trading Co. on 8 November 1921 for £44,000 and was resold to a German company in September 1922. The ship departed Plymouth, under tow, for Germany on 14 September and was subsequently broken up.

<doc id="488534" wikidata="Q2605181" url="?curid=488534" title="HMS Superb (1907)">
<text>HMS &quot;Superb&quot; was one of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent almost her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

&quot;Superb&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in October 1918 and became its flagship. She supported Allied forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea after the war ended in November. The ship was deemed obsolete and was reduced to reserve when she returned home in early 1919 and was then used as a training ship. &quot;Superb&quot; was used for gunnery experiments in 1920 and then became a target ship in 1922. The ship was sold for scrap late that year and broken up in 1923.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class was derived from that of the revolutionary battleship , with a slight increase in size, armour and a more powerful secondary armament. &quot;Superb&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1914 her crew numbered 840 officers and ratings.
The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During &quot;Superb&quot;″s sea trials on 2 April 1909, she reached a top speed of from . The ship carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
The &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat armament, comprised 16 BL Mk VII guns in single mounts. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other eight were positioned in the superstructure. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class ships had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from . The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

====Modifications====
The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1914 and the guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun was added to the aft turret roof.

By May 1915, a fire-control director had been installed high on the forward tripod mast and approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland a year later. By April 1917, &quot;Superb&quot; had exchanged the three-inch AA gun on &#x27;Y&#x27; turret for a four-inch gun and the stern torpedo tube had been removed. In 1918 a high-angle rangefinder was fitted, the starboard aft four-inch gun was removed and the four-inch AA gun was moved to the quarterdeck. By this time, the ship mounted 11 four-inch guns, plus one three- and one four-inch AA gun. After the war ended, both AA guns were removed.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Superb&quot; was the eighth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 26 December 1906 and was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at their shipyard in Elswick on 6 February 1907. She was launched on 7 November and completed in May 1909. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,676,529 or £1,641,114. &quot;Superb&quot; was commissioned on 29 May 1909 and assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet, under the command of Captain Frederick Tudor. She was reviewed by King Edward VII and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during Cowes Week on 31 July. The ship participated in fleet manoeuvres in April and July before beginning a refit in late 1910 at Portsmouth. Captain Herbert Heath relieved Tudor on 16 August. &quot;Superb&quot; took part in the combined exercises for the Mediterranean, Home and Atlantic Fleets in January 1911 and was present during the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead on 24 June. Heath was relieved by Captain Ernest Gaunt on 22 September. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS). The ship was present in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead and then participated in manoeuvres in October. On 30 April 1913 Captain George Hope assumed command. The following July, the squadron visited Cherbourg, France.

===First World War===
&quot;Superb&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review between 17 and 20 July 1914 as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack. Captain Price Lewes relived Hope on 28 July. In August, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. Lewes was relieved on 4 November for reasons of ill-health and died five days later from a kidney disease. Captain Rudolf Bentinck assumed command of the ship on the 6th. On the evening of 22 November, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea, during which &quot;Superb&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st BS cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Superb&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
The ship departed Scapa Flow to have her turbines repaired at Portsmouth on 18 January 1915 and rejoined her squadron on 11 March. During this time, Captain Edmond Hyde Parker relieved Bentinck. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the fleet patrolled the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April. It made further sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. &quot;Superb&quot; had to be escorted from Devonport on 16 June after the completion of her refit. The Grand Fleet conducted training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the fleet was performing numerous training exercises before making another sweep into the North Sea on 13–15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Superb&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. Five days later, the ship was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Superb&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea. When the dreadnought began a refit later that month, she was relieved by &quot;Superb&quot; as the flagship of the 3rd Division of the 4th BS, commanded by Rear-Admiral Alexander Duff.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s 5 battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May &quot;Superb&quot; was the eleventh ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship opened fire with her main guns at 18:26 at the crippled light cruiser , claiming several hits. At 19:17, the ship fired seven salvos at the battlecruiser , but did not make any hits. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle. She received no damage and fired a total of 54 twelve-inch shells (38 high explosive and 16 common pointed, capped) during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====
The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. &quot;Superb&quot; was refitting at this time and did not participate in this action. On 2 January 1918, Hyde Parker was relieved by Captain Sidney Drury-Lowe before he was transferred to command the battleship on 3 April. The ship began a refit that same month before recommissioning in June. Captain Stephen Radcliffe assumed command of the ship on 22 June and remained in command until 15 December 1919.
In October 1918, &quot;Superb&quot; and her sister ship, , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and &quot;Superb&quot; became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, upon her arrival at Mudros on 31 October. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked &quot;Superb&quot; to provide a crew for the , which had been turned over to the Allies by the Germans after the Armistice of 11 November. On 4 December, the ship conveyed Gough-Calthorpe to Odessa, Russia, to inspect the situation there; he made another such visit to Port Said, Egypt, in late March 1919.

The following month, she was relieved and sailed for England, and was reduced to reserve at Sheerness upon her arrival on 26 April as she was thoroughly obsolete in comparison to the latest dreadnoughts. &quot;Superb&quot; became a gunnery training ship in September, until she was relieved of that duty in December. The ship was listed for disposal on 26 March 1920 at the Nore and was used for gunnery experiments in December. Beginning in May 1922, she was used as a target ship for the next several months. In December, she was sold to Stanlee Shipbreaking Company, but was not towed to Dover for demolition until 7 April 1923.

<text>HMS &quot;Temeraire&quot; was one of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent almost her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

&quot;Temeraire&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in October 1918 and she supported Allied forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea after the war ended in November. The ship was deemed obsolete and was reduced to reserve when she returned home in early 1919 and was then used as a training ship. &quot;Temeraire&quot; was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up the following year.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class was derived from that of the revolutionary battleship , with a slight increase in size, armour and a more powerful secondary armament. &quot;Temeraire&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1909 her crew numbered 681 officers and ratings and 729 in 1911.
The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;s were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of and were intended to give them a maximum speed of . During &quot;Temeraire&quot;″s sea trials on 5 March 1909, she reached a top speed of from . The ship carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
The &quot;Bellerophon&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27;, respectively. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat armament, comprised 16 BL Mk VII guns in single mounts. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other eight were positioned in the superstructure. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

The &quot;Bellerophon&quot;-class ships had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from . The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

====Modifications====
The four-inch guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1914 and the guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun was added to the aft turret roof.

By May 1916, a fire-control director had been installed high on the forward tripod mast and approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland. By April 1917, &quot;Temeraire&quot; had exchanged the three-inch AA gun on &#x27;Y&#x27; turret for a four-inch gun and the stern torpedo tube had been removed. In 1918 a high-angle rangefinder was fitted and the four-inch AA gun was moved to the quarterdeck. After the war ended, four secondary guns were removed to provide extra space for naval cadets and both AA guns were dismounted.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Temeraire&quot; was named after the French 74-gun ship of the line Téméraire that had been captured in 1759, and was the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 30 October 1906 and was laid down at HM Dockyard, Devonport on 1 January 1907. She was launched on 24 August 1907 and completed in May 1909. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,744,287 or £1,751,144. On 31 July 1909 &quot;Temeraire&quot; was taking part in a Royal Review of the Fleet at Spithead when an accident with a 4-inch gun injured three men, one of whom later died. &quot;Temeraire&quot; was commissioned on 15 May 1909 and assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet under the command of Captain Alexander Duff. She participated in combined fleet manoeuvres in June–July and was then reviewed by King Edward VII and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during Cowes Week on 31 July. Captain Arthur Christian relieved Duff on 25 October. &quot;Temeraire&quot; was refitted in 1911 at Devonport and then took part in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead on 24 June 1911. Christian was relieved in his turn by Captain Reginald Allenby on 12 August. The 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The ship was present in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead and then participated in manoeuvres in October. On 5 April 1913 Captain Cresswell Eyres assumed command of the ship. The squadron visited Cherbourg, France in July. Eyres was relieved by Captain Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair on 1 September.

===First World War===

On 15 July 1914, &quot;Temeraire&quot; was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron and took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review between 17 and 20 July as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack. In August, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Temeraire&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. On 16 December, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Temeraire&quot; and the 4th BS conducted target practice north of the Hebrides on 24 December and then rendezvoused with the rest of the Grand Fleet for another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.

Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Temeraire&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but they were too far away to participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 8 February, Captain Allen Hunt relieved Alexander-Sinclair. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the fleet patrolled the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet swept the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. &quot;Temeraire&quot; was refitted at Devonport in mid-1915 and rejoined the 4th BS in August. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet was performing numerous training exercises before making another sweep into the North Sea on 13–15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Temeraire&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Hunt was relieved in his turn by Captain Edwin Underhill on 3 March. Another sweep began on three days later, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Temeraire&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Temeraire&quot; was the fifteenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired five salvos from her main guns at the crippled light cruiser from 18:34, claiming two or three hits. At 19:17, the ship fired seven salvos at the battlecruiser , but did not make any hits. About ten minutes later, &quot;Temeraire&quot; engaged several German destroyer flotillas with three salvos from her main armament without result. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle. She received no damage and fired a total of 72 twelve-inch shells (all high explosive) and 50 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====
The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

The Grand Fleet sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, &quot;Temeraire&quot; and her sister ship, , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe. They were part of the squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked &quot;Temeraire&quot; to provide a crew for the , which had been turned over to the Allies by the Germans after the Armistice of 11 November. On 13 February 1919, Captain Francis Caulfeild relieved Underhill. The ship remained in the Black Sea and Ottoman waters until 3 April, when she departed for home, having visited Sevastopol, Russia, and Haifa, Palestine, during her deployment.

Upon her arrival at Devonport on 23 April, &quot;Temeraire&quot; was reduced to reserve as she was thoroughly obsolete in comparison to the latest dreadnoughts. Five months later, to the day, she recommissioned as a cadet training ship and began her first training cruise to the Mediterranean on 8 October. Upon her arrival at Portsmouth on 11 April 1921, the ship was relieved of her duty and she sailed for Rosyth, Scotland, four days later to be listed for disposal. She was sold to the Stanlee Shipbreaking &amp; Salvage Co. for scrap in late 1921 and was towed to Dover for demolition in February 1922.

<doc id="488536" wikidata="Q6626637" url="?curid=488536" title="List of loanwords in Indonesian">
<text>The Indonesian language has absorbed many loanwords from other languages, Sanskrit, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Portuguese, Dutch, English, French, Greek, Latin and other Austronesian languages.

Indonesian differs from the form of Malay used in Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore in a number of aspects, primarily due to the different influences both languages experienced and also due to the fact that the majority of Indonesians speak another language as their mother tongue. Indonesian functions as the lingua franca for speakers of 700 various languages across the archipelago.

Conversely, many words of Malay-Indonesian origin have also been borrowed into English. Words borrowed into English (e.g., bamboo, orangutan, dugong, amok, and even &quot;cooties&quot;) generally entered through Malay language by way of British colonial presence in Malaysia and Singapore, similar to the way the Dutch have been borrowing words from the various native Indonesian languages. One exception is &quot;bantam&quot;, derived from the name of the Indonesian province Banten in Western Java (see Oxford American Dictionary, 2005 edition). Another is &quot;lahar&quot; which is Javanese for a volcanic mudflow. Still other words taken into modern English from Malay/Indonesian probably have other origins (e.g., &quot;satay&quot; from Tamil, or &quot;ketchup&quot; from Chinese).

During development, various native terms (mostly Javanese) from all over the archipelago made their way into the language. The Dutch adaptation of the Malay language during the colonial period resulted in the incorporation of a significant number of Dutch loanwords and vocabulary. This event significantly affected the original Malay language, which gradually developed into modern Indonesian. Most terms are documented in &quot;Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia&quot;.

== Chronology ==
The study of Indonesian etymology and loan words reflects its historical and social context. Examples include the early Sanskrit borrowings, probably during the Srivijaya period, the borrowings from Arabic and Persian, especially during the time of the establishment of Islam, and words borrowed from Dutch during the colonial period. Linguistic history and cultural history are clearly linked.

* Early Hindu and Buddhist influence from India results in many Sanskrit words in Indonesian (and especially adopted through Javanese influence). Indian traders may have contributed words as well, in Tamil and Sanskrit-related languages.
* Indonesian has evolved through trade with China since ancient times, including through significant numbers of Chinese immigrants migrating to Indonesia. As a result, some of the Chinese language, especially the Hokkien dialect, has been incorporated into Indonesian.
* Muslim influence, originally through Arabic and Persian traders over a number of centuries, resulted in an extensive influence from the Arabic and Persian.
* Portuguese contact, trade and colonization in the 16th century was the first contact between Indonesia and European culture, and had an influence that remains today, in spite of the relatively short time period of that influence.
* Dutch colonization and administration, lasting from the 17th century to the 20th, extensively affected the vocabulary. As Dutch-trained linguists determined the rules for the official Indonesian language, Dutch thus affected the structure of the language as well. For example, suffixes such as &quot;-asi&quot; (e.g., administrasi = administrative) and &quot;-if&quot; (e.g., fiktif = fictief) were applied with consistency. Some loan words are still intensively used today, although Indonesian equivalents exist.
* Modern Indonesian regularly adopts new words from other languages, particularly English. In contrast to the large number of mechanical terms borrowed from Dutch (e.g., automotive parts), hi-tech words are typically taken from English (e.g., internet) and some informal greetings such as &quot;hai&quot;, &quot;he&quot; (probably from Javanese), &quot;yo&quot;, etc.

But the processes may also be ‘out of period’; for example, Indonesian words are still being concocted from Sanskrit, and the influence of the Dutch language certainly continued after the Dutch themselves left.

Indonesian has also generalized brand names into common (lower-case) nouns as generic name. For example, &quot;sanyo&quot; refers to any electrical well pump, regardless of manufacturer, &quot;odol&quot; as all of toothpastes, or “aqua” for mineral water. This is similar to the type of generalization that occurs in English words like &quot;xerox&quot; or &quot;tampax&quot; or &quot;polaroid&quot;.

==List of loanwords==

===From Austronesian languages===

====From Minangkabau====
Most of Indonesian&#x27;s vocabulary is natively derived from Malay, but some might ultimately be loanwords from the Minang language. Yet it is unclear, since Malay and Minang are closely related, and some might consider Minang to have been an ancestral dialect of Malay.
====From Javanese====
Compared to the Malay language spoken as the native regional language in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula or the standardized version of Malaysian, Indonesian differs profoundly by the large number of Javanese loanwords incorporated into their already rich vocabulary. This is mostly contributed by Java&#x27;s position as the center of Indonesian politics, education, and culture, since the capital is located in Jakarta on Java island, albeit in the area where the Javanese are not the majority. The disproportionate number of Javanese that dominate Indonesian politics is reflected by the fact that six out of seven Indonesian presidents have been ethnic Javanese. The result is that the Javanese began to pour their own vocabulary into Indonesian to describes terms and words that do not have exact counterparts in the Malay language. It is also important to note that most of Indonesian&#x27;s Sanskrit loanwords have been transmitted through Old Javanese, a language whose Sanskrit borrowings number almost 50% of the total vocabulary. Javanese loanwords, unlike those from other native languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign.
====From Sundanese====
Besides Javanese, Sundanese is another local language that has influenced Indonesian&#x27;s vocabulary, albeit to a lesser extent. This can be attributed to the fact that the capital, Jakarta, was formerly a part of West Java, a province which, together with Banten, before it too was divided, constituted the &quot;Pasundan&quot; (Sundanese world), the most significant non-Javanese region in an otherwise Javanese-dominated Java island. Some of the most populous cities in Indonesia are also located in the &quot;Pasundan&quot;, including West Java&#x27;s capital, Bandung, and Jakarta&#x27;s four satellite cities (Bekasi, Bogor, Depok, and Tangerang).

====From Betawi====
Betawi is a Malay-based creole that arose from influences by foreign traders who stopped at the capital, Jakarta, including those from China and Arabia. Most of its speakers are inhabitants of Jakarta, and its influence upon Indonesian is attributed to its frequent usage in Indonesian mass media, including radio and television. Its status as a &quot;hip&quot; language by other portions of Indonesian society is another contributing factor as well.

====From Nias====
====From Batak====
====From Palembang====
====From Ambonese====
====From Balinese====
Balinese, or simply Bali, is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by 3.3 million people (as of 2000) on the Indonesian island of Bali as well as northern Nusa Penida, western Lombok and eastern Java.

===From Indian languages===

====From Sanskrit====

Although Hinduism and Buddhism are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, Sanskrit, the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem, and its status is comparable with that of Latin in English and other Western Indo-European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for neologisms; these are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. For example, the name of Jayapura city (former Hollandia) and Jayawijaya Mountains (former Orange Range) in the Indonesian province of Papua were coined in the 1960s; both are Sanskrit origin name to replace its Dutch colonial names. Some Indonesian contemporary medals of honor and awards, such as Bintang Mahaputra medal, Kalpataru award and Adipura award, are also Sanskrit derived names.

The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of religion, art and everyday life. The Sanskrit influence on Indonesia came from contacts with India long ago before the 1st century. The words are either directly borrowed from India or through the intermediary of the Old Javanese language. In the classical language of Java, Old Javanese, the number of Sanskrit loanwords is far greater. The Old Javanese — English dictionary by Prof. P.J. Zoetmulder, S.J. (1982) contains no fewer than 25,500 entries. Almost half are Sanskrit loanwords. Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign.

====From Pali====
Pali (Pāli) is a Prakrit language and belongs to the Indo-European language family together with Sanskrit. As Sanskrit is the language vehicle of Hinduism, Pali is the language vehicle for Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition which is mainly adhered to by Buddhists within Indosphere Southeast Asia. Virtually every word in Pāḷi has cognates in the other Middle Indo-Aryan languages, the Prakrits. The relationship to Vedic Sanskrit is less direct and more complicated; the Prakrits were descended from Old Indo-Aryan vernaculars.

====From Hindi====
Hindi (Devanagari: हिन्दी, IAST: Hindī) is a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language. Hindi is an Indo-European, and specifically an Indo-Aryan language. It is descended from Sanskrit and is considered part of the Central Indo-Aryan subgroup.

====From Tamil====
Loanwords from Tamil, while also an Indian language (though not Indo-European like Sanskrit), mainly exist in cuisine, like Chinese and unlike Sanskrit. It is a Dravidian language and not an Indo-Aryan language. However, Hinduism had great impact in Tamil, there are several Indo-Aryan loanwords in Tamil and they are possibility to list them in Indo-Aryan loanwords, such as Sanskrit.

Interaction between Tamil speakers and Malay speakers has been established from ancient time. Tamil influence has been around such as Palava usage as ancient script in Indonesia (Palava dynasty was existed on 275 CE–897 CE) and Chola invasion of Srivijaya in 1025. It mainly entered the lexicon of Malay (and by extension, Indonesian) with the immigration of South Indian traders who settled around the Strait of Malacca.

===From Middle Eastern languages===

====From Arabic====
The loanwords from Arabic are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with Islam. Allah is the word for God even in Christian Bible translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual Hebrew words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations, this practice has been discontinued. They now turn to Greek names or use the original Hebrew word. For example, the name Jesus was initially translated as &quot;&#x27;Isa&quot;, but is now spelt as &quot;Yesus&quot;.

====From Persian====

Persian is an Indo-European language under the Indo-Iranian branch, wherein Sanskrit and Hindi belongs.
====From Hebrew====

===From East Asian languages===

====From Chinese====
Chinese loanwords into Indonesian often involve cuisine, trade, or Chinese culture. According to the 2000 census, the relative number of people of Chinese descent in Indonesia (termed the &quot;peranakan&quot;) is almost 1% (totaling to about 3 million people, although this may likely be an underestimate due to an anti-Chinese sentiment that exists in some circles of the population), yet the &quot;peranakan&quot; are the most successful when it comes to business, trade, and cuisine. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying Hokkien/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as traditional and simplified characters) include &quot;pisau&quot; (匕首 bǐshǒu – knife), &quot;mie&quot; (T:麵, S:面, Hokkien mī – noodles), &quot;lumpia&quot; (潤餅 (Hokkien = lūn-piáⁿ) – springroll), &quot;teko&quot; (T:茶壺, S:茶壶 = cháhú [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), 苦力 kuli = 苦　khu (bitter) and 力　li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms &quot;gua&quot; and &quot;lu&quot; (from the Hokkien &#x27;goa&#x27; 我 and &#x27;lu/li&#x27; 你 – meaning &#x27;I/ me&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;). Almost all loanwords in Indonesian of Chinese origin come from Hokkien (福建) or Hakka (客家).

====From Japanese==== 
Japanese is an East Asian language spoken by about 126 million people, primarily in Japan, where it is the official language and national language. The influx of Japanese loanword can be classified into two periods, Japanese colonial administration period (1942–1945) and globalisation of Japanese popular culture (1980–now). As Indonesian is written using Latin script, Japanese romanisation systems influence the spelling in Indonesian.

====From Korean====
In contrast with Chinese and Japanese, Korean loanwords are mostly related to Korean culture. These loanword is attributed to increasing popularity of South Korean culture. Since the turn of the 21st century, South Korea has emerged as a major exporter of popular culture and tourism, aspects which have become a significant part of its burgeoning economy. This phenomenon is called Korean Wave.

===From European languages===
The European influence on Indonesian is largely related to European intervention and colonialism. The most significant consequence is the continued use of the Latin alphabet instead of various local scripts.

The Portuguese arrived first in the archipelago and influenced the original Malay language after their conquest of Malacca. Portuguese dominance over trade in the region and control of the spice islands of Moluccas significantly increased Portuguese influence, as did the introduction of Christianity in the region.

However, Dutch has had the most influence on the language, as a result of the Dutch having controlled Indonesia for 300 years after eliminating Portuguese influence in the archipelago. The Dutch language itself was not introduced into the archipelago before 1799, when the Dutch government took over the colony from the already bankrupt VOC (Dutch East India company). Previously, the Malay language had adopted by the VOC due to its trade and diplomatic benefit, which led to large numbers of loanwords being introduced into the language.

English has also exerted a certain influence on the archipelago&#x27;s language, being the third most favored foreign language by the educated in colonial days. More recently, English has played an increasingly large role in the nation&#x27;s official language as a result of globalization.

====From Portuguese====
Alongside Malay, Portuguese was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail east to the &quot;Spice Islands&quot;. Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia.
====From Dutch====
The former colonial power, the Netherlands, left an extensive imprint on Indonesian vocabulary. These Dutch loanwords, as well as other non Italo-Iberian European language loanwords which were introduced via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords possessing clusters of multiple consonants pose difficulties for speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by the insertion of the schwa. For example, Dutch &quot;schroef&quot; → &quot;sekrup&quot; . The months from January (Januari) to December (December) used in Indonesian are also derived from Dutch. Although Dutch loanwords are normally no longer newly developed, there is some sort of derivation using Dutch-loaned suffixes, like &quot;-si&quot; &quot;-tion&quot; ← Dutch &quot;-tie&quot;, &quot;-ase&quot; &quot;-age&quot; ← &quot;-age&quot;, and &quot;-is&quot; &quot;-ic, -ish&quot; ← &quot;-isch&quot;.

It is estimated that 10,000 words in the Indonesian language can be traced back to the Dutch language.

====From English====
Many English words are adopted in Indonesian through globalization, due to this however many Indonesians mistake words that were originally adopted from Dutch with English due to the Germanic traces that exist in the two languages (both are Indo-European Germanic languages from the same branch, the West Germanic).
However, many English words in Indonesian too are borrowed via Malay (such as: &quot;sains&quot; (science), &quot;enjin&quot; (engine), &quot;botol&quot; (bottle), &quot;gaun&quot; (gown), etc.).

====From Greek====

====From Latin====
It is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilizes words that reflect the English usage (as used by its former colonial power, the British), while Indonesian uses a Latinate form reflected in the Dutch usage (e.g. aktiviti (Malaysian) vs. aktivitas (Indonesian), universiti (Malaysian) vs. universitas (Indonesian)).
====From French====
====From North Germanic====
The North Germanic languages make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages, a sub-family of the Indo-European languages, along with the West Germanic languages and the extinct East Germanic languages. The language group is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Nordic languages&quot;, a direct translation of the most common term used among Danish, Swedish, Icelandic and Norwegian scholars and laypeople.

<doc id="488537" wikidata="Q2992635" url="?curid=488537" title="List of battlecruisers of the Royal Navy">
<text>The battlecruiser was the brainchild of Admiral Sir John (&quot;Jacky&quot;) Fisher, the man who had sponsored the construction of the world&#x27;s first &quot;all big gun&quot; warship, . He visualised a new breed of warship with the armament of a battleship, but faster, lighter, and less heavily armoured. The first three battlecruisers, the , were laid down while &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was being built in 1906.

This design philosophy was most successful in action when the battlecruisers could use their speed to run down smaller and weaker ships. The best example is the Battle of the Falkland Islands where and sank the German armoured cruisers and almost without damage to themselves, despite numerous hits by the German ships. They were less successful against heavily armoured ships, as was demonstrated by the loss of &quot;Invincible&quot;, , and during the Battle of Jutland in 1916. All three ships were destroyed by more heavily armoured German battlecruisers, with the British failure to prevent fires or explosions in the gun turrets from reaching the magazines also playing a role in the losses.

Of the battlecruisers built before the First World War, the &quot;Invincible&quot; class and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class all had of armour on their waterline, a top speed of , and eight guns. The more advanced battlecruisers—the two &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships, &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and —all had an armour belt of , speeds over , and eight guns. The &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Courageous&quot; classes, built during the war, were begun when Admiral Fisher was appointed First Sea Lord for the second time in late 1914. Each of these classes in turn served as the fastest capital ships in the world and were heavily armed with four or six guns, but they paid for their speed and armament by having less armour than battleships. was laid down during the war, but was extensively reworked with more armour based on the experience gained at the Battle of Jutland, and was not completed until after the war.

Following the war, the British planned to build the G3 class, which had the same armament and armour as battleships of the time and were rated as battlecruisers only by comparison to the more heavily armoured and slower battleships also planned. They were cancelled as they exceeded the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty. Of the first nine battlecruisers, only HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; survived the Washington Treaty and into the 1930s. The three &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships were converted to aircraft carriers during the 1920s and only &quot;Repulse&quot;, &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; served in the Second World War as battlecruisers. All three went through substantial refits between the wars. &quot;Hood&quot; was lost in the battle of the Denmark Strait, &quot;Repulse&quot; was sunk by Japanese aircraft at the start of the war in the Pacific, and &quot;Renown&quot; survived the war to be scrapped in 1948.

==Key==
==&quot;Invincible&quot; class==

The &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships were the first battlecruisers in the world. The design resembled that of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, but sacrificed armour protection and one gun turret from the main battery for a speed advantage. During the First World War &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; participated in the unsuccessful pursuit of the German ships &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; in the Mediterranean. &quot;Inflexible&quot; was recalled home shortly afterwards, but &quot;Indomitable&quot; remained off the Dardanelles to bottle up the German ships for the rest of 1914 before returning to the UK. &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; were sent to the South Atlantic in late 1914 to hunt down the German East Asia Squadron and destroyed it at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. &quot;Indomitable&quot; participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in the North Sea in early 1915 while &quot;Inflexible&quot; was badly damaged during the opening stages of the Dardanelles Campaign. The ships formed the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron at Jutland where &quot;Invincible&quot; was destroyed by the explosion of an artillery magazine. The two surviving ships spent the rest of the war conducting patrols of the North Sea, as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden by the Kaiser to risk any more losses. They were put into reserve in early 1919 and sold for scrap on 1 December 1921.

==&quot;Indefatigable&quot; class==

The design of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class represented a modest reworking of the preceding s, featuring increased endurance and an improved cross-deck arc of fire for their midships wing turrets achieved by lengthening the hull. Like its predecessor, the design resembled the contemporary dreadnought, but sacrificed armour protection and one turret from the main battery for a 4-knot speed advantage. Originally was the only ship of the class, but and were later built as part of a scheme to improve the defense of the Dominions by having each Dominion purchase a &quot;fleet unit&quot; of one battlecruiser, three light cruisers, and six destroyers. New Zealand agreed to fund one battlecruiser and chose a modified &quot;Indefatigable&quot; design rather than the then being built for the Royal Navy.

They spent most of the war patrolling the North Sea and participated in most of the battles there. 
Of the two, only &quot;New Zealand&quot; was in the United Kingdom when the war began. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was in the Mediterranean, where she unsuccessfully pursued the German warships and as they sailed towards Turkey. &quot;New Zealand&quot; participated in some of the early actions in the North Sea, including the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the inconclusive Scarborough Raid. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; participated in the Battle of Jutland, where the former was destroyed by a magazine explosion after numerous hits from the battlecruiser . &quot;New Zealand&quot; patrolled uneventfully after Jutland, watching for the next appearance of the High Seas Fleet. She conducted Admiral Jellicoe on his tour of India and the Dominions after the war. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was sold for scrap in 1922 to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty.

==&quot;Lion&quot; class==

The &quot;Lion&quot; class, nicknamed the &quot;Splendid Cats&quot;, were a significant improvement over their predecessors of the in speed, armament, and armour. The &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships were faster, exchanged the guns of the older ships for guns, and had a waterline belt thick versus the of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s. These improvements were in response to the German , Germany&#x27;s second class of battlecruisers, which were larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers of the &quot;Invincible&quot; class.

HMS &quot;Lion&quot; served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s battlecruisers throughout the First World War, except when she was being refitted or under repair. She sank the German light cruiser during the Battle of Heligoland Bight and served as Vice Admiral Beatty&#x27;s flagship at the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland. She was so badly damaged at the first of these battles that she had to be towed back to port by and was under repair for more than two months. During the Battle of Jutland she suffered a serious propellant fire that destroyed one gun turret, which had to be removed and rebuilt while the ship was under repair for several months.

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; served in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the war began and then was sent to the Caribbean to prevent the East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands by the two &quot;Invincible&quot;-class battlecruisers, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits, although one directly crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards &quot;Princess Royal&quot; became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock. She was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required a month and a half of repairs. Both ships spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although they did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. In 1920 they were both put into reserve and were sold for scrap a few years later under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==HMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;==

HMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was similar to the &quot;Lion&quot;-class battlecruisers, though she was slightly larger and given more powerful engines to achieve the same speed as the earlier ships. Her secondary guns were better protected and some of her belt armour was redistributed. She was the last battlecruiser completed before the beginning of the war, and she participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight shortly after the war began. As part of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, she unsuccessfully attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914. She was refitting during the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915, but participated in the next major fleet action of the war, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; hit the German battlecruiser early in the battle and burnt out one of that ship&#x27;s rear turrets. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; later knocked out one of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s main guns. The German battlecruiser , in the meantime, had lost sight of her previous target in the haze and switched to &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Within 10 minutes, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was hit twice, exploding shortly afterwards.

==HMS &quot;Tiger&quot;==

HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; was the most heavily armoured battlecruiser of the Royal Navy at the start of the First World War, although she was still being finished when the war began. The ship was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron for the duration of the war and participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915 even though she was still shaking down and did not perform well. She next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 where she was one of the British battlecruisers most often hit by German shells; she was only lightly damaged. She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although she did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight.

&quot;Tiger&quot; was the oldest battlecruiser retained by the Royal Navy after the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty came into effect in 1922. She became a gunnery training ship in 1924 and joined the Battlecruiser Squadron in 1929 while its flagship, , underwent a lengthy refit. Upon &quot;Hood&quot;″s return to service in 1931, &quot;Tiger&quot; was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1932 in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

==&quot;Renown&quot; class==

The &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships were originally laid down as improved versions of the s. Construction was suspended at the outbreak of the war on the grounds they would not be ready in time. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart their construction as battlecruisers that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D&#x27;Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher&#x27;s requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but they were delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916. They were the world&#x27;s fastest capital ships upon completion.

 was the only ship of the class to see combat in the First World War when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. Both ships were reconstructed twice between the wars; their armour protection was increased along with other lesser improvements in the 1920s, while a much more thorough reconstruction was done in the 1930s, especially for . Both ships served during the Second World War; they searched for the in 1939, participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940, and searched for the in 1941. &quot;Repulse&quot; was sunk on 10 December 1941 in the South China Sea off Kuantan, Pahang, by Japanese aircraft.

&quot;Renown&quot; spent much of 1940 and 1941 assigned to Force H at Gibraltar escorting convoys, and she fought in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento. She was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and provided cover to several Arctic convoys in early 1942. The ship was transferred back to Force H for Operation Torch and spent much of 1943 refitting and transporting Winston Churchill and his staff to and from various conferences with Allied leaders. In early 1944 &quot;Renown&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean, where she supported numerous attacks on Japanese-occupied facilities in Indonesia and various island groups in the Indian Ocean. The ship returned to the Home Fleet in early 1945 and was placed in after the end of the war. &quot;Renown&quot; was sold for scrap in 1948.

==&quot;Courageous&quot; class==

The &quot;Courageous&quot; class comprised three battlecruisers, known as &quot;large light cruisers&quot;, that were nominally designed to support Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Fisher&#x27;s Baltic Project, which was intended to land troops on the German Baltic Coast. The ships of this class were fast but very lightly armoured with only a few heavy guns. They were given a shallow draught, in part to allow them to operate in the shallow waters of the Baltic but also reflecting experience gained earlier in the war. To maximize their speed, the &quot;Courageous&quot; class were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers. This made them the fastest capital ships in existence, slightly faster than even the &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships.

The first two ships, and , were commissioned in 1917 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. They participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight and were present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later. Their half-sister was designed with a pair of guns, the largest guns ever fitted on a ship of the Royal Navy, but was modified during construction to take a flying-off deck and hangar in lieu of her forward turret and barbette. After some patrols in the North Sea her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked the Zeppelin sheds during the Tondern raid in July 1918. All three ships were laid up after the end of the war, but were rebuilt as aircraft carriers during the 1920s. &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Courageous&quot; were sunk early in the Second World War and &quot;Furious&quot; was sold for scrap in 1948.

==Admiral class==

The Admiral-class battlecruisers were intended as improved versions of the s, but were recast as battlecruisers after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, saw no real need for more battleships. A number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to the bulk of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s battlecruisers so the design was revised to counter these. The class was going to consist of &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Anson&quot;, &quot;Howe&quot;, and &quot;Rodney&quot;—all names of famous Admirals—but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to begin again with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919.

&quot;Hood&quot;, however, was sufficiently advanced in construction that she was completed in 1920 and immediately became flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In 1923–24 &quot;Hood&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Repulse&quot; and a number of s, sailed around the world from west to east via the Panama Canal. On 23 April 1937, after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, she escorted three British merchantmen into Bilbao harbour despite the presence of the Nationalist cruiser that attempted to blockade the port. &quot;Hood&quot; spent most of the early part of the Second World War patrolling against German commerce raiders and escorting convoys. As flagship of Force H based at Gibraltar, she bombarded French ships during the attack on Mers-el-Kébir. In May 1941 &quot;Hood&quot; and the battleship were ordered to intercept the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser as they attempted to break out into the North Atlantic. In the subsequent Battle of the Denmark Strait &quot;Hood&quot;″s aft magazines exploded, sinking her within five minutes of the start of the battle.

==G3 battlecruiser==
The G3 battlecruisers were planned as a response to naval expansion programmes by the United States and Japan. The four ships of this class would have been larger, faster, and more heavily armed than any existing battleship (although several projected foreign ships would be larger). The &quot;battlecruiser&quot; designation came from their higher speed and lesser firepower and armour relative to the planned N3-class battleship design. The G3s would have carried nine guns and were expected to achieve , while the N3s would carry nine guns on the same displacement at the expense of a slower speed. While officially referred to as &quot;battlecruisers&quot;, the G3s have also been considered &quot;fast battleships&quot;.

The G3 design was approved by the Board of Admiralty on 12 August 1921. Orders were placed in October and November, but were suspended later in November with the beginning of the Washington Naval Conference, which limited battleship numbers. The orders were cancelled in February 1922 with the ratification of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited construction to ships of no more than displacement.

<text>Janica Kostelić (; born 5 January 1982) is a Croatian former alpine ski racer. She is a four-time Olympic gold medalist. In addition to the Olympics, she won five gold medals at the World Championships. In World Cup competition, she won thirty individual races, three overall titles, three slalom titles, and four combined titles. Kostelic&#x27;s accomplishments in professional skiing have led some commentators, writers, and fellow ski racers to regard her as the greatest female ski racer of all time.

==Biography==
Kostelić is the only woman to win four gold medals in alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics (in 2002 and 2006), and the only woman to win three alpine skiing gold medals in one Olympics (2002).

Kostelić was the World Cup overall champion in 2001, 2003 and 2006. On 15 January 2006, Kostelić became the third woman in World Cup history (after Swede Pernilla Wiberg and Austrian Petra Kronberger) to win World Cup races in all of the sport&#x27;s five disciplines. On 5 February 2006 Kostelić became the second female skier (after Petra Kronberger) to win all five disciplines in one season.

In the summer of 2006, she decided to not compete in the 2007 season, due to chronic knee and back pain. She had endured ten knee surgeries and thyroid surgery during her career. Following a year away from competition, Kostelić announced her retirement from racing in April 2007, at just 25 years old.

Since 2016, Kostelić has been the State Secretary for Science, Education and Sports in the Croatian Government.

== Career ==
===Early years===
Born in Zagreb, Croatia, then part of Yugoslavia, into a winter sports family, Kostelić&#x27;s father Ante was also her trainer. Her older brother Ivica is a ski racer in his own right, the 2011 overall World Cup champion. She started skiing at the age of three and began training at nine years old, and quickly became successful and won several junior competitions.

At the age of 16, Kostelić was selected for the Croatian team for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. Her best result was 8th place in the combined. She competed in all five disciplines. She won her first World Cup slalom in December 1999. Kostelić then suffered knee ligament damage which kept her out of competition until late 2000. She won the World Cup overall title that 2001 season with eight further victories.

===2002 Winter Olympics===
At the 2002 Winter Olympics she won three gold medals and a silver, the first Winter Olympic medals ever for an athlete from Croatia. No other female alpine racer has ever won four medals or three gold medals at a single Olympics.

Kostelić chose not to compete in the downhill and concentrated on the combined. She performed well in the downhill run and then won the gold medal after the two-run slalom. She then won a silver medal in the super-G, just behind Daniela Ceccarelli. The next race was the slalom, in which Kostelić won her second gold medal, narrowly beating Laure Péquegnot. Her final victory was in the giant slalom, a substantial 1.32 seconds ahead of silver medalist Anja Pärson.

===Later career===
Kostelić won the World Cup overall title again in 2003, but missed the following season due to knee surgery in October, her fourth in ten months, and thyroid surgery in January 2004. This caused 2004 to be the only year from 1998 to 2006 that she was not recognized as &quot;Croatian Sportswoman of the Year.&quot;

After more than 18 months aways from competition, she returned to World Cup competition at Sölden and finished eighth in the giant slalom in October 2004. At the World Championships in February 2005, she won three gold medals, despite being in ill health. She won the downhill and successfully defended her world titles in slalom and combined.

In the 2006 season, Kostelić won the World Cup overall title for the third time, but also was in Top 5 in all 4 disciplines, including number 1 in slalom. She won her first World Cup races in giant slalom (2), super-G and downhill in 2006.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino she won a gold medal in women&#x27;s alpine combined. That was her fourth Olympic gold medal, making her the most successful female skier in the history of the Olympic Games. This record was set on 18 February 2006, only half an hour after Norway&#x27;s Kjetil André Aamodt, winner of the men&#x27;s super-G, became the first Alpine skier in men&#x27;s competition to win four Olympic gold medals.

She also became the first alpine skier to win the &quot;Sportswoman of the Year&quot; award at the Laureus World Sports Awards in 2006, in part for her accomplishment of winning races in each discipline during the year.

Due to recurring injuries, Kostelić has not competed since the conclusion of the 2006 season. As expected, she announced her retirement a year later on 19 April 2007, citing persistent pain from her injuries.

===World Cup===
She won 3 overall World Cup titles: 2001, 2003 and 2006. In 2005 she was second overall, just three points behind winner Anja Pärson – the smallest difference between 1st and 2nd place in women&#x27;s World Cup history. (In 2011, Maria Riesch beat Lindsey Vonn in the overall world cup by a margin of three points as well.)

Kostelić also won the slalom season title three times, the same years that she won the overall titles. She also would have won the season trophy for the combined discipline four times (2001, 2003, 2005, 2006), but the discipline trophy for the combined was not awarded to women during her career, being added only in 2007.

She won a total of 30 World Cup races, including at least one in every discipline: 20 in slalom, 6 in combined, 2 in giant slalom, 1 in super-G, and 1 in downhill.

<doc id="488550" wikidata="Q612370" url="?curid=488550" title="List of Sony Ericsson products">
<text>The following is a list of products manufactured under the [[Sony Mobile Communications|Sony Ericsson]] brand. Most of the models have been released under multiple names, depending on region of release, currently usually indicated by a letter added to the end of the model number (&#x27;i&#x27; for international, &#x27;a&#x27; for North America, and &#x27;c&#x27; for mainland China), but indicated on some (mostly older) models by a slightly differing model number. Typically, there is one version for the European and US market, and another for the Asian market. However, some models have yet more versions. Most &quot;Walkman&quot; branded models are also released as a non-Walkman version; such as Sony Ericsson W580 and the S500. These versions usually differ only slightly.

== International phones ==
Each phone in boldface indicates that the phone is a smartphone.

S = Status, where P indicates &quot;under production&quot;, D is &quot;discontinued&quot; and U indicates &quot;upcoming&quot; .

=== C series: Cyber-shot (2008, 2009)===


====C902====
The Sony Ericsson C902 was released during the second quarter of 2008. It is a java based feature device running on Sony Ericsson&#x27;s proprietary A200 platform. A special feature was the presence of 8 touch sensitive keys using capacitive technology for the camera mode. The camera technology includes face detection and the music player is similar to the system used on the company&#x27;s &quot;Walkman&quot; series handsets. The phone is the first in Sony Ericsson&#x27;s new &#x27;Cyber-shot&#x27; C-series of phones, designed to be a successor to the popular K800i and the K850. The C902 is featured in the James Bond film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, and has been praised for its user interface design and its build quality. Although the device received favorable reviews, analysts did not expect it to reach the same level of popularity or sales as its predecessor, the K800i, because it was not intended to be a &quot;flagship model.&quot;

=== CK series: Messaging phones (2011) ===

=== F series: Fun phones (2004–2009) ===
=== G series: Generation web phones (2008) ===
====G700====

The Sony Ericsson G700 was announced at the Mobile World Congress (formerly 3GSM congress) February 2008 and is based on the Symbian OS 9.1 UIQ 3.0 platform. The handset has had below average reviews, with a lot of reviewers criticizing the phone for being priced too high as the better equipped G900 is in the same price bracket while others have lamented the fact that Sony Ericsson chose to implement the same technology that had been presented in late 2006 in the P1. A &quot;business edition&quot; also exists for the Sony Ericsson G700, which has no camera.

====G900====
Announced at the 2008 Mobile World Congress (formerly 3GSM congress) in February of that year, G900 is a mid-to-high-end smartphone based on the Symbian 9.1 UIQ 3.0 platform. The phone sports high quality sound, 3G, Wi-Fi, and a clear 5.0-megapixel camera.

=== J series: Junior phones (2004–2010) ===
Some phones are part of Sony Ericsson&#x27;s &quot;Greenheart&quot; range.

=== K series: Camera phones (2004–2008) ===
Some phones have Cyber-shot branding.
=== M series: Messaging phones (2006) ===
=== P series: PDA phones (2002–2007) ===
=== R series: Radio phones (2008) ===
=== S series: Style / slider / swivel phones (2004–2009) ===
=== T series: Tela phones (2002–2009) ===
NOTE: Sony Ericsson may release cell phones in one variants, indicated with a letter after the model number. For example Sony Ericsson t303 released in China was released as Sony Ericsson t303c.
=== V series: Vodafone phones (2004–2007) ===
=== W series: Walkman phones (2005–2011) ===

NOTE: Sony Ericsson may release cell phones in three variants, indicated with a letter after the model number. Example: W200 was released as W200a (for the Americas), W200c (for China) and W200i (rest of the world). The default release letter for most models is &quot;i&quot; which means international.

=== X series: Xperia phones (2008–2011) ===

Some phones are part of Sony Ericsson&#x27;s &quot;Greenheart&quot; range.
=== Z series: Clamshell phones (2003–2008) ===
=== Entertainment Unlimited series: Entertainment phones (2009–2010) ===
The first Entertainment Unlimited phones were announced and launched in 2009, creating a new category where the benefits of audio and images were &quot;combined in smart, good-looking and high-performing devices.&quot; Apart from first-rate audio-visual strength, what these products have in common are differentiating factors in the user interface, borrowing from the wider Sony Group UI-developments. Aino is the first product that connects into the world of the Sony PlayStation remotely via remote media play. Vivaz is the first Sony Ericsson phone supporting high-definition (HD) video capture.
=== Greenheart phones (2009–2011) ===

<text>Dead Heat is a 1988 American buddy cop action zombie comedy film directed by Mark Goldblatt and starring Treat Williams, Joe Piscopo, Darren McGavin, Lindsay Frost and Vincent Price. The film is about an LAPD police officer who is murdered while attempting to arrest zombies who have been reanimated by the head of Dante Laboratories in order to carry out violent armed robberies, and decides to get revenge with the help of his former partner.

==Plot==
Detectives Roger Mortis and Doug Bigelow are called to the scene of a rather violent jewelry store robbery. The robbers take on a squadron of police in a messy shootout, but neither seems affected when they are riddled with bullets. Thanks to the combined, albeit extreme measures of Mortis and Bigelow, they are able to take out the criminals. Narrowly avoiding termination, their captain assigns them to the investigation.

Meanwhile, a coroner friend of Roger&#x27;s, Rebecca informs the detectives that the two bodies they had brought in had previously been to the morgue: not only do they have autopsy scars, but she herself clearly remembers performing the autopsy and has pictures to prove it, suggesting that they simply got up and left the morgue of their own volition.

There is a preservative chemical compound found in the bodies that connect the pair of detectives to a company that had ordered a great amount of it recently. Mortis and Bigelow investigate and meet the company&#x27;s head public relations person, Randi James who gives them a tour of the facility. When Doug wanders off to investigate a suspicious room, he encounters the reanimated corpse of a biker on a strange machine. A fight ensues, Roger comes to aid his partner, and in the fray, he is knocked into a decompression room used to humanely kill failed test animals and is asphyxiated to death when an unknown person activates the room.

Encountering the machine, and realizing it is capable of bringing people back from the dead, Rebecca and Doug successfully bring Roger back from the dead. He says he feels fine, yet he has no heart beat and his skin is cold to the touch, Rebecca surmises he has about twelve hours before the reanimation process ends and he dissolves into a puddle of mush. Roger decides to take this time to find and exact his vengeance on the person who killed him, as well as solve the case he and Doug are working on. They go to Randi&#x27;s house just shortly before she is attacked by two more undead thugs, which the partners are able to subdue. Randi says that she is the daughter of a rich industrialist, and the owner of the company she works for until his death, Arthur P. Laudermilk.

The two of them pay another visit to Rebecca, who says that she might have found a way to keep Roger in healthy condition indefinitely, but the unsure nature of the theory has him decide to spend his final hours finding the man who killed him. Doug splits from Roger, agreeing to meet back at Randi&#x27;s home, while Roger and Randi pay a visit to Laudermilk&#x27;s tomb. Randi admits she&#x27;s not his daughter, more a protégé or daughter he&#x27;d never had. While there, they encounter a numeric code, which Roger discovers later is a vital clue. Upon returning to Randi&#x27;s home, they find Doug dead, having been suspended and drowned in a fish tank for some time. Randi tells Roger that she too is undead, having been one of Laudermilk&#x27;s first test subjects for resurrection, shortly before abruptly dissolving while asking for Roger&#x27;s forgiveness.

Roger confronts the head coroner Dr. Ernest McNab, Rebecca&#x27;s boss, who was linked to the secret numeric code that Roger had found. Roger also has determined that McNab reanimated the robbers to steal for him all while keeping his hands clean, in addition to killing Doug and himself. But McNab turns the tables on Roger, capturing him, then locking him in an ambulance with Rebecca&#x27;s dead body, after killing her, in order to wait out his last hour to dissolution. He releases the brakes on the ambulance and puts it in neutral, sending it careening down the highway into a massive collision, from which he emerges, even more zombified and scarred almost beyond recognition. He returns to the laboratory where McNab and a resurrected Laudermilk are pitching the resurrection machine to a group of very rich clients. Mortis charges in and in the ensuing crossfire between him and McNab&#x27;s men a few of the rich clients are killed, leaving Laudermilk cowering in a corner.

McNab reveals a test subject; Doug, resurrected by the machine. But because he&#x27;s been dead for hours, the brain deterioration leaves him little more than an obedient zombie with no memory of who Roger is. Before he can obey McNab&#x27;s orders to kill Mortis, however, Roger manages to trigger Doug&#x27;s short-term memory and bring him back to normal. The pair go after McNab who immediately kills himself before they can do anything. Roger and Doug put McNab onto the resurrection table and resurrect him. But to exact revenge, Roger starts the resurrection process again and it overloads, causing a screaming McNab to explode in the machine. Despite Laudermilk&#x27;s pleas and promises of eternal life, the pair then destroy the machine completely, leaving the room pondering about the afterlife and reincarnation; Doug&#x27;s fond wish of being reincarnated as a girl&#x27;s bicycle seat intriguing the both of them. The film ends with Roger stating, &quot;This could be the end of a beautiful friendship.&quot;

<doc id="488563" wikidata="Q183283" url="?curid=488563" title="Ashura">
<text>Ashura (, , ) is a day of commemoration in Islam. It occurs annually on the tenth of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. For Sunni Muslims, Ashura marks the parting of the Red Sea by Moses and the salvation of the Israelites. Also on this day, Nuh disembarked from the Ark, God forgave Adam, and Joseph was released from prison, among various other auspicious events having occurred on Ashura according to Sunni tradition. Ashura is celebrated in Sunni Islam through supererogatory fasting and other acceptable expressions of joy. In some Sunni communities, the annual Ashura festivities include carnivals, bonfires, and special dishes, even though some Sunni scholars have criticized such practices. 

By contrast, for Shia Muslims, Ashura is a day of mourning as they annually commemorate the death of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the third Shia imam. Husayn refused on moral grounds to pledge his allegiance to the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya () and was subsequently killed, alongside most of his male relatives and his small retinue, by the Umayyad army in the Battle of Karbala on Ashura 61 AH (680 CE). Among the Shia, mourning for Husayn is viewed as an act of protest against oppression, a struggle for God, and a means of securing the intercession of Husayn in the afterlife. Ashura is observed through mourning gatherings, processions, and dramatic reenactments. In such ceremonies, Shia mourners strike their chests to share in the pain of Husayn. Extreme self-flagellation, often involving self-inflicted bloodshed, remains controversial among the Shia, condemned by many Shia clerics, and outlawed in some Shia communities. Ashura has sometimes been an occasion for sectarian violence, particularly against the Shia minority.

==Etymology==
 is an Aramaic word meaning &#x27;tenth&#x27;. It may have also been derived from the Syriac words or . It shares the same root as the Hebrew word &quot;&#x27;āsōr&quot;. In Arabic, Ashura refers to the tenth day of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, a month in which fighting has been forbidden since before the advent of Islam.

== Likely origins ==
Fasting on Ashura was likely a Jewish practice adopted by the Islamic prophet Muhammad after his arrival in the city of Medina in 622 CE, perhaps signifying Muhammad&#x27;s sense of a shared prophetic mission with Moses. Although it remained optional, fasting on Ashura ceased to be a religious obligation after about a year when the relations with the Medinan Jews deteriorated. This transition is often associated with verses 2:183–5 of the Quran, the central religious text in Islam, which explicitly designate Ramadan as the month of fasting. It also seems improbable that Ashura initially coincided with the tenth of Muharram. Instead, Ashura was probably observed at first on the tenth of the first Jewish month of Tishrei, known as Yom Kippur (). The association of Ashura with the tenth of Muharram thus happened later, some time after the Jewish and Muslim calendars diverged. In turn, the calendars began to diverge when Muhammad forbade Jewish-type calendar adjustments in connection with verse 9:37 of the Quran.

== In Sunni Islam ==
A similar origin story for Ashura appears in some Sunni traditions. Alternatively, there are traditions in canonical Sunni collections that describe fasting on Ashura as a pre-Islamic practice among the Quraysh tribe, in which Muhammad also partook while he was in Mecca. Some early Sunni traditions, many classified as unreliable, possibly invented by the Umayyads (), link Ashura to various auspicious events: On this day, Moses parted the Red Sea, Noah disembarked from the Ark, God forgave Adam, Joseph was released from prison, Jesus, Abraham, and Adam were born, Muhammad was conceived, and Jonah was freed from the fish that had swallowed him. Fasting on the ninth of Muharram, known as Tasu&#x27;a, was a later addition, probably to distinguish Muslims from Jews.

=== Customs ===

In Sunni Islam, ninth and tenth of Muharram are days for voluntary fasting, strongly encouraged by Sunni jurists. While not endorsed by all Sunni scholars, Ashura is further viewed as a day of thanksgiving () to God, a joyous occasion, celebrated through pious acts and acceptable expressions of delight. Ashura is thus an important festival for many Sunnis, in contrast to the Shia, who mourn on this day the slaughter of Muhammad&#x27;s grandson, Husayn ibn Ali, and his small retinue in the Battle of Karbala in 680. Such Sunni festivities either developed in response to Shia customs on Ashura or with the influence of pre-Islamic traditions. In line with the former view, under the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (), Ashura was celebrated as a festive public holiday to counter the commemoration of Husayn. The Abbasid caliph al-Qadir () did so too in Baghdad, Iraq. Another instance is the reenactment by a Sunni mob of the Battle of the Camel (656) against Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first Shia imam, in the Buyid-era Baghdad on Ashura 973.

Whatever the case is for their origins, such festivities were firmly established by the time of the Sunni jurist Ibn Taymiyya (), to whom a questioner wrote, observing that people are joyful on Ashura; they bathe, adorn themselves, shake hands with each other, and cook grains. In the Maghreb, for instance, Ashura is celebrated today through fasting, almsgiving, honoring the dead, special dishes, jumping over bonfires, and carnivals. Nevertheless, particularly in South Asia, some Sunnis participated in the Shia rituals on Ashura, at least until modern times. Sufis also commonly commemorated the death of Husayn, more so in the earlier times, despite its variance with the views of the Sunni elite. For Sufis, rather than a tragedy, Ashura celebrates the eternal life of Husayn and his companions, who annihilated themselves in the Divine with their martyrdom. 

=== Ibn Taymiyya ===
In response to an inquiry about their legal basis, Ibn Taymiyya rejects both mourning and celebrating on Ashura because, he contends, neither was practiced by Muhammad. Ibn Taymiyya does, however, encourage fasting on Ashura to emulate Muhammad. The Islamicist M. Katz questions the judgment of Ibn Taymiyya for not taking into account the Sunni reports that Muhammad fasted to celebrate Ashura, suggesting that Ibn Taymiyya has stripped fasting of its higher meaning.

== In Shia Islam ==
=== Battle of Karbala ===

In Shia Islam, Ashura commemorates the death of Husayn ibn Ali, Muhammad&#x27;s grandson and the third Shia imam. Husayn was killed, alongside most of his male relatives and his small retinue, on 10 Muharram 61 AH (10 October 680) in the Battle of Karbala against the army of the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya (), having been surrounded for some days and deprived of the drinking water of the nearby Euphrates river. After the battle, the women and children in Husayn&#x27;s camp were taken prisoner and marched to the capital Damascus in Syria. The battle followed failed negotiations and Husayn&#x27;s refusal to pledge his allegiance to Yazid, who is often portrayed by Muslim historians as impious and immoral. The fight took place in the desert land of Karbala, en route to the nearby Kufa, whose residents had invited Husayn to lead them against Yazid.

=== Significance ===
Ashura is a day of mourning and grief for Shia Muslims. It was observed as such by their imams, who also frequently encouraged the Shia community to follow suit. For instance, a tradition attributed to the Shia imam Ali al-Rida () describes Ashura as a day of grieving and somber resignation from material affairs. Shia tradition also dismisses as fabricated those Sunni hadiths that mark Ashura as a joyful occasion. Indeed, traditions attributed to the Shia imams forbid fasting on this day, and promise eternal punishment for those who celebrate Ashura as a day of blessing.

In Shia Islam, Karbala symbolizes the eternal struggle between good and evil, the pinnacle of self-sacrifice, and the ultimate sabotage of Muhammad&#x27;s prophetic mission. Historically, the event served to crystallize the Shia community into a distinct sect and remains an integral part of their religious identity to date. On the one hand, mourners share in the pain of Husayn and hope to benefit from his intercession on the Day of Judgement. On the other, they view mourning for Husayn as an act of protest against oppression, a struggle for God (), and as such an act of worship. 

=== Rituals ===

In addition to pilgrimage to the shrine of Husayn, located in Karbala, Iraq, Shia Muslims annually commemorate the events of Karbala throughout the months of Muharram and Safar. Most rituals take place during the first ten days of Muharram, culminating on Ashura with processions in major Shia cities. The main component of ritual ceremonies (, ) is the narration of the stories of Karbala (, ), and the recitation of elegies and dirges (, , ), all intended to raise the sympathy of audience and move them to tears. A often takes place in a dedicated building or structure, known variously as , , , or . Another component of mourning gatherings is the self-flagellation of participants to the rhythm of Karbala elegies. Rooted in ancient Arab practices, mild forms of self-flagellation, that is, striking one&#x27;s face and chest in grief (, , ), are common today in Shia communities. But there are also extreme forms of self-flagellation (, , ), in which the participants strike themselves, usually on the forehead or back, with knives, swords, or chains to which razor blades are attached. Banned in Iran and the Shia communities of Lebanon since the mid-90s, instrumental self-flagellation has been condemned by many Shia clerics, and it remains an often controversial practice among the Shia.

Another mourning ritual is the dramatic reenactment of Karbala narratives (, ), practiced today in Iran, in the western Gulf shore, and in Lebanon. On Ashura, always the &quot;martyrdom of Husayn&quot; is reenacted in such performances. In Karbala, an annual performance on Ashura reenacts the burning of Husayn&#x27;s tents after the battle by the Umayyads and the captivity of the women and children. During Muharram, especially on Ashura, processions of mourners (, ) march the streets, chanting dirges and elegies, sometimes accompanied by self-flagellation. For instance, in the march in Karbala, male and then female mourners walk barefoot to the shrine of Husayn in the afternoon of Ashura. Depending on the region, processions carry symbolic objects, such as (), (), , and &quot;tadjah.&quot; represents the ensign of Husayn in Karbala, while the last three objects symbolize his bier or tomb.

==Terrorist attacks during Ashura==
Ashura has sometimes been an occasion for Sunni violence against Shia Muslims, who are often a minority in Muslim communities. In India, for instance, the Sunni activist Ahmad Barelvi () preached against Ashura rituals and, probably with some exaggeration, boasted of destroying thousands of imambargahs, which are buildings dedicated to ritual mourning. Some terrorist attacks against Ashura services are listed below.
* 1940: Bomb thrown at an Ashura procession, Delhi, India, 21 February.
* 1994: Bomb explosion in the Imam Reza shrine, Mashhad, Iran, 20 June, 20 people killed.
* 2004: Bomb explosions, Karbala and Najaf, Iraq, 2 March, over 180 Shia worshipers killed and 5000 injured.
* 2008: Two separate attacks on Ashura processions, Iraq, 19 January, 9 people killed.

<doc id="488568" wikidata="Q7191338" url="?curid=488568" title="Pie floater">
<text>The pie floater is an Australian dish sold in Adelaide. It consists of a meat pie in a thick pea soup, typically with the addition of tomato sauce. Believed to have been first created in the 1890s, the pie floater gained popularity as a meal sold by South Australian pie carts. In 2003, it was recognised as a South Australian Heritage Icon.

== Development ==
Pea soup with meat has long been part of English culinary history, with mentions in the 19th century, including the &quot;pea and pie supper&quot; (in Yorkshire), &quot;pea soup with eel&quot;, and suet dumplings or saveloys. (Dumplings in soup were known as &quot;floaters&quot;.) It may have developed from those dishes, which are useful for feeding groups of people on a budget, such as at a sports match or at harvest time. 
A pie floater commonly consists of a traditional Australian-style meat pie, usually sitting, but sometimes submerged (traditionally upside down) in a bowl of thick pea soup made from blue boiler peas. It is often self-garnished with tomato sauce, and the consumer may also add a combination of mint sauce, salt, pepper, or malt vinegar according to personal preference.

South Australian records credit the pie floater&#x27;s popularity in the 1890s to one Ern &quot;Shorty&quot; Bradley of Port Pirie; Bradley&#x27;s old employer Jim Gibbs of Adelaide is another candidate.

==Pie carts==
Pie floaters were typically purchased in the street from pie-carts as a late evening meal. Pie-carts are typically a form of caravan/trailer/cart, originally horse-drawn, with an elongated &quot;window&quot; along one or both sides where customers could sit or (more usually) stand to eat their purchases. The pie-cart was typically moved into position at lunchtime and in the evening. As traffic became busier and on-street car-parking in demand, the carts evolved to have one window on the &quot;footpath side&quot;, and were moved into position after afternoon peak-hour traffic had ebbed. They did business until late evening or early morning, after which they were returned to their daytime storage locations.

South Australia has had pie carts in the Adelaide metropolitan area since the 1870s. In the evenings, the Norwood pie-cart was located on The Parade adjacent to the Norwood Town Hall. It was also the only place where members of the public could buy draught Hall&#x27;s &quot;Stonie&quot; ginger beer direct from the keg. In the Adelaide city centre in the 1880s, there were 13 pie-carts operating in King William Street and North Terrace. By 1915 there were nine pie-carts in operation. By 1958 this had reduced to two: Balfour&#x27;s pie-cart on North Terrace outside the Adelaide railway station, and Cowley&#x27;s in Victoria Square outside the Adelaide General Post Office. In 2007, the Glenelg tram line was extended from Victoria Square along King William Street and North Terrace past Adelaide railway station, and the Balfour&#x27;s pie-cart was forced to close.

In 2003, the South Australian National Trust traced the history of the pie floater back over 130 years. The pie floater was recognised as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia, although it is now available at very few locations; among them are the Café de Vilis, Enjoy Bakery on Norwood Parade, O&#x27;Connell Street Bakery, North Adelaide and the Upper Sturt General Store.

<text>Simics is a full-system simulator or virtual platform used to run unchanged production binaries of the target hardware. Simics was originally developed by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS), and then spun off to Virtutech for commercial development in 1998. Virtutech was acquired by Intel in 2010. Currently, Simics is provided by Intel in a public release and sold commercially by Wind River Systems, which was in the past a subsidiary of Intel.

Simics contains both instruction set simulators and hardware models, and is or has been used to simulate systems such as Alpha, ARM (32- and 64-bit), IA-64, MIPS (32- and 64-bit), MSP430, PowerPC (32- and 64-bit), RISC-V (32- and 64-bit), SPARC-V8 and V9, and x86 and x86-64 CPUs. 

Many different operating systems have been run on various simulated virtual platforms, including Linux, MS-DOS, Windows, VxWorks, OSE, Solaris, FreeBSD, QNX, RTEMS, UEFI, and Zephyr. 

The NetBSD AMD64 port was initially developed using Simics before the public release of the chip. The purpose of simulation in Simics is often to develop software for a particular type of hardware without requiring access to that precise hardware, using Simics as a virtual platform. This can applied both to pre-release and pre-silicon software development for future hardware, as well as for existing hardware. Intel uses Simics to provide its ecosystem with access to future platform months or years ahead of the hardware launch.

The current version of Simics is 6 which was released publicly in 2019. Simics runs on 64-bit x86-64 machines running Microsoft Windows and Linux (32-bit support was dropped with the release of Simics 5, since 64-bit provides significant performance advantages and is universally available on current hardware). The previous version, Simics 5, was released in 2015.

Simics has the ability to execute a system in forward and reverse direction. Reverse debugging can illuminate how an exceptional condition or bug occurred. When executing an OS such as Linux in reverse using Simics, previously deleted files reappear when the deletion point is passed in reverse and scrolling and other graphical display and console updates occur backwards as well.

Simics is built for high performance execution of full-system models, and uses both binary translation and hardware-assisted virtualization to increase simulation speed. It is natively multithreaded and can simulate multiple target (or guest) processors and boards using multiple host threads. It has been used to run simulations containing hundreds of target processors.

<text>The Sony Ericsson P900 is a Symbian OS v7.0 based smartphone from Sony Ericsson.

It was introduced in 2003 and is the successor of the Sony Ericsson P800; like the P800, the P900 uses the UIQ platform.

Like other Symbian-based mobile phone of its time, but unlike Ericsson R380, the P900 is an open phone. This means that it is possible to develop and install third party applications without restrictions. A UIQ 2.1 SDK based upon Symbian C++ is freely available from the Sony Ericsson developer website. Additionally, the P900 supports applications written in Java. Because of this openness, many third-party applications exist that can be used on the P900 and other UIQ phones (such as the Motorola A1000 and BenQ P30). Many are shareware and freeware.

As the P900 uses UIQ version 2.1, it is backwards compatible with UIQ 2.0 as found in the P800. Applications made for the P800 will normally work on a P900 as well. It, like the P800 and P910i, has an ARM9 processor clocked at 156 MHz.

The P900 can be used without the flip as well. This makes the phone more like a PDA, but still usable as a traditional phone. The P900 supports Memory Stick Duo cards (but not Memory Stick Pro Duo) up to 128 MB in size, as does the P800. However, it has been confirmed that this 128 MB limit is just a software restriction.

The P900 was well received and is sometimes considered one of the best Symbian OS devices to have been released.

An updated version of the P900, the Sony Ericsson P910 was released in July 2004. It features a small QWERTY keyboard and enhanced software, as well as double the P900&#x27;s memory (64 MB, versus the P900&#x27;s 32 MB) and supports Memory Stick Pro Duo, allowing the phone up to 4 GB of storage on a single card. The P910 has approximately the same battery life as its predecessor.

The P900 is the first Sony Ericsson product for which Research in Motion&#x27;s BlackBerry wireless email service will be available.

Some of the specifications of the P900 are:
# Weight – 150 g (with flip), 140 g (without flip)
# Internal camera: VGA (display resolution up to 640 × 480 pixels)
# Connectivity: Bluetooth, Infrared, USB dock
# GPRS (WAP 2.0)
# Messaging: SMS, EMS, MMS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP

== &#x27;P905&#x27; ==
P905 is the unofficial term for a Sony Ericsson P900 flashed with hacked Sony Ericsson P910a firmware. The P900 is flashed using a &#x27;Fighter Kit&#x27;. This is usually done for four reasons:
# The P900 has a software restriction on the size of the memory card that can be used (128 MB).
# The P900 software does not support HTML email.
# The P900 software does not provide an option to alter the screen brightness.
# Flashing the firmware is cheaper than purchasing a new P910.

Though this may seem all beneficial, there may be the drawback of not being able to connect to certain Bluetooth headsets (however, this is rare).

Though the P905 may be identical to the P910 in software terms they are not identical in hardware terms.

<text>Alexander Grant MacKay (March 7, 1860 – April 25, 1920) was a Canadian teacher, lawyer and provincial level politician. He served prominent posts in two provincial legislatures as Leader of the Opposition in Ontario and as a Cabinet Minister in Alberta.

==Early life==
Alexander Grant MacKay was born in Sydenham, Canada West, in Grey County on March 7, 1860, to parents Hugh MacKay and Katherine McInnis.

He attended post secondary studies at the Owen Sound College and the University of Toronto obtaining a Master of Business degree. After university he became the principal of Port Rowan High School. In 1891 he joined the Ontario bar and served as a criminal lawyer until 1894, when he became Crown Attorney for Grey County. He served that role until 1912.

MacKay began his political career on the municipal level with his election to the Owen Sound Board of Education in 1894. He served in that role until he entered Ontario provincial politics in 1902.

==Ontario politics==
MacKay ran and was elected to the Ontario legislature in 1902 in the riding of Grey North. He was re-elected in 1905, 1908 and 1911. He served in the government of Premier Ross as Commissioner of Crown Lands until the government&#x27;s defeat in 1905. On September 7, 1907 MacKay was elected leader of the Ontario Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition and held that position until he resigned in September 1911. MacKay moved to Alberta in the spring of 1912, he was accused by the Toronto press of leaving Ontario because he was unable to get along with new Liberal opposition leader Newton Rowell. MacKay officially resigned his seat in the Ontario Legislature when he ran in the 1913 Alberta general election on April 12, 1913.

==Alberta politics==

MacKay ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for the first time in the 1913 Alberta general election resigning his Ontario Legislature seat as soon as the writ was dropped. MacKay ran in the Edmonton electoral district and was defeated finishing a very close 3rd place in the block vote. After his defeat he then ran as the candidate in the deferred Athabasca election on July 30, 1913. In his second attempt at office he defeated Conservative candidate Mayor of Athabasca James Wood by a comfortable margin to win his first term in office. MacKay spent his first term in the Legislature as a back bencher for the government.

MacKay stood for re-election in the 1917 Alberta general election. This time he was returned to his second term in a landslide victory over Conservative candidate A.F. Fugl.

MacKay was appointed to the provincial cabinet on August 26, 1918. He assumed the portfolio of Minister of Municipal Affairs from Wilfrid Gariépy. He was confirmed to his portfolio in a ministerial by-election on September 27, 1918, which he won by acclamation. MacKay was given a second portfolio on June 19, 1919, when he was appointed as Alberta&#x27;s first Minister of Health. He served both portfolios until he died of pneumonia (arising from the Spanish flu) in the Edmonton General Hospital April 25, 1920.

<doc id="488581" wikidata="Q3489077" url="?curid=488581" title="Dave Lister">
<text>David Lister, commonly referred to simply as Lister, is a fictional character from the British science fiction situation comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, portrayed by Craig Charles.

Lister is characterised as a third-class technician (the lowest ranking crewman) on the mining ship &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; spending his time performing tasks under the hated supervision of Arnold Rimmer. In the series, he becomes marooned three million years into the future, but maintains a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm on Fiji and open a hot dog and doughnut diner, preferably with the one true love of his life, Kristine Kochanski, a navigation officer of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. As a character, Lister is lazy, slobbish, and unmotivated, but he frequently shows moral courage. He also likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring theme in the series.

== Fictional history ==

=== Television ===

==== 1980s ====
Lister first appeared in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s first episode &quot;The End&quot; (1988), where he is characterised as third technician on board the mining ship &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, ranking below his immediate superior Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), with whom he shares quarters, and all four of the service robots as the lowest ranked crew member on board the ship. As a technician, Lister helps Rimmer with maintenance work on chicken soup vending machines that not even the robots are assigned to. Lister is shown having smuggled an unquarantined pregnant cat from the moon Titan on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; as part of his five-year plan to buy a farm on Fiji to bring along the cat, the cat&#x27;s unborn kittens, and to get a sheep and a cow and breed horses. As punishment for bringing the cat on board, he is put into stasis for 18 months without pay.

Lister mentions that crewmember Kristine Kochanski (C P Grogan) was going to come with him to Fiji, but never told her before her death. The ship&#x27;s computer Holly (Norman Lovett) tells Lister that while Lister was in stasis, a release of lethal radiation occurred on board as a result of a faulty repair carried out by Rimmer, killing the entire crew. As a result, Holly keeps Lister in stasis for three million years until the radiation levels return to normal. Lister is left as presumably the last human being in the universe, accompanied on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; by a hologram simulation of Rimmer and a humanoid creature called &quot;the Cat&quot; (Danny John-Jules) that evolved from his cat, who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens when the crew died. Lister tells Holly to set co-ordinates for Fiji, which has become the &quot;promised land&quot; in the religion of the Cat&#x27;s people.

Lister&#x27;s backstory in &quot;Future Echoes&quot; (1988) reveals that Lister&#x27;s &quot;grandmother&quot; raised Lister, and headbutted the headmaster of Lister&#x27;s school when Lister came bottom in French, leading to Lister&#x27;s expulsion. Also in this episode, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is shown travelling faster-than-light, and this causes glimpses of the future, &quot;future echoes&quot;, to appear to the crew. Rimmer sees what he believes to be Lister being killed in the drive room. After trying to change another future echo involving the Cat and ending up causing it instead, Lister accepts his fate when Holly asks for help to stop the navi-comp from overheating. Lister survives, and a future echo of Lister aged 171—who cannot see the younger Lister and Rimmer but remembers the conversation he had when he was Lister&#x27;s age—explains that it wasn&#x27;t Lister that Rimmer saw die, but Lister&#x27;s second son, Bexley, who appeared in a photograph with his twin brother Jim as a child in another future echo. Lister realises that this means he is going to have two sons in the future. The elderly Lister from the future tells the present Lister to quickly take his camera to the medical unit. As &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; begins to slow down, Lister sees a future echo of himself from nearer to the present who is holding baby Jim and Bexley, and the present Lister takes the photograph of the Lister holding the babies, which had previously been seen on the bunkroom wall in a future echo.

In &quot;Balance of Power&quot; (1988), Lister is revealed to have pined after Kochanski; Lister mentioning that he had always been crazy about Kochanski but never acted on his feelings to ask her out or make love to her. Lister asks Holly why Rimmer was brought back as a hologram instead of Kochanski. Holly explains that this is because Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane, and that the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, compared to the 173 words Lister shared with Kochanski. Lister asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Kochanski&#x27;s hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with Kochanski, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Rimmer&#x27;s hologram wouldn&#x27;t be turned on again.

In &quot;Waiting for God&quot; (1988), Holly reads out the captain&#x27;s confidential files on Lister, explaining that Lister&#x27;s previous job before joining &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was a supermarket trolley attendant, which he left because &quot;he didn&#x27;t want to get tied down to a career&quot;. After translating a holy book written by the Cat&#x27;s people, Holly confirms that Lister is considered a god in the Cat&#x27;s people&#x27;s religion called Cloister, and that his plan of buying a farm on Fiji and opening up a hot dog and doughnut diner has become their idea of Heaven.

In &quot;Confidence and Paranoia&quot; (1988), Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister&#x27;s confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski&#x27;s personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski&#x27;s box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.

In &quot;Me²&quot; (1988), Rimmer moves in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. After the two Rimmers&#x27; constant arguing, Lister decides to have one of them wiped to stop this. Knowing that Rimmer would never tell Lister otherwise, Lister tricks Rimmer into revealing Rimmer&#x27;s &quot;gazpacho soup&quot; story while Rimmer&#x27;s double is wiped instead; Rimmer believing that &quot;he&quot; was the one that was doomed.

According to Lister&#x27;s backstory in &quot;Kryten&quot; (1988), Lister applied to art college after having failed his exams. He dropped out after 97 minutes however, after learning that there were lectures every day, &quot;first thing in the afternoon&quot;. In this episode, the crew of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; rescue a service mechanoid called Kryten (David Ross) from the crash landed spaceship the &quot;Nova 5&quot;. After Kryten begins serving Rimmer, Lister persuades Kryten to rebel against Rimmer (which includes showing him the movies &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot;) and to become independent. Kryten changes the portrait of Rimmer he is painting to make it appear as though he was sitting on the toilet, and then pours soup onto Rimmer&#x27;s bed sheets. Kryten takes Lister&#x27;s space-bike and goes out to find a planet with an atmosphere where he can grow a garden, which had always been a dream of his.

Backstory in &quot;Better Than Life&quot; (1988) reveals that Lister&#x27;s &quot;dad&quot; died when he was six. Lister&#x27;s grandmother, while trying to explain to Lister that his dad wouldn&#x27;t be coming back, said that Lister&#x27;s dad had gone to the same place as Lister&#x27;s goldfish. Lister thought she meant he was flushed down the toilet. Lister was eventually sent to a child psychologist after he was found with his head in the toilet bowl reading his father the football results.

In &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; (1988), when Rimmer had eight months of Lister&#x27;s memory pasted over his own as a present to celebrate the anniversary of Rimmer&#x27;s death, Lister recounts to Rimmer that Lister had gone out with a girl named Lise Yates (Sabra Williams), but the relationship ended because he did not want to be tied down, a fact that Lister later regretted. Rimmer also realises the memories he was given couldn&#x27;t have actually happened because Rimmer remembers being an orphan even though both his parents were alive, meaning that at some point Lister himself had become an orphan.

In a possible future seen in the episode &quot;Stasis Leak&quot; (1988), Lister finds out that his future self from five years hence has gone back in time and married Kochanski three weeks before the accident which causes &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to leave the Solar System; their wedding and honeymoon taking place while Kochanski is on planet leave at the Ganymede Holiday Inn. This version of Lister&#x27;s future has still yet to be portrayed outside of &quot;Stasis Leak&quot; as of Series X.

&quot;Parallel Universe&quot; (1988) shows Holly&#x27;s &quot;Holly Hop Drive&quot; trying to get to Earth within a few seconds. Instead, however, it lands the crew in a female-oriented parallel universe with another version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;; its crew including a female version of Lister called Deb Lister (played by Angela Bruce). Because of the laws of the female Lister&#x27;s universe being different, Lister falls pregnant with his alternate self&#x27;s child after a drunken sexual liaison with her.

At the start of &quot;Backwards&quot; (1989), some quickly scrolling text describes Lister&#x27;s pregnancy leading to successful delivery of twin boys, Jim and Bexley. Because the twins were conceived in another universe where different laws apply, they reach eighteen years of age in three days. To save their lives, Lister returns them to their universe for their father (the female Lister) to raise them. Kryten is described as being found in pieces after his space-bike crashed on an asteroid shortly after these events. Lister rebuilds Kryten (now played by Robert Llewellyn), although he is unable to recapture his former personality.

According to backstory in &quot;Marooned&quot; (1989), Lister lost his virginity to Michelle Fisher at the age of twelve in one of the bunkers on the ninth hole of Bootle Municipal Golf Course.

In &quot;Timeslides&quot; (1989), Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid, and tells his seventeen-year-old self (played by Emile Charles), who at this point is a singer-songwriter in a band called Smeg and the Heads, how to gain a successful multi-billion-pound business empire with fifty-eight houses by inventing the &quot;tension sheet&quot; so that he won&#x27;t join the Space Corps and get trapped on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in deep space. By becoming the inventor of the tension sheet and never joining the Space Corps, Lister&#x27;s entire timeline is altered, causing Kryten to never be rescued and the Cat race to no longer exist. Lister is also seen living with the model and novelist Sabrina Mulholland-Jjones (Koo Stark), and according to Holly (now played by Hattie Hayridge), in this new timeline, Lister dies aged 98 after he crashes a plane he had lost control of while making love to his fourteenth wife. Rimmer unwittingly changes the timelines to set things exactly how they were, and Lister, the Cat and Kryten return to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

Despite having previously mentioned his father and grandmother, backstory in &quot;The Last Day&quot; (1989) reveals that Lister never knew who his parents were because he was abandoned at the age of six weeks in a cardboard box underneath a pool table in a pub, with Lister never finding out why.

==== 1990s ====
Lister&#x27;s previously established history with Kochanski where he barely interacted with her is retconned in &quot;DNA&quot; (1991), when Lister mentions Kochanski having &quot;finished with [him]&quot; back before the accident that killed her. Following this break up, he recalls going for a walk in the botanical gardens and looking at a squirrel, thinking, &quot;You lucky little sod. You like your job, you&#x27;re your own boss and you&#x27;ve got no woman trouble, so you&#x27;ll never feel as bad as I feel now.&quot; This affected Lister enough for him to tell the crew of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; that for a split second, he would have given anything to swap places with the squirrel.

In &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; (1991), an alternate Lister from another dimension, nicknamed &quot;Spanners&quot;, is seen (also played by Charles). Lister explains that, after being told about Spanners by the Rimmer of that dimension—a successful test pilot called &quot;Ace&quot;—Spanners is a flight engineer in the Space Corps who is married to Kochanski with twin boys, Jim and Bexley, and, unlike Rimmer, Lister is pleased to learn of his success in a parallel universe.

In &quot;The Inquisitor&quot; (1992), Lister is put on trial by the legendary android known as the Inquisitor (John Docherty) to determine whether or not his existence is justified or a waste. After Lister is found unworthy of existence, the memory of Lister is erased, and the Inquisitor replaces Lister&#x27;s life with that of an alternative Lister who never got a chance at life. This &quot;Second Lister&quot;, played by Jake Abraham, is described by Kryten as &quot;one of the many David Listers who never got a chance to exist&quot;, while Lister believes them to be &quot;kind of sperms-in-law&quot;. This alternative Lister is killed by the Inquisitor, while Lister subsequently tricks the Inquisitor into erasing himself from existence, causing the memory of Lister to be restored.

In &quot;Demons &amp; Angels&quot; (1992), &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, complete with their own versions of Lister (both played by Charles). Before the lifespans of both versions of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;s, and restore the original &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The &quot;high&quot; version of Lister is stabbed to death when Lister&#x27;s &quot;low&quot; self controls Lister into doing this by remote control, while the &quot;low&quot; version is shot down by bazookoid fire from the Cat.

In &quot;Back to Reality&quot; (1992), ink from a &quot;despair squid&quot; causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider &quot;quintessential to [their] self-esteem&quot;. In the hallucination, Lister believes he is Colonel Sebastian Doyle, a totalitarian fascist mass murderer who is section chief at &quot;CGI&quot; and head of the Ministry of Alteration, where he &quot;change[s] people...from being alive people to being dead people&quot;. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second.

&quot;Psirens&quot; (1993) further contradicts the early series&#x27; depiction of Lister having never asked Kochanski out. In the episode, while rejogging Lister&#x27;s memory following Lister awakening from two hundred years of deep sleep, Kryten explicitly explains to Lister that Kochanski dated Lister for three weeks before &quot;discard[ing]&quot; him for a catering officer. In the episode, Kryten explains that &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was &quot;stolen&quot;, with the crew now based inside the shuttlecraft &quot;Starbug&quot; chasing after &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to recover it.

In &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; has been lost. In the episode, a &quot;Starbug&quot; from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten&#x27;s future selves intending to copy some components from the present &quot;Starbug&quot;″s time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring. The Lister from the future has also been damaged in an accident, having become nothing more than a brain in a jar. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future &quot;Starbug&quot; fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing &quot;Starbug&quot; up.

In the following episode, &quot;Tikka to Ride&quot; (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future &quot;Starbug&quot; destroying the &quot;Starbug&quot; of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of &quot;Starbug&quot; in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered.

In &quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot; (1997), Lister pretends to be a hostile knight who escaped from &quot;Starbug&quot;″s artificial reality suite in order to prove Rimmer is heroic enough to take over as the new Ace Rimmer and leave &quot;Starbug&quot; for other dimensions to &quot;right wrongs&quot;. Rimmer fires blank rounds at Lister, and Lister pretends to die, with Rimmer not realising this deception.

In &quot;Blue (Red Dwarf)&quot; (1997), Lister finds himself missing Rimmer&#x27;s company after the hologram goes off on adventures with Ace Rimmer, but is alternately confused and horrified at the thought that he might have feelings for him, and after seeing Rimmer&#x27;s ego-trip of a ride, declares their friendship officially over.

In &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (1997), Lister meets a Lister from a parallel dimension (played by Charles), when a &quot;linkway&quot; through &quot;non-space&quot; is opened when the membrane between the two realities temporarily collapses. Lister realises that that dimension&#x27;s Lister is a hard light hologram. The parallel Lister explains that he was killed in the radiation leak that wiped out the crew of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. In a flashback, following Lister breaking up with Kochanski (now played by Chloë Annett) the previous week, the parallel Lister is shown returning to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and smuggling a cat on board, after a few days&#x27; shore leave on the moon Mimas—and not Titan as previously claimed—to get over Kochanski. This version of Kochanski later apologises for the Dear John letter she sent Lister the previous week. She describes her love life with Lister as having gone nowhere and amounting to &quot;hanging out in [Lister&#x27;s] bunk, eating delivery curries and having fantastic sex&quot;. She explains to Lister that she is back together with her ex, a chef called Tim. Kochanski discovers the unquarantined cat Lister smuggled on board and takes her, but is unable to kill her and hides her instead.

Back in the present, the parallel Lister explains that Holly brought him back as a hologram, and when the cat was discovered, Kochanski was the person who was punished and put into stasis instead. The original Lister also realises that the parallel Lister&#x27;s relationship with Kochanski was rekindled. Kryten later tells the original Lister that after the parallel Lister&#x27;s death, that dimension&#x27;s Lister was originally a soft light hologram before becoming hard light, and this made him &quot;caring in a way that most men aren&#x27;t&quot;. Kochanski asks Lister to fill an in-vitro tube with Lister&#x27;s DNA, as she hopes to one day have children. When Lister realises that he is his own father and Kochanski is &quot;me ex-girlfriend and me mum&quot;, Lister hurries to retrieve the tube. Lister saves Kochanski&#x27;s life during an attack on the linkway by a GELF spaceship, but Kochanski is subsequently stranded in Lister&#x27;s dimension when the interdimensional rip self repairs, and becomes a new member of &quot;Starbug&quot;″s crew. Lister says that after the baby Lister is grown in a uterine simulator, Lister travels back in time to leave his infant self (played by Alexander John-Jules) under a pool table at the Aigburth Arms pub. The story subsequently skips ahead to when this happens.

The official &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; website claims that the suggestion within &quot;Ouroboros&quot; is that the diverging point between Lister&#x27;s timeline and Kochanski&#x27;s alternate timeline happened when Kochanski takes &quot;her&quot; Lister&#x27;s cat, meaning that &quot;almost everything else [before] about [Kochanski&#x27;s] timeline was supposed to have played out along similar lines to the main one&quot;.

In &quot;Epideme&quot; (1997), Lister has his right arm amputated in an attempt to rid his body of the Epideme virus (voiced by Gary Martin). Kochanski ultimately gets rid of the virus by temporarily stopping Lister&#x27;s heart and containing the virus in deceased &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crewmember Caroline Carmen&#x27;s (Nicky Leatherbarrow) arm, injected with blood and adrenaline, and tricking the virus into thinking the arm belongs to Kochanski. In the following episode, &quot;Nanarchy&quot; (1997), Kryten tries looking for his self-repairing nanobots to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm. Returning to the part of space where they were last seen, the crew discovers &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; has been converted by the nanobots into a planetoid made of sand and Holly restored to his old settings (again played by Norman Lovett) and abandoned there, with the &quot;Red Dwarf Starbug&quot; spent years chasing after being a subatomic version shrunken down and eventually exploring Lister&#x27;s laundry basket, and the remaining bits they didn&#x27;t want being left on the planetoid. Kryten orders the nanobots to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm and turn the planetoid back into &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;Back in the Red&quot; (1999), Holly creates a new set of nanobots to bring the entire crew on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; back to life after Kryten&#x27;s had gone missing again. Included among the resurrected crew is Rimmer, after the hologrammatic simulation of Rimmer left &quot;Starbug&quot;. Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryten and Kochanski are sentenced to two years in the ship&#x27;s brig for misuse of confidential information. In &quot;Cassandra&quot; (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they&#x27;re a singing troupe. During a mission with the Canaries, the mainframe computer of the SS &quot;Silverberg&quot;, Cassandra (Geraldine McEwan), who can predict the future with an accuracy rating of one hundred per cent, tells Lister that he chokes to death aged 181, while trying to remove a bra with his teeth.

In &quot;Only the Good...&quot; (1999), a corrosive micro-organism is shown eating apart &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. After Rimmer tries and fails to obtain the formula for an antidote from a &quot;mirror universe&quot; where everything is opposite, and not being able to find anyone on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; upon returning, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone crossed back into the mirror universe. The machine opening the way to the mirror universe is shown to have been destroyed by the micro-organism, leaving Rimmer stranded and the only crew member aboard &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in his universe.

==== 2000s ====
In &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; (2009), set nine years later, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is intact; the human race is apparently &quot;virtually extinct&quot; in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female &quot;despair squid&quot;, whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and their dimension is &quot;invalid&quot;. This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest &quot;valid&quot; reality. They confront the &quot;Creator&quot; of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (Richard O&#x27;Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they&#x27;re hallucinating, and they wake up on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid. Lister initially believes that Kochanski is dead as well, but two children in the hallucination (played by Charlie Kenyon and Nina Southworth) inform that Kryten lied to him, and she actually left him after taking a &quot;Blue Midget&quot; shuttle. Kryten later confirms this. After waking up, Lister subsequently starts looking for Kochanski to get her back.

==== 2010s ====
In &quot;Trojan&quot; (2012), Lister describes himself as the &quot;last human being alive&quot;, with Kryten saying the same thing about him in &quot;Dear Dave&quot; (2012), while in a recorded message for his son (himself) in &quot;Fathers and Suns&quot; (2012), Lister tells himself to &quot;find Krissie [Kochanski]&quot; after getting himself an education, and in &quot;Entangled&quot; (2012), Lister mentions asking the Biologically Engineered Garbage Gobblers (BEGGs) for help with finding Kochanski.

According to backstory in &quot;Twentica&quot; (2016), Lister hotwired cars to go shoplifting from the age of seven until he was eleven, when he was on the . He also lies that he is a descendant of the scientist Joseph Lister to gain the crew access to the Lady Be Good Club.

In &quot;Officer Rimmer&quot; (2016), Lister reveals that as a kid he sold the rights to his genome to his friend Dodgy for 100 dollarpounds and half a packet of cigarettes. Kryten explains that this means thousands of companies, including a call centre, were licensed to produce biological copies of Lister. Lister wonders if this means all the &quot;smartarse Scousers in call centres&quot; are him.

In &quot;Skipper&quot; (2017), Rimmer uses a quantum skipper to travel to a universe where Lister is kind and hardworking. Here, Lister got put into stasis because he smuggled a pet rat on board, rather than a pet cat. The rat race did not have a religious war when they evolved, but stayed on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, living on most of its decks. In another universe, Rimmer discovers Lister has become captain of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; subsequent to Lister spotting the faulty drive plate, and has become wealthy from the shares he owned after &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; discovered a planet rich in helium-7.

=== Novels ===
Within the continuity of the books by Grant Naylor, Lister&#x27;s official date of birth is 14 October. Lister is described as going on a drunken Monopoly board pub crawl in London with his friends to celebrate his 23rd birthday, where he gets very drunk; when he awakens, he is on Mimas with no money. After six months, having failed to make enough money to get back home, he signs up for a job on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, which, unknown to him, is due to make a four-and-a-half-year mining run to Triton before heading back to Earth. Smuggling a cat on board was in fact a deliberate attempt to get discharged and sent home early.

In the book &quot;Better Than Life&quot; (1990), after spending two years in the game Better Than Life, Lister eventually discovers Earth, but discovers that it has left the orbit of the Solar System and finds that eight-foot-long cockroaches are the dominant species. He becomes their king and plans to rebuild the planet. The others find him thirty-four years later (after believing Lister was missing for a fortnight due to a time dilation). Later, after Lister dies of a heart attack in a confrontation with a polymorph, his body is taken to the alternative universe where time runs backwards and is told that he will be rescued in thirty-six years&#x27; time. Two accounts of what followed are &quot;Last Human&quot; (1995) and &quot;Backwards&quot; (1996).

In &quot;Last Human&quot;, the crew fight an alternate version of Lister who was adopted by different parents, this Lister choosing the wealthy but psychotic Thorntons over the poorer but more emotionally stable parents which the normal Lister had. As a result, this Lister grew up to be a sociopath, often manipulating others with his efforts, claiming not to believe in even the concept of love, and perfectly willing to murder his shipmates in order to achieve his goals.

In &quot;Backwards&quot;, the crew try to meet up with Lister at a Souvenir shop at Niagara Falls on backwards Earth, where they discover that Lister will be involved in a murder. They see Lister being unarrested and embark on a backwards pursuit. They find that Kryten was the one who killed a hillbilly which had Lister sentenced to eight years in prison (all in reverse). They miss their flight window and must spend the next ten years on the reverse Earth. They eventually leave for their own universe.

==Appearance==
Lister is normally dressed in a leather jacket and deerstalker hat, his boiler suits and his lengthy dreadlocks that he grows only from the back of his head.

Lister has a tattoo on his right buttock, dedicated to the love of his life: it is a heart with an arrow through it and underneath it has in dripping curry sauce, &quot;I love Vindaloo&quot;. It was obtained while on planet leave on Ganymede with Petersen, who spiked his cocktail with four-star petrol. When Lister woke up the next day, he had enrolled as a novice monk in a Ganymedian monastery. He also has another tattoo claiming that he loves Petersen placed on his inner thigh, which stems from an unidentified incident where the two got so heavily drunk together that Lister had no idea what was happening to him.

==Personality==
Lister is very lazy, and more importantly, unmotivated. He is a slob: his best shirt is one with &quot;only&quot; two curry stains on the front. He enjoys &quot;bumming around&quot;, drinking large amounts of lager, and eating Indian food and listening to a band called Rastabilly Skank. He is a supporter of the London Jets zero-gravity football team, and speaks with a Liverpudlian (Scouse) accent.

He prides himself on being a good man, a man of moral courage. When confronted with an evil version of himself on a corrupted version of Red Dwarf in &quot;Demons and Angels&quot; (1992), Lister says of his evil counterpart, &quot;But he kills; I&#x27;m not capable of that.&quot; Likewise, when he kills &quot;the Creator&quot; of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; TV series during his hallucination in &quot;Back to Earth&quot; (2009), his initial reaction is to state that he doesn&#x27;t kill people and doesn&#x27;t understand why he did it. In the episode &quot;Waiting for God&quot; (1988), he also showed an extreme amount of remorse when he hears that vast numbers of the Cat&#x27;s race have been killed due to holy wars and one of their arks flying off and crashing into an asteroid due to declaring him their god. Lister&#x27;s religious beliefs are unclear. In the episode &quot;The Last Day&quot; (1989), Kryten states that Lister is a pantheist, believing God to be in all things; however, in the later episode &quot;Back to Reality&quot; (1992) he is described as the &quot;ultimate atheist&quot;. Lister has had a number of relationships with women, albeit not all successful (his lack of ambition being the main cause for not settling down).

Lister managed to learn the international language Esperanto from Rimmer&#x27;s tapes, while Rimmer himself was unable to. In the episode &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; (1988), Arnold Rimmer described that, even though all its ingredients were wrong, a fried-egg chilli chutney sandwich somehow made a right and likened this fact to Lister&#x27;s personality. He is capable of piloting a spaceship and has a knack for mechanical repairs, particularly amateur cybernetics. He also considers himself good at pool, saying that he was nicknamed &quot;Dave Cinzano Bianco Lister&quot; because once he was on a table you couldn&#x27;t get rid of him. When the Inquisitor from the 1992 episode of the same name appeared on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to judge the crew, he declared that Lister&#x27;s failure to put his brain to good use was evidence that he had not lived a worthwhile life.

Lister is also an avid junk collector who has purchased (among other things) a talking toilet, a talking toaster with artificial intelligence, and two robot goldfish, which he named Lennon and McCartney (the latter of which swims backwards and is prone to breaking down).

===Guitar===
Lister is very attached to his guitar. In Series I, Lister&#x27;s guitar is firstly a silver acoustic Clarissa Roundback (Polverini, Italian Ovation copy, S1E5, 19:41). Then in &quot;Marooned&quot; (1989), his guitar is shown to be a black, electric guitar – according to Lister it is an &quot;authentic Les Paul copy&quot;. In &quot;Fathers and Suns&quot; (2012), Lister describes his guitar as a Gibson Les Paul.

The guitar appears to be destroyed or lost in several episodes, while somehow being recovered: in &quot;&quot; (1993), the Cat breaks Lister&#x27;s guitar. By &quot;Tikka to Ride&quot; (1997), he seems to have it intact again. While Lister is prison in the episode &quot;Krytie TV&quot; (1999), Petersen recovers the guitar from the wreck of &quot;Starbug&quot; offscreen, and has it sent it to Lister. Later, in &quot;Fathers and Suns&quot;, as punishment from his father (himself) for not applying for a robotics course, Lister&#x27;s guitar is flushed out of one of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s airlocks and is &quot;half a light-year away&quot;. When Professor Edgington (Sydney Stevenson) sees Lister&#x27;s guitar case in &quot;Entangled&quot; (2012), Lister mentions that he plays guitar.

==American pilot==
In the unaired pilot for the American version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Lister was played by Craig Bierko.

<text>Barrio () is a Spanish word that means &quot;quarter&quot; or &quot;neighborhood&quot;. In the modern Spanish language, it is generally defined as each area of a city delimited by functional (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial, etc.), social, architectural or morphological features. In Spain, several Latin American countries and the Philippines, the term may also be used to officially denote a division of a municipality. &quot;Barrio&quot; is an arabism (Classical Arabic &quot;barrī&quot;: &quot;wild&quot; via Andalusian Arabic &quot;bárri&quot;: &quot;exterior&quot;).

==Usage==

In Argentina and Uruguay, a &quot;barrio&quot; is a division of a municipality officially delineated by the local authority at a later time, and it sometimes keeps a distinct character from other areas (as in the barrios of Buenos Aires, even if they have been superseded by larger administrative divisions). The word does not have a special socioeconomic connotation unless it is used in contrast to the &quot;centro&quot; (city center or downtown). The expression &quot;barrio cerrado&quot; (translated &quot;closed neighborhood&quot;) is used to describe small upper-class residential settlements planned with an exclusive criterion and often physically enclosed in walls, that is, a kind of gated community.

In Colombia, the term is used to describe any urban area neighborhood whose geographical limits are determined locally. The term can be used to refer to all classes within society. The term &quot;barrio de invasión&quot; or &quot;comuna&quot; is more often used to refer to shanty towns, but the term &quot;barrio&quot; has a more general use.

In Cuba, El Salvador and Spain, the term &quot;barrio&quot; is used officially to denote a subdivision of a &quot;municipio&quot; (or municipality); each &quot;barrio&quot; is subdivided into sectors (&quot;sectores&quot;). 

In the Philippines, the term &quot;barrio&quot; may refer to a rural village, but it may also denote a self-governing community subdivision within a rural or urban area anywhere in the country. A 1974 decree replaced the word barrio with &quot;barangay&quot;, the basic administrative unit of government, possessing an average population of 2,500 people. &quot;Barrio&quot;, however, is still widely used interchangeably with &quot;barangay&quot;. Both may refer to rural settlements or urban municipal districts (the latter formerly known as &quot;visitas&quot;). It is alternatively spelled as &quot;baryo&quot;, though the preferred spelling is the Spanish one (barrio).

In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, the term &quot;barrio&quot; is an official government designation used to denote a subdivision of a &quot;municipio&quot; and denotes the government&#x27;s lowest level and geographically smallest officially recognized administrative unit. A barrio in Puerto Rico is not vested with political authority. It may or may not be further subdivided into sectors, communities, &quot;urbanizaciones&quot;, or a combination of these, but such further subdivisions, though popular and common, are unofficial
In the mainland United States, the term &quot;barrio&quot; is used to refer to inner-city areas overwhelmingly inhabited by first-generation Spanish-speaking immigrant families who have not been assimilated into the mainstream American culture. Some examples of this include Spanish Harlem in New York City, East L.A. in Los Angeles; and Segundo Barrio in Houston. Some of these neighborhoods are simply referred to as just &quot;El Barrio&quot; by the locals, as opposed to using their actual names (Spanish Harlem, East L.A., Segundo Barrio, etc.). 

In Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, the term is commonly used to describe slums in the outer rims of big cities such as Caracas and Santo Domingo as well as lower- and middle-class neighborhoods in other cities and towns.

==History==
Over the centuries, selectness in the Spanish Empire evolved as a mosaic of the various &quot;barrios&quot;, surrounding the central administrative areas. As they matured, the &quot;barrios&quot; functionally and symbolically reproduced the city and in some way tended to replicate it. The &quot;barrio&quot; reproduced the city through providing occupational, social, physical and spiritual space. With the emergence of an enlarged merchant class, some &quot;barrios&quot; were able to support a wide range of economic levels. This led to new patterns of social class distribution throughout the city. Those who could afford to locate in and around the central plazas relocated. The poor and marginal groups still occupied the spaces at the city&#x27;s edge.

The desire on the part of the sector popular to replicate a &quot;barrio&quot; was expressed through the diversity of the populace and functions and the tendency to form social hierarchies and to maintain social control. The limits to replication were mainly social. Any particular &quot;barrio&quot; could not easily expand its borders into other &quot;barrios&quot;, nor could it easily export its particular social identity to others. Different &quot;barrios&quot; provided different products and services to the city, e.g., one might make shoes, while another made cheese. Integration of daily life could also be seen in the religious sector, where a parish and a &quot;convento&quot; might serve one or more neighborhoods.

The mosaic formed by the &quot;barrios&quot; and the colonial center continued until the period of independence in Mexico and Latin America. The general urban pattern was one where the old central plaza was surrounded by an intermediate ring of &quot;barrios&quot; and emerging suburban areas linking the city to the hinterland. The general governance of the city was in the hands of a mayor and city councilors. Public posts were purchased and funds given to the local government and the royal bureaucracy. Fairness and equity were not high on the list of public interests. Lands located on the periphery were given to individuals by local authorities, even if this land was designated for collective uses, such as farming or grazing. This practice of peripheral land expansion laid the groundwork for later suburbanization by immigrants from outside the region and by real estate agents.

At the edge of Hispanic American colonial cities there were places where work, trade, social interaction and symbolic spiritual life occurred. These barrios were created to meet the space needs of local craftsman and the shelter needs of the working class. At times they were designed to meet municipal norms, but they usually responded to functional requirements of the users. Barrios were built over centuries of sociocultural interaction within urban space. In Mexico and in other Latin American countries with strong heritages of colonial centers, the concept of barrio no longer contains the social, cultural and functional attributes of the past. The few surviving barrios do so with a loss of traditional meaning. For most of them the word has become a descriptive category or a generic definition.

<text>In the military, a political commissar or political officer (or , a portmanteau word from ; or political instructor) is a supervisory officer responsible for the political education (ideology) and organization of the unit to which they are assigned, with the intention of ensuring political control of the military.

The function first appeared as &quot;commissaire politique&quot; (political commissioner) or &quot;représentant en mission&quot; (representative on mission) in the French Revolutionary Army during the French Revolution (1789–1799). Political commissars were heavily used within the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). They also existed, with interruptions, in the Soviet Red Army from 1918 to 1991, as well as in the armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1943 to 1945 as &quot;Nationalsozialistische Führungsoffiziere&quot; (national socialist leadership officers).

The function remains in use in China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

==China==

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The position of political commissar () existed in the Chinese Red Army since the Sanwan Reorganization of 1927 (), which established military organizations at various levels with Chinese Communist Party committees. The practice was formalized with the principle of the &quot;Party commands the gun&quot; () and the Gutian Conference of 1929. Red Army was part of the Communist revolution forces; thus Mao Zedong had constantly emphasized its role in both combat and political missions. The political commissioners were tasked to teach communist ideologies to internal members of the Red Army, as well as propaganda tasks targeting the enemy by showing the Red Army as a righteous force.

In the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), each level of the command has a dual-command structure, with a military organ and a Party organ. This collective leadership is held between the military commander () and political commander (, i.e. the political commissar). The political commissar is always a uniformed military officer with both tactical and political training and Chinese Communist Party cadre. In the past, this position has been used to give civilian party officials some experience with the military.

Usually, the operational command organ has the military commander as the highest decision maker, while the political commissar serves as the second-in-command. As the deputy, political commissar are largely responsible for administrative tasks such as public relations, unit welfare, mental health, morale, and political education. The party organs are chaired by the political commissar, with the military commanders serving as the deputy secretaries. This framework ensures that both military and political officers can collectively design the goals and tasks of their respective units.

The role of the political commissar is not universal across different branches of the PLA. In the Ground Force (PLAGF), the political commissar is often second-in-command, while the military officer is responsible for the operation. Whereas in the Navy (PLAN), the political commissar and the Party committee are the supreme decision-makers, while military works are delegated to the operational commander as the second-in-command.

===Republic of China===
The position of political commissar (, literal translation &quot;political warfare officer&quot;) also existed in the Republic of China Army of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Chiang Ching-kuo, appointed as Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) director of secret police in 1950, was educated in the Soviet Union, and initiated Soviet-style military organization in the Republic of China Armed Forces, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and Kuomintang party activities were propagated throughout the military. Opposed to this was General Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute. Chiang Ching-kuo then arrested Sun Li-jen, charging him of conspiring with the American Central Intelligence Agency of plotting to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. Sun was placed under house arrest in 1955.

==Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc==

An early kind of political commissar was established during the February Revolution 1917 as the Ispolkom issued the controversial Order no 1. As the Bolsheviks came to power through the October Revolution of November 1917, and as the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922 began, Leon Trotsky gradually established the Red Army and set up the role of political officers. They were tasked with making sure that communist parties could count on the loyalty of armed forces. Although there was a huge difference between the February Revolution and the October Revolution, their leaders in each case feared a counter-revolution, and both regarded the military officers as the most likely counter-revolutionary threat.

Later commissars in the Eastern bloc could exercise broader roles in social engineering.

===In the Soviet Union===


In the Red Army (1918–1946) and the Soviet Army (1946–1991), the &quot;political commissar&quot; () existed, by name, only during the 1918–1924, 1937–1940, and 1941–1942 periods; not every Red Army political officer was a commissar. The political commissar held military rank equaling the unit commander to whom he was attached; moreover, the commissar also had the military authority to countermand the unit-commander&#x27;s orders at any time. During the other periods of the Red Army&#x27;s history political officers were militarily subordinate to unit commanders, and the position of political commissar did not exist.

The political supervision of the Russian military was effected by the political commissar, who was present in every unit and formation, from company- to division-level, including in the navy. Revolutionary Military Councils (or Revvoyensoviets, RVS) were established at army-, front-, fleet-, and flotilla-level, comprising at least three members—the commander and two political workers. The political workers were denominated &quot;members of the RVS&quot;, not &quot;commissars&quot;, despite their position as official political commissars.

In 1919, the title &quot;politruk&quot; () was assigned to political officers at company level. Despite their position as official political commissars, they were not addressed as &quot;commissar&quot;. Beginning in 1925, the politico-military doctrinal course toward &quot;edinonachalie&quot; (, single command) was established, and the political commissar, as a military institution, faded. The introduction of &quot;edinonachalie&quot; was two-fold, either the military commander joined the Communist Party and became his own unit&#x27;s political officer, or a &quot;pompolit&quot; (, assistant commander for political work) officer was commissioned sub-ordinate to him. Earlier, in 1924, the RVSs were renamed as Military Councils, such high-level political officers were known as ChVS (&quot;Chlen Voennogo Soveta&quot;, Member of the Military Council); they were abolished in 1934.

On 10 May 1937, the role of political commissar was reinstated in the Red Army, and Military Councils were set up. These derived from the political purges in the Soviet armed forces. Again, in August 1940, the office of political commissars was abolished, yet the Military Councils continued throughout the Second World War and after. Below army level, the &quot;edinonachalie&quot; (single-command) system was restored. In July 1941, consequent to the Red Army&#x27;s defeats at the war&#x27;s start, the position of political commissar reappeared. The commissars had an influential role as &quot;second commanders&quot; within the military units during this time. Their rank and insignia generally paralleled those of officers. Because this proved ineffective, General Ivan Konev asked Joseph Stalin to subordinate the political officer to commanding officers: the commissars&#x27; work was re-focused to morale-related functions. The term &quot;commissar&quot; was abolished in August 1942, and at the company- and regiment-level, the &quot;pompolit&quot; officer was replaced with the &quot;zampolit&quot; (deputy for political matters). Although no longer known by the original &quot;commissar&quot; title, political officers were retained by all the Soviet Armed Forces, e.g., Army, Navy, Air Force, Strategic Missile Troops, et al, until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

====Red Army rank designations====

*&quot;Starshy politruk&quot; (Senior politleader)
*&quot;Politruk&quot; (Politleader)
*&quot;Mladshy politruk&quot; (Junior politleader)

===Eastern Bloc armies===
After World War II, other Eastern Bloc armies also used political officers patterned on the Soviet model. For example, East Germany&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Army used &quot;Politoffiziere&quot; as the unit commander&#x27;s deputy responsible for political education. During the Korean War, the Korean People&#x27;s Army commissars were known as &quot;Cultural Sections&quot; or &quot;Political Sections&quot;.

<doc id="488597" wikidata="Q1196267" url="?curid=488597" title="Danish cuisine">
<text>Danish cuisine originated from the peasant population&#x27;s own local produce and was enhanced by cooking techniques developed in the late 19th century and the wider availability of goods during and after the Industrial Revolution. Open sandwiches, known as &quot;smørrebrød&quot;, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and garnished with a variety of ingredients. Hot meals are typically prepared with meat or fish. Substantial meat and fish dishes includes &quot;flæskesteg&quot; (roast pork with crackling) and &quot;kogt torsk&quot; (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Ground meats (pork, veal or beef) became widespread during the industrial revolution and traditional dishes that are still popular include &quot;frikadeller&quot; (meat balls), &quot;karbonader&quot; (breaded pork patties) and &quot;medisterpølse&quot; (fried sausage). Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters, but amongst the Danes themselves imported wine has gained steadily in popularity since the 1960s.

Cooking in Denmark has always been inspired by foreign and continental practises and the use of imported tropical spices like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and black pepper can be traced to the Danish cuisine of the Middle Ages and some even to the Vikings.

Since the early 2000s, some Danish chefs have developed the new Danish cuisine, an innovative way of cooking based on high-quality local produce. This new philosophy and cuisine has attracted the attention of, and been celebrated by, the international gourmet community. It has contributed with a considerable number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the province, with some of them awarded Michelin stars.

== History ==

Danish cooking is rooted in the peasant dishes served across the country before the Industrial Revolution in 1860. It was based on the need to make use of natural products available on or near the family farm. As a result, a variety of &quot;brassicas&quot;, bread, fish, pork, and later potatoes, were eaten everywhere. Families had their own storage of long-lasting dry products, rye for making bread, barley for beer, dried peas for soup, and smoked or salted pork. Industrialization brought an increase in the consumption of fresh meat and vegetables, but rye bread and potatoes continued to be staples. With the arrival of dairy cooperatives in the second half of the 19th century, milk also gained favor, although all kinds of dairy products have been consumed in lesser quantities for millennia. The introduction of wood-burning stoves and meat grinders contributed to a range of new dishes including &quot;frikadeller&quot; (meat balls), &quot;medisterpølse&quot; (fried ground meat sausage), &quot;hakkebøf&quot; (meat patties of beef), &quot;karbonader&quot; (breaded pork meat patties), meat loafs, roast pork, poached cod, and &quot;stegt rødspætte&quot; (breaded plaice). Desserts of stewed fruits or berries such as &quot;rødgrød&quot; date from the same period, as do a large variety of cakes and cookies.

Over the centuries, sausage, which was not only economical but could be kept for long periods, was together with rye bread behind the development of &quot;smørrebrød&quot;. By the end of the 18th century, there were several different kinds of sausage but the preparation of cold meat products developed rapidly in the 1840s when the French butcher Francois Louis Beauvais opened a business in Copenhagen. In the 1880s, Oskar Davidsen opened a restaurant specializing in &quot;smørrebrød&quot; with a long list of open sandwiches. &quot;Leverpostej&quot; (liver pâté) became available in grocery shops at the end of the 19th century but it was some time before its price was comparable with that of cold cuts. Around the same time, the one-hour lunch break which had allowed people to enjoy a hot midday meal was shortened to 30 minutes, encouraging them to take a few pieces of &quot;smørrebrød&quot; to work in a lunch box. In the 1920s and 1930s, tomatoes and cucumbers were added as a topping to the cold cuts. In the 1940s, Henry Stryhn popularized &quot;leverpostej&quot; by making deliveries around Copenhagen on his bicycle.

In the 1960s and 1970s, with the availability of deep frozen goods, the concept of fast food arrived together with an interest in Mediterranean dishes as Danes travelled more widely. By the 1990s, ingredients were being imported from the south while new products were farmed at home, providing a basis for a developing interest in gourmet dishes. Much of the inspiration came from France, as Danish chefs went on television explaining how to prepare dishes such as &quot;canard à l&#x27;orange&quot; or authentic &quot;sauce Béarnaise&quot;. A younger generation of chefs soon started to travel abroad themselves, learning how to adapt the expertise of French and Spanish chefs to the use of local ingredients as a basis for creating beautifully presented, finely flavored Nordic dishes. As a result, in recent years Danish chefs have helped to put Denmark on the world gastronomic map, with several Michelin-starred restaurants in Copenhagen and the provinces.

=== New Danish cuisine ===


Danish cuisine has also taken advantage of the possibilities inherent in traditional recipes, building on the use of local products and techniques that have not been fully exploited. Local products such as rapeseed, oats, cheeses and older varieties of fruits are being rediscovered and prepared in new ways both by restaurants and at home, as interest in locally sourced organic foods continues to grow. The Nordic Council&#x27;s agricultural and food ministers have supported these developments in the form of a manifesto designed to encourage the use of natural products from the Nordic countries in the food production industry, while promoting the &quot;purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics&quot; associated with the region&#x27;s cuisine.

In 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 the Copenhagen restaurant Noma (short for &quot;nordisk mad&quot; – Nordic food) was named the world&#x27;s best restaurant by the magazine &quot;Restaurant&quot;.

In 2012, the Danish chef and food activist Claus Meyer had his own show about Nordic cuisine on BBC Lifestyle. His recent book &quot;Almanak&quot; contains 365 new cuisine recipes, one for each day of the year.

== Main meals ==

Most Danes have three regular meals a day, usually consisting of a cold breakfast with coffee or tea, a cold lunch at work and a hot dinner at home with the family. Some also have a snack in the middle of the afternoon or in the late evening. Meat, especially pork, is by far the most common ingredient of hot meals. It is usually accompanied by potatoes and sometimes by another vegetable such as carrots or lettuce. Most hot meals consist of only one course: starters are fairly rare but desserts such as ice cream or fruit are a little more frequent. Beer and wine are fairly common drinks at mealtimes but so are soft drinks, plain water and, to a lesser extent, milk and coffee. Many families follow the old traditions. Mothers and fathers cook together and teach their children how to cook. Meals form an important part of family life, allowing for socializing and contributing to the sense of the well-being and coziness known as &quot;hygge&quot;.

=== Breakfast ===

The basic Danish breakfast consists of coffee, or tea, and rye bread, white bread, or rolls with cheese or jam. Bread at breakfast time most often comes in the form of a white loaf known as &quot;franskbrød&quot; (French bread), a baguette, or a variety of white or brown rolls (&quot;boller&quot;, &quot;birkes&quot;, &quot;rundstykker&quot;, &quot;håndværkere&quot;) or croissants. The bread is usually buttered and topped with soft or creamy cheese, sausage, pâté, cured cold meat or jam. On festive gatherings or when time permits, as on Sundays, for example, a variety of bread rolls can be included as well as &quot;wienerbrød&quot;, as Danish pastry is known in Denmark. Fruit juice, mostly orange or apple, and sometimes a bitter such as Gammel Dansk, may also be served, especially when breakfast is served to guests or on special occasions and celebrations like birthdays and anniversaries. In Danish hotels, soft-boiled eggs and cold meats are usually served for breakfast, too.

On weekdays, various cereals, such as corn flakes, muesli or rolled oats, are often served for breakfast with just cold milk and sugar. Soured milk products are popular, too, and are served either plain or with cereals or fruit. The typical local soured milk product of &quot;ymer&quot; is topped with &quot;ymerdrys&quot;, a mixture of dried grated rye bread and brown sugar. Porridges such as oatmeal and a traditional local porridge called &quot;Øllebrød&quot; are also popular on work days. Øllebrød, a thin porridge cooked with bits of rye bread, hvidtøl, water, and sugar, and served with milk or sometimes whipped cream, is gaining in popularity as reflected on the breakfast menus of many cafés.

=== Lunch ===

Rather than eating at home, most Danes have a quick lunch at work or school either in the cafeteria, if there is one, or more often in the form of a packed lunch or &quot;madpakke&quot; prepared before they leave home. Lunch is usually a cold meal consisting of a few simply prepared pieces of &quot;smørrebrød&quot; (often referred to as &quot;håndmad&quot;, i.e. hand-food) with slices of cold meat, sliced sausage or hard-boiled egg. &quot;Leverpostej&quot;, a liver pâté prepared from pig&#x27;s liver and lard, is also frequently used as a spread.

=== Dinner ===
For the average family, dinner is the one meal of the day where everyone can be gathered, due to the pressures of the modern life where both parents are likely to work, and the children are in school or pre-school institutions. Dinner usually consists of just one main course, often a meat dish with potatoes and a vegetable or salad. Starters are seldom served at home. If there is a dessert, it is likely to be ice cream or a fruit dish. Much more substantial dinners are served on weekends, special occasions or when guests have been invited.

Confusingly, the evening meal is sometimes called &quot;middag&quot; (midday) because hot meals were formerly served in the middle of the day. The variety of evening meals has developed as a result of the increasing availability of foods from supermarkets as well as the development and growth of the local food industry. As a result of American influence, there is now considerable interest in barbecues, salad buffets and ready-to-serve dishes. Italian-inspired preparations, including pizza and pasta, have also become common options. Meat is very popular, pork ranking as the most frequently served. Cuts are often prepared in the frying pan and accompanied by gravy and potatoes.

== Open sandwiches ==

&quot;Smørrebrød&quot; (originally &quot;smør og brød&quot;, meaning &quot;butter and bread&quot;) usually consists of a piece of buttered rye bread (&quot;rugbrød&quot;), a dense, dark brown bread. &quot;Pålæg&quot; (meaning put-on, actually &quot;that which is laid on [the bread]&quot;), the topping, then among others can refer to commercial or homemade cold cuts, pieces of meat or fish, cheese or spreads. More elaborate, finely decorated varieties have contributed to the international reputation of the Danish open sandwich or &quot;smørrebrød&quot;. A slice or two of &quot;pålæg&quot; is placed on the buttered bread and decorated with the right accompaniments to create a tasty and visually appealing food item.

Some traditional compositions include:
*&quot;Dyrlægens natmad&quot; (veterinarian&#x27;s late-night snack). On a piece of dark rye bread, a layer of liver pâté (&quot;leverpostej&quot;), topped with a slice of &quot;saltkød&quot; (salted beef) and a slice of &quot;sky&quot; (meat jelly). This is all garnished with raw onion rings and garden cress.
*&quot;Røget ål med røræg&quot;, smoked eel on dark rye bread, topped with scrambled eggs, chives and a slice of lemon.
*&quot;Leverpostej&quot;, warm rough-chopped liver pâté served on dark rye bread, often topped with bacon and/or sauteed mushrooms. Additions can include lettuce, and sliced pickled/fresh cucumber.
*Roast beef, thinly sliced and served on dark rye bread, topped with a portion of remoulade, and decorated with a sprinkling of shredded horseradish and crispy fried onions.
*&quot;Ribbensteg&quot;, thin slices of roast pork with crackling, served on dark rye bread with &quot;rødkål&quot; (pickled red cabbage), and decorated with a slice of orange.
*&quot;Rullepølse&quot;, spiced meat roll with a slice of meat jelly, onions, tomatoes and parsley. Usually pork meat, but sometimes lamb.
*Tartar, with salt and pepper, served on dark rye bread, topped with raw onion rings, grated horseradish and a raw egg yolk.
*&quot;Røget laks&quot;. Slices of cold-smoked salmon on white bread, topped with shrimp and garnished with a slice of lemon and fresh dill.
*&quot;Stjerneskud&quot; (Shooting star). On a base of buttered toast, two pieces of fish: a piece of steamed white fish (mostly plaice) on one half, a piece of fried, breaded plaice or &quot;rødspætte&quot; on the other half. On top is piled a mound of shrimp, which is then garnished with a dollop of mayonnaise, sliced cucumber, caviar or blackened lumpfish roe, and a lemon slice.

== Cold buffet ==
&quot;Det Kolde Bord&quot; is a cold buffet served with bread on special occasions. The food is usually brought to the dining table and passed around family-style and the idea is similar to the Swedish counterpart, the &quot;smörgåsbord&quot;, but with slightly different ingredients. &quot;Det Kolde Bord&quot; is usually served at lunch time, but may well carry on into the evening.

The meal begins with seafood, usually pickled herring, or another herring dish. The cured and pickled herring fillets are typically made and served in a white and a red variety, but a multitude of pickled herring dishes exists. White herring has marinated in a clear, sweet and mildly spiced vinegar marinade while the sharper tasting red herring has marinated in a red, seasoned vinegar marinade, owing their red colour to sandal wood. Other common variations includes a variety of sour cream-based sauces, of which a curry flavoured type is very popular. &quot;Spegesild&quot; is usually served on buttered, black rye bread, topped with onion rings, pickled capers and a glob of curry salad – a sour-cream based sauce, flavored with curry and chopped pickles – and chopped hard boiled eggs on the side. Alternative, but common, herring dishes served at the cold buffet includes (fried herring in vinegar) consisting of rye-battered, fried fillets of herring in a spiced vinegar marinade or the more elaborate (herring dish) where the herring is arranged in a large serving dish with various sides such as warm, boiled potatoes, raw onion, pickled capers and a dill-flavoured sour-cream or mayonnaise sauce, or diced apple, shredded horseradish and curry salad, as two common options. Other seafood dishes may include:

*&quot;Rejer&quot; (shrimps), usually served on white bread with mayonnaise and lemon
*&quot;Røget ål&quot; (smoked eel) with scrambled egg
*&quot;Gravad laks&quot; (salt-cured salmon) with a dill and mustard sauce
*&quot;Rødspættefilet&quot; (breaded filets of plaice), served hot with lemon and remoulade
*&quot;Røget laks&quot; (smoked salmon)
*&quot;Røget hellefisk&quot; (smoked halibut)

The cold table also consists of a wide variety of meat dishes and, despite its name, nearly always includes a few items which are served hot. Some of the more common components are:

*&quot;Frikadeller&quot; (meat balls), sometimes hot
*&quot;Leverpostej&quot; (liver paste), sometimes hot, with pickled beetroot, mushrooms or fried bacon
*&quot;Mørbradbøf&quot; (pork tenderloin), hot, with fried onions
*&quot;Flæskesteg&quot; (roast pork) with crackling, usually with red cabbage
*&quot;Medisterpølse&quot; (a coarsely ground pork sausage, fried)
*&quot;Pariserbøf&quot; (ground beef steak), usually served hot on toast with pickles

There might also be cold cuts from hams, roast beef, salami, brisket of beef and spiced roulade. &quot;Det Kolde Bord&quot; usually include accompaniments such as potato salad, scrambled egg and a variety of salads. Desserts like fruit salad and fruit pies, as well as various cheeses may also be served. Around Christmas, the buffet will sometimes include &quot;sylte&quot; (meat jelly from pork) and other Christmas-related specialties.

== Options for dinner ==
The everyday evening meal for most Danes consists of a main course and perhaps a dessert. At weekends and on special occasions, a more elaborate meal is served. Good restaurants usually serve a three-course dinner. While an ever-wider range of foreign foods are available in Denmark, traditional dishes are still popular. A selection of the more common options is given below.

=== Appetizer ===
The first course is typically fish or soup, although a wide variety of other appetizers are becoming more common. Common traditional appetisers include:

* Shellfish, including mussels, shrimp, oyster, crab and lobster. Usually served poached with white bread and various toppings for an appetiser or small meal.
** Shrimp (&quot;rejer&quot;) are mostly from the Greenland or the North Atlantic. Fjord shrimp from Denmark are a seasonal and less common delicacy: very small and flavorful, about the size of the smallest fingernail. Special shrimp appetisers are shrimp cocktail (&quot;rejecocktail&quot;), shrimp salad (with mayonnaise) and shrimp terrine. Apart from appetisers, shrimps also features as toppings for some fish servings.
** Mussels (&quot;muslinger&quot;), is fished and farmed on a large scale in Danish waters and is served poached. Blue mussels is by far the most common, but razor clams, green lipped mussel and common cockle is sometimes served as well. As with shrimps, mussels may feature in some fish dishes.
** Oyster is usually served raw, and sometimes smoked, as an appetiser for more lavish dinners.
*Fish served for appetiser or entrée, includes pickled herring and &quot;gravad laks&quot; served cold with bread; rye bread for the herring and white bread for the salmon. There are many kinds of pickled herring, with a large variety of vinegar marinades and smoked or fried pickled herring is also served. Fish pâté of various kinds with bread might also be had.

=== Soups ===

Soup is often a meal on its own and mostly served with bread. It can also be served as an entrée before the main course. In addition to soups also common outside of Denmark, specialities include:

*&quot;Gule ærter&quot; (pea soup), a meal in itself served together with salted pork, carrots and other vegetables
*&quot;Hønsekødssuppe&quot; (chicken soup) served with &quot;melboller&quot; (small flour dumplings), meatballs and cubed vegetables.

=== Main dishes ===

Fish, seafood and meat are prominent parts of any traditional Danish dish.

With a very long coastline and large number of smaller islands, Denmark has a long tradition of fishing and seafood takes a natural part of the Danish food tradition.

The most commonly eaten fish and seafood are:
*Cod (&quot;torsk&quot;), a common white fish in general food preparation (baked, steamed, poached). It is also dried (&quot;klipfisk&quot;). Danes are particularly fond of cod&#x27;s roe. The roe are in season in January–February, but is sold and consumed year round canned. Prices on cod have risen in recent years, making this once-favorite fish drop down the list. It has mainly been replaced by other white fish, such as haddock and ling.
*Norway lobster (&quot;jomfruhummer&quot;)
*Herring (&quot;sild&quot;), features prominently in the traditional Danish cuisine and is served in a large variety of ways either smoked, fried, pickled, breaded, or charred.

*Plaice (&quot;rødspætte&quot;), in the form of fried, battered fish filets or as a white fish in general food preparation (baked, steamed, poached). It is often replaced with the more common European flounder, known as &quot;skrubbe&quot; in Danish.
*Eel (&quot;ål&quot;), is smoked or pan-fried. Smoked eel is almost exalted in some homes.
*Salmon (&quot;laks&quot;), poached or broiled and served in a variety of ways. Smoked and gravad lox salmon with bread is reserved for appetisers or &quot;smørrebrød&quot;.
*Roe (&quot;rogn&quot;), fish roe from cod is by far the most common, but lumpfish (&quot;stenbider&quot;) is also served on occasion. Poached or pan-fried is most typical. Salmon roe is used for toppings of some seafood dishes.

Fish from Bornholm, Iceland and Greenland also has a special place in the Danish cuisine. The island of Bornholm, a part of Denmark located in the Baltic Sea, to the east of Zealand and south of Sweden, is noted for its smoked fish items. Iceland and Greenland have long shared histories with Denmark, and the fish from these North Atlantic lands is a sign of quality.

Pork is the favourite meat in Denmark and pork meat has been a major export sector for more than 100 years. As regards home cooking and meat, the Danes primarily eat pork (42%), followed by poultry (28%) and beef (26%). These are 2016 numbers and does not include processed meat and eating out. Processed meats comprise a lot of pork in Danish cuisine, including hams, smoked pork, many kinds of cold cuts, sausages and salamis, so the pork consumption percentage would be even larger if processed meat were included. Ground pork meat is used in many traditional recipes requiring ground meat. Danish bacon is generally of good quality (exported Danish bacon is of exceptional quality), and available in both the striped and back varieties.

Beef is also very popular in the modern Danish kitchen. Danish cattle are primarily used for dairy and Denmark has a centuries-old tradition of dairy products. Hence, cattle bred for their meat were formerly rare and expensive. Dairy cattle rarely make good meat cattle – especially after several years as dairy cows- and for that reason, beef has traditionally been ground and cooked as patties or prepared as boiled roast or soup. Today meat-cattle is more common and steaks are popular, especially top sirloin steak of beef (&quot;culottesteg&quot;) is a classic dish to serve for guests.

Poultry consumption is dominated by chicken, with chicken filet and as the most popular choice.

The Danes meat consumption remains high, but meat has overall lost a little bit of ground to vegetables and vegetarian food in the 2010s. Also there is a tendency to replace popular meats with chicken.

==== Traditional main course dishes ====
Many traditional dishes have been abandoned in Denmark in the last 4-5 decades, especially dishes requiring long preparations but also organ meat dishes. Fast preparations, pre-cooked meals and foreign inspired cooking from around the world, has increasingly found its way into the kitchens of the common Danish family. Traditional Danish main course dishes includes:

*&quot;Hønsekødssuppe&quot; (Hens-meat-soup). A strong soup boiled on a large hen with herbs and vegetables like carrots, celeriac, onions and leeks. The meat is usually reserved for other dishes like &quot;Høns i Asparges&quot;, &quot;Høns i peberrod&quot; or chicken salad for &quot;smørrebrød&quot;, and the soup is then served on its own with meatballs of pork (&quot;kødboller&quot;), small white dumplings of flour and milk (&quot;melboller&quot;), and a few of the vegetables.
*&quot;Høns i Asparges&quot; (Hens in Asparagus) Boiled hens meat (traditionally from &quot;Hønsekødssuppe&quot;) is cooked with a little chicken soup, a bit of flour and some chopped white asparagus. Sometimes chopped champignons are added. The dish is thickened and flavoured with cream and egg yolks and served with boiled potatoes and a drizzle of parsley.

Apples, onions, and sometimes oranges or red wine might be added, and for more luxurious versions, the cabbage is stewed with duck grease. Served for Christmas, but not exclusively. &quot;Rødkål&quot; is a traditional accompaniment to &quot;flæskesteg&quot;, &quot;medister&quot;, &quot;frikadeller&quot;, &quot;stegt and&quot;, and &quot;stegt gås&quot;.

=== Desserts ===

Desserts from the traditional Danish cuisine that are still popular, includes:
*&quot;Æblekage&quot;, (apple charlotte). Stewed sweetened apples layered with butter-roasted bread crumbs and crushed &quot;makroner&quot; (an almond-flavoured meringue), topped with whipped cream and sometimes redcurrant jelly. Served cold.
*&quot;Citronfromage&quot; (lemon custard). A very thick lemon flavoured custard made with both gelatin and beaten egg whites with sugar (see Meringue). Served cold with whipped cream. Flavouring with rum instead of lemon, is a traditional variation known as &quot;Romfromage&quot;.

*&quot;Frugtsalat&quot;. Fruit salad topped with vanilla cream or whipped cream and grated chocolate. This is a more recent addition to the Danish cuisine and tropical or foreign fruits like banana, grapes, orange or pineapple are standard ingredients. Also known as &quot;abemad&quot; (monkey food).

Almost exclusively served on festive events related to Christmas and commonly eaten on Christmas Eve in particular.

=== Cakes ===
Cakes are usually not served for dessert in Denmark, but as an occasional sweet treat in between meals or at celebrations and particular festive events. Coffee or tea is usually offered with cakes.

=== Sweets ===
Salted liquorice is popular in Denmark and the Netherlands. Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats originate from Denmark. Also first produced in Denmark the company &quot;Castus&quot; produces slices of fig/date to put on rye bread. Other fruit slices are also produced.

== Traditional feasts ==
Danish culture has a number of annual recurring traditional feasts. Most of them are rooted in both the Norse pagan tradition and the Christian culture, including the most widely celebrated feast of Christmas, known as Jul in Denmark. Christmas and Easter are the most prominent feasts in Danish culture, both in terms of religious and traditional importance but also food wise. A number of smaller feasts such as &quot;Fastelavn&quot; (Carnival), &quot;Pinse&quot; (Pentecost) and &quot;Mortensaften&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Day), are also of some importance regarding food while other traditional celebrations such as &quot;Grundlovsdag&quot;, May Day and &quot;Sankthans&quot; (St. John&#x27;s Eve) are not coupled to the Danish food culture in any special way.

The celebration of New Year&#x27;s Eve is perhaps on par with both Christmas and Easter in modern times and is also coupled with some strong food traditions. Poached cod served with mustard sauce, boiled potatoes and horseradish is traditionally enjoyed as the main course on this evening, known as &quot;nytårstorsk&quot; (New Year&#x27;s Cod), with champagne and &quot;kransekage&quot; served later in the night. Slices of boiled ham served with stewed kale is another traditional dish for this particular evening. In recent decades, the traditional menus has given way to contemporary gourmet servings in many places, even though the champagne and the &quot;kransekage&quot; remains very popular.

=== Christmas ===
There are some regional variations of the traditional Christmas cuisine within Denmark, but it is generally the same across the country. It includes a lot of spices, in particular cinnamon, cloves and cardamom.

==== Christmas lunch ====

&quot;Julefrokost&quot;, or Christmas lunch, is a variation on &quot;Det Kolde Bord&quot; buffet, celebrated on various occasions throughout the whole Christmas month of December. Most communities, workplaces, organisations and associations set aside time for an annual gathering and &quot;julefrokost&quot; on a non-specific Friday or Saturday. This includes coworkers, club members and all kinds of organizations and the festivities often include music and dancing, and usually continues into the early hours of the morning with plentiful drinking. In addition to these public gatherings, there is also tradition for a special family event &quot;julefrokost&quot;, but this is celebrated in the home on Christmas Day or shortly after.

Apart from the standard food items for a Danish cold buffet, Christmas lunch &quot;julefrokost&quot; traditionally also includes some specialities, such as &quot;sylte&quot; (pork meat jelly), fried &quot;blodpølse&quot;, and &quot;Risalamande&quot;. &quot;Blodpølse&quot; is a sweetened and spiced blood sausage with raisins, but it has decreased a lot in popularity since the 19th century. &quot;Risalamande&quot; is a rice pudding served with hot or cold cherry sauce and it is very popular. The pudding consists mainly of sweetened and cooled rice porridge mixed with whipped cream, vanilla and chopped almonds. A popular and traditional game is to put a whole, peeled almond in the common bowl of pudding. The lucky person to find it in his or her serving wins a prize, which in popular traditions would be a pig shaped of marzipan.

&quot;Juleøl&quot; Christmas beer brews and herb infused &quot;akvavit&quot; spirit is commonly paired with the &quot;julefrokost&quot;. All over Denmark, trains and buses run all night during the &quot;julefrokost&quot; season and the police are on a special lookout for drunk drivers to avoid alcohol related accidents.

A special part of not only the &quot;julefrokost&quot; lunch but of many festive, celebratory meals is the &quot;selskabssang&quot; (party song). It is a tradition unique to Denmark, and includes event-specific sing-along songs to traditional tunes, but with lyrics specifically written for the occasion.

==== Christmas dinner at home ====

In Denmark, the Christmas dinner is served on the evening of 24 December (Christmas Eve). It takes the form of a main dish (usually pork, goose or duck) and the &quot;Risalamande&quot; dessert. The traditional recipes from Frk. Jensen&#x27;s 1901 cook book (see below) still form the basis of Christmas cooking today.

&quot;Flæskesteg&quot;, a pork roast cut from the breast or neck and with the skin left on, is prepared by cutting the skin through to the meat layer sideways and rubbing it thoroughly with coarse salt flakes and sometimes spices to guarantee crispy tasty cracklings. Slices of roasted &quot;flæskesteg&quot; is served with brown gravy and accompanied by both boiled potatoes and caramelized potatoes (&quot;brunede kartofler&quot;) specially prepared in a frying pan with melted sugar and a lump of butter. Sour-sweet spiced red cabbage is always included too and is widely available in jars and cans.

Goose and duck are filled with a stuffing of apple boats and prunes before they are roasted in a hot oven. The bird is served with a brown sauce based on the broth obtained by boiling the heart, neck, liver and gizzard, thickened with a little fat from the bird, flour and sour cream. Gravy browning may be added. Just like the pork, the bird is served with two kinds of potatoes and red cabbage.

=== Easter ===
==== Holy Saturday lunch ====
Holy Saturday the traditional dish served for lunch is &quot;Skidne æg&quot; (Dirty eggs), the name referres to fact that the homes were usually dirty on Holy Saturday, as no work and no cleaning or laundry would be done on the two holidays: Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. Skidne æg is medium boiled eggs, served with mustard sauce, cress and ryebread.

==== Easter Sunday lunch ====
Families gather for lunch on Easter Sunday. The lunch will typically consist three courses, starting with &quot;det kolde bord&quot; with pickled herring, prawns, hard-boiled eggs, tuna, liverpaté and various cold cuts. Strong Easter Brew beer and snaps is usually served. The second dish is a warm dish, that according to tradition should contain either lamb, eggs or chicken. The third dish is cheeses with grapes, red peppers and crackers.

== Restaurants and dining venues ==

Eating out in restaurants can be a costly affair, with the average price running higher than that of the European average. As a result of the New Nordic Cuisine trend, Danish restaurants are now firmly on the international gourmet map.

In the big cities, and in shopping districts, there are many more reasonably priced eating places, including such chain fast food possibilities as McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King. The most common quick food restaurant is the &quot;burger bar&quot; or &quot;grill bar&quot;, offering hamburgers, hot dogs and a wide variety of other fast food staples. Pizzerias are equally popular and can be found in every town in the country, large or small. Other commonly found fast foods include Turkish and Middle East food specialties such as falafel, shish-kebab and spit-roasted meat (most often shawarma) with salad in pita bread, or wrapped in durum wheat based flatbread.

=== Restaurants ===
Denmark has many fine dining restaurants, not only in the larger cities, but also in the countryside. The &quot;kro&quot; (roughly equivalent to an inn, but held in higher social regard) provides lodging as well as meals and drinks. Especially the royally privileged lodges have a long and interesting history. Danish cuisine continues to evolve and keep up with the times. It has become more health-conscious, and has drawn inspiration not only from the traditional French and Italian kitchens, but also from many other more exotic gastronomical sources. Increasingly, restaurants are turning to trends based on a combination of continental cooking and the growing interest in products from the local environment served in accordance with seasonal availability.

=== Cafés ===
Another reasonable place to eat is at a café. These are plentiful, especially in the bigger cities, and usually offer soups, sandwiches, salads, cakes, pastries, and other light foods, in addition to the expected coffee, tea, beer and other beverages. Quite a few cafés serve breakfast and brunch, and some double as evening restaurants.

Most cafés in Denmark are unique, but chains are increasingly popular. The Danish coffee-bar chain of Baresso Coffee, founded in 1999, mainly serves coffee and tea related products and is present with many cafés in most larger towns across Denmark, but also in the Faroe Islands as well as Copenhagen Airport and MS Crown of Scandinavia. International café chains has gained ground in the capital of Copenhagen, currently including two Starbucks and several Caffè Ritazza (UK), at the Copenhagen Airport, Magasin Torv by the Magasin Du Nord department store, and at Copenhagen Central Station.

=== Street food ===
Street food has made an enormous impact on the way Danes eat in the 2010s, but street food has been part of Danish dining culture for many years.

==== Hot dog vans ====

The pølsevogn (lit. sausage wagon) food truck is a well-established common fast food option and the &quot;original&quot; street food outlet in Denmark. They serve a variety of pork sausages, including Denmark&#x27;s renowned red sausages, &quot;røde pølser&quot;. These hot dog-like sausages of the Vienna type are about 20 cm long, about the diameter of an index finger and stuffed in brightly coloured red skin. &quot;Røde pølser&quot; are traditionally served on a small, rectangular paper plate with a bread (similar to a hot dog bun, but without a slice in it) on the side, and a squirt of both ketchup, Danish remoulade sauce and mustard. Danish remoulade is somewhat similar to American relish and the mustard served with sausages is hot and unsweetened. The bread and sausage is eaten alternately, dipped into the condiments. Typical and classic sausages served from a pølsevogn also includes, thick and juicy &quot;knækpølser&quot; (both red and uncoloured), long thick and grilled &quot;frankfurtere&quot;, hearty grilled &quot;medisterpølse&quot;, large grilled &quot;kryddersvend&quot; sausages spiced with curry, and &quot;pølse i svøb&quot; (sausage in a wrap) which are a sausage wrapped in and grilled with bacon.

When the sausage is served in a traditional hot dog bun, it is called a &quot;hot dog&quot;. It is commonly served with Danish remoulade, ketchup, mustard, onion (both raw and toasted, i.e. &quot;ristede&quot;) and thinly sliced pickles on top. The &quot;ristede løg&quot; fried onions are similar in taste to French-fried onion rings. The pickled condiment varies from region to region, and includes &quot;rødkål&quot; red cabbage in some places, but cucumber relish is the most widespread. Another variety is the French hot dog (&quot;Fransk hotdog&quot;) which is a sausage stuffed into a special long baguette-like bread roll. The roll has a hole in one end, and after the requested condiment has been squirted in (ketchup, mustard, different kinds of dressing), a sausage is slipped through. The simplest sausage wagons are portable and very temporary. They are typically a metal wagon with an open window to the street, and a counter where customers can stand and eat their sausages. More advanced wagons includes limited seating, usually both inside and outside. Through the years the number of sausage wagons has dropped as competition from convenience stores, gas stations, kebab and pizza-places has increased.

==== Social dining ====
Food courts emerged on the Copenhagen dining scene in 2011 and quickly became very popular, inspiring similar initiatives in Aarhus from 2015. Parallel with the stationary and sheltered food courts, mobile food trucks appeared, selling a wide variety of meals at events and random popular spots. This new development is part of a broader popular movement of social dining across the country, with a multitude of local food, dining and cooking clubs, purchasing societies and urban farming projects sprouting among citizens in larger cities.

== Other popular foods ==
=== Potatoes ===

Potato recipes are ubiquitous in Danish cooking. The potato was first introduced into Denmark by French immigrant Huguenots in Fredericia in 1720. The potato is considered an essential side dish to every hot meal.

Especially prized are the season&#x27;s early potatoes, such as those from Samsø.

Some favorites:
* Au gratin potatoes
* Baked potatoes with crème fraiche
* Boiled new potatoes with herbs
* Potato wedges au natural or baked with beetroots and carrots marinated in olive oil, garlic and dry herbs
* Boiled potatoes smothered in butter with fresh dill or chives

* &quot;Pommes frites&quot; (French fries)
*Potato salad (&quot;kartoffelsalat&quot;)

=== Vegetables and salads ===

Although the potato is the central vegetable in traditional Danish cooking, it is by no means the only vegetable associated with Danish cuisine. Those other vegetables that play an important role often had to be preserved for long periods of time in cold rooms, or were pickled or marinated for storage. Cauliflower, carrots and a variety of cabbages were often a part of the daily meal, especially when in season, in the days prior to widespread refrigeration.

*Beans (&quot;bønner&quot;)
*Peas (&quot;ærter&quot;) Especially popular when freshly picked.
*Brussels sprouts (&quot;rosenkål&quot;)
*Cabbage (&quot;kål&quot;)
*Carrots (&quot;gulerødder&quot;)
*Creamed kale (&quot;grønlangkål&quot;), spinach or white cabbage
*Cauliflower (&quot;blomkål&quot;)
*Cucumber salad (&quot;agurkesalat&quot;)
*Italian salad (&quot;italiensk salat&quot;), a mixture of vegetables in a mayonnaise dressing, served on ham and other cold cuts. The name comes from the red-white-green coloring, the colors of the Italian flag. The salad&#x27;s colouring originates from carrots, mayonnaise and asparagus, and green peas.
*Onion (&quot;løg&quot;)
*Pickled red beet slices (&quot;rødbeder&quot;)
*Pickles, a mixture of pickled vegetables in a yellow gelatinous sauce, served with corned beef
* Russian salad (&quot;russisk salat&quot;), a red beet salad (not to be confused with Olivier salad, which is also known as Russian salad).
*Sweet and sour red cabbage (&quot;rødkål&quot;). Sautéed red cabbage, boiled with red currant juice, apples and vinegar. Additional sugar may be added, and sometimes cinnamon or cloves.

===Sauces and condiments===

Sauces and condiments are an important part of the Danish meal:
*Béarnaise sauce, served with beef steaks
*Brown sauce (&quot;brun sovs&quot;). Variations include mushroom sauce, onion sauce and herbed brown sauce.
*Horseradish sauce (&quot;peberrodssovs&quot;), a cream sauce served with roast beef or prime rib. Sometimes frozen into individual servings for placement on hot roast beef.
*Ketchup, a must with red sausages, along with mustard.
*Mayonnaise, used in food preparation, and as a condiment with &quot;pommes frites&quot; (French fries). A generous dollop of mayonnaise is generally placed on top of shrimp.
*Mustard (&quot;sennep&quot;). A wide variety of mustards are available. Traditional mustard is a sharp flavored, dark golden brown, but many other types are used, including dijon, honey-mustard and other specialty flavored variants. Prepared salad mustard (yellow mustard) is generally eaten with red sausage or hot dogs. A special sweet mustard with dill is eaten with smoked salmon (laks).
*Parsley sauce (&quot;persillesovs&quot;), a white sauce with generously amounts of chopped fresh parsley.
*Pepper sauce, served with beef steaks and roasts.
*Remoulade, a very commonly used condiment. A popular (dipping) sauce for &quot;pommes frites&quot; (French fries), plaice, spring rolls, canned cod roe, roast beef, salami.
*Whiskey sauce, served with beef steaks and roasts
*White sauce. Various kinds of blanched vegetables are often added such as peas, peas and carrots, cauliflower, spinach, parsley or shredded cabbage. White sauce is typically flavoured with black pepper and nutmeg.

=== Cheese ===

Denmark is known for quality dairy products, and that includes cheese. In Denmark, cheese might be served as part of breakfast, lunch or in salads and also as an after-dinner snack, referred to as a so-called (lit.: cheese-table) or (lit: cheese-plate) along with grapes, crackers and wine.

While the most commonly eaten cheese in Denmark is mild, there are also stronger Danish cheeses available, some of which are very pungent. Danish Blue cheese can be quite strong, and Danish cheese manufacturers produce molded cheeses that span the range from the mildest and creamiest to the intense blue-veined cheese internationally associated with Denmark. Another strong cheese is &quot;Gamle Ole&quot; (lit: Old Ole – Ole is a man&#x27;s name), a brand of pungent aged cheese that has matured for a longer period of time. It can be bitingly strong. It is often served in combination with sliced onion and aspic (&quot;sky&quot;) on Danish &quot;rugbrød&quot; spread with lard. Rum may be dripped on this pungent cheese prior to serving.

Strong cheeses are an acquired taste for Danes too. Elderly Danes who find the smell offensive might joke about &quot;Gamle Ole&#x27;s&quot; smelling up a whole house, just by being in a sealed plastic container in the refrigerator. One might also refer to Gamle Ole&#x27;s pungency when talking about things that are not quite right, i.e. &quot;they stink&quot;. Here one might say that something stinks or smells of &quot;Gamle Ole&quot;.

Danish cheese is almost exclusively produced from cow&#x27;s milk. Some well-known Danish cheeses include:
* &quot;Danablu&quot;, a strong blue creamy cow&#x27;s milk cheese.
* Blue Castello, a blue cheese
* &quot;Esrom&quot;, a semi-soft and aged cow&#x27;s milk cheese. Both young and more matured versions are produced.
* &quot;Danbo&quot;, a semi-soft and aged cow&#x27;s milk cheese. Mostly mild in flavor, but extensively aged and more pungent versions are also produced.
* &quot;Mycella&quot;, a traditional cow&#x27;s milk creamy cheese. This cheese is often described as a Danish version of Gorgonzola.
* &quot;Vesterhavsost&quot;, a hard cheese from cow&#x27;s milk, and aged in caves. Has a slightly nutty flavor.
* &quot;Havarti&quot;, a semi-soft cow&#x27;s milk cheese, named after the experimental farm from which it originated in the mid-19th century.
* &quot;Apetina&quot;, a blanched cow&#x27;s milk cheese. This cheese is often sold sliced up in small cubes, sometimes submerged in herb flavoured oil and used in salads much like Greek feta.
* &quot;Rygeost&quot; or &quot;røgeost&quot;. A smoked fresh soft cream cheese, made of cow&#x27;s milk and buttermilk and an original speciality from the island of Funen. This cheese is spiced with caraway seeds and traditionally served with radish, chives and rye bread.

In relation to &quot;Apetina&quot;, Denmark lost a long legal battle with Greece, to use the term &quot;feta&quot; for Danish cheese produced using artificially blanched cow&#x27;s milk. Since July 2002, feta has been a protected designation of origin (PDO), which limits the term within the European Union to feta made exclusively of sheep&#x27;s/goat&#x27;s milk in Greece. Because of the decision by the European Union, Danish dairy company Arla Foods (who also manufacture Danbo) changed the name of their Feta product to &quot;Apetina&quot;.

=== Seasonings and herbs ===

Fresh herbs are very popular, and a wide variety are readily available at supermarkets or local produce stands. Many people grow fresh herbs either in the kitchen window, in window boxes or outside, weather permitting. Most commonly used herbs and other seasonings in Danish cooking:

*Bay leaves
*Black pepper
*Chives
*Cress
*Curry powder
*Dill
*Garlic
*Parsley
*Rosemary
*Thyme
*Oregano

Other spices used in the traditional Danish cuisine includes nutmeg, carraway, juniper, allspice and ginger (powder and candied). In modern times, the use and variety of spices has increased and now spices like chilli, paprika, basil and star anise is used widely.

=== Fruit ===

Similarly to vegetables, fruit had to withstand long storage during the winter to become a part of the traditional cuisine. Fruit is generally eaten in smaller portions, often as an accompaniment to cheese, or as decoration with desserts.

Fruit that is traditionally associated with Danish cuisine:
*Apples (&quot;Æbler&quot;) Popular in traditional dishes as &#x27;winter apples&#x27; store well. Can be fried and served with &quot;Flæsk&quot; (thick bacon)
*Blackcurrant (&quot;Solbær&quot;), literally &#x27;sun berries&#x27;
*Cherries (&quot;Kirsebær&quot;) When in season eaten fresh. But famously cooked into cherry sauce, traditionally served over rice pudding (&quot;risalamande&quot;) at Christmas. Also used in making Heering, a famous cherry liqueur, produced in Denmark.
*Gooseberry (&quot;Stikkelsbær&quot;) literally &#x27;thorny berries&#x27;. Used for stewed gooseberries (&quot;stikkelsbærgrød&quot;).
*Pears (&quot;Pærer&quot;)
*Plums (&quot;Blommer&quot;)
*Raspberries (&quot;Hindbær&quot;)
*Redcurrants (&quot;Ribs&quot;) Made to jelly or simply mixed raw with sugar as (&quot;Rysteribs&quot;), served to roast.
*Strawberries (&quot;Jordbær&quot;), literally &#x27;earth berries&#x27;

A combination of strawberries, red currants, black currants, blueberries and mulberries is known as &quot;forest fruits&quot; (&quot;skovbær&quot;) and is a common component in tarts and marmalades. A popular dessert is &quot;rødgrød&quot;, made from one or more kinds of berries or rhubarbs, boiled down to a red porridge. It is served with cream, sometimes milk.

&quot;Rødgrød med fløde&quot; is often jokingly used by Danes as a shibboleth, as it contains the soft &quot;d&quot; several times, which most foreigners find difficult to pronounce.

=== Baked goods ===

Bread is a very important part of the Danish table. It is enjoyed at home, in the workplace or in restaurants and is usually based primarily on &quot;rugbrød&quot;, which is sour-dough rye bread. It is a dark, heavy bread which is sometimes bought pre-sliced, in varieties from light-colored rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. Rugbrød forms the basis of &quot;smørrebrød&quot; (see above). Many people still bake at home, particularly &quot;boller&quot;, which are small bread rolls, and often the traditional &quot;kringle&quot;, which is a pastry filled with Zante currants and remonce paste. The Danish &quot;franskbrød&quot; (lit: French-bread) are leavened wheat breads, roughly equivalent to white bread. Franskbrød are available in many varieties, ranging from whole wheat to pumpkin, chestnut, or poppy-seed sprinkled loaves and loaves containing maize, müsli or honey. Some loaves are made with alternative wheat sorts like emmer or spelt and some contains small amounts of low-gluten grains such rye. Leavened brown loaves are also referred to as &quot;franskbrød&quot;. People often eat jam with cheese on crusty white bread for breakfast, and also very thin slices of chocolate, called &quot;pålægschokolade&quot;. Because of the popular rye bread, Danes eat less wheat bread than most other western countries, even though bread is part of most daily meals.

==== Cakes ====
Denmark has a large variety of cakes and in 1997, the bakers guild launched the now countrywide celebration of &quot;Kagens Dag&quot; (Day of the Cake) as an annual recurring event in April–May. The region of Sønderjylland has become known for its concept of &quot;Sønderjydsk kaffebord&quot;, serving copious amounts of coffee and regional cakes on gatherings and festive afternoons. Typical Danish cakes include:

*&quot;Wienerbrød&quot; (Danish pastry) – Denmark has a large variety of Danish pastries; most of the recipes are based on the same kind of dough.
**&quot;Kringle&quot; – a pretzel-shaped Danish pastry. It has symbolized bakers in Denmark since the early Middle Ages, and in the United States &quot;kringle&quot; is associated with the country of Denmark.
**&quot;Kagemand&quot; (&quot;cake-man&quot;) – a Danish pastry in the shape of a man. Decorated with icing and candy. Traditionally served at children&#x27;s birthday parties. In a traditional game, before serving, the head is cut off the cake man while the children scream loudly.
*&quot;Småkager&quot; (&quot;small-cakes&quot;) – Cookies, usually baked hard and crusty in an oven, but both pan and deep fried versions exist. There is a large variety of &quot;småkager&quot; in Denmark. Most of the recipes came about when stoves became common property in the last part of the 1800s, but some recipes like &quot;Klejner&quot; and &quot;Pebernødder&quot; have been around since the Middle Ages. Quite a few recipes are associated with Christmas. Denmark has a significant export of quality butter cookies.
**&quot;Pebernødder&quot; – (&quot;pepper nuts&quot;) – A small, spicy cookie associated with Christmas. Traditionally used in a number of games.
**&quot;Vaniljekranse&quot; – Vanilla-flavoured butter cookies in a ring-shape.
*&quot;Flødekager&quot; (&quot;cream-cakes&quot;) – These cakes earn their name from the generous amounts of whipped cream used to make them and are served cold. The many varieties do not always include baked ingredients. They were largely introduced in the 1800s and 1900s when &quot;Konditorier&quot; became popular in larger towns. A &quot;Konditori&quot; is the Danish version of the French patisserie, and they were booming in the 1940s and 1950s.
**&quot;Lagkage&quot; (layer cake) – This cake has thin sponge cake layers, often with mashed berries and whipped cream or custard between the layers and decorated with fruit on top. Layer cakes are usually considered a &quot;flødekage&quot; in Denmark. They are often used to celebrate birthdays, on which occasion they will traditionally be decorated with as many lit candles as the age of the celebrated individual. He is then supposed to blow them all out in one try or he will be in bad luck. Some Danish layer cakes follow strict recipes like the &quot;Rugbrødslagkage&quot; made with crumbled and toasted rye bread or the &quot;Othellolagkage&quot;, made with marzipan and chocolate cream.
**&quot;Gåsebryst&quot; (&quot;Goose breast&quot;) consists of a crisp puff pastry bottom with a generous spread of prune jam and a thick layer of whipped cream on top. The cake is wrapped in a thinly rolled layer of marzipan. Several slight variations exists and this particular cream cake is also popular in Norway.
*&quot;Tørkager&quot; (&quot;dry-cakes&quot;) – As the name implies this kind of cake comprise dry cakes, as compared to the moist cream cakes and layer cakes, and they are often made with sweet shortcrust dough and served cold.
**&quot;Kransekage&quot; (&quot;ringcake&quot;) is a marzipan-based cake, usually served at special celebrations and on New Year&#x27;s Eve. It comes in various shapes and sizes. A popular arrangement consists of a stack of ring shaped cakes of increasingly smaller size, creating an upside down cone form. The cake rings are decorated with white icing, and the arrangement is decorated with small red-and-white Danish paper flags. On special occasions they will hide a bottle of champagne. &quot;Kransekage&quot; is typically served with champagne on New Year&#x27;s Eve or to celebrate weddings, &quot;round&quot; birthdays and anniversaries.
**&quot;Studenterbrød&quot; (&quot;graduates-bread&quot;) is a popular cold confectionery cake consisting of scratch-made thick cookie butter on a thin crispy crust of shortcrust dough with a spread of raspberry jam in-between. The cookie butter is flavoured with cocoa powder and rum, although the more inexpensive rum essence is normally used. Topped with chocolate icing and sprinkles.
**&quot;Hindbærsnitte&quot; (&quot;raspberry-slice&quot;) consists of two thin and crusty baked pieces of shortcrust with a spread of raspberry jam in between, covered in white icing and sprinkles. Similar to Alexandertorte
*Pies and tarts
**Strawberry pie – very popular in the summer. Normally sold in bakeries with a chocolate covered crust and filled with marzipan.
**Apple pie – oven baked. Served either hot or cold, usually with a dollop of crème fraîche or whipped cream, occasionally vanilla ice cream.
*Other cakes
**&quot;Æbleskiver&quot; (&quot;apple slices&quot;) – Fried spherical cakes made in special pans. Contrary to the name, &quot;æbleskiver&quot; is not made with apples, but of a puffy pancake dough with buttermilk and cardamom. Danes eat them hot throughout December as a Christmas tradition, served with both confectioner&#x27;s sugar and jam (strawberry or black currant).
**&quot;Pandekager&quot; (pancakes) – These are thin pancakes usually served with jam, granulated sugar and sometimes vanilla ice cream and rolled up before eaten.

=== Sweets ===
Denmark is not a noted exporter of candies, but Danes eat more candy per capita than other countries.

*Chocolate – Denmark has a long tradition of producing chocolate known worldwide, the most famous brand is Anthon Berg.
*Liquorice – A very popular herb extraction in Denmark used for a number of widely available sweets, but also ice cream, desserts and in some dishes as well. &quot;Salmiaklakrids&quot;, flavoured with salmiak, and salty &quot;Salt lakrids&quot; are typical Danish candy. Denmark produces some of the strongest liquorice in the world and many Danes have a tendency to put liquorice (“lakrids” in Danish) on many other foods.
*Marzipan – A typical treat for Christmas, but enjoyed year round and also exported. Marzipan in Denmark is typically less sweet and with a higher content of almonds (or other nuts) than what you normally find elsewhere. The largest and best known exporter is perhaps Anthon Berg. However, in Denmark, only &quot;Ægte Marcipan&quot; (True Marzipan) is required to contain almonds; for ordinary marzipan, apricot kernels are widely used as substitutes for the more expensive almonds. Marzipan made with pistachios or walnuts is also sold but is not as common.
*Wine gums – While similar looking and often similar branded as in other European countries, Danish wine gums are much less sweet and have more texture.

There also exists a vast number of other types of sweets and candy, ranging from gumdrops and dragée to mints and caramel sweets. A concept known as &quot;Bland selv slik&quot; (literally &quot;mix-yourself candy&quot;) is common in Danish supermarkets and kiosks. It comprises a number of lined-up containers, usually between 20 and 50, each with a different kind of candy, and customers then service themselves with a paper bag and a small scoop. The paper bag is then weighed, and paid for.

Both Danish and imported candy are found in these box assortments, and the shape, texture and flavor differences are often very creative. Candy has been manufactured resembling a vast number of objects, such as flying saucers, tennis racquets, soccer balls, butterflies, and even teeth and toothbrushes.

== Drinks ==
Traditional or popular drinks consumed in Denmark includes:

*Coffee (&quot;Kaffe&quot;). Filter coffee is the most popular way to make coffee, closely followed by pressing. The coffee is mostly had black, but milk and sugar is usually offered. It is drunk throughout the day and evening, and always in the morning. Nearly all cafés serves a wide variety of coffee brews, from espresso to flat white and caffè latte. Coffee is a very popular beverage throughout the Nordic countries and Denmark has the fifth highest coffee consumption per capita in the world.
*Chocolate milk (&quot;kakaomælk&quot;) and hot chocolate (&quot;varm kakao&quot;). Cold chocolate milk is widely consumed and hot chocolate can be had in most cafés. At home, hot chocolate is often served to children as an essential part of family &quot;hygge&quot;.
*&quot;Hyldeblomstsaft&quot;. Sweetened elderflower drink, often mixed at home with added water. Sometimes served hot in the winter but usually cold.
*&quot;Danskvand&quot;, or &quot;hvid vand&quot;, is simply carbonated water. It is often flavoured with citrus.
*&quot;Saftevand&quot;, a diluting juice made from concentrated and sweetened fruit syrup. The syrup is mixed with plain water by the consumer and served right away. In former times, diluting juices were a luxury product in Denmark, because of the limited availability of sugar, but from the 1980s and 90s, the consumption had risen to the popularity it experiences today. Many different kinds, including artificial products.
*&quot;Sodavand&quot; are soft drinks of various flavours and it has long been a very popular drink. International brands like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Fanta and Sprite is widely consumed, but there are many local brands of soft drinks as well, some of which are unique. This includes Nikoline (without artificial flavours), Tuborg Squash, Faxe Kondi or the traditional &quot;citronvand&quot; (lemon soda) and &quot;hindbærbrus&quot; (raspberry soda).

Notable alcoholic beverages includes:

*&quot;Akvavit&quot;, usually called &quot;snaps&quot;. A clear, high proof spirit made from potatoes but, unlike vodka, always flavoured with herbs (dill, caraway, sweetgale, etc.)
*Beer (&quot;øl&quot;) has been widely consumed in Denmark for millennia. Carlsberg and Tuborg are two large Danish producers with a notable export. Drinking a &quot;pilsner&quot; is a favored activity by many Danes after work or, when relaxing or socialising. The pilsner type is the dominant beer type, but many other types are available. In the 2000s, small breweries have been budding up all over the country with new local brews of all kinds.
*Bitters. The most popular bitter is &quot;Gammel Dansk&quot; (translated, Old Danish).
*&quot;Mjød&quot;, mead is known from the Norse Mythology and is rarely consumed in Denmark.
* Fruit wines. Cherry wine, apple wine, black currant wine, elderberry wine.
*&quot;Gløgg&quot;, hot punch made with red wine, brandy and sherry with raisins and almonds. Spiced with cloves and cinnamon, part of the Christmas tradition.
*Wine (&quot;vin&quot;) is ever more popular. Almost exclusively imported wines, as Danish wine is only produced in small quantities and is still rare to find outside speciality shops.

== Criticism ==
The Danish food culture is sometimes criticized by gastronomes and nutritionists.

Substantial criticism has been directed at the nutritional content of Danish food; for example, at the ratio of meat, side dishes, and greens on the plate. Nutrition information campaigns have been trying to get the Danes to become healthier by eating less meat, fat, and sugar, and more raw vegetables. Instead of a healthier diet, however, the results too often have been feelings of guilt and a view of food as something which is just the correct fuel for the body&#x27;s machinery.

Historian Søren Mørch has characterized the Danish cuisine as a &quot;garbage kitchen&quot; of insipid, sweet and unspiced &quot;baby food&quot; where the tastes of milk and sweetness form the key elements. He believes that it arose because the export policy of the Danish food sector was to use the Danish home market as a &quot;gutter&quot; for left-over products, after high-quality bacon and butter had been sold abroad. Skimmed milk, meat scraps only suitable for chopping up, and the replacement product margarine are all products which Søren Mørch describes as residue products.

== &quot;Frøken Jensens Kogebog&quot; ==

The cookery book was published by Kristine Marie Jensen (1858–1923) in 1901 and titled &quot;Frk. Jensens Kogebog&quot; (Miss Jensen&#x27;s Cookbook) is considered by many Danes to contain all the authentic recipes for traditional dishes as well as for baking bread, cakes, and biscuits. It has been reprinted dozens of times and new editions can be found in most Danish bookshops today. When Danes prepare meals for special occasions, for example at Christmas time, they frequently follow Frøken Jensen&#x27;s detailed descriptions. The book has not been translated into English but many of the traditional Danish recipes on English-language websites are those of Frøken Jensen. The original edition (only in Danish) is available online.

<text>In the mathematical field of measure theory, an outer measure or exterior measure is a function defined on all subsets of a given set with values in the extended real numbers satisfying some additional technical conditions. The theory of outer measures was first introduced by Constantin Carathéodory to provide an abstract basis for the theory of measurable sets and countably additive measures. Carathéodory&#x27;s work on outer measures found many applications in measure-theoretic set theory (outer measures are for example used in the proof of the fundamental Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem), and was used in an essential way by Hausdorff to define a dimension-like metric invariant now called Hausdorff dimension. Outer measures are commonly used in the field of geometric measure theory.

Measures are generalizations of length, area and volume, but are useful for much more abstract and irregular sets than intervals in formula_1 or balls in formula_2. One might expect to define a generalized measuring function formula_3 on formula_1 that fulfills the following requirements:

# Any interval of reals formula_5 has measure formula_6
# The measuring function formula_3 is a non-negative extended real-valued function defined for all subsets of formula_1.
# Translation invariance: For any set formula_9 and any real formula_10, the sets formula_9 and formula_12 have the same measure
# Countable additivity: for any sequence formula_13 of pairwise disjoint subsets of formula_1
::formula_15

It turns out that these requirements are incompatible conditions; see non-measurable set. The purpose of constructing an &quot;outer&quot; measure on all subsets of formula_16 is to pick out a class of subsets (to be called &quot;measurable&quot;) in such a way as to satisfy the countable additivity property.

==Outer measures==
Given a set formula_17 let formula_18 denote the collection of all subsets of formula_17 including the empty set formula_20 An outer measure on formula_16 is a set function
formula_22
such that 
* : formula_23
* : for arbitrary subsets formula_24 of formula_17formula_26
Note that there is no subtlety about infinite summation in this definition. Since the summands are all assumed to be nonnegative, the sequence of partial sums could only diverge by increasing without bound. So the infinite sum appearing in the definition will always be a well-defined element of formula_27 If, instead, an outer measure were allowed to take negative values, its definition would have to be modified to take into account the possibility of non-convergent infinite sums.

An alternative and equivalent definition. Some textbooks, such as Halmos (1950) and Folland (1999), instead define an outer measure on formula_16 to be a function formula_29 such that
* : formula_23
* : if formula_9 and formula_32 are subsets of formula_16 with formula_34 then formula_35
* for arbitrary subsets formula_36 of formula_17formula_38
==Measurability of sets relative to an outer measure==
Let formula_16 be a set with an outer measure formula_40 One says that a subset formula_41 of formula_16 is formula_43-measurable (sometimes called Carathéodory-measurable relative to formula_43, after the mathematician Carathéodory) if and only if
formula_45
for every subset formula_9 of formula_47

Informally, this says that a formula_43-measurable subset is one which may be used as a building block, breaking any other subset apart into pieces (namely, the piece which is inside of the measurable set together with the piece which is outside of the measurable set). In terms of the motivation for measure theory, one would expect that area, for example, should be an outer measure on the plane. One might then expect that every subset of the plane would be deemed &quot;measurable,&quot; following the expected principle that
formula_49
whenever formula_9 and formula_32 are disjoint subsets of the plane. However, the formal logical development of the theory shows that the situation is more complicated. A formal implication of the axiom of choice is that for any definition of area as an outer measure which includes as a special case the standard formula for the area of a rectangle, there must be subsets of the plane which fail to be measurable. In particular, the above &quot;expected principle&quot; is false, provided that one accepts the axiom of choice.

===The measure space associated to an outer measure===
It is straightforward to use the above definition of formula_43-measurability to see that
* if formula_53 is formula_43-measurable then its complement formula_55 is also formula_43-measurable.
The following condition is known as the &quot;countable additivity of formula_43 on measurable subsets.&quot;
* if formula_58 are formula_43-measurable pairwise-disjoint (formula_60 for formula_61) subsets of formula_16, then one has formula_63

A similar proof shows that:
* if formula_58 are formula_43-measurable subsets of formula_17 then the union formula_67 and intersection formula_68 are also formula_43-measurable.

The properties given here can be summarized by the following terminology:

One thus has a measure space structure on formula_17 arising naturally from the specification of an outer measure on formula_47 This measure space has the additional property of completeness, which is contained in the following statement:
* Every subset formula_53 such that formula_73 is formula_43-measurable.
This is easy to prove by using the second property in the &quot;alternative definition&quot; of outer measure.

==Restriction and pushforward of an outer measure==
Let formula_43 be an outer measure on the set formula_76.
===Pushforward===
Given another set formula_77 and a map formula_78 define formula_79 by
:formula_80
One can verify directly from the definitions that formula_81 is an outer measure on formula_77.
===Restriction===
Let be a subset of . Define by
:formula_83
One can check directly from the definitions that is another outer measure on .
===Measurability of sets relative to a pushforward or restriction===
If a subset of is -measurable, then it is also -measurable for any subset of .

Given a map and a subset of , if is -measurable then is -measurable. More generally, is -measurable if and only if is -measurable for every subset of .

==Regular outer measures==
===Definition of a regular outer measure===
Given a set , an outer measure on is said to be regular if any subset formula_84 can be approximated &#x27;from the outside&#x27; by -measurable sets. Formally, this is requiring either of the following equivalent conditions:
* formula_85
* There exists a -measurable subset of which contains and such that formula_86.
It is automatic that the second condition implies the first; the first implies the second by taking the countable intersection of formula_87 with formula_88

===The regular outer measure associated to an outer measure===
Given an outer measure on a set , define by
:formula_89
Then is a regular outer measure on which assigns the same measure as to all -measurable subsets of . Every -measurable subset is also -measurable, and every -measurable subset of finite -measure is also -measurable.

So the measure space associated to may have a larger σ-algebra than the measure space associated to . The restrictions of and to the smaller σ-algebra are identical. The elements of the larger σ-algebra which are not contained in the smaller σ-algebra have infinite -measure and finite -measure.

From this perspective, may be regarded as an extension of .

== Outer measure and topology ==

Suppose is a metric space and an outer measure on . If has the property that

:formula_90

whenever

:formula_91

then is called a metric outer measure.

Theorem. If is a metric outer measure on , then every Borel subset of is -measurable. (The Borel sets of are the elements of the smallest -algebra generated by the open sets.)

== Construction of outer measures ==
There are several procedures for constructing outer measures on a set. The classic Munroe reference below describes two particularly useful ones which are referred to as Method I and Method II.

=== Method I ===
Let be a set, a family of subsets of which contains the empty set and a non-negative extended real valued function on which vanishes on the empty set.

Theorem. Suppose the family and the function are as above and define

:formula_92

That is, the infimum extends over all sequences of elements of which cover , with the convention that the infimum is infinite if no such sequence exists. Then is an outer measure on .

=== Method II ===
The second technique is more suitable for constructing outer measures on metric spaces, since it yields metric outer measures. Suppose is a metric space. As above is a family of subsets of which contains the empty set and a non-negative extended real valued function on which vanishes on the empty set. For each , let

:formula_93

and

:formula_94

Obviously, when since the infimum is taken over a smaller class as decreases. Thus

:formula_95

exists (possibly infinite).

Theorem. is a metric outer measure on .

This is the construction used in the definition of Hausdorff measures for a metric space.

<doc id="488613" wikidata="Q63213676" url="?curid=488613" title="Kapu (Hawaiian culture)">
<text>Kapu is the ancient Hawaiian code of conduct of laws and regulations. The &quot;kapu&quot; system was universal in lifestyle, gender roles, politics and religion. An offense that was &quot;kapu&quot; was often a capital offense, but also often denoted a threat to spiritual power, or theft of &quot;mana&quot;. &quot;Kapus&quot; were strictly enforced. Breaking one, even unintentionally, often meant immediate death, &quot;Koʻo kapu&quot;. It is related to the concept of &quot;tapu&quot; or &quot;tabu&quot; found in other Polynesian cultures, from whence came the English word &quot;taboo.&quot; The Hawaiian word &quot;kapu&quot; is usually translated to English as &quot;forbidden&quot;, though it also carries the meanings of &quot;keep out&quot;, &quot;no trespassing&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot;, &quot;consecrated&quot;, or &quot;holy&quot;.

The opposite of kapu is &quot;noa&quot;, meaning &quot;common&quot; or &quot;free&quot;.

== Kahili ==

The &quot;Kahili&quot; were restrictions placed upon contact with chiefs (kings), but these also apply to all people of known spiritual power. &quot;Kapu Kū mamao&quot; means prohibited from a place of the chief, while &quot;Kalu noho&quot; was to assemble before the chief. It was &quot;kapu&quot; when entering a chief&#x27;s personal area to come in contact with his hair or fingernail clippings, to look directly at him, and to be in sight of him with a head higher than his. Wearing red and yellow feathers (a sign of royalty) was &quot;kapu&quot;, unless an individual was of the highest rank. Places that are &quot;kapu&quot; are often symbolized by &quot;Pahu Kapu&quot;, two crossed staffs, each with a white ball atop.

== ʻAi Kapu ==
The &quot;ʻAi kapu&quot; was the &quot;kapu&quot; system governing contact between men and women. Many &quot;aliʻi&quot; obtained their power through this system, and then would give thanks to the god of politics Kū. &quot;ʻAi&quot; means &quot;to eat&quot; and &quot;Kapu&quot; means sacred. Therefore, it is translated to &quot;sacred eating&quot;. In this practice men and women could not eat meals together. Furthermore, certain foods such as pork (the body form of the god Lono), most types (67 of the 70 varieties) of bananas (body form of the god Kanaloa), and coconuts (body form of the god Kū) were considered &quot;kapu&quot; to women. This not only prohibited women from eating these, but also their contact in contexts such as the manufacture of coconut rope. Taro (body form of the god Kāne) was kapu for women to cook and prepare. Some large fish were also kapu for women to eat. Isabella Abbott, a leading ethnobotanist of Hawaii, theorizes that because of the limited &quot;noa&quot; (free) diet for Hawaiian women, seaweeds were relied upon more heavily for Hawaiians than other Pacific islands.

The &quot;kapu&quot; system was used in Hawaii until 1819, when King Kamehameha II, acting with his mother Queen Keōpūolani, his father&#x27;s other queen Kaʻahumanu, and &quot;Kahuna-nui&quot; Hewahewa, abolished it by the symbolic act of sharing a meal of forbidden foods with the women of his court. Abolishing the &quot;ʻai kapu&quot; assured political power to the line of Kamehameha rulers as monarchs because it limited the power of the rulers below them. Originally, it was from this political system that the rulers throughout the island would gain rank, power, and prestige.

== Modern usage ==

The ambiguities in the Polynesian concept (from the English point of view) are reflected in the different senses of the word in different national Englishes: in modern usage in Hawaii, &quot;kapu&quot; is often substituted for the phrase &quot;No Trespassing&quot; on private property signage. Although kapu can be taken to mean &quot;keep out&quot;, kapu has a larger meaning to most residents of Hawaii. By contrast, in New Zealand, the comparable word &quot;tapu&quot; is almost always applied in English as meaning &quot;sacred&quot;.

<doc id="488615" wikidata="Q4229607" url="?curid=488615" title="Commissar">
<text>Commissar (or sometimes &quot;Kommissar&quot;) is an English transliteration of the Russian (&quot;komissar&quot;), which means &#x27;commissary&#x27;. In English, the transliteration &quot;commissar&quot; often refers specifically to the political commissars of Soviet and Eastern-bloc armies or to the people&#x27;s commissars (effectively government ministers), while administrative officers are called &quot;commissaries&quot;.

The Russian word комисса́р, from French &quot;commissaire&quot;, was used in Russia for both political and administrative officials. The title has been used in the Soviet Union and in Russia since the time of the emperor Peter the Great ().

==History==
In the 18th and 19th centuries in the Russian army &quot;kommissars&quot;, then &quot;krigs-komissars&quot; (from &#x27;war&#x27;) were officials in charge of supply for the armed forces (see Rus. Генерал-кригскомиссар).

Commissaries were used during the Provisional Government (March–July 1917) for regional heads of administration, but the term commissar is associated with a number of Cheka and military functions in Bolshevik and Soviet government military forces during the Russian Civil War (the White Army widely used the collective term &quot;bolsheviks and commissars&quot; for their opponents) and with the later terms &quot;People&#x27;s Commissar&quot; (or &quot;narkom&quot;) for government ministers and &quot;political commissar&quot; in the military.

==Variants==

===People&#x27;s Commissar===

A People&#x27;s Commissar (informally abbreviated &quot;narkom&quot;) was a government official serving in a Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. This title was first used by the Russian SFSR (out of dislike for the tsarist and bourgeois term &quot;minister&quot;) and then copied among the many Soviet and Bolshevik-controlled states in the Russian Civil War.

The government departments headed by a People&#x27;s Commissar were called &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat&quot; (informally abbreviated narkomat).

People&#x27;s Commissars and People&#x27;s Commissariats were renamed Ministers and Ministries in 1946 by a decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

===Political commissar===

In the Red Army, a political commissar was a high-ranking functionary at a military headquarters who held coequal rank and authority with the military commander of the unit. The Bolshevik Party established political commissars in 1918 to control and improve morale in the military forces. Commissars were in charge of communist political propaganda and indoctrinating the public with communist ideology. From 1917 the Bolshevik administration, like the Provisional Government before it, relied on experienced (ex-Tsarist) army-officers whose loyalty it distrusted. Trotsky summarised the solution to the issue: &quot;We took a military specialist and we put on his right hand and on his left a commissar [...].&quot; 
During the early stages of the usage of commissars, no military order might be issued which did not have the prior approval of both the commander and the commissar.

Many lower-level political officers never received the same military training as commanding officers. Prior to becoming a commissar an individual had to be registered as a communist for a minimum of three years and had to attend specific political institutions, many of which never offered any military-oriented training.

Following the problems encountered in 1941 with dual commanders in units, commissars and other political officers were removed from direct command-roles. Political officers were then more directly tasked with morale- and regulation-based goals. A political officer&#x27;s classification changed to the form of a &quot;Deputy for Political Matters&quot; in 1942. The specific position of &quot;Commissar&quot; itself survived only at regimental and front levels, where the Commissars formed the Military Councils with their corresponding military commanders.

Other Communist-bloc militaries also adopted systems of using political commissars. Mulvenon and Yang (2002) report that the role of the political commissar in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) of China has become one resembling that of an HR specialist.

===Military commissar===
The voenkom (), translated as war commissar, is the head of a military commissariat — a regional office that conscripts men for military service, executes plans for military mobilization and maintains records on military reserves.

===NKVD===
Until the late 1930s, the People&#x27;s Militsiya and Internal Troops of the NKVD had no personal ranks, and used many various position-ranks instead. In 1935, the Militsiya created a special system of personal ranks that was a blend of standard military ranks and position-ranks; this system was largely reused by the newly created Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) in their rank structure, although they had Commissar-style ranks for top officers in place of Militsiya-style &quot;inspector&quot; and &quot;director&quot;.

From 1943, the Militsiya switched to a new rank system and insignia introduced in the Soviet Army. Instead of General ranks, top officers used &quot;Commissar of Militsiya&quot; 3rd, 2nd, and 1st rank, even though they used army-standard Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General shoulder boards. These Commissar ranks were replaced by corresponding General ranks in 1975.

The GUGB also switched to military-style ranks and insignia in 1945, although they replaced Commissar-style ranks with General officer ranks right away.

==Similar terms==
Commissar is linked to titles in a variety of languages, such as commissary in English, &quot;commissaire&quot; in French, &quot;Kommissar&quot; in German, and komisszár (or népbiztos; archaic: csendbiztos) in Hungarian.

The term &quot;commissary&quot; was used by the British and U.S. military to denote an officer in charge of supplying an army with provisions and equipment (and Commissariat).

A similar term in French describes the equivalent of the rank of Major both in the army of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; and the French Revolution. Such officials were not military officers but reported back to the political authorities: the king and the National Assembly (French Revolution), respectively.

Various historical German states have used an equivalent title, Reichskommissar (a compound of &quot;Reich&quot; and the German &quot;Kommissar&quot;), for several administrators who held responsibility over a territory or area of government.

<doc id="488623" wikidata="Q1215887" url="?curid=488623" title="Dr. Phibes Rises Again">
<text>Dr. Phibes Rises Again! is a 1972 British comedy horror film, produced by Louis M. Heyward, directed by Robert Fuest, and starring Vincent Price and Robert Quarry. The film is a sequel to &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971). After seeking vengeance on the doctors whom he blamed for his wife&#x27;s death in the first film, Phibes returns to seek eternal life in Egypt, while he pursues a centuries-old man who holds the ancient secrets that Phibes needs.

==Plot==
Three years after the events of the previous film, Dr Anton Phibes emerges from suspended animation when the Moon enters into an alignment with the planets, the first such occasion after 2,000 years. Phibes prepares to take Victoria&#x27;s body to the River of Life in Egypt, which promises eternal life for him and Victoria. However, his ancient papyrus map to the river has been stolen by Darius Biederbeck, a man who has lived for centuries through the regular use of a special elixir. After translating the papyrus, Biederbeck seeks the River of Life for himself and his lover Diana.

Phibes and his silent assistant, Vulnavia, enter Biederbeck&#x27;s house, kill his manservant and reclaim the papyrus; they leave for Southampton to take a ship to Egypt. Biederbeck travels on the same ship with Diana and his assistant, Ambrose. When Ambrose discovers Victoria&#x27;s body stored in the hold, Phibes kills him. His body is stuffed in a giant bottle and thrown overboard. Inspector Trout discovers the corpse when the bottle washes ashore near Southampton. He and Superintendent Waverley question shipping agent Lombardo; upon hearing the descriptions of Vulnavia, an organ and a clockwork band all being loaded aboard, they realize that Phibes is responsible.

Trout and Waverley pursue Phibes to Egypt, catching up to Biederbeck&#x27;s archaeological party near the mountain housing the hidden temple containing the River of Life. Phibes, having set up residence inside the temple, hides Victoria&#x27;s body in a secret compartment of an empty sarcophagus. He also finds the silver key that opens the gates to the River of Life. Phibes begins killing Biederbeck&#x27;s men one by one. Biederbeck&#x27;s team breaks into the temple and takes the sarcophagus and the key; Biederbeck takes the key for himself. Phibes uses a giant screw press to crush the man guarding the sarcophagus and a giant fan to simulate a windstorm, muffling his screams. The sarcophagus is retrieved.

Biederbeck is unmoved by the murders and insists on continuing. He sends Diana and Professor Hackett, the last remaining team member, back to England. Hackett is lured from his truck by Phibes&#x27; clockwork men impersonating British troops. When he returns to the truck, Diana is gone and he is sandblasted to death. His truck crashes into Biederbeck&#x27;s tent.

Realizing Phibes must have taken Diana, Biederbeck confronts him in the temple. Phibes demands the key in exchange for Diana&#x27;s life, claiming that when the gate is opened the water will drain out of Diana&#x27;s trap and flow through the gate. Unable to free her from Phibes&#x27; water trap, Biederbeck surrenders the key. Phibes unlocks the gate to the River of Life, boats Victoria&#x27;s coffin through it and summons Vulnavia to join them on the other side. Biederbeck returns to the gate as it closes, pleading through the bars for Phibes to take him along. Phibes ignores him. Diana attempts to comfort Biederbeck, but he rapidly ages and dies.

==Cast==
==Production==
Producer Heyward brought in Robert Blees to co-write the film. He felt Blees&#x27; sense of humor would serve a &quot;Phibes&quot; script well. According to Heyward, Blees and co-writer Robert Fuest, who also directed the film, had frequent disagreements about the script, forcing Heyward to mediate. Heyward said of the two writers&#x27; conflicts: &quot;They were two men with great senses of integrity, but one protecting director&#x27;s viewpoint and the other protecting writer&#x27;s viewpoint.&quot;

American International Pictures (AIP) was grooming Robert Quarry as Vincent Price&#x27;s replacement. It was rumoured that the two actors did not get on well, but Heyward said he did not notice any rift between them on the set. Quarry subsequently said that the studio had told him privately that he would replace Price when Price&#x27;s contract ran out. According to Quarry, AIP had become disenchanted with Price, whose salary continued to rise despite his films&#x27; disappointing box office performance. In addition, Price was not particularly interested in working with the studio. AIP&#x27;s plans were revealed to Price at a publicity event in England, when a publicist asked him how he felt about being replaced by Quarry. Quarry went on to say that while there was tension between him and Price on the set, it did not affect the production of the film. On the contrary, Quarry characterized the experience as &quot;extremely pleasant. Our sense of humor was the one bond that made working with him a pleasure.&quot;

Director Robert Fuest, production designer Brian Eatwell (creator of the film&#x27;s noted Art Deco settings), and composer John Gale all remained from &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; team. Price, Peter Jeffrey, and John Cater reprised their roles from &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;. Hugh Griffith and Terry-Thomas also appeared in both films, but played different characters. Caroline Munro appeared in both films as Victoria, Phibes&#x27; late wife, but in both films her role was limited to lying silently in a glass coffin. It was originally planned for Phibes to have a new assistant in the sequel, but the studio insisted that Vulnavia be retained, despite the fact that the character dies in the first &quot;Phibes&quot; film, and despite the unavailability of original Vulnavia actress Virginia North, who was pregnant at the time. Valli Kemp was cast as a replacement.

Although the film&#x27;s budget was slightly higher than that of &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;, several elements of the original script had to be cut for budgetary reasons; for example, the pyramid was originally planned to have several levels of traps and be overrun with boiling oil at the end. The desert scenes were shot in Ibiza, Spain.

==Release==
The film&#x27;s U.S. release was slightly edited, cutting a few seconds each from some of the murder scenes in order to remove the most gruesome parts and allow the film to be released with a PG rating.

AIP solicited scripts for a third &quot;Phibes&quot; film, but Heyward said the studio never found one suitable. Proposed titles included &quot;Phibes Resurrectus&quot;, &quot;The Brides of Dr. Phibes&quot;, and &quot;The Seven Fates of Dr. Phibes&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Vincent Price &quot;delivers one of his priceless theatric performances&quot; and that producer Louis M. Heyward had &quot;lined up a first-rate crew of technical assistants&quot;.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one star, criticizing the &quot;cheapness of the production&quot; and the &quot;unmotivated, mostly unimaginative&quot; violence.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Those who enjoyed the campy horror of last year&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Phibes&quot; are in for a keen disappointment&quot; and called the script &quot;astonishingly slapdash&quot;.

Philip Strick of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s refreshing to find a sequel that&#x27;s better than its prototype. The return of the abominable Phibes, his pallor flushed with the success of his initial screen appearance, is accompanied both by a larger budget and, more to the point, by a greater display of confidence at all levels of the production&quot;.

At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 59% of 22 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.9/10. In &quot;Horror Movies of the 1970s&quot;, writer John Kenneth Muir described the film as &quot;no better or worse than its predecessor&quot;.

In &quot;The Penguin Encyclopaedia of Horror and the Supernatural&quot; Kim Newman wrote: &quot;&quot;Dr Phibes Rises Again&quot; lacks the gleeful insanity of the first film, but is far more achieved&quot;.

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing: &quot;Vincent Price returns as the ingenious doctor, now in Egypt searching for the elixir of life, but continuing to outwit enemies with macabre murders, each grislier and funnier than the last. While it&#x27;s not as splendid as &quot;The Abominable Dr Phibes&quot;, this sequel is mounted with lavish care by Robert Fuest, director of several classic episodes of The Avengers, and still scores high in the squirm and chuckle departments, thanks to Price&#x27;s perfect timing and grandiose camp relish.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The film score by John Gale was released on Perseverance Records (PRD 002) on 20 March 2003.

<text>The Isle of Bute (; or &#x27;), known asBute (), is an island in the Firth of Clyde in Scotland, United Kingdom. It is divided into highland and lowland areas by the Highland Boundary Fault.

Formerly a constituent island of the larger County of Bute, it is now part of the council area of Argyll and Bute. Bute&#x27;s resident population was 6,498 in 2011, a decline of just over 10% from the figure of 7,228 recorded in 2001 against a background of Scottish island populations as a whole growing by 4% to 103,702 for the same period.
==Name==
The name &quot;Bute&quot; is of uncertain origin. Watson and Mac an Tàilleir support a derivation from Old Irish &#x27; (&quot;fire&quot;), perhaps in reference to signal fires. This reference to beacon fires may date from the Viking period, when the island was probably known to the Norse as &#x27;. Other possible derivations include Brittonic &quot;budh&quot; (&quot;corn&quot;), &quot;victory&quot;, , or &quot;&quot;, his monastic cell. There is no likely derivation from Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Ebudae&quot;.

The island was also known during the Viking era as Rothesay, possibly referring to the personal name Roth or Roderick and the Old Norse suffix &#x27; (&quot;island&quot;). This name was eventually taken by the main town on the island, whose Gaelic name is &#x27; (&quot;town of Bute&quot;).

==Geography==

 Bute lies in the Firth of Clyde. The only town on the island, Rothesay, () is linked by ferry to the mainland. To its north is the coastal village of Port Bannatyne; hamlets on the island include Ascog, Kilchattan Bay, and Kingarth.

The interior of the island is hilly, though not mountainous, with conifer plantations and some uncultivated land, particularly in the north. The highest point is Windy Hill at . The centre of the island contains most of the cultivated land, while the island&#x27;s most rugged terrain is found in the far south around Glen Callum. Loch Fad is Bute&#x27;s largest body of freshwater and runs along the fault line.

The western side of Bute is known for its beaches, many of which enjoy fine views over the Sound of Bute towards Arran and Bute&#x27;s smaller satellite island Inchmarnock. Hamlets on the western side of the island include Straad, around St. Ninian&#x27;s Bay, and Kildavanan on Ettrick Bay.

In the north, Bute is separated from the Cowal peninsula by the Kyles of Bute. The northern part of the island is more sparsely populated, and the ferry terminal at Rhubodach connects the island to the mainland at Colintraive by the smaller of the island&#x27;s two ferries. The crossing is one of the shortest, less than , and takes only a few minutes but is busy because many tourists prefer the scenic route to the island.

North Bute forms part of the Kyles of Bute National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

==Geology==
Bute straddles the divide between highland and lowland Scotland with the Highland Boundary Fault cutting NNE-SSW through the island between Rothesay Bay and Scalpsie Bay. To the north of this line are metamorphosed sandstones and mudstones (i.e. psammites and pelites) which constitute the Southern Highland Group of the Dalradian. To its south are the conglomerates, sandstones, mudstones and siltstones of the Devonian age Stratheden Group (a division of the Old Red Sandstone) and of the Carboniferous age Inverclyde Group. Associated with the latter are Carboniferous extrusive igneous rocks, mainly lavas and tuffs of the Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation. These occur north of Ascog, northeast of Scalpsie, and south of Kilchattan Bay.

The metamorphic rocks of the Dalradian sequence are divided locally into a couple of groups, themselves subdivided into formations, each of which contains &#x27;members&#x27;. The youngest strata are at the top of the list:
*Trossachs Group
**Ardscalpsie Formation
***Quien Hill Grit Member
***Loch Dhu Slate Member (includes &#x27;Rothesay Limestone&#x27;)
*Southern Highland Group
**St Ninian Formation
***Toward Quay Grit Member
***Bullrock Greywacke Member
**Dunoon Phyllite Formation

The Palaeozoic sedimentary and extrusive igneous sequence in stratigraphic order (i.e. youngest at top) is as follows. All are of Carboniferous age except the Bute Conglomerate, which is late Devonian and separated from the overlying Kinnesswood sandstones and mudstones by an unconformity.
*Strathclyde Group
**Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation
**Birgidale Mudstone Formation
*Inverclyde Group
**Clyde Sandstone Formation
**Ballagan Formation
**Kinnesswood Formation
*Stratheden Group
**Bute Conglomerate Formation

A couple of thin coal seams are recorded within the volcanic sequence inland of Ascog.

The centre of the island is cut by a couple of east–west trending late Carboniferous dykes of quartz-microgabbro and the whole island by a much more numerous swarm of Palaeogene age microgabbro dykes aligned NNW-SSE in the north but also WSW-ESE and NNE-SSW in the south. sills and other intrusive bodies are present in the extreme south.

Raised beaches are present around most of Bute&#x27;s coastline, lying around 8m above current sea levels. Higher marine platforms with partial cover of sand and gravel are recognised further inland, dating from earlier parts of the Devensian ice age. Till derived from the ice age is widespread inland while isolated peat deposits particularly in the north. Alluvium floors numerous stream valleys. Small areas of blown sand are to be found landward of some sandy bays.

==History==
===Neolithic Era===
Evidence of early occupation exists in the form of cairns at the north end of the isle, such as the long cairn or Cairnbaan and the white cairn at Lenihuline Wood. Other prehistoric structures are to be found such as a fort complex at Dunagoil. The Kingarth sun circle is estimated to be around 3000 years old.

A well known artifact is the Queen of the Inch necklace, which is an article of jewellery made of jet found in a cist that dates from circa 2000 BC.

===Dal Riata Era===
Bute was absorbed into the &quot;Cenél Comgaill&quot; of Dál Riata and colonised by Gaelic peoples. Saint Maccai (died 460) was said to have founded a monastery on the island.Other well known Gaelic missionaries associated with the island of the 5th and 6th centuries include Cathan whilst the Irish Text &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot; makes a reference to Blane, the Bishop of Kingarth on Bute, &quot;in Gall-Ghàidheil&quot;.

The island subsequently fell under Norse control and formed part of the Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by the Crovan dynasty.

===Kingdom of the Isles===
However, in the 12th century, the island, along with Arran, was granted by David I to Somerled, Lord of Argyll, Kintyre and Lorne. At about the turn of the 13th century, Bute appears to have come into possession of the family of the Steward of Scotland, during a time of internal strife amongst Somerled&#x27;s descendants.

During the 13th century, Bute was the target of two Norwegian attempts to reassert authority in the Isles. For instance, Rothesay Castle fell to a Norwegian-backed King of the Isles in 1230, and fell again to the Norwegians in 1263. In 1266, the Norwegian king, Magnus VI, ceded the Kingdom of the Isles to the Scottish king, Alexander III, in return for a very large sum of money, by the Treaty of Perth. Alexander Stewart of Dundonald had been the chief military commander of Scottish forces at the Battle of Largs, and was now rewarded by King Alexander III by being confirmed in possession of Bute and Arran.

===Under Scottish rule===
In 1549, Dean Monro wrote of &quot;Buitt&quot; that it was:

very fertyle ground, namelie for aitts, with twa strenthes; the ane is the round castle of Buitt, callit Rosay of the auld, and Borrowstone about it callit Buitt. Before the town and castle is ane bay of sea, quhilk is a gude heavin for ships to ly upon ankers. That uther castle is callit the castle of Kames, quhilk Kames in Erishe is alsmeikle as to say in English the bay Castle. In this ile ther is twa paroche kirks, that ane southe callit the kirk of Bride, the uther northe in the Borrowstone of Buitt, with twa chappells, ane of them above the towne of Buitt, the uther under the forsaid castle of Kames.

Under Scottish Rule, Bute and Arran were governed as a unit, the shrievalty aligning with the comital jurisdiction. The latter merged into the crown, as a result of Alexander Stewart&#x27;s great-grandson, Robert, inheriting the throne via his mother. A corresponding title, Duke of Rothesay was created by Robert&#x27;s son for the heir apparent, without landlordship of the land. Robert had already granted the sheriffdom to his bastard son, heritably; consequently, in the early 18th century, the latter&#x27;s senior descendant acquired the (non-comital) title &quot;Earl of Bute&quot;.

During the seventeenth century, there were accusations of witchcraft: in 1630 an unknown number of women confessed to the crime and were confined in the dungeon at Rothesay Castle, left without food or water, and died from starvation. Other instances are recorded but the most fervent activity occurred during the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–62 when at least four Bute witches were executed; one woman who was convicted at that time escaped but the sentence was enacted when she returned to the island in 1673.

When the comital powers were abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746 and counties formally created, on shrieval boundaries, by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, Bute and Arran became the County of Bute. Later reforms merged Bute, without Arran, into the wider region of Argyll and Bute.

===World War II===
Bute played a major role during World War II, and its naval involvements were especially significant. HMS &quot;Cyclops&quot; was the depot ship for the 7th Submarine Flotilla and was home-based in Rothesay Bay. A few miles further north at Port Bannatyne, the luxury 88-bedroom Kyles Hydro Hotel overlooking the Port, was requisitioned by the Admiralty to serve as the HQ for midget submarine (X-craft) operations. In particular, it was from here (hotel renamed HMS Varbel) that the top secret and audacious attack on the Tirpitz was masterminded.

Much of the training of X-craft submariners was undertaken in the waters around Bute, and especially in the secluded waters of Loch Striven to the north of Port Bannatyne. Bute at War. Bute accommodated many officers and NCOs of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. Officially a military camp, it was unofficially thought of as a prison for Władysław Sikorski&#x27;s political enemies.

===21st century===
On 2 July 2018, the island was shocked by the murder and rape of 6-year-old girl Alesha MacPhail after she was taken from her bed by a 16-year-old male. The 16-year-old, Aaron Campbell, was caught, charged and convicted, and given a life sentence.

Several major wildfires started on 18–19 April 2019 in the north of the island, involving a substantial area of moorland and conifer plantation.

==Transport==
Bute is connected with the Scottish mainland by two Caledonian MacBrayne ferries:
*Rothesay to Wemyss Bay
*Rhubodach to Colintraive

During summer, the paddle steamer &quot;Waverley&quot; calls at Rothesay on regular cruises.

There is a regular bus service along the eastern coast road, and a daily service connecting the island with Argyll and the western Highlands and Islands. Many independent holidaymakers use the island as a stepping stone from Glasgow and Ayrshire to western Scotland using this route. In summer an open-top bus tours the island leaving from Guildford Square by the ferry at 1030, 1200, 1430, and 1600.

The main ferry to the island leaves from Wemyss Bay, a village on the A78, the coast road between Glasgow and Ayr. Wemyss Bay is connected with trains running to Glasgow Central station. On the same line is Paisley Gilmor Street which has easy walking access to Glasgow Airport.

There is an ad hoc link between Glasgow Pacific Quay and Port Bannatyne Marina by Loch Lomond Seaplanes, which has a journey time of 17 minutes.

There is also another route, which runs from Loch Fad to Loch Lomond; however, this has not been set into action. The route is also run by Loch Lomond Seaplanes.

==Education==
The island has one secondary school, Rothesay Academy, which moved to a new modern joint campus with Rothesay Primary in 2007. The largest of the island&#x27;s three primary schools is Rothesay Primary. The smallest school (with roughly 50 pupils) is North Bute Primary in Port Bannatyne. The third primary school, St Andrews Primary, is a Catholic School aligned with St Andrew&#x27;s Church, the only Catholic Church on the predominantly Protestant island.

==Sport==
Bute has many sports clubs and activities available. There are three golf courses: Rothesay Golf Club, Kingarth Golf Club and Port Bannatyne Golf Club. The most successful sporting club on the island is Bute Shinty Club who play at the highest level of shinty (the Marine Harvest Premier League).

In 2006, Bute won promotion to the Premier League by winning the South Division One. Bute also won the Ballimore Cup and were runners-up in the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup in 2006. The local amateur football team are known as the Brandanes, and the junior team are the Brandane Bulls. Bute also has facilities for fishing, rugby, tennis, bowls, and cricket. Pétanque is played at Port Bannatyne; boules may be hired from the Post Office there.

The centre for sailing on Bute is at Port Bannatyne with two boatyards and the new marina, and a club which organises private moorings in these particularly protected waters of Kames Bay. There is Bute Sailing School with its own yacht.

There is a Kayak and SUP hire centre operating from the Old Quay in Kilchattan Bay during the summer holidays.

==Economy==
The Mount Stuart Trust owns on the island: , the trust was wholly controlled by five members of the Marquess of Bute&#x27;s family, plus an accountant and lawyer, none of whom lived on Bute. , all 12 of the trust&#x27;s directors had addresses outside the island.

Farming and tourism are the main industries on the island, along with fishing and forestry. Privately owned businesses include Port Bannatyne Marina and Boat Yard, the Ardmaleish Boatbuilding Company and Bute Fabrics Ltd (an international weaver of contemporary woollen fabrics for upholstery and vertical applications).

In December 2015, Bute became home to about 100 Syrians, making the island one of the largest recipients of these refugees in the UK relative to its population. Argyll and Bute council stated that the island was chosen as a suitable location because it had &quot;available social housing&quot; and is &quot;closer to the central belt&quot; for medical support. These newcomers have started up highly successful shops.

In 2019, &quot;The Buteman&quot;, the island&#x27;s weekly newspaper, closed after 165 years, due to a fall in readership. This was replaced by the &quot;Isle of Bute News&quot;, run by the &quot;Dunoon Observer&quot;.

==Attractions==
=== Architectural attractions ===
The island has a ruined 12th-century chapel called St Blane&#x27;s chapel which stands on a site associated with Saint Catan and Saint Blane, who was born on Bute. Another ruined chapel, dating from the 6th century, lies at St Ninian&#x27;s Point.

The eccentric Mount Stuart House is often cited as one of the world&#x27;s most impressive neo-Gothic mansions, bringing many architectural students from Glasgow on day trips. The third Marquess had a passion for art, astrology, mysticism, and religion, and the house reflects this in the architecture, furnishings, and art collection. There is a marble chapel, much stained glass, and walls of paintings. The house is open at Easter and from May to October. There are gardens with plants imported from many parts of the world and a visitor centre. The gardens host a number of events throughout the year starting with an Easter Parade.

In 2003 the fashion designer Stella McCartney married in the chapel, generating intense media interest. Activities and workshops are often held there in the summer by a local organisation that provides after-school clubs and activities in the school holidays; there is also a farmers&#x27; market and a Christmas market held in the house and in the visitor centre. In 2016, a previously uncatalogued copy of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio was authenticated in the Mount Stuart House library.

The Pavilion is a 1930s edifice housing a concert hall, workshops and café, and is noted for its architecture. It was little changed from when it was built in 1938. Renovation of the building was halted in 2021 following the administration of the main contractor during the 2020 pandemic. Work restarted in May 2023, with the first stage works expected to be competed in August 2024. It is anticipated that restoration will be complete by January 2026.

Rothesay Castle was built 800 years ago by the hereditary High Steward of Scotland.

Ascog Hall Fernery and Gardens are a renovated Victorian residence and glass house containing shrubs and plants from all over the Empire, including a fern believed to be over 1,000 years old.

The Old Post Office, now used only for sorting mail, is a historic working post office (open mornings only) that houses artefacts of the early post, some from before the advent of the postage stamp.

=== Tourist locations ===
Loch Fad is a deep freshwater loch stocked with pike and brown trout, and is available to visiting tourist fishermen. Boats are available to hire.

Scalpsie Bay has a colony of over 200 seals on its beach, which can only be reached on foot across the fields. The island also has many herds of deer, rich bird life and some large hares. Wild goats with large curled horns may be seen in the north of the island.

Port Bannatyne, a village towards the north of the island, is the centre for sailing and sea-fishing on the island. It has two boatyards and a marina for 200 vessels. Langoustines are fished with creels anchored in the bay. X-Class midget submarines were stationed in Kames Bay during World War II and there is a memorial to World War II dead. Port Bannatyne Golf Club is known for scenic views from the course.

The road from Port Bannatyne goes along the shore of the Kyles of Bute to the small ferry to Colintraive on the Argyll mainland.

=== Rothesay ===
The 1920s Winter Gardens (now the &quot;Discovery Centre&quot;) close to the Rothesay Pier houses a small cinema and tourist information office. Nearby are the Victorian toilets.

There are a variety of music, folk, and poetry festivals, as well as walking trails and new cycling routes.

=== Heritage ===
There are some remote Bronze Age stone circles, an Iron Age fortified village, and early Christian remains (including St. Blane&#x27;s Chapel). The Bute Museum of the island&#x27;s history is situated behind Rothesay Castle.

=== Walks ===
The West Island Way is a waymarked long distance footpath that opened in September 2000 as part of Bute&#x27;s millennium celebrations, and was the first waymarked long-distance route on a Scottish island. It is in length, running between Kilchattan Bay in the south of the island and Port Bannatyne in the north, with Rothesay as a central point.
