<text>In the history of the United States, carpetbagger is a largely historical pejorative used by Southerners to describe allegedly opportunistic or disruptive Northerners who came to the Southern states after the American Civil War and were perceived to be exploiting the local populace for their own financial, political, or social gain. The term broadly included both individuals who sought to promote Republican politics (including the right of African Americans to vote and hold office) and individuals who saw business and political opportunities because of the chaotic state of the local economies following the war. In practice, the term carpetbagger often was applied to any Northerners who were present in the South during the Reconstruction Era (1865–1877). The word is closely associated with scalawag, a similarly pejorative word used to describe native white Southerners who supported the Republican Party-led Reconstruction.

White Southerners commonly denounced carpetbaggers collectively during the post-war years, fearing they would loot and plunder the defeated South and be allied politically with the Radical Republicans. Sixty men from the North, including educated free blacks and slaves who had escaped to the North and returned South after the war, were elected from the South as Republicans to Congress. The majority of Republican governors in the South during Reconstruction were from the North.

Since the end of the Reconstruction era, the term has been used to denote people who move into a new area for purely economic or political reasons despite not having ties to that place.

==Etymology and definition==
The term carpetbagger, used exclusively as a pejorative term, originated from the carpet bag, a form of cheap luggage, made from carpet fabric, which many of the newcomers carried. The term came to be associated with opportunism and exploitation by outsiders. It is now used in the United States to refer to a parachute candidate, that is, an outsider who runs for public office in an area without having lived there for more than a short time, or without having other significant community ties.

According to a 1912 book by Oliver Temple Perry, Tennessee Secretary of State and Radical Republican Andrew J. Fletcher &quot;was one of the first, if not the very first, in the State to denounce the hordes of greedy office-seekers who came from the North in the rear of the army in the closing days of the [U.S. Civil] War&quot;, in the June 1867 stump speech that he delivered across Tennessee in support of the re-election of the disabled Tennessee Governor William G. Brownlow:

That was the origin of the term &quot;carpet bag&quot;, and out of it grew the well known term &quot;carpet-bag government&quot;.

In the United Kingdom at the end of the 20th century, carpetbagger developed another meaning, referring to people who joined a mutual organization, such as a building society, in order to force it to demutualize, that is, to convert into a joint stock company, seeking personal financial gain by that means.

==Background==
The Republican Party in the South comprised three groups after the Civil War, and white Democratic Southerners referred to two in derogatory terms. Scalawags were white Southerners who supported the Republican party, &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; were recent arrivals in the region from the North, and freedmen were freed slaves.

Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the South were edited by scalawags and 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers. White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.

Historian Eric Foner argues:
===Reforming impulse===
Beginning in 1862, Northern abolitionists moved to areas in the South that had fallen under Union control. Schoolteachers and religious missionaries went to the South to teach the freedmen; some were sponsored by northern churches. Some were abolitionists who sought to continue the struggle for racial equality; they often became agents of the federal Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, which started operations in 1865 to assist the vast numbers of recently emancipated slaves. The bureau established schools in rural areas of the South for the purpose of educating the mostly illiterate Black and Poor White population. Other Northerners who moved to the South did so to participate in the profitable business of rebuilding railroads and various other forms of infrastructure that had been destroyed during the war.

During the time most blacks were enslaved, many were prohibited from being educated and attaining literacy. Southern states had no public school systems, and upper-class white Southerners either sent their children to private schools (including in England) or hired private tutors. After the war, hundreds of Northern white women moved South, many to teach the newly freed African-American children. They joined like-minded Southerners, most of which were employed by the Methodist and Baptist Churches, who spent much of their time teaching and preaching to slave and freedpeople congregations both before and after the Civil War.

===Economic motives===

Carpetbaggers also established banks and retail businesses. Most were former Union soldiers eager to invest their savings and energy in this promising new frontier, and civilians lured south by press reports of &quot;the fabulous sums of money to be made in the South in raising cotton.&quot; Foner notes that &quot;joined with the quest for profit, however, was a reforming spirit, a vision of themselves as agents of sectional reconciliation and the South&#x27;s &quot;economic regeneration.&quot; Accustomed to viewing Southerners—black and white—as devoid of economic initiative, the &quot;Puritan work ethic&quot;, and self-discipline, they believed that only &quot;Northern capital and energy&quot; could bring &quot;the blessings of a free labor system to the region.&quot;

Carpetbaggers tended to be well educated and middle class in origin. Some had been lawyers, businessmen, and newspaper editors. The majority (including 52 of the 60 who served in Congress during Reconstruction) were veterans of the Union Army.

Leading &quot;black carpetbaggers&quot; believed that the interests of capital and labor were identical and that the freedmen were entitled to little more than an &quot;honest chance in the race of life.&quot;

Many Northern and Southern Republicans shared a modernizing vision of upgrading the Southern economy and society, one that would replace the inefficient Southern plantation regime with railroads, factories, and more efficient farming. They actively promoted public schooling and created numerous colleges and universities. The Northerners were especially successful in taking control of Southern railroads, aided by state legislatures. In 1870, Northerners controlled 21% of the South&#x27;s railroads (by mileage); 19% of the directors were from the North. By 1890, they controlled 88% of the mileage; 47% of the directors were from the North.

== Prominent examples in state politics==
===Mississippi===
Union General Adelbert Ames, a native of Maine, was appointed military governor and later was elected as Republican governor of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era. Ames tried unsuccessfully to ensure equal rights for black Mississippians. His political battles with the Southerners and African Americans ripped apart his party.

The &quot;Black and Tan&quot; (biracial) constitutional convention in Mississippi in 1868 included 30 white Southerners, 17 Southern freedmen and 24 non-southerners, nearly all of whom were veterans of the Union Army. They included four men who had lived in the South before the war, two of whom had served in the Confederate States Army. Among the more prominent were Gen. Beroth B. Eggleston, a native of New York; Col. A.T. Morgan, of the Second Wisconsin Volunteers; Gen. W.S. Barry, former commander of a Colored regiment raised in Kentucky; an Illinois general and lawyer who graduated from Knox College; Maj. W.H. Gibbs, of the Fifteenth Illinois infantry; Judge W. B. Cunningham, of Pennsylvania; and Cap. E.J. Castello, of the Seventh Missouri infantry. They were among the founders of the Republican party in Mississippi.

They were prominent in the politics of the state until 1875, but nearly all left Mississippi in 1875 to 1876 under pressure from the Red Shirts and White Liners. These white paramilitary organizations, described as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party&quot;, worked openly to violently overthrow Republican rule, using intimidation and assassination to turn Republicans out of office and suppress freedmen&#x27;s voting. Mississippi Representative Wiley P. Harris, a Democrat, stated in 1875:
If any two hundred Southern men backed by a Federal administration should go to Indianapolis, turn out the Indiana people, take possession of all the seats of power, honor, and profit, denounce the people at large as assassins and barbarians, introduce corruption in all the branches of the public administration, make government a curse instead of a blessing, league with the most ignorant class of society to make war on the enlightened, intelligent, and virtuous, what kind of social relations would such a state of things beget.

Albert T. Morgan, the Republican sheriff of Yazoo, Mississippi, received a brief flurry of national attention when insurgent white Democrats took over the county government and forced him to flee. He later wrote &quot;Yazoo; Or, on the Picket Line of Freedom in the South&quot; (1884).

On November 6, 1875, Hiram Revels, a Mississippi Republican and the first African American U.S. Senator, wrote a letter to U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant that was widely reprinted. Revels denounced Ames and Northerners for manipulating the Black vote for personal benefit, and for keeping alive wartime hatreds:

Elza Jeffords, a lawyer from Portsmouth, Ohio who fought with the Army of the Tennessee, remained in Mississippi after the conclusion of the Civil War. He was the last Republican to represent that state in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1883 to 1885. He died in Vicksburg, Mississippi 16 days after he left Congress. The next Republican congressman from the state was not elected until 80 years later in 1964: Prentiss Walker of Mize, Mississippi, who served a single term from 1965 to 1967.

===North Carolina===
Corruption was a charge made by Democrats in North Carolina against the Republicans, notes the historian Paul Escott, &quot;because its truth was apparent.&quot; The historians Eric Foner and W.E.B. Du Bois have noted that Democrats as well as Republicans received bribes and participated in decisions about the railroads. General Milton S. Littlefield was dubbed the &quot;Prince of Carpetbaggers&quot;, and bought votes in the legislature &quot;to support grandiose and fraudulent railroad schemes&quot;. Escott concludes that some Democrats were involved, but Republicans &quot;bore the main responsibility for the issue of $28 million in state bonds for railroads and the accompanying corruption. This sum, enormous for the time, aroused great concern.&quot; Foner says Littlefield disbursed $200,000 (bribes) to win support in the legislature for state money for his railroads, and Democrats as well as Republicans were guilty of taking the bribes and making the decisions on the railroad. North Carolina Democrats condemned the legislature&#x27;s &quot;depraved villains, who take bribes every day&quot;; one local Republican officeholder complained, &quot;I deeply regret the course of some of our friends in the Legislature as well as out of it in regard to financial matters, it is very embarrassing indeed.&quot;

Escott notes that extravagance and corruption increased taxes and the costs of government in a state that had always favored low expenditure. The context was that a planter elite kept taxes low because it benefited them. They used their money toward private ends rather than public investment. None of the states had established public school systems before the Reconstruction state legislatures created them, and they had systematically underinvested in infrastructure such as roads and railroads. Planters whose properties occupied prime riverfront locations relied on river transportation, but smaller farmers in the backcountry suffered.

Escott claimed &quot;Some money went to very worthy causes—the 1869 legislature, for example, passed a school law that began the rebuilding and expansion of the state&#x27;s public schools. But far too much was wrongly or unwisely spent&quot; to aid the Republican Party leadership. A Republican county commissioner in Alamance eloquently denounced the situation: &quot;Men are placed in power who instead of carrying out their duties...form a kind of school for to graduate Rascals. Yes if you will give them a few Dollars they will liern you for an accomplished Rascal. This is in reference to the taxes that are rung from the labouring class of people. Without a speedy reformation I will have to resign my post.&quot;

Albion W. Tourgée, formerly of Ohio and a friend of President James A. Garfield, moved to North Carolina, where he practiced as a lawyer and was appointed a judge. He once opined that &quot;Jesus Christ was a carpetbagger.&quot; Tourgée later wrote &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot;, a largely autobiographical novel about an idealistic carpetbagger persecuted by the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina.

===South Carolina===
A politician in South Carolina who was called a carpetbagger was Daniel Henry Chamberlain, a New Englander who had served as an officer of a predominantly black regiment of the United States Colored Troops. He was appointed South Carolina&#x27;s attorney general from 1868 to 1872 and elected Republican governor from 1874 to 1877. As a result of the national Compromise of 1877, Chamberlain lost his office. He was narrowly re-elected in a campaign marked by egregious voter fraud and violence against freedmen by Democratic Red Shirts, who succeeded in suppressing the black vote in some majority-black counties. While serving in South Carolina, Chamberlain was a strong supporter of Negro rights.

Some historians of the early 1800s, who belonged to the Dunning School that believed that the Reconstruction era was fatally flawed, claimed that Chamberlain later was influenced by Social Darwinism to become a white supremacist. They also wrote that he supported states&#x27; rights and laissez-faire in the economy. They portrayed &quot;liberty&quot; in 1896 as the right to rise above the rising tide of equality. Chamberlain was said to justify white supremacy by arguing that, in evolutionary terms, the Negro obviously belonged to an inferior social order.

Charles Woodward Stearns, also from Massachusetts, wrote an account of his experience in South Carolina: &quot;The Black Man of the South, and the Rebels: Or, the Characteristics of the Former and the Recent Outrages of the Latter&quot; (1873).

Francis Lewis Cardozo, a black minister from New Haven, Connecticut, served as a delegate to South Carolina&#x27;s 1868 Constitutional Convention. He made eloquent speeches advocating that the plantations be broken up and distributed among the freedmen. They wanted their own land to farm and believed they had already paid for land by their years of uncompensated labor and the trials of slavery.

===Louisiana===
Henry C. Warmoth was the Republican governor of Louisiana from 1868 to 1874. As governor, Warmoth was plagued by accusations of corruption, which continued to be a matter of controversy long after his death. He was accused of using his position as governor to trade in state bonds for his personal benefit. In addition, the newspaper company which he owned received a contract from the state government. Warmoth supported the franchise for freedmen.

Warmoth struggled to lead the state during the years when the White League, a white Democratic terrorist organization, conducted an open campaign of violence and intimidation against Republicans, including freedmen, with the goals of regaining Democratic power and white supremacy. They pushed Republicans from political positions, were responsible for the Coushatta Massacre, disrupted Republican organizing, and preceded elections with such intimidation and violence that black voting was sharply reduced. Warmoth stayed in Louisiana after Reconstruction, as white Democrats regained political control of the state. He died in 1931 at age 89.

George Luke Smith, a New Hampshire native, served briefly in the U.S. House from Louisiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district but was unseated in 1874 by the Democrat William M. Levy. He then left Shreveport for Hot Springs, Arkansas.

===Alabama===
George E. Spencer was a prominent Republican U.S. Senator. His 1872 reelection campaign in Alabama opened him to allegations of &quot;political betrayal of colleagues; manipulation of Federal patronage; embezzlement of public funds; purchase of votes; and intimidation of voters by the presence of Federal troops.&quot; He was a major speculator in a distressed financial paper.

===Georgia===
Tunis Campbell, a black New York businessman, was hired in 1863 by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to help former slaves in Port Royal, South Carolina. When the Civil War ended, Campbell was assigned to the Sea Islands of Georgia, where he engaged in an apparently successful land reform program for the benefit of the freedmen. He eventually became vice-chair of the Georgia Republican Party, a state senator and the head of an African-American militia which he hoped to use against the Ku Klux Klan.

===Arkansas===
The &quot;Brooks–Baxter War&quot; was a factional dispute, 1872–74 that culminated in an armed confrontation in 1874 between factions of the Arkansas Republican Party over the disputed 1872 election for governor. The victor in the end was the &quot;Minstrel&quot; faction led by carpetbagger Elisha Baxter over the &quot;Brindle Tail&quot; faction led by Joseph Brooks, which included most of the scalawags. The dispute weakened both factions and the entire Republican Party, enabling the sweeping Democratic victory in the 1874 state elections.

====William Furbush====
William Hines Furbush, born a mixed-race slave in Carroll County, Kentucky in 1839 received part of his education in Ohio. He migrated to Helena, Arkansas in 1862. After returning to Ohio in February 1865, he joined the Forty-second Colored Infantry.

After the war, Furbush migrated to Liberia through the American Colonization Society, where he continued to work as a photographer. He returned to Ohio after 18 months and moved back to Arkansas by 1870. Furbush was elected to two terms in the Arkansas House of Representatives, 1873–74 (from an African-American majority district in the Arkansas Delta, made up of Phillips and Monroe counties.) He served in 1879–80 from the newly established Lee County.

In 1873, the state passed a civil rights law. Furbush and three other black leaders, including the bill&#x27;s primary sponsor, state senator Richard A. Dawson, sued a barkeeper in Little Rock, Arkansas for refusing to serve their group. The suit resulted in the only successful Reconstruction prosecution under the state&#x27;s civil rights law. In the legislature, Furbush worked to create Lee County, Arkansasfrom portions of Phillips County, Crittenden County, Monroe County, and St. Francis County in eastern Arkansas, which had a black-majority population.

Following the end of his 1873 legislative term, Furbush was appointed as county sheriff by Republican Governor Elisha Baxter. Furbush twice won re-election as sheriff, serving from 1873 to 1878. During his term, he adopted a policy of &quot;fusion&quot;, a post-Reconstruction power-sharing compromise between Populist Democrats and Republicans. Furbush originally was elected as a Republican, but he switched to the Democratic Party at the end of his time as sheriff. Democrats held most of the economic power and cooperating with them could make his future.

In 1878, Furbush was elected again to the Arkansas House. His election is notable because he was elected as a black Democrat during a campaign season notorious for white intimidation of black and Republican voters in black-majority eastern Arkansas. He was the first-known black Democrat elected to the Arkansas General Assembly.

In March 1879, Furbush left Arkansas for Colorado. He returned to Arkansas in 1888, setting up practice as a lawyer. In 1889, he co-founded the African American newspaper &quot;National Democrat.&quot; He left the state in the 1890s after it disenfranchised black voters. Furbush died in Indiana in 1902 at a veterans&#x27; home.

===Texas===
Carpetbaggers were least numerous in Texas. Republicans controlled the state government from 1867 to January 1874. Only one state official and one justice of the state supreme court were Northerners. About 13% to 21% of district court judges were Northerners, along with about 10% of the delegates who wrote the Reconstruction constitution of 1869. Of the 142 men who served in the 12th Legislature, some 12 to 29 were from the North. At the county level, Northerners made up about 10% of the commissioners, county judges and sheriffs.

George Thompson Ruby, an African American from New York City, who grew up in Portland, Maine, worked as a teacher in New Orleans from 1864 until 1866 when he migrated to Texas. There he was assigned to Galveston, Texas as an agent and teacher for the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. Active in the Republican Party and elected as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1868–1869, Ruby was later elected as a Texas state senator and had wide influence. He supported construction of railroads to support Galveston business. He was instrumental in organizing African-American dockworkers into the Labor Union of Colored Men, to gain them jobs at the docks after 1870. When Democrats regained control of the state government in 1874, Ruby returned to New Orleans, working in journalism. He also became a leader of the Exoduster movement. Blacks from the Deep South migrated to homestead in Kansas in order to escape white supremacist violence and the oppression of segregation.

==Historiography==
The Dunning school of American historians (1900–1950) espoused White supremacy and viewed &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; unfavorably, arguing that they degraded the political and business culture. The revisionist school in the 1930s called them stooges of Northern business interests. After 1960 the neoabolitionist school emphasized their moral courage.

==Modern use==
===United Kingdom===
====Building societies====

In the late 1990s, carpetbagging was used as a term in Great Britain during the wave of demutualizations of building societies. It described people who joined mutual societies with the hope of making a quick profit from their conversion to joint stock companies.
Those so-called carpetbaggers were roving financial opportunists, often of modest means, who spotted investment opportunities and aimed to benefit from a set of circumstances to which they were not ordinarily entitled. The best opportunities for carpetbaggers came from opening membership accounts at building societies to qualify for windfall gains, running into thousands of pounds, from the process of conversion and takeover. The influx of such transitory &quot;token&quot; members, who took advantage of the deposit criteria, often instigated or accelerated the demutualisation of the organisation.

The new investors in those mutuals would receive shares in the newly created public companies, usually distributed at a flat rate, which equally benefited small and large investors, providing a broad incentive for members to vote for leadership candidates who were pushing for demutualisation. Carpetbaggers first was used in this context in early 1997 by the chief executive of the Woolwich Building Society, who announced the society&#x27;s conversion with rules removing the entitlement of the most recent new savers to potential windfalls, stating in a media interview, &quot;I have no qualms about disenfranchising carpetbaggers.&quot;

Between 1997 and 2002, a group of pro-demutualization supporters, &quot;Members for Conversion&quot;, operated a website, carpetbagger.com, which highlighted the best ways of opening share accounts with UK building societies, and organised demutualisation resolutions.

That led many building societies to implement &quot;anti-carpetbagging&quot; policies, such as not accepting new deposits from customers who lived outside the normal operating area of the society. Another measure was to insert a charitable assignment clause for new members into the constitution of the organisation, requiring customers opening a savings account to sign a declaration agreeing that any windfall conversion benefits to which they might become entitled would be assigned to the Charities Aid Foundation.

The term continues to be used within the co-operative movement to, for example, refer to the demutualisation of housing cooperatives.

====UK politics====
The analogous term to carpetbagging in Britain is &quot;chicken run&quot;, to denote an MP running in a safer constituency to seek re-election. The term was first used by the Labour Party to describe Norman Lamont&#x27;s move from Kingston-upon-Thames in London to Harrogate and Knaresborough in North Yorkshire. The term has been used at subsequent elections, to describe MPs including Shaun Woodward (Witney to St Helens South), Mims Davies (Eastleigh to Mid Sussex), Kieran Mullan (Crewe and Nantwich to Bexhill and Battle), and Richard Holden (North West Durham to Basildon and Billericay).

The term &quot;carpetbagger&quot; has also been applied to those who join the Labour Party but lack roots in the working class that the party was formed to represent.

===World War II===
During World War II, the U.S. Office of Strategic Services surreptitiously supplied necessary tools and materials to resistance groups in Europe. The OSS called this effort Operation Carpetbagger. The modified B-24 aircraft used for the night-time missions were referred to as &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. (Among other special features, they were painted a glossy black to make them less visible to searchlights.) Between January and September 1944, Operation Carpetbagger operated 1,860 sorties between RAF Harrington, England, and various points in occupied Europe. British Agents used this &quot;noise&quot; as cover for their use of Carpetbagger for the nominated Agent who was carrying monies [authentic and counterfeit] to the Underground/Resistance.

===Australia===
In Australia, &quot;carpetbagger&quot; may refer to unscrupulous dealers and business managers in indigenous Australian art.

The term was also used by John Fahey, a former Premier of New South Wales and federal Liberal finance minister, in the context of shoddy &quot;tradespeople&quot; who travelled to Queensland to take advantage of victims following the 2010–2011 Queensland floods.

===United States===
In the United States, the common modern usage, usually derogatory, refers to politicians who move to different states, districts or areas to run for office despite their lack of local ties or familiarity. For example, West Virginia Congressman Alex Mooney was attacked as a carpetbagger when he first ran for Congress in 2014, as he had previously been a Maryland State Senator and Chairman of the Maryland Republican Party. 2022 Republican nominee for Pennsylvania Senator Mehmet Oz was prominently attacked as a carpetbagger by his opponent John Fetterman for previously living in New Jersey until months before the election. Fetterman won the election, with some claiming that this attack was vital to his victory. The term is now sometimes even used for politicians who relocate from the South to the North for politically opportunistic reasons. For example, former Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton was attacked by opponents as carpetbagging because she never resided in New York State or participated in the state&#x27;s politics before the 2000 Senate race; Republican nominee and New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani mocked Clinton by putting an Arkansas flag on top of the New York City Hall. Ahead of the 2024 United States House of Representatives elections in Colorado, Republican representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado&#x27;s 3rd congressional district was accused of carpetbagging after switching to the less-competitive 4th district for reelection. 

Alongside its modern usage in politics, the term can still be applied to unscrupulous individuals coming from the north to profit themselves at Southerner&#x27;s expense, such as in the case of Brian Kelly. Kelly left his head coaching position at Notre Dame to take the same position at LSU, enticed in no small part by a 10 year, $95 million dollar contract. Despite adopting a horrifically fake southern accent and claiming that he&#x27;d now have &quot;the resources to win a national championship&quot;, Kelly has continued regularly lose to top-10 opponents in embarrassing fashion. He has not offered to return any of his earnings or re-negotiate his contract to reflect his mediocre performance.

===Cuisine===
A carpetbag steak or carpetbagger steak is an end cut of steak that is pocketed and stuffed with oysters, among other ingredients, such as mushrooms, blue cheese, and garlic. The steak is sutured with toothpicks or thread, and it sometimes is wrapped in bacon.
The combination of beef and oysters is traditional. The earliest specific reference is in a United States newspaper in 1891. The earliest specific Australian reference is a printed recipe sometime between 1899 and 1907.

=== French politics ===
In French politics, carpetbagging is known as parachutage, which means parachuting in French.

<text>A skipping rope or jump rope is a tool used in a sport where participants jump over a rope which is swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. Variations of the sport allow for freestyle jumping, or following set sequences, with one or more participants involved in jumping.

Rope skipping is commonly performed as an exercise or recreational activity. It is noted as having a beneficial effect on health.

Sports organisations exist supporting rope skipping as a competitive sport. Often separated by sex and age, events include hundreds of competitive teams around the world. 

In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine lasting a specific time. Performances are judged. In speed events, a jumper is judged on the number of times the correct foot touches the ground in those times.

==History==

Explorers reported seeing aborigines jumping with vines in the 16th century. European boys started skipping in the early 17th century. The activity was considered indecent for girls due to concerns of them showing their ankles. Girls began skipping in the 18th century, adding skipping chants, owning the rope, controlling the game, and deciding who may participate.

In the United States, domination of the activity by girls emerged as their families moved into cities in the late 19th century. There, they found sidewalks and other smooth surfaces conducive to skipping, along with a high density of peers with whom to engage in the sport. Educator Lucy Nulton studied the rhymes that American children chanted or sang while jumping rope in the mid-20th century.

==Techniques==
There are many techniques that can be used when skipping. These can be used individually or combined in a series to create a routine.

=== Solo participants ===
For solo jumping, the participant jumps and swings the rope under their feet. The timing of the swing is matched to the jump. This allows them to jump the rope and establish a rhythm more successfully. This can be contrasted with swinging the rope at the feet and jumping, which would mean they were matching the jump to the swing. This makes it harder to jump the rope and establish a rhythm. 

====Basic jump or easy jump====
Jump with both feet slightly apart over the rope. Beginners usually master this technique first before moving onto more advanced techniques.

====Slow (double bounce)====
Turn the rope slowly and jump once before jumping over the rope as in a basic jump.

====Alternate foot jump (speed step)====
Use alternate feet to jump off the ground. This technique can be used to effectively double the number of jumps per minute as compared to the above technique. This step can be used for speed events.

====Criss-cross====
Also known as crossover, cross arms, or simply a cross. Perform the basic jump whilst crossing arms in front of the body.

====Side swing====
The rope is passed by the side of the participant&#x27;s body without jumping it.

====EB (front-back cross or sailor)====
Perform the criss-cross whilst crossing one arm behind the back.

====Double under====
A high basic jump, turning the rope twice under the feet. Turning the rope three times is called a triple under. In competitions, participants may attempt quadruple (quads) and quintuple under (quins) using the same method. The Guinness World Record currently belongs to Kirato Hitaka, who has managed to do 8 revolutions in one jump.

====Boxer jump====
One foot is positioned slightly forward and one foot slightly back. The person positions their bodyweight primarily over their front foot, with the back foot acting as a stabiliser. From this stance, the person jumps up several times (often 2-3 times) before switching their stance, so the front foot becomes the back foot, and the back foot becomes the front foot. And so forth. An advantage of this technique is that it allows the back leg a brief rest. So while both feet are still used in the jump, a person may find they can skip for longer than if they were using the basic two-footed technique.

====Toad====
Perform the criss-cross with one arm crossing under the opposite leg from the inside.

====Leg over or Crougar====
A basic jump with one arm hooked under the adjacent leg. Doing Crougar with the non-dominant leg in the air is easier

====Awesome Annie====
Also known as Awesome Anna or swish. Alternates between a leg over and a toad without a jump in between.

====Inverse toad====
Perform the toad whilst one arm crosses the adjacent leg from the outside.

====Elephant====
A cross between the inverse toad and the toad, with both arms crossing under one leg.

====Frog or Donkey kick====
The participant does a handstand, returns to their feet, and turns the rope under them. A more advanced version turns the rope during the return to the ground.

====TJ====
A triple-under where the first &#x27;jump&#x27; is a side swing, the middle jump is a toad and the final jump in the open.

====Mic release====
One hand lets go of the rope, which is then swung in a loop on the side. The rope is caught and jumping continues. First demonstrated by Mike Fry in 2004.

====Mamba release====
One hand lets go of the rope, which is swung on one side, then pulled over to the other side, and back and forth. After a number of swings, the rope is recaught. Jumping can continue throughout. 

=== Competition techniques ===
In competitions, participants are required to demonstrate competence using specific techniques. The selection depends on the judging system and the country in which the tournament is held.

==Health effects==
Skipping may be used as a cardiovascular workout, similar to jogging or bicycle riding, and has a high MET or intensity level. This aerobic exercise can achieve a &quot;burn rate&quot; of up to 700 to over 1,200 calories per hour of vigorous activity, with about 0.1 to nearly 1.1 calories consumed per jump, mainly depending upon the speed and intensity of jumps and leg foldings. Ten minutes of skipping are roughly the equivalent of running an eight-minute mile. Skipping for 16–20 minutes is enough to burn off the calories from a candy bar and is equivalent to 45–60 minutes of running, depending upon the intensity of jumps and leg swings. Many professional trainers, fitness experts, and professional fighters greatly recommend skipping for burning fat over any other alternative exercises like running and jogging.

Weighted skipping ropes are available for such athletes to increase the difficulty and effectiveness of such exercise. Individuals or groups can participate in the exercise, and learning proper techniques is relatively simple compared to many other athletic activities. The exercise is also appropriate for a wide range of ages and fitness levels.

Skipping grew in popularity in 2020 when gyms closed or people stayed home due to coronavirus restrictions across the world. These workouts can be done at home and do not require specialized equipment.

==Competition==

===International===
The world governing body for the sport of jump rope is the International Jump Rope Union (IJRU). It is a merger of two previous rival world organizations: the International Rope Skipping Federation (FISAC-IRSF), and the World Jump Rope Federation (WJRF). There have been 11 World Championships on every alternate year by FISAC-IRSF, with the final competition being held in Shanghai, China. There have been 7 World Jump Rope Championships held every year by (WJRF); the final competition taking place in Oslo, Norway. Previous locations of this championship included Washington DC, Orlando, France, and Portugal. IJRU held its first World Tournament in Colorado City, Colorado in 2023 and plans to hold its second one in Kawasaki, Japan in 2025.

In 2018, FISAC-IRSF and WJRF announced the merger organization IJRU. IJRU has become the 10th International Federation to gain GAISF Observer status. The decision was taken by the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) Council, which met during SportAccord in Bangkok. Observer status is the first step on a clear pathway for new International Federations towards the top of the Olympic Family pyramid. Those who wish to proceed will be assisted by GAISF, leading them into full GAISF membership through the Alliance of Independent Recognised Members of Sport (AIMS), and the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF).

In 2019 the International Rope Skipping Organisation (IRSO). re-emerged and reactivated its activities as governing body of skipping rope sport. The organization is headed by Richard Cendali, who is referred to as the grandfather of the sport of jump rope. IRSO had disagreements with both FISAC-IRSF and WJRF for ignoring several long-standing organizations in their merger. Various jump rope organizations that were long-standing for the development of the sport were left out of the merger of IJRU and came under IRSO under the leadership of Richard Cendali. The USA Jump Rope Federation and newly formed Asian Rope Skipping Association also joined IRSO and decided to host their World Championship in conjunction with AAU.

===World Inter School===
The first World Inter-School Rope Skipping Championship was held at Dubai, November 2015. The second World Inter-School Rope Skipping Championship was held at Eger, Hungary. The Championship was organized by World Inter School Rope Skipping Organisation (WIRSO). Second, third and fourth World Inter-School championships held in Hungary 2017, Hong Kong 2018 and Belgium 2019 respectively.

==Locations==

===United States===
Historically, there were two competing jump rope organizations in the United States: the International Rope Skipping Organization (IRSO), and the World Rope Skipping Federation (WRSF). IRSO focused on stunt-oriented and gymnastic or athletic type moves, while WRSF appreciated the aesthetics and form of the exercise. In 1995, these two organizations merged to form the United States Amateur Jump Rope Federation which is today now known as USA Jump Rope (USAJR).USAJR has hosted annual national tournaments, as well as camps, workshops, and clinics on instruction since 1995. Jump rope is also part of the Amateur Athletic Union and participates in their annual AAU Junior Olympic Games. More recently, the American Jump Rope Federation was founded in 2016 by previous members of WJRF. It is recognized as the official governing body for the sport of jump rope in the United States by IJRU.

The National Collegiate Jump Rope Association was formed in 2019 by a group of students.

In the US, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and few states have sanctioned official events at the elementary school level. 

== Types of jump ropes ==
Speed jump ropes are made from a thin vinyl cord or wire and are primarily used for speed jumping or double unders. They are best for indoor use, because they will wear down fast on concrete or other harsh surfaces. Licorice jump ropes are also made from vinyl cord or PVC and are primarily used for freestyle jumping. The beaded ropes make rhythmic jumping very easy, because the jumper can hear the beads hitting the ground and strive for a rhythmic pattern. Leather jump ropes are thicker and is less likely to tangle or wear down with outdoor use.

<doc id="491912" wikidata="Q6779318" url="?curid=491912" title="Mary Dewson">
<text>Mary Williams Dewson (1874–1962) was an American feminist and political activist. After graduating from Wellesley College in 1897, she worked for the Women&#x27;s Educational and Industrial Union. She became an active member of the National Consumers League (NCL) and received mentorship from Florence Kelley, a famous advocate for social justice feminism and General Secretary of the NCL. Dewson&#x27;s later role as civic secretary of the Women&#x27;s City Club of New York (WCCNY) led to her meeting Eleanor Roosevelt, who later convinced Dewson to be more politically active in the Democratic Party. Dewson went on to take over Roosevelt&#x27;s role as head of the Women&#x27;s Division of the Democratic National Campaign Committee. Dewson&#x27;s &quot;Reporter Plan&quot; mobilized thousands of women to spread information about the New Deal legislation and garner support for it. In connection with the Reporter Plan, the Women&#x27;s Division held regional conferences for women. This movement led to a historically high level of female political participation.

==Early life and education==
Dewson was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, on February 18, 1874. She was the youngest of six children. Her mother, Elizabeth Weld Williams, and father, Edward Henry Dewson, lived in Roxbury when they had their first child, Francis Williams. After moving to Quincy, they had five more children: George Badger, William Inglee, Edward Henry Jr., Ellen Reed, and Mary Williams.

Dewson&#x27;s mother took on a domestic role and took care of the household during Dewson&#x27;s childhood, while her father worked in the leather business. Dewson was very athletic and played both baseball and tennis. She was not concerned with her appearance, and preferred to play with &quot;boy&#x27;s&quot; toys like paper soldiers instead of the traditional dolls made for young girls.

She attended private schools, including Dana Hall School, before entering Wellesley College, from which she graduated as a social worker in 1897. At Wellesley, she was senior class president and her classmates believed she might one day be elected president of the United States.

== Career ==

===Early career, 1897–1912===
Shortly after graduating from Wellesley in 1897, Dewson began working as research assistant at the Women&#x27;s Educational and Industrial Union, an organization that originated in Boston to advocate for the social advancement of women, women&#x27;s education, and rights of women in the workforce. Dewson was offered this job by Elizabeth Glendower Evans, a reformer from Boston and one of Dewson&#x27;s mentors. During her time at the WEIU, Dewson conducted statistical studies and reported on women&#x27;s poor working conditions. She also taught a course on household economics. The lack of reading material for the course inspired her to write and publish &quot;The Twentieth Century Expense Book&quot; (1899). It served as a basic guide to help American women budget a household and prioritize expenses.

In 1900, Dewson joined the Massachusetts State Industrial School for Girls, located in Lancaster, Massachusetts. By 1904, she became the first superintendent of their parole department. The school&#x27;s goal was to rehabilitate young women delinquents, especially those who grew up in poverty. Dewson put her efforts towards understanding the different factors that affect female crime and delinquency. She gathered statistical data and used this information to improve the rehabilitation process. She wrote a paper titled &quot;The Delinquent Girl on Parole&quot; about her findings. She presented it in 1911 at the National Conference of Charities and Correction.

Even before leaving the Industrial School (1912), she became involved in the minimum wage movement (1911). She was named executive secretary of the Minimum Wage Investigative Committee, which produced a report that led to Massachusetts&#x27; (and the nation&#x27;s) first minimum wage law. This report brought her national recognition.

===Suffrage movement===
By 1915, Dewson was involved in the Massachusetts campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. During World War I, she and her partner, Polly Porter, went with the American Red Cross to France to aid war refugees. Dewson was chief of the Mediterranean Zone by war&#x27;s end. After returning from Europe, Dewson worked as Florence Kelley&#x27;s principal assistant in the National Consumers&#x27; League campaign for state minimum wage laws for women and children. From 1925 to 1931, Dewson served as president of the New York Consumers&#x27; League, working closely with Eleanor Roosevelt (ER), leading the lobbying effort of the Women&#x27;s Joint Legislative Conference and playing a central role in the passage of a 1930 New York law limiting women to forty-eight-hour work weeks. As president of the New York Consumers&#x27; League, Dewson worked and socialized with Frances Perkins and Clara Mortenson Beyer, both of would go on to work in the United States Department of Labor under President Roosevelt, and who played important roles in New Deal era labor economics.

Mary W. Dewon started her career in Massachusetts reform and suffrage circles. In the 1920s in New York she was a civic secretary of the Women&#x27;s City Club of New York,[6][6][6][6][7][7][5][5][4][3][3] and the research secretary of the National Consumers&#x27; League. By 1929 Dewson knew all of the leading women reformers in the city. Because of Dewson&#x27;s connections Eleanor Roosevelt recruited her into the Democratic political party. It was during this time that Dewson entered politics more personally, organizing Democratic women for Al Smith&#x27;s presidential campaign at Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s request. She performed a similar feat for Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s 1930 gubernatorial and 1932 presidential races. Because of her work on FDR&#x27;s campaigns (and ER&#x27;s intense lobbying), Dewson was appointed head of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Division (DNC). She reorganized the division to be utterly different. She found government jobs for female party workers, more than had been given to women under any previous administration. She is credited with securing the post of secretary of labor for Frances Perkins, and placing women high up in the Social Security and National Recovery Administrations. Even so, she opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. Despite this opposition, she began to push for state laws or state party rulings that would provide even representation in membership and leadership positions for women on party committees from the precinct level up. She created the Reporter Plan, which educated female party workers on New Deal programs so that they could explain them to voters. In the 1936 election, the women&#x27;s division provided 90 percent of the campaign fliers the DNC produced. That same year she got a rule passed that provided for a member and an alternate for each state on the DNC Platform Committee; the rule also required that each pair be composed of one man and one woman. Because of Dewson&#x27;s organizational skills, FDR nicknamed her &quot;the little general.&quot;

She withdrew from the women&#x27;s division&#x27;s day-to-day affairs in 1936 because of poor health, but continued to be available to her successors. In 1937 she again returned to active public life when she was nominated and confirmed as a member of the Social Security Board. There she set up effective systems of federal-state cooperation, an issue that had been problematic. However, she again had to step down because of illness in 1938.

== Personal life ==
Dewson met her life partner Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Porter in 1909, when both women were working at the Massachusetts State Industrial School for Girls. Dewson was then director of the parole board and living with her mother, and Porter, ten years her junior, was working an internship as part of her studies at the Massachusetts School for Social Work. The two became a couple and moved in together in 1912, after the death of Dewson’s mother. They were together for more than fifty years, until Dewson&#x27;s death in 1962. Throughout their lives together, the two women referred to themselves as the Porter-Dewsons. 

In 1913, the Porter-Dewsons bought a dairy farm near the central Massachusetts hamlet of South Berlin and briefly became &quot;gentlewoman farmers.&quot; After serving in Europe during World War I, the couple moved to New York City. By 1927, they had an apartment in the city&#x27;s Greenwich Village neighborhood. Their building, at 171 West 12th Street, contained the apartments of two other notable female couples. Feminists Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman lived there, as did Communist Party activists Grace Hutchins and Anna Rochester. 

In 1911, Dewson visited Polly Porter&#x27;s family summer home in Castine, Maine, and the couple made frequent visits there during the summers. In 1952, they retired to Castine full-time. Dewson became the vice-president of the Maine Democratic Advisory Committee in 1954. Dewson died in Castine on October 21, 1962.

<text>General Sir Anthony Blaxland Stransham (22 December 1805 – 6 October 1900) was a senior officer in the Royal Marines.

==Background==
Stransham was the son of Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Stransham of the Royal Marines, and grandson of Major Samuel Stransham, also of the Royal Marines, who raised the Union Flag on the Falklands in 1771, claiming formal possession of the islands for the United Kingdom.

==Military career==
Stransham entered the Royal Marines on 1 January 1823. Four years after entering the service, he was present as a subaltern at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827. Stransham led the Royal Marines during the First Battle of Canton in the First Opium War on 18 March 1841. He was wounded and promoted to captain. He was awarded the Baltic Medal, having been with Charles John Napier in 1854. From 1862 to 1867, General Stransham was Inspector-General of the Royal Marines.

Later in his career, as a general, the &quot;Grand Old Man of the Army&quot; became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

He saw active service for over 53 years, retiring with the rank of general on 24 December 1875.

<text>The Pilbara () is a large, dry, sparsely populated region in the north of Western Australia. It is known for its Aboriginal people; its ancient landscapes; the prevailing red earth; and its vast mineral deposits, in particular iron ore. It is also a global biodiversity hotspot for subterranean fauna.

==Definitions of the Pilbara region==

At least two important but differing definitions of &quot;the Pilbara&quot; region exist. Administratively it is one of the nine regions of Western Australia defined by the &quot;Regional Development Commissions Act 1993&quot;; the term also refers to the Pilbara shrublands bioregion (which differs in extent) under the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA).

==Geography==
The Pilbara region, as defined by the Regional Development Commissions Act 1993 and administered for economic development purposes by the Pilbara Development Commission, has an estimated population of 61,688 , and covers an area of . It contains some of Earth&#x27;s oldest rock formations, and includes landscapes of coastal plains and mountain ranges with cliffs and gorges. The major settlements of the region are Port Hedland, Karratha and Newman. The three main ports in this region are Port Hedland, Dampier and Port Walcott.

Under the &quot;Regional Development Commissions Act&quot;, Pilbara is situated south of the Kimberley, and comprises the local government areas of Shire of Ashburton, Shire of East Pilbara, City of Karratha Town of Port Hedland.

The Pilbara region covers an area of 507,896 km2 (193,826 mi2) (including offshore islands), roughly the combined land area of the US States of California and Indiana. It has a population of more than 45,000, most of whom live in the western third of the region, in towns such as Port Hedland, Karratha, Wickham, Newman and Marble Bar. A substantial number of people also work in the region on a fly-in/fly-out basis.
There are approximately 10 major/medium population centres and more than 25 smaller ones.
The Pilbara consists of three distinct geographic areas. The western third is the Roebourne coastal sandplain, which supports most of the region&#x27;s population in towns and much of its industry and commerce. The eastern third is almost entirely desert, and is sparsely populated by a small number of Aboriginal people. The two areas are separated by the inland uplands of the Pilbara Craton, including the predominant Hamersley Range, which has numerous mining towns, the Chichester Range, and others. The uplands have many gorges and other natural attractions.

The Pilbara contains some of the world&#x27;s oldest surface rocks, including the ancient fossilised remains known as stromatolites and rocks such as granites that are more than three billion years old. In 2007, some of the oldest evidence of life on Earth was found in 3.4 billion-year-old sandstones at Strelley Pool, which preserve fossils of sulphur-processing bacteria. The mineralised spheres, which were found on an ancient beach and have a cell-like morphology, were chemically analysed, revealing that they used sulphur for fuel.

An extinct genus of stromatolite-forming cyanobacteria, &quot;Pilbaria&quot;, was named after the region, where the type specimen was found.

===Urban centres and localities===
== Local government ==
The Pilbara region, under the Pilbara Development Commission, contains four local government areas:

:Ashburton – Shire of Ashburton
:East Pilbara – Shire of East Pilbara
:Karratha – City of Karratha
:Port Hedland – Town of Port Hedland

==Etymology==
According to the Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre &quot;Wangka Maya&quot;, the name for the Pilbara region derives from the Aboriginal word &quot;bilybara&quot;, meaning &quot;dry&quot; in the Nyamal and Banyjima languages. Another suggested origin is &quot;pilbarra&quot;, an Aboriginal word for the salt-water mullet found in local waters, reflected in the name of a tributary of the Yule River, Pilbarra Creek, which evolved to &quot;Pilbara&quot; Creek. The Pilbara Goldfield, discovered in 1885, was named after the creek, and the name later became associated with the region.

==History==

Radiocarbon dating estimates in evidence show that rock art and standing stones at Murujuga in the Dampier Archipelago, Australia&#x27;s earliest known stone structures, believably dating from 6046 to 5338 BC, are of contextualization by thousands of years of unique cultural traditions and folklore. These sites have lived up as part of survival in present times.

The first European to explore the area was Francis Thomas Gregory in 1861. Within two years, European settlers had begun arriving. The region was regarded as part of the North West at first – a larger area that included the modern Kimberley and Gascoyne regions.

Settlements along the coast at Tien Tsin Harbour (later Cossack), Roebourne and Condon (officially Shellborough; later abandoned) were established over ensuing decades, mainly as centres of the rangeland livestock (grazing/pastoral) industry or pearling ports. However, as natural mother of pearl beds around Cossack were fished out, the pearling fleet began to move northward, and by 1883 it was based at Broome, in the Kimberley region. From , pastoralism went into decline with the growth of other, more productive agricultural areas of the state.

Mining in the region started on 1 October 1888, when the Pilbara Goldfield was officially declared – named after a local creek, the goldfield would later give its name to the region as a whole. It was later divided into the Nullagine Goldfield and Marble Bar Goldfield. However, gold mining began to decline in the Pilbara in the mid-1890s, after alluvial ore had been exhausted. In 1937, mining of asbestos commenced at Wittenoom Gorge. While the presence of abundant iron ore had been known for about a century, it was not until the 1960s and the discovery of high-grade ore in the Hamersley Ranges that the area became pivotal to the state&#x27;s economy, and towns built to accommodate mining and allied services boomed.

In the 1950s, three British nuclear weapons tests were carried out in the Montebello Islands, 130 km (81 mi) off the Pilbara coast.

==Aboriginal people==
===Prehistory===
The Aboriginal population of the Pilbara considerably predates, by 30,000 to 40,000 years, the European colonisation of the region. Archaeological evidence indicates that people were living in the Pilbara even during the harsh climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum. The early history of the first people is held within an oral tradition, archeological evidence and petroglyphs. Near the town of Dampier is a peninsula known as Murujuga, which contains a large collection of World Heritage-listed petroglyphs, dating back thousands of years. Rock art in the Pilbara appears to have been mainly etched into the hard rock surfaces, whereas on the softer sandstone in the Kimberley rock paintings predominate.
===20th century===
Working conditions in the pearling and pastoral industries for Aboriginal people in the Pilbara region around 1900 have been described as slavery, with no wages paid, kidnapping as well as severe and cruel punishments for misbehaviour and absconding all common practices. Some incidents, such as the Bendu Atrocity of 1897, attracted international condemnation. The first strike by Indigenous people in Australia took place in 1946 in the Pilbara, known as the Pilbara strike or Pilbara Aboriginal strike, when Aboriginal pastoral workers walked off the stations in protest at low pay and bad working conditions, a strike that lasted for over three years.

Family clans in the Pilbara who were supported by mining prospector, Don McLeod, developed skills for mining and the concentration of rare metals. For a short period money accumulated, which according to Aboriginal law was to be used for traditional ways. Eventually the funds were used to establish an independent Aboriginal-controlled school. The concept has expanded into a movement with around 20 similar schools established in northern Western Australia by the mid-1990s. Jan Richardson, wife of Victorian Aboriginal activist Stan Davey, wrote a biography of McLeod as a doctoral thesis.

===21st century===
In 2006, it was estimated that 15% of the population of the Pilbara identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, approximately 6000 people.

Many Pilbara communities face the many complex effects of colonisation, and lack adequate access to housing, health and education. A 1971 survey of 1000 Aboriginal people conducted by Pat McPherson found that most had one or more serious diseases. At the McClelland Royal Commission into British nuclear testing, Aboriginal people from the Pilbara provided evidence regarding the explosion on the Montebello Islands.

Aboriginal communities are sited over a number of different places. Many have poor infrastructure, and relations between police and Aboriginal people are often tense.

==Climate==
The climate of the Pilbara is arid and tropical. It experiences high temperatures and low irregular rainfall that follows the summer cyclones. During the summer months, maximum temperatures exceed almost every day, and temperatures in excess of are not uncommon. Winter temperatures rarely drop below on the coast; however, inland temperatures as low as are occasionally recorded.

The Pilbara town of Marble Bar set a world record of most consecutive days of maximum temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) or more, during a period of 160 such days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924.

The average annual rainfall in the region is between . Almost all of the Pilbara&#x27;s rainfall occurs between December and May, usually with occasional heavy downpours in thunderstorms or tropical cyclones. The period from June to November is usually completely rainless, with warm to very hot and sunny conditions. Like most of the north coast of Australia, the coastal areas of the Pilbara experience occasional tropical cyclones. The frequency of cyclones crossing the Pilbara coast is about 7 every 10 years. Due to the low population density in the Pilbara region, cyclones rarely cause large scale destruction or loss of life.


==Economy==
The area is known for its petroleum, natural gas and iron ore deposits, which contribute significantly to Australia&#x27;s economy. Other than mining, pastoral activities as well as fishing and tourism are the main industries.

The Pilbara&#x27;s economy is dominated by mining exports and petroleum export industries.

During the 1970s the area was known for union militancy with many strikes and some mines operating as fully unionised &#x27;closed shops.&#x27; This was challenged by employers from the mid-1980s onwards and the region now has a very low level of union membership compared to other parts of Australia.

===Iron ore===

Most of Australia&#x27;s iron ore is mined in the Pilbara, with mines mostly centred around Tom Price and Newman. The iron ore industry employs 9,000 people from the Pilbara area. The Pilbara also has one of the world&#x27;s major manganese mines, Woodie Woodie, situated southeast of Port Hedland.

Iron ore deposits were first discovered by prospector Stan Hilditch, who in 1957 found a large iron ore deposit in the southern Ophthalmia Range, at what was to become the Mount Whaleback mine.

In the 1960s, it was reportedly called &quot;one of the most massive ore bodies in the world&quot; by Thomas Price, then vice president of US-based steel company Kaiser Steel. Geoscience Australia calculated that the country&#x27;s &quot;economic demonstrated resources&quot; of iron amounted to 24 gigatonnes, or 24 billion tonnes. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, , that resource is being used up at a rate of 324 million tonnes a year, with rates expected to increase over coming years. Experts Gavin Mudd (Monash University) and Jonathon Law (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) expect it to be gone within 30 to 50 years (Mudd) and 56 years (Law).

, active iron ore mines in the Pilbara are:
* BC Iron
** Iron Valley mine
* BHP
** Area C mine
** Jimblebar mine
** Mount Whaleback mine
** Orebodies 18, 23 and 25 mine
** Yandi mine

** Paraburdoo mine
** West Angelas mine
** Yandicoogina mine
* Atlas Iron
** Pardoo mine
* Moly Mines
** Spinifex Ridge (molybdenum, copper, iron ore)

===Liquified natural gas===
A significant part of Pilbara&#x27;s economy is based on liquified natural gas (LNG) through the North West Shelf Venture and Pluto LNG plant, both operated by Woodside.

===Agriculture===

The region also has a number of cattle-grazing stations, and a substantial tourist sector, with popular natural attractions including the Karijini and Millstream-Chichester national parks and the Dampier Archipelago.

===Transport===

The first railway in the Pilbara region was the narrow-gauge Marble Bar Railway between Port Hedland and Marble Bar. The Marble Bar Railway opened in July 1911 and closed in October 1951. The Roebourne-Cossack Tramway opened in 1897 and many industrial railways have been built to serve the mines.

Five heavy-duty railways are associated with the various iron-ore mines. They are all standard gauge and built to the heaviest North American standards. Rio Tinto runs driverless trains on its railways.

===Ports===
The ports of the Pilbara are:

* Port Hedland
** Nelson Point and Finucane Island (operated by BHP)
** Herb Elliott Port (operated by the Fortescue Metals Group)
* Dampier (operated by Rio Tinto)
* Cape Lambert (operated by Rio Tinto)
* Anketell Port (under development)

==Ecology==
===Terrestrial===

The dominant flora of the Pilbara is acacia trees and shrubs and drought-resistant Triodia &quot;spinifex&quot; grasses. Several species of acacia (wattle) trees are endemic to the Pilbara and are the focus of conservation programs, along with wildflowers and other local specialities.

&quot;Fairy circles&quot; (known as &quot;linyji&quot; in the Manyjilyjarra language and &quot;mingkirri&quot; in the Warlpiri language) which are circular patches of land barren of plants, varying between in diameter and often encircled by a ring of stimulated growth of grass, are found in the western part of the Great Sandy Desert in the Pilbara. It has not yet been proven what causes these formations, but one theory suggests that they have been built and inhabited by Australian harvester termites since the Pleistocene.

The Pilbara is home to a wide variety of endemic species adapted to this tough environment. There is a high diversity of invertebrates, including hundreds of species of subterranean fauna (both stygofauna and troglofauna), which are microscopic invertebrates that live in caves, vugs or groundwater aquifers of the region, and terrestrial fauna (see short-range endemic invertebrates). The Pilbara olive python, the western pebble-mound mouse, and the Pilbara ningaui of the Hamersley Range are among the many species of animals within the fragile ecosystems of this desert ecoregion. Birds include the Australian hobby, nankeen kestrel, spotted harrier, mulga parrot and budgerigars.

Wildlife has been damaged by the extraction of iron, natural gas and asbestos, but the protection of culturally and environmentally sensitive areas of the Pilbara is now enhanced by the delineation of several protected areas, including the Millstream-Chichester and the Karijini National Parks.

===Freshwater===

The western Pilbara is part of the Pilbara freshwater ecoregion, also known as the Pilbara-Gascoyne or Indian Ocean drainage basin. The freshwater region is characterized by intermittent rivers which form deep gorges, and brackish-water caves that host endemic species. The region includes the drainages of the Murchison, Gascoyne, Ashburton, Fortescue, and De Grey rivers. The Great Sandy Desert, which covers the eastern Pilbara, has little freshwater habitat.

<doc id="491919" wikidata="Q2352940" url="?curid=491919" title="M-37 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-37 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The southern terminus is near the border between Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties at exit 92 of Interstate 94 (I-94) southwest of Battle Creek. The northern terminus is at the Mission Point Light on Old Mission Point in Grand Traverse County. In between, the highway connects Battle Creek, Grand Rapids and Traverse City. Motorists will travel through agricultural land, forests, suburbs and large cities along the way. The section of M-37 on the Old Mission Peninsula was designated what is now a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway in 2008.

Originally named the Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Northport State Road, and later the Newaygo and Northport State Road, today&#x27;s modern highway can be traced back to the 19th century and earlier. The southernmost section between Grand Rapids and Battle Creek parallels an early Indian trail. The modern highway was formed by July 1, 1919 along this segment. By the 1940s, a second section of highway was designated M-37, creating a gap between it and the original section. This gap was eliminated in the 1950s, completing the M-37 corridor in the state. Additional changes to the routing were made through the Grand Rapids area into the 1970s.

==Route description==
M-37 runs for through the western side of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan connecting Battle Creek, Grand Rapids and Traverse City. Segments of it have been listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. Through the Grand Rapids area, M-37 is on the NHS along Broadmoor and East Beltline avenues north of M-6 and the concurrency with I-96. The second segment on the NHS runs from M-115 in Mesick to Traverse City. The road has also been designated what is now a Pure Michigan Byway through the Old Mission Peninsula. The trunkline is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). As part of this responsibility, the department tracks the traffic volumes along M-37. MDOT uses a metric called average annual daily traffic, which is a calculation of the average traffic level for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. Along M-37, the volume varies from the peak 49,173 vehicles on a section of I-96/M-37 in Grand Rapids to the 718 vehicles at the northern terminus by the Mission Point Light.

===West Michigan===
M-37 starts joined with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) as the two highway designations run concurrently at exit 92 on I-94 southwest of Battle Creek. They follow Columbia Avenue and pass around the southern side of the W. K. Kellogg Airport. When the roadway meets M-96, BL I-94/M-37 turns northward, joining M-96 around the eastern end of the airport to Dickman Road. M-37 jogs westerly onto Dickman Road before continuing northward Helmer Road through suburban residential areas in Springfield and across the Kalamazoo River into Level Park-Oak Park. There the highway intersects M-89, passes through more residential areas and exits the Battle Creek metro area.

North of Bedford, M-37 meanders through rural Barry County. The road passes through mixed agricultural and forest lands near several small lakes in the area. On its path to Hastings, the trunkline runs through Dowling and meets the western terminus of M-79. The highway follows Hanover Street through the south side of Hastings into downtown, where it turns west on Green Street and north on Broadway Street. At the intersection of Broadway and State streets, M-37 meets and joins M-43. West of Hastings, M-43 separates and heads south toward Kalamazoo while M-37 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Thornapple River. The highway follows the river west and north to the community of Middleville through mixed farms and forests.
In southern Kent County, M-37 follows Cherry Valley Road through Caledonia. As the highway transitions to Broadmoor Avenue, the landscape also transitions from rural to suburban. North of 76th Street, Broadmoor widens to a four-lane boulevard which passes a campus of Davenport University near the M-6 freeway on the outskirts of the Grand Rapids area. This section is dominated by light industrial complexes west of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in the suburb of Kentwood. These complexes change over to retail establishments north of 32nd Street. At 28th Street, Broadmoor Avenue ends, and East Beltline Avenue begins. M-37 follows East Beltline Avenue between the Woodland Mall and the Centerpointe Mall. North of the malls, M-37 passes through the campus of Calvin University and along residential areas at the east end of Reeds Lake. The intersection of East Beltine Avenue and Fulton Street is the western terminus for M-21, a highway that runs east across the state to Flint. North of this junction, M-37 meets I-96 and M-44

M-37 parts East Beltline Avenue and turns west along I-96. The freeway runs west and then north around the edge of Grand Rapids. Near 3 Mile Road, I-96/M-37 runs west again, continuing across the Grand River and meeting the US Highway 131 (US 131) freeway. The next interchange immediately west of US 131 is for Alpine Avenue, which M-37 follows north. This road runs through a commercial and retail corridor in the communities of Walker and Comstock Park. South of 6 Mile Road, Alpine Avenue widens into a four-lane divided highway. This highway splits from Alpine Avenue north of 8 Mile Road and turns to the northwest as the surroundings transition to rural farmland again. M-37 transitions back to a two-lane road south of Sparta. The trunkline passes to the west of Kent City and crosses into Muskegon County at Casnovia. Through this area, the highway parallels a line of the Marquette Rail that runs north from Grand Rapids.

West of the county line, M-37 meets and merges with M-46 along Apple Avenue. The two highways separate at a roundabout junction where M-37 turns north on Newaygo Road. M-37 passes Half Moon Lake and through Bailey. In recent years the highway has served as the location of West Michigan&#x27;s Longest Yard Sale which spans about of the route starting in the Bailey–Grant area of Newaygo County through northern Lake County. Between |Grant and Newaygo, the farms transition to forest. M-82 follows M-37 through downtown and across the Muskegon River. The highway continues north along Evergreen Drive between Emerald, Sylvan and Twinwood lakes. This area is where M-37 crosses into the Manistee National Forest. M-20 follows M-37 through downtown White Cloud and over the White River. Further north, the road passes through Brohman and Lilley in the northern end of the county.

===Northern Michigan===
As M-37 crosses into Lake County, the highway crosses the Pere Marquette River. US 10 follows M-37 through Baldwin. The Marquette Rail line turns westward on the edge of town, and north of Baldwin, the highway forms the dividing line between the Manistee National Forest to the west and the Pere Marquette State Forest to the east. The road crosses the Little Manistee River near Peacock and the Pine River in southwest Wexford County. M-37 curves to the northeast along the edge of the Hodenpyl Dam Pond near Mesick. M-37 turns east to follow M-115 through the community and then returns to a northward course into Sherman and on to Buckley. North of the latter community, the highway crosses into Grand Traverse County. The area around Buckley transitions to agricultural use again. This landscape continues past the M-113 to the area known as Chums Corners. There, M-37 merges with US 31, and the two run through a small unincorporated community that is host to Turtle Creek Stadium, home of the Traverse City Pit Spitters, a minor league baseball team.

US 31/M-37 enters the south side of Traverse City near the intersection with South Airport Road and the Grand Traverse Mall. As the highway heads towards Grand Traverse Bay and downtown, it passes several car dealerships, an outlet mall and other retailers. After the city limits, the roadway is also given the name Division Street. North of 14th Street, US 31/M-37 passes the former Traverse City State Hospital, a Kirkbride Plan former mental asylum. This section of town is mostly residential except for the old state hospital and Munson Medical Center. North of Front Street, Division Street meets Grandview Parkway. This roadway runs along the bay from the northwest carrying M-22/M-72. When the two streets meet, M-22 ends, and US 31/M-37 and M-72 merge into a triple concurrency along the bay north of downtown Traverse City. Grandview Parkway passes the Open Space park, the marina, the former Clinch Park Zoo and runs along a narrow piece of land between the Boardman River and the bay. Grandview Parkway ends east of the mouth of the river, and the highway continues along Front Street past the Great Lakes Maritime Academy and the home berth of the TS &quot;State of Michigan&quot; to Garfield Avenue near the campus of Northwestern Michigan College. M-37 turns north along Garfield Avenue to Peninsula Drive, leaving US 31/M-72.
M-37 follows Center Road up the middle of the Old Mission Peninsula. This landform divides Grand Traverse Bay into its east and west arms. The highway runs along a ridge at the center of the peninsula offering views of each arm of the bay. This area contains the greatest concentration of cherry trees in the US. These trees are said to &quot;explode in a filigree of creamy pink blossoms in May&quot; by the editors of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine. The area is also famous for its vineyards and wineries. The peninsula&#x27;s seven wineries produce Rieslings, pinot grigios and chardonnays. The first grapes were introduced to the region in 1983. In the fall, the area is renowned for its colors in addition to the harvest. Besides cherries and grapes, apples are also grown in the area, contributing to the bounty each year. At the tip of the peninsula is the Mission Point Light, a lighthouse that dates back to 1870. M-37 ends at a cul-de-sac in front of the building which is located near the 45th Parallel, halfway between the North Pole and the Equator.

==History==

===Early history===
The southern section of M-37 follows the path of an early Indian trail that connected the St. Joseph Trail near Kalamazoo and Battle Creek to the Grand River Trail near present-day Alto. These trails &quot;were narrow and permitted only single-file travel.&quot; In the Grand Rapids area, Alpine Avenue was originally constructed as a plank road. These roads were at least wide covered with wood planks thick.

A portion of M-37 follows the route of the Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Northport State Road, which was later renamed the Newaygo and Northport State Road. The road was authorized by the state legislature in 1857, and it was intended to connect the settlements in Muskegon and Newaygo counties, which at the time were &quot;most northerly on the south side of the &#x27;Big Woods&#x27;&quot;, with the growing settlements around the Grand Traverse Bay. Construction progressed slowly and was only opened through Wexford County in 1863. and the bridge over the Manistee River in 1864 at what is now Sherman.

The Custer Trail, named for General George Armstrong Custer, was created in 1917 along a series of roads between Grand Rapids and Ft. Wayne, Indiana that included the modern M-37. Custer commanded the Michigan Cavalry Bridge during the Civil War, and he was wildly popular in the state after the war. The road that bears his name never achieved that level of popularity. By 1930, the name had already fallen out of use.

===State highway era===
The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signed M-37 initially as part of the state trunkline highway system by July 1, 1919. This section of highway ran from Battle Creek to Grand Rapids, roughly along the modern routing. By 1929, the highway was extended north to Peacock in Lake County, replacing the contemporary M-54 in the process. A group of local leaders formed an organization to lobby for the completion of the highway in 1928 when state efforts to do stalled. The Grand Rapids–Leelanau Association named their roadway the Paradise Trail and promoted it as an alternative to both US 31 and US 131. They convinced local land owners to donate land to build the road. Backers named the road for the &quot;divine scenic and recreational delights&quot; in the area.

An unnumbered section of gravel highway was opened in 1937 west of Cadillac; the roadway extended south from M-55 to the Wexford–Lake county line. Later, in 1940, the MSHD renumbered the north–south leg of M-42 from Mesick north to Traverse City and Old Mission. As a result, M-37 was then a discontinuous highway with a gap between M-63 in Peacock to M-115 at Mesick. The spur in Wexford County is shown after 1941 as an &quot;earthen&quot; highway, before disappearing from state maps completely in 1945. A section of M-37 through Newaygo County was renamed in 1945 for Stevens T. Mason, the first governor of the State of Michigan. At the time, Consumers Power Company recommended that all north–south roads in the county bear the name of a state governor as part of a plan to rename the major roads in the county. The company wanted to simplify directions for their employees looking for customers&#x27; homes in the area. In the middle of 1948, M-37 was extended to M-55 on a gravel highway that followed the previously unnumbered highway in Wexford County and a new roadway in Lake County. As a result, M-37 still had a gap, but only between M-55 and M-115.

M-37 through the south side of the Grand Rapids area was realigned in late 1949 or early 1950. After the change, the highway follows Broadmoor Avenue to 28th Street and 28th Street west to its former routing along Kalamazoo Avenue. In 1953, this routing was shifted further when M-37 was rerouted to run north on East Beltline Avenue concurrent with US 131 and M-21 to Cascade Road. There it turned west along Cascade Road and Fulton Street into downtown back to its existing alignment. During that same time frame, the gap in the routing between M-55 and Mesick was eliminated. The highway was moved to bypass Sparta, Kent City and Casnovia to the southwest in the 1962. Another change around the same time frame shifted M-37&#x27;s routing through Grand Rapids again. This time, M-37 was rerouted to follow M-11/M-21 along 28th Street to the US 131 freeway north to I-96 and back to Alpine Avenue. The final Grand Rapids routing change was made in 1969 when M-37 was moved to its current course along East Beltline Avenue and I-96. This change resulted in a concurrency with the southernmost end of M-44 that was later removed in 1977 when M-44 was truncated northward. A proposed new routing near Comstock Park in the 1970s would have removed M-37 from Alpine Avenue. The new highway, if built, would have run southeastward from the Alpine Avenue split to US 131 near 6 Mile Road. In 2008, the northernmost on the Old Mission Peninsula were designated what is now a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by MDOT. In 2013, the hairpin curve on a hill north of Mesick was straightened and the hill slightly leveled.

To expand the blast radius for ammunitions testing at Fort Custer, MDOT rerouted the BL I-94/M-37 to run along the southern and eastern edges of the airport in Battle Creek instead of following roads on the opposite sides. This change was completed in 2015.
MDOT and the Grand Traverse County Road Commission (GTCRC) announced in August 2019 that the GTCRC would take over ownership of M-37 on the Old Mission Peninsula north of Traverse City effective May 1, 2020. If the change were completed, MDOT would have removed M-37 from the US 31 concurrency through Traverse City, truncating the highway to terminate in Chums Corners. In November 2019, Peninsula Township officials went on record in opposition to the transfer. The City of Traverse City supported accepting jurisdiction of a section of M-37 north of US 31/M-72 to the city limits in February 2020. MDOT announced a public hearing for May 21, 2020, to take public comment on the transfer. Because only state trunkline highways are eligible for Pure Michigan Byway status and that section of M-37 has that status, the department is required to conduct at 30-day review of the transfer and removal of byway status. In May 2021, the department announced that it had cancelled plans to transfer M-37 to the local jurisdictions.

<text>The Battersea Shield is one of the most significant pieces of ancient Celtic art found in Britain. It is a sheet bronze covering of a (now vanished) wooden shield decorated in La Tène style. The shield is on display in the British Museum, and a replica is housed in the Museum of London.

==History==
The Battersea Shield is dated by the museum to c.350–50 BC, though later dates up to the early 1st century AD had previously been suggested, usually in the later part of this range; Miranda Aldhouse-Green is typical in using &quot;2nd-1st century BC&quot; in 1996. It was dredged from the bed of the River Thames at Battersea in London in 1857, during excavations for the predecessor of Chelsea Bridge; in the same area workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians to conclude that the area was the site of Julius Caesar&#x27;s crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain, although it is now thought that the shield was a votive offering, which probably predates the invasion.

==Description==

The Battersea Shield is made of several different pieces, held together by rivets concealed under the decorative elements. It is decorated with repoussé decoration, engraving, and enamel. The decoration is in the typically Celtic La Tène style, consisting of circles and spirals. There are 27 small round compartments in raised bronze with red cloisonné enamel; the bronze within the compartment forms a sort of swastika, thought to have been associated with good luck and also &quot;solar energy&quot;. This symbol was known as the whirling sun in ancient times. Enamel was a Celtic speciality, and reflects the use of red Mediterranean coral inlays in other British Celtic artefacts, such as the Witham Shield, and here may perhaps be considered as an imitation of imported coral, though the use of enamel allows a more elaborate design. Some scholars have read a reversible human face into the decoration at the points where the smaller circles link to the larger one.

The bronze sheet is said by archaeologists to be too thin to have offered effective protection in combat, and shows no signs of battle damage. It is therefore believed that the shield was cast into the river as a votive offering, and made either as a &quot;parade piece&quot; or status symbol, or specifically for votive offering. Nothing remains of the plain wooden or leather shield to which the surviving metal plate would have been fixed.

==In popular culture==
The shield plate inspired the name of a 2004 EP, &quot;Battersea Shield&quot;, by electronic bands The Orb and Meat Beat Manifesto, which was sold in an embossed tin based on the design of the Battersea Shield, instead of a standard jewel case.

<text>The Goldfields–Esperance region is one of the nine regions of Western Australia. It is located in the south-eastern corner of Western Australia, and comprises the local government areas of Coolgardie, Dundas, Esperance, Kalgoorlie–Boulder, Laverton, Leonora, Menzies, Ngaanyatjarraku, Ravensthorpe and Wiluna.

It also incorporates the area along the Great Australian Bight to the South Australian border known as the Nullarbor Plain.

==Geography==
The Goldfields–Esperance region is the largest of Western Australia&#x27;s regions, with an area of . It is mostly a low and flat plateau of extremely ancient Precambrian rocks that have been stable since long before the Paleozoic Era. Because of the extreme geological stability and the absence of glaciation since the Carboniferous, the soils are extremely infertile and generally quite saline. Consequently, the region supports the lowest stocking rates in the world: it is considered that one sheep per square mile is the maximum sustainable rate except in the small wetter area near Esperance. There are no rivers; any rainfall that is not absorbed by the dense rooting systems of the native flora percolates to form extremely saline groundwater, which is very frequently too salty even for adult sheep.

In the 1890s the &quot;goldfields&quot; term was used for country between Southern Cross and Coolgardie; however, as the gold fields extended to Kalgoorlie and beyond, the term &quot;Eastern Goldfields&quot; was used for the locations in vicinity of Kalgoorlie at that stage.

The Little Sandy Desert and the Gibson Desert are found in the northern part of the region, with the Great Victoria Desert in the south east.

==Climate==
The climate is mostly hot and dry. Annual rainfall is typically around per year and can be very variable, except in the small area near Esperance and Cape Arid National Park where reliable winter rainfall can give annual totals as high as 635 mm (25 inches) falling mainly in the winter months. Most rainfall is produced by thunderstorms in spring or summer or by cloudbands from the northwest in autumn and winter, but sometimes cyclones from the Pilbara decay into rain depressions and produce heavy rainfall. Climate change has already had a major impact: in the Kalgoorlie – Eucla – Wiluna – Giles area annual rainfall has increased by over 40 percent since 1967 – probably due to lower frequencies of anticyclones located over the interior of Australia instead of the adjacent oceans.

==Population==
The region has a population of just under 60,000 people, about half of whom live in the City of Kalgoorlie–Boulder. Another quarter live in the Shire of Esperance, and the remaining shires are very sparsely populated. Nearly 10% of the region&#x27;s population are of Aboriginal descent, which is substantially higher than the state as a whole.

==Economy==
The economy of the Goldfields sub-region is based on the extraction and processing of various mineral resources, primarily gold and nickel. In 2012 the mining of gold, nickel and platinum yielded just under A$9 billion.

Pastoralism in the northern goldfields commenced in the early 1900s with Yundamindera Station being established by Dr. Laver. In 1923 Yundmindera was purchased along with Mount Celia Station with a combined area of over by T. H. Pearse, who stocked the property with sheep. Between 1925 and 1928 were established, and over £1,500,000 was invested in properties in the northern and eastern goldfields. In three months of 1925 over 40,000 sheep were railed to the area and in one month of 1927 seven trains carrying sheep arrived. By 1934 the goldfields were stocked with over 500,000 sheep and 25,000 cattle. Shearing the same year produced approximately 11,667 bales of wool valued at £243,600.

Further south near Esperance, the economy is based on agriculture, with wheat, canola and barley widely grown and making up about 80% of the area&#x27;s agricultural economy. These crops require huge inputs of fertilisers because of the sandy nature of the soils and are a major threat to the region&#x27;s great plant diversity. In 2021–22, the Esperance zone harvested 3,550,000 tonnes of grain. Pastoralism is also common, with both sheep and cattle stations being common in the area. Along the coast fishing and aquaculture are common, with fisheries for abalone, pilchards and sharks.

<doc id="491936" wikidata="Q272460" url="?curid=491936" title="Pilates">
<text>Pilates (; ) is a type of mind-body exercise developed in the early 20th century by German physical trainer Joseph Pilates, after whom it was named. Pilates called his method &quot;Contrology&quot;. It is practiced worldwide, especially in developed countries such as Australia, Canada, Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Pilates uses a combination of around 50 repetitive exercises to spur muscle exertion. Each exercise flows from the &quot;five essentials&quot;: breath, cervical alignment, rib and scapular stabilization, pelvic mobility, and utilization of the transversus abdominis. Each exercise is typically repeated three to five times. As of 2023, over 12 million people practice Pilates.

Pilates developed in the aftermath of the late nineteenth century physical culture of exercising to alleviate ill health. There is, however, only limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate problems such as lower back pain. While studies have found that regular sessions improve balance, and can help muscle conditioning in healthy adults (compared to doing no exercise), it has not been shown to be an effective treatment for any medical condition.

== History ==
Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates from Mönchengladbach, Germany. His father was a gymnast and his mother a naturopath. 

Pilates said that the inspiration for his method came to him during World War I, while he was being held at the Knockaloe internment camp in the Isle of Man. Pilates spent four years there, working on his fellow internees, developing his method of a system of exercises intended to strengthen the human mind and body, believing that mental and physical health were interrelated.

In his youth, Pilates had practiced many of the physical training regimens available in Germany, and it was from these that he developed his own method. It has clear connections with the physical culture of the late nineteenth century, such as the use of special apparatuses, and claims that the exercises could cure ill health. It is also related to the tradition of &quot;corrective exercise&quot; or &quot;medical gymnastics&quot; as typified by Pehr Henrik Ling.
Pilates accompanied his method with a variety of equipment, which he called &quot;apparatus&quot;. Each apparatus was designed to help accelerate the process of stretching, strengthening, body alignment and increased core strength started by mat work. The best-known and most popular apparatus today, the Reformer, was originally called the Universal Reformer, aptly named for &quot;universally reforming the body&quot;. Eventually Pilates designed other apparatus, including the Cadillac, Wunda Chair, High &quot;Electric&quot; Chair, Spine Corrector, Ladder Barrel and Pedi-Pole.

He published two books related to his training method: &quot;Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising That Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education&quot; (1934) and &quot;Return to Life Through Contrology&quot; (1945).

During his lifetime, Joseph Pilates directly trained and certified two assistants, Kathy Stanford Grant and Lolita San Miguel.

== Description ==
A systematic review of Pilates in 2012 examined its literature to form a consensus description of it, and found it could be described as &quot;a mind-body exercise that requires core stability, strength, and flexibility, and attention to muscle control, posture, and breathing&quot;.

According to The New York Times, Pilates &quot;can be tailored to a spectrum of fitness goals, ages and abilities&quot;. Pilates is not a cardiovascular workout, but rather a strength and flexibility workout. There are various elements that contribute to distinguishing Pilates from other forms of resistance training. For example, Pilates places a heavy emphasis on breathwork and creating a mind-body connection. Joseph Pilates even states &quot;Above all, learn how to breathe correctly.&quot; Participants consciously use the core and breath for all forms of movement.

In his book &quot;Return to Life through Contrology&quot;, Joseph Pilates presented his method as the art of controlled movements, which should look and feel like a workout (not a therapy) when properly done. If practiced consistently, Pilates improves flexibility, builds strength, and develops control and endurance in the entire body. It puts emphasis on alignment, breathing, developing a strong core, and improving coordination and balance. The core, consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back and hips, is often called the &quot;powerhouse&quot; and is thought to be the key to a person&#x27;s stability. Pilates&#x27; system allows for exercises to be modified in difficulty, from beginner to advanced or any other level, and to accommodate the instructor&#x27;s and practitioner&#x27;s goals and/or limitations. Their intensity can be increased as the body adapts itself to the exercises.

A number of versions of Pilates are taught today; most are based on up to nine principles.

Pilates Teachers who have completed extensive training covering all aspects of Pilates, including mat work and apparatus-based exercises, such as the Reformer, Cadillac, Chair, and Barrel are referred to as Comprehensive Pilates Teachers.

== Effectiveness ==
In 2015 the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published a meta study which reviewed the existing literature on 17 alternative therapies, including Pilates, to determine whether any were suitable for being covered by health insurance. The review found that due to the small number and methodologically limited nature of the existing studies, the effectiveness of Pilates was uncertain. Accordingly, in 2017, the Australian government named it a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would &quot;ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence&quot;.

For the treatment of lower back pain, low-quality evidence suggests that while Pilates is better than doing nothing, it is no more effective than other forms of physical exercise. There is some evidence that regular sessions can help condition the abdominal muscles of healthy people, when compared to doing no exercise. There is no good evidence that it helps improve balance in elderly people.

From the limited data available, it would seem from the statistically and clinically significant findings that Pilates has demonstrated efficacy as a tool for the rehabilitation of a wide range of conditions.

== Mat and reformer Pilates ==

Pilates is continuously evolving through the use of modern equipment, but the core of the technique is tied to the movement patterns designed by Joseph Pilates. Pilates can be performed on both a mat or on specialized equipment. Pilates often incorporates spring-based resistance machines known as reformers, which consists of a box-like frame, sliding platform, springs, straps/ropes, and pulleys that help support the spine and target different muscle groups. For example, in order to target the upper back, a typical Pilates move on the reformer involves lying face-down on top of an accessory called a long box which is placed on top of the sliding platform. The participant then lifts their head and chest while pulling back the straps down toward their hips to slide forward with the moving platform and repeating a few times. The straps can be heavier or lighter depending on the resistance that is controlled by the springs.

With mat Pilates, people sit or lie with their body weight as the main resistance, using gravity to stabilize their core. For example, a common mat Pilates exercise is called &quot;roll-up&quot;, where participants start by sitting on the floor with their legs straight out in front of them and their arms extended over their legs. Participants then slowlyusing the breath to control the motionuncurl their upper bodies backward toward a supinated lying down position, until they are indeed lying down on their backs with their arms out over their heads. They then curl back up into the starting position as they exhale, repeating this process multiple times.

Accessories such as resistance circle rings or resistance bands may be used in both mat and reformer Pilates.

== Comparison with yoga ==
Modern yoga, like Pilates, is a mind-and-body discipline, though yoga classes are more likely to address spiritual aspects explicitly. Both yoga and Pilates incorporate elements of stretching and breathing. Both are low-impact, low-intensity exercises, but there are key differences. When practicing yoga, individuals hold certain poses for longer periods of time and flow into others; when practicing Pilates, individuals move their arms or legs while in certain positions. With yoga, breath is used for relaxation and to hold poses. With Pilates, breath is used to power the muscles with more energy. Most Pilates exercises start from lying down, while most yoga poses start from standing up.

Some poses are similar in the two disciplines, for example, open leg balance closely resembles Navasana (boat pose), roll over is similar to Halasana (plough pose), and swan and push-up are essentially identical to Bhujangasana (cobra pose) and Chaturanga Dandasana (low plank pose). Both disciplines develop strength, flexibility and fitness. Pilates, however, emphasises core strength, while yoga emphasizes flexibility.

==Legal status==
Pilates is not professionally regulated.

In October 2000, &quot;Pilates&quot; was ruled a generic term by a U.S. federal court, making it free for unrestricted use. The term is still capitalized in writing due to its origin from the proper name of the method&#x27;s founder.

As a result of the court ruling, the Pilates Method Alliance was formed as a professional association for the Pilates community. Its purpose is to provide an international organization to connect teachers, teacher trainers, studios, and facilities dedicated to preserving and enhancing the legacy of Joseph H. Pilates and his exercise method by establishing standards, encouraging unity, and promoting professionalism.

<text>World Climate Report, a newsletter edited by Patrick Michaels, was produced by the Greening Earth Society, a non-profit organization created by the Western Fuels Association.

Early editions were paper based; it was then transferred to a web-only format, having ceased publication as a physically based report with Volume 8 in 2002. It existed until 2019 in blog form at www.worldclimatereport.com, although the website itself was not updated after late 2012.

World Climate Report presented a dismissive view of anthropogenic-driven mass global climate change, or as it calls it, &#x27;Global Warming Alarmism&#x27;. However, it did not reject other well-established and widely accepted scientific concepts such as global climate change itself or the greenhouse effect, in general attempting to engender itself as giving a well balanced and scientific view of the sources (though often at a contrary expense of its perceived adversaries: the aforementioned alleged &#x27;Global Warming Alarmists&#x27;).

WCR says of itself:

: &quot;World Climate Report, a concise, hard-hitting and scientifically correct response to the global change reports which gain attention in the literature and popular press. As the nation&#x27;s leading publication in this realm, World Climate Report is exhaustively researched, impeccably referenced, and always timely. This popular biweekly newsletter points out the weaknesses and outright fallacies in the science that is being touted as &quot;proof&quot; of disastrous warming. It&#x27;s the perfect antidote against those who argue for proposed changes to the Rio Climate Treaty, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which are aimed at limiting carbon emissions from the United States ... World Climate Report has become the definitive and unimpeachable source for what &quot;nature&quot; now calls the “mainstream skeptic” point of view.&quot; .

In addition to Patrick Michaels (chief editor), the staff is listed as Robert C. Balling, Jr (contributing editor), Robert Davis (contributing editor), and Paul Knappenberger (Administrator).

<doc id="491940" wikidata="Q2383974" url="?curid=491940" title="Latent homosexuality">
<text>Latent homosexuality is an erotic attraction toward members of the same sex that is not consciously experienced or expressed in overt action. This may mean a hidden inclination or potential for interest in homosexual relationships, which is either suppressed or not recognized, and which has not yet been explored, or may never be explored.

The term was originally proposed by Sigmund Freud. Some argue that latent homosexuality is a potentially iatrogenic effect (that is, it is not present until suggested by a therapist). Others argue that the term latent is not truly applicable in the case of homosexual urges, since they are often not in the unconscious or unexpressed category, but rather exist in the conscious mind and are (often violently) repressed on a conscious level.

==Links to homophobia==

A theory that homophobia is a result of latent homosexuality was put forth in the late 20th century. A 1996 study from the University of Georgia by Henry Adams, Lester Wright Jr., and Bethany Lohr was conducted concerning this theory. The research was done on 64 heterosexual men, 35 of whom exhibited homophobic traits and 29 who did not. They were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W.W. Hudson &amp; W.A. Ricketts, 1980). The groups did not differ in aggression.

Three tests were conducted using penile plethysmography. While there was no difference in response when the men were exposed to heterosexual and lesbian pornography, there was a major difference in response when the men were exposed to male homosexual pornography.

The researchers reported that 24% of the non-homophobic men showed some degree of tumescence in response to the male homosexual video, compared to 54% of the subjects who scored high on the homophobia scale. In addition, 66% of the non-homophobic group showed no significant increases in tumescence after this video, but only 20% of the homophobic men failed to display any arousal. Additionally, when the participants rated their degree of sexual arousal later, the homophobic men significantly underestimated their degree of arousal by the male homosexual video.

The results of this study indicate that individuals who score in the homophobic range and admit negative affect toward homosexuality demonstrate significant sexual arousal to male homosexual erotic stimuli.

A possible explanation is found in various psychoanalytic theories, which have generally explained homophobia as a threat to an individual&#x27;s own homosexual impulses causing repression, denial, or reaction formation (or all three; West, 1977). Generally, these varied explanations conceive of homophobia as one type of latent homosexuality where persons either are unaware of or deny their homosexual urges.

Another explanation of these data is found in Barlow, Sakheim, and Beck&#x27;s (1983) theory of the role of anxiety and attention in sexual responding. It is possible that viewing homosexual stimuli causes negative emotions such as anxiety in homophobic men but not in nonhomophobic men. Because anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection, this theory would predict increases in erection in homophobic men.

A 2013 study did not find any connection between homophobia and attraction to the same sex. Same-sex attraction was related to positive evaluations of gay men and lesbians among female participants.

==Links to environment==
Situational homosexuality may be due to exposure to a single-gender environment, such as a single-sex school, prison, or military service.

==In fiction==
In Kingsley Amis&#x27; 1966 book &quot;The Anti-Death League&quot;, the main character is introduced while resisting treatment for repressed homosexuality – which a doctor believes that he has – despite the man being openly homosexual.

Latent homosexual themes were a common theme of science fiction films of the 1950s.

In the 1999 film &quot;American Beauty&quot;, the character Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) is depicted as being a latent homosexual. Throughout the film, Fitts makes several statements that are narrow-minded and homophobic, and it disturbs the colonel that his son Ricky might be homosexual. However, toward the end of the film, it is revealed that Fitts has sexual feelings toward men when he approaches his neighbor Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and kisses him, but Lester rejects Col. Fitts, and this greatly humiliates him.

<doc id="491949" wikidata="Q7867608" url="?curid=491949" title="USS Bass (SS-164)">
<text>USS &quot;Bass&quot; (SF-5/SS-164), a &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class submarine and one of the &quot;V-boats&quot;, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bass.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bass&quot;′s keel was laid at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched as &quot;V-2&quot; (SF-5) on 27 December 1924 sponsored by Mrs. Douglas E. Dismukes, wife of Captain Dismukes, and commissioned on 26 September 1925. Like her sisters, &quot;Bass&quot; was designed to meet the fleet submarine requirement of surface speed for operating with contemporary battleships.

==Engineering==

&quot;V-2&quot; was completed with two Busch-Sulzer direct-drive 6-cylinder 2-cycle main diesel engines of each, along with two Busch-Sulzer auxiliary diesel engines of each, driving electrical generators. The latter were primarily for charging batteries, but to reach maximum surfaced speed, they could augment the mechanically coupled main-propulsion engines by supplying supplemental power to the 1,200 hp (890 kW) electric motors that were intended for submerged propulsion. Although it wasn&#x27;t until about 1939 that its problems were fully solved, electric transmission in a pure diesel-electric arrangement became the propulsion system for the successful fleet submarines of World War II, the &quot;Porpoise-class&quot;, and the &quot;Tambor&quot;-class through the &quot;Tench&quot;-class. Prior to recommissioning in 1940, the auxiliary diesels were replaced with two BuEng Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg AG (MAN-designed) 6-cylinder 4-cycle diesel engines of each. In 1942-43 &quot;Bass&quot; was converted to a cargo submarine, with the main engines removed to provide cargo space, significantly reducing her speed on the remaining auxiliary diesels.

==Service history==

===Inter-War Period===
&quot;V-2&quot; was assigned to Submarine Division 20 (SubDiv 20) and cruised along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea until November 1927, when the Division sailed for San Diego, California, arriving on 3 December 1927. &quot;V-2&quot; operated with the fleet on the West Coast, in the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Caribbean Sea until December 1932. During this period her 5 inch (127 mm)/51 caliber deck gun was replaced by a 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber weapon.

Renamed &quot;Bass&quot; on 9 March 1931, she was assigned to SubDiv 12 in April. On 1 July, her hull classification symbol was changed from SF-5 to SS-164. On 2 January 1933, she was assigned to Rotating Reserve SubDiv 15, San Diego. &quot;Bass&quot; rejoined the fleet again in July and cruised along the West Coast, in the Canal Zone, and in the Hawaiian Islands until January 1937. She then departed the West Coast and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 18 February 1937, where she went out of commission in reserve on 9 June.

===World War II===
&quot;Bass&quot; was recommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 5 September 1940, and assigned to SubDiv 9, Atlantic Fleet. From February–November 1941, she operated along the New England coast and made two trips to St. George, Bermuda. She arrived at Coco Solo, Canal Zone on 24 November and was on duty there when the Japanese launched their attack on Pearl Harbor.

In 1942, &quot;Bass&quot; was attached to Submarine Squadron 3 (SubRon 3), SubDiv 31, Atlantic Fleet. From March–August, while based at Coco Solo, she made four war patrols in the Pacific, off Balboa, Panama. While at sea on 17 August 1942, a fire broke out in the after battery room and quickly spread to the aft torpedo room and starboard main electric motor, resulting in the death of 26 enlisted men by asphyxiation. The following day, arrived to assist the submarine and escorted her into the Gulf of Dulce, Costa Rica. Both then proceeded to Balboa.

&quot;Bass&quot; remained in the Canal Zone until October 1942, when she departed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, arriving on 19 October. &quot;Bass&quot; was then overhauled at Philadelphia Navy Yard. At this time she was converted to a cargo submarine with the removal of her main engines, severely restricting her speed on the remaining auxiliary engines. &quot;Bass&quot; proceeded to New London, Connecticut where she conducted secret experiments off Block Island in December 1943. She was again in Philadelphia for repairs from January–March 1944. During the remainder of the year, she was attached to SubRon 1, Atlantic Fleet, and operated out of New London in the area between Long Island and Block Island.

&quot;Bass&quot; was decommissioned at the Naval Submarine Base New London on 3 March 1945 and expended as a target for the Mark 24 Fido &quot;mine&quot; (actually an acoustic homing torpedo) on 12 March 1945. The location of the wreck is .

<text>USS &quot;Cachalot&quot; (SC-4/SS-170) was a United States Navy submarine and the lead ship of her class, known as the &quot;V-boats&quot; and named for the sperm whale. Her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 19 October 1933 as &quot;V-8&quot; (SC-4) sponsored by Miss K. D. Kempff, and commissioned on 1 December 1933 with Lieutenant Commander Merril Comstock in command. &quot;Cachalot&quot; was the first submarine to have the Torpedo Data Computer, Arma Corporation&#x27;s Mark 1, installed.

==Design==
&quot;Cachalot&quot; was built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, as were most of the previous V-boats. Design conservatism and economic realities forced Portsmouth to continue to use riveting in the construction of the inner and outer hulls, although non-critical areas like the superstructure, piping brackets, support framing, and interior tankage were actually welded. Her sister, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; (the first submarine built by Electric Boat since the S-class of 1925) had most of the outer hull and fuel tanks welded, while retaining riveting for the inner hull. Both were medium-sized submarines built under the tonnage limits of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. An extensive study was conducted to determine the optimum submarine size under the treaty restrictions, factoring in total force, endurance, and percentage of the force that could be maintained on station far from a base, as in a Pacific war scenario. Despite the calculation process, size reduction had gone too far with the &quot;Cachalot&quot;s, limiting their patrol endurance. After three Pacific war patrols, &quot;Cachalot&quot; was relegated to training duties in September 1942, once numerous &quot;Gato&quot;-class boats became available.

The as-built engine specifications were two BuEng-built, MAN-designed M9Vu 40/46 nine-cylinder two-cycle direct drive main diesel engines, each, with one BuEng MAN two-cycle auxiliary diesel engine, driving a electric generator. The auxiliary engine was for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing power to the main electric motors. As with most V-boats, the main engines proved troublesome, and were replaced in 1937-38 by two Winton GM 16-278 16-cylinder four-cycle diesels, each.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
After shakedown, further construction, tests, and overhaul, &quot;Cachalot&quot; sailed for San Diego, California, where on 17 October 1934 she joined the Submarine Force, U.S. Fleet. Operating until 1937 principally on the West Coast, she engaged in fleet problems, torpedo practice, and antisubmarine, tactical, and sonar training exercises. She cruised twice to Hawaiian waters and once to the Panama Canal Zone to participate in large-scale fleet exercises.

&quot;Cachalot&quot; cleared San Diego on 16 June 1937, bound for New London, Connecticut, and duty in experimental torpedo firing for the Newport Torpedo Station and sonar training for the New London Submarine School until 26 October 1937, when she began a lengthy overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. This included replacement of her troublesome engines with General Motors Winton engines. A year later, she sailed for participation in a fleet problem, torpedo practice and sound training in the Caribbean Sea and off the Canal Zone, and on 16 June 1939 reported at Pearl Harbor for duty with the Submarine Force and the Scouting Force.

===World War II===
War came to &quot;Cachalot&quot; as she lay in Pearl Harbor Navy Yard in overhaul. In the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor of 7 December 1941, one of her men was wounded, but the submarine suffered no damage. Yard work on her was completed at a furious pace, and on 12 January 1942 she sailed on her first war patrol. After fueling at Midway Island, she conducted a reconnaissance of Wake Island, Eniwetok, Ponape, Truk, Namonuito, and the Hall Islands, returning to Pearl Harbor on 18 March with vitally needed intelligence of Japanese bases. Her second war patrol, for which she cleared from Midway on 9 June, was conducted off the Japanese home islands, where she damaged an enemy tanker. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 26 July, she cleared on her final war patrol on 23 September, penetrating the frigid waters of the Bering Sea in support of the Aleutian Islands operations.

Over-age and lacking endurance for strenuous war patrols, &quot;Cachalot&quot; still had a key role to play, acting as training ship for the Submarine School at New London. She served there from late 1942 until 30 June 1945, when she sailed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, being decommissioned there on 17 October. She was sold for scrap on 26 January 1947.

<doc id="491951" wikidata="Q7868692" url="?curid=491951" title="USS Cuttlefish (SS-171)">
<text>USS &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; (SC-5/SS-171), a and one of the &quot;V-boats,&quot; was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the cuttlefish. Her keel was laid down by Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 21 November 1933 sponsored by Mrs. B. S. Bullard, and commissioned on 8 June 1934, Lieutenant Commander Charles W. &quot;Gin&quot; Styer in command. &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; was the first submarine built entirely at Electric Boat&#x27;s facility in Groton, Connecticut; construction of previous Electric Boat designs had been subcontracted to other shipyards, notably Fore River Shipbuilding of Quincy, Massachusetts. Four Peruvian R-class submarines had previously been finished in Groton, using material from cancelled S-boats salvaged from Fore River.

==Design==

&quot;Cuttlefish&quot; differed from her sister &quot;Cachalot&quot; (built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard) mainly in her different internal arrangements and the incorporation of the first air conditioning plant in a USN submarine. Like all of the other V-boats (except &quot;V-1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;), she was built to a partial riveted/partial welded construction. Electric Boat expanded on the use of welding pioneered by Portsmouth, with most of &quot;Cuttlefish&#x27;s&quot; outer hull and fuel tanks welded, but with the internal pressure hull still riveted. This was entirely successful as it virtually eliminated the problem of fuel leakage caused by the riveted fuel tanks on earlier boats. Both were medium-sized submarines built under the tonnage limits of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. An extensive study was conducted to determine the optimum submarine size under the treaty restrictions, factoring in total force, endurance, and percentage of the force that could be maintained on station far from a base, as in a Pacific war scenario. Despite the calculation process, size reduction had gone too far with the &quot;Cachalot&quot;s, limiting their patrol endurance. After three Pacific war patrols, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; was relegated to training duties in September 1942, once numerous boats became available.

The as-built engine specifications were two BuEng-built, MAN-designed M9Vu 40/46 nine-cylinder two-cycle direct drive main diesel engines, each, with one BuEng MAN two-cycle auxiliary diesel engine, driving a electric generator. The auxiliary engine was for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing power to the main electric motors. As with most V-boats, the main engines proved troublesome, and were replaced in 1937-38 by two Winton GM 16-278 16-cylinder four-cycle diesels, each.

==Service history==

===Inter-War Period===
Departing New London, Connecticut on 15 May 1935, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; arrived at San Diego, California on 22 June. She sailed on torpedo practice and fleet tactics exercises along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian Islands until 28 June 1937, when she sailed for the Panama Canal, Miami, Florida, New York City, and New London, Connecticut.

Arriving at New London on 28 July, she conducted experimental torpedo firing, sound training, and other operations for the Submarine School. At this time her troublesome MAN engines were replaced with Winton GM engines at the New York Navy Yard in 1937–38, as were her sister&#x27;s. She sailed from New York City on 22 October 1938 for Coco Solo, where she conducted diving operations and other exercises for the training of submariners until 20 March 1939, sailing then for the Mare Island Navy Yard, California.

&quot;Cuttlefish&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 16 June and was based there on patrol duty, as well as joining in battle problems and exercises in the Hawaiian area. That autumn, she cruised to the Samoan Islands, and in 1940 to the West Coast. On 5 October 1941, she cleared Pearl Harbor for an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard.

===World War II===
After returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; put to sea on her first war patrol on 29 January 1942. On 13 February, she performed a reconnaissance of Marcus Island, gaining valuable information, and after patrolling in the Bonin Islands, returned to Midway Island on 24 March. She refitted there and at Pearl Harbor, and on 2 May cleared Midway for her second war patrol. From 18 to 24 May, she reconnoitered Saipan and the northern part of the Mariana Islands. On 19 May, she attacked a patrol ship, and while maneuvering for a second attack, was detected. She was forced deep to endure four hours of severe depth charging, more of which came her way on 24 May when she challenged three enemy destroyers. The next day an alert enemy plane caught her on the surface and dropped two bombs as she went under, both of them misses.

As it became obvious the Japanese Fleet was out in strength, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; was ordered to patrol about west of Midway, remaining on station during the Battle of Midway from 4–6 June 1942. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 June, and there and at Midway prepared for her third war patrol, for which she sailed on 29 July under the command of Lieutenant Commander Elliot E. Marshall. Patrolling off the Japanese homeland, she attacked a destroyer on 18 August, and received a punishing depth charge attack. Three days later, she launched a spread of torpedoes, three of which hit a freighter and one of which hit an escort. Explosions were seen, but the sinking could not be confirmed. On 5 September, she attacked a tanker which, it is believed, she sank.

Returning to Pearl Harbor on 20 September 1942, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; was ordered to New London, where she served the Submarine School as a training ship from December 1942 to October 1945. On 8 December 1944, she suffered minor damage in a collision with USS Bray (DE-709). She was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 24 October 1945, and sold for scrap on 12 February 1947.

<text>Energy bars are supplemental bars containing cereals, micronutrients, and flavor ingredients intended to supply quick food energy. Because most energy bars contain added protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and other nutrients, they may be marketed as functional foods. Manufacturing of energy bars may supply nutrients in sufficient quantity to be used as meal replacements.

==Nutrition==
A typical energy bar weighs between 30 and 50 grams and is likely to supply about 200–300 calories (840–1,300 joules), 3–9 grams of fat, 7–15 grams of protein, and 20–40 grams of carbohydrates — the three sources of energy in food. In order to provide energy quickly, most of the carbohydrates are various types of sugars like fructose, glucose, maltodextrin and others in various ratios, combined with complex carbohydrate sources, such as oats or barley. Proteins come mostly in the form of whey protein. Fats sources are often cocoa butter and dark chocolate.

== Usage ==
Energy bars are used in a variety of contexts. Energy bars may be used as an energy source during athletic events such as marathons, triathlons and other activities which require a high energy expenditure for long periods of time. They are also commonly used as meal replacements in weight-loss programs. They may be used as a snack. For those who are malnourished, energy bars, such as Plumpy&#x27;nut, are an effective tool for treating malnutrition.

<doc id="491961" wikidata="Q2449569" url="?curid=491961" title="Transparency (graphic)">
<text>Transparency in computer graphics is possible in a number of file formats. The term &quot;transparency&quot; is used in various ways by different people, but at its simplest there is &quot;full transparency&quot; i.e. something that is completely invisible. Only part of a graphic should be fully transparent, or there would be nothing to see. More complex is &quot;partial transparency&quot; or &quot;translucency&quot; where the effect is achieved that a graphic is partially transparent in the same way as colored glass. Since ultimately a printed page or computer or television screen can only be one color at a point, partial transparency is always simulated at some level by mixing colors. There are many different ways to mix colors, so in some cases transparency is ambiguous.

In addition, transparency is often an &quot;extra&quot; for a graphics format, and some graphics programs will ignore the transparency.

Raster file formats that support transparency include GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TGA and JPEG 2000, through either a &quot;transparent color&quot; or an alpha channel.

Most vector formats implicitly support transparency because they simply avoid putting any objects at a given point. This includes EPS and WMF. For vector graphics this may not strictly be seen as transparency, but it requires much of the same careful programming as transparency in raster formats.

More complex vector formats may allow transparency combinations between the elements within the graphic, as well as that above. This includes SVG and PDF.

A suitable raster graphics editor shows transparency by a special pattern, e.g. a checkerboard pattern.

==Transparent pixels==
One color entry in a single GIF or PNG image&#x27;s palette can be defined as &quot;transparent&quot; rather than an actual color. This means that when the decoder encounters a pixel with this value, it is rendered in the background color of the part of the screen where the image is placed, also if this varies pixel-by-pixel as in the case of a background image.

Applications include:
* an image that is not rectangular can be filled to the required rectangle using transparent surroundings; the image can even have holes (e.g. be ring-shaped)
* in a run of text, a special symbol for which an image is used because it is not available in the character set, can be given a transparent background, resulting in a matching background.

The transparent color should be chosen carefully, to avoid items that just happen to be the same color vanishing.

Even this limited form of transparency has patchy implementation, though most popular web browsers are capable of displaying transparent GIF images. This support often does not extend to printing, especially to printing devices (such as PostScript) which do not include support for transparency in the device or driver. Outside the world of web browsers, support is fairly hit-or-miss for transparent GIF files.

===Edge limitations of transparent pixels===
The edges of characters and other images with transparent background should not have shades of gray: these are normally used for intermediate colors between the color of the letter/image and that of the background, typically shades of gray being intermediate between a black letter and a white background. However, with, for example, a red background the intermediate colors would be dark red. Gray edge pixels would give an ugly and unclear result. For a variable background color there are no suitable fixed intermediate colors.

==Partial transparency by alpha channels==
Some image formats, such as PNG and TIFF, also allow partial transparency through an alpha channel, which solves the edge limitation problem. Instead of each pixel either being transparent or not transparent, it can be set to 254 levels of partially transparent, allowing some of the background image to show through the foreground image.

A major use of partial transparency is to produce &quot;soft edges&quot; in graphics so that they blend into their background. See also monochrome or with shades of gray and anti-aliasing. Partial transparency can also be used to make an image less prominent, such as a watermark or other logo; or to render something see-through, such as a ghostly apparition in a video game. Animating the alpha channel in an image-editing program can allow smooth transitions between different images.

The process of combining a partially transparent color with its background (&quot;compositing&quot;) is often ill-defined and the results may not be exactly the same in all cases. For example, where color correction is in use, should the colors be composited before or after color correction?


==Transparency by clipping path==
An alternative approach to full transparency is to use a clipping path. A clipping path is simply a shape or outline, that is used in conjunction with the other graphics. Everything inside the path is visible, and everything outside the path is invisible. The path is inherently vector, but can potentially be used to mask both vector and bitmap data. The main usage of clipping paths is in PostScript files.

==Compositing calculations==
While some transparency specifications are vague, others may give mathematical details of how two colors are to be composited. This gives a fairly simple example of how compositing calculations can work, can produce the expected results, and can also produce surprises.

In this example, two grayscale colors are to be composited. Grayscale values are considered to be numbers between 0.0 (white) and 1.0 (black). &quot;To emphasize: this is only one possible rule for transparency. If working with transparency, check the rules in use for your situation.&quot;

The color at a point, where color G1 and G2 are to be combined, is .
Some consequences of this are:
* Where the colors are equal, the result is the same color because .
* Where one color (G1) is white (0.0), the result is . This will always be less than any nonzero value of G2, so the result is whiter than G2. (This is easily reversed for the case where G2 is white).
* Where one color (G1) is black (1.0), the result is . This will always be more than G2, so the result is blacker than G2.
* The formula is commutative since . This means it does not matter which order two graphics are mixed i.e. which of the two is on the top and which is on the bottom.
* The formula is &quot;not&quot; associative since
 ( ( G1 + G2 ) / 2 + G3 ) / 2 = G1 / 4 + G2 / 4 + G3 / 2
 ( G1 + ( G2 + G3 ) / 2 ) / 2 = G1 / 2 + G2 / 4 + G3 / 4
This is important as it means that when combining three or more objects with this rule for transparency, the final color depends very much on the order of doing the calculations.

Although the formula is simple, it may not be ideal. Human perception of brightness is not linear - we do not necessarily consider that a gray value of 0.5 is halfway between black and white. Such details may not matter when transparency is used only to soften edges, but in more complex designs this may be significant. Most people working seriously with transparency will need to see the results and may fiddle with the colors or (where possible) the algorithm to arrive at the results they need.

This formula can easily be generalized to RGB color or CMYK color by applying the formula to each channel separately. For example, final . But it cannot be applied to all color models. For example, Lab color would produce results that were surprising.

An alternative model is that at every point in each element to be combined for transparency there is an associated color and opacity between 0 and 1. For each color channel, you might work with this model: if a channel with intensity and opacity overlays a channel with intensity and opacity the result will be a channel with intensity equal to , and opacity . Each channel must be multiplied by corresponding alpha value before composition (so called premultiplied alpha). The SVG file specification uses this type of blending, and this is one of the models that can be used in PDF.

Alpha channels may be implemented in this way, where the alpha channel provides an opacity level to be applied equally to all other channels. To work with the above formula, the opacity needs to be scaled to the range 0 to 1, whatever its external representation (often 0 to 255 if using 8 bit samples such as &quot;RGBA&quot;).

==Transparency in PDF==

Starting with version 1.4 of the PDF standard (Adobe Acrobat version 5), transparency (including translucency) is supported. Transparency in PDF files allows creators to achieve various effects, including adding shadows to objects, making objects semi-transparent and having objects blend into each other or into text. PDF supports many different blend modes, not just the most common averaging method, and the rules for compositing many overlapping objects allow choices (such as whether a group of objects are blended before being blended with the background, or whether each object in turn is blended into the background).

PDF transparency is a very complex model, its original specification by Adobe being over 100 pages long. A key source of complication is that blending objects with different color spaces can be tricky and error-prone as well as cause compatibility issues. Transparency in PDF was designed not to cause errors in PDF viewers that did not understand it – they would simply display all elements as fully opaque. However, this was a two-edged sword as users with older viewers, PDF printers, etc. could see or print something completely different from the original design.

The fact that the PDF transparency model is so complicated means that it is not well supported. This means that RIPs and printers often have problems printing PDFs with transparency. The solution to this is either to rasterize the image or to apply vector transparency flattening to the PDF. However vector transparency flattening is extremely complex and only supported by a few specialist packages.

==Transparency in PostScript==
The PostScript language has limited support for full (not partial) transparency, depending on the PostScript level. Partial transparency is available with the pdfmark extension, available on many PostScript implementations.

=== Level 1 ===
Level 1 PostScript offers transparency via two methods:

* A one-bit (monochrome) image can be treated as a mask. In this case the 1-bits can be painted any single color, while the 0-bits are not painted at all. This technique cannot be generalised to more than one color, or to vector shapes.
* Clipping paths can be defined. These restrict what part of all subsequent graphics can be seen. This can be used for any kind of graphic, however in level 1, the maximum number of nodes in a path was often limited to 1500, so complex paths (e.g. cutting around the hair in a photograph of a person&#x27;s head) often failed.

=== Level 2 ===
Level 2 PostScript adds no specific transparency features. However, by the use of patterns, arbitrary graphics can be painted through masks defined by any vector or text operations. This is, however, complex to implement. In addition, this too often reached implementation limits, and few if any application programs ever offered this technique.

=== Level 3 ===
Level 3 PostScript adds further transparency option for any raster image. A transparent color, or range of colors, can be applied; or a separate 1-bit mask can be used to provide an alpha channel.

===Encapsulated PostScript===
EPS files contain PostScript, which may be level 1, 2 or 3 and make use of the features above. A more subtle issue arises with the previews for EPS files that are typically used to show the view of the EPS file on screen. There are viable techniques for setting transparency in the preview. For example, a TIFF preview might use a TIFF alpha channel. However, many applications do not use this transparency information and will therefore show the preview as a rectangle. A semi-proprietary technique pioneered in Photoshop and adopted by a number of pre-press applications is to store a clipping path in a standard location of the EPS, and use that for display.

In addition, few of the programs that generate EPS previews will generate transparency information in the preview.

Some programs have sought to get around this by treating all white in the preview as transparent, but this too is problematic in the cases where some whites are &quot;not&quot; transparent.

More recently, applications have been appearing that ignore the preview altogether; they therefore get information on which parts of the preview to paint by interpreting the PostScript.

<doc id="491962" wikidata="Q472287" url="?curid=491962" title="Respiration (physiology)">
<text>In physiology,respiration is the transport of oxygen from the outside environment to the cells within tissues, and the removal of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction to the environment by a respiratory system.

The physiological definition of respiration differs from the biochemical definition, which refers to a metabolic process by which an organism obtains energy (in the form of ATP and NADPH) by oxidizing nutrients and releasing waste products. Although physiologic respiration is necessary to sustain cellular respiration and thus life in animals, the processes are distinct: cellular respiration takes place in individual cells of the organism, while physiologic respiration concerns the diffusion and transport of metabolites between the organism and the external environment.

Exchange of gases in the lung occurs by ventilation and perfusion. Ventilation refers to the in-and-out movement of air of the lungs and perfusion is the circulation of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths. Inhalation (breathing in) is usually an active movement that brings air into the lungs where the process of gas exchange takes place between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries. Contraction of the diaphragm muscle causes a pressure variation, which is equal to the pressures caused by elastic, resistive and inertial components of the respiratory system. In contrast, exhalation (breathing out) is usually a passive process, though there are many exceptions: when generating functional overpressure (speaking, singing, humming, laughing, blowing, snorting, sneezing, coughing, powerlifting); when exhaling underwater (swimming, diving); at high levels of physiological exertion (running, climbing, throwing) where more rapid gas exchange is necessitated; or in some forms of breath-controlled meditation. Speaking and singing in humans requires sustained breath control that many mammals are not capable of performing. 

The process of breathing does not fill the alveoli with atmospheric air during each inhalation (about 350 ml per breath), but the inhaled air is carefully diluted and thoroughly mixed with a large volume of gas (about 2.5 liters in adult humans) known as the functional residual capacity which remains in the lungs after each exhalation, and whose gaseous composition differs markedly from that of the ambient air. Physiological respiration involves the mechanisms that ensure that the composition of the functional residual capacity is kept constant, and equilibrates with the gases dissolved in the pulmonary capillary blood, and thus throughout the body. Thus, in precise usage, the words &quot;breathing&quot; and &quot;ventilation&quot; are hyponyms, not synonyms, of &quot;respiration&quot;; but this prescription is not consistently followed, even by most health care providers, because the term &quot;respiratory rate&quot; (RR) is a well-established term in health care, even though it would need to be consistently replaced with &quot;ventilation rate&quot; if the precise usage were to be followed. During respiration the C-H bonds are broken by oxidation-reduction reaction and so carbon dioxide and water are also produced. The cellular energy-yielding process is called cellular respiration.

<doc id="491964" wikidata="Q15304688" url="?curid=491964" title="Cat's cradle">
<text>Cat&#x27;s cradle is a game involving the creation of various string figures between the fingers, either individually or by passing a loop of string back and forth between two or more players. The true origin of the name is debated, though the first known reference is in &quot;The light of nature pursued&quot; by Abraham Tucker in 1768. The type of string, the specific figures, their order, and the names of the figures vary. Independent versions of this game have been found in indigenous cultures throughout the world, including in Africa, Eastern Asia, the Pacific Islands, Australia, the Americas, and the Arctic.

==Play==
The simplest version of the game involves a player using a long string loop to make a complex figure using their fingers and hands.

Another version of the game consists of two or more players making a sequence of string figures, each altering the figure made by the previous player. The game begins with one player making the eponymous figure &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (above). After each figure, the next player manipulates that figure and removes the string figure from the hands of the previous player with one of a few simple motions and tightens the loop to create another figure, for example, &quot;Diamonds&quot;. &quot;Diamonds&quot; might then lead to &quot;Candles&quot; (which is also known as &quot;Pinkies&quot;), for example, and then &quot;Manger&quot;—an inverted &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;—and so on. Most of the core figures allow a choice between two or more subsequent figures: for example, &quot;Fish in a Dish&quot; can become &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; or &quot;Manger&quot;. The game ends when a player makes a mistake or creates a dead-end figure, which cannot be turned into anything else. Many players believe that &quot;Two Crowns&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Crown&quot; is one such dead-end figure, although more experienced players recognize that it can be creatively maneuvered into &quot;Candles&quot; or &quot;Pinkies&quot;, which allows the game to continue.

==History==
The origin of the name &quot;cat&#x27;s cradle&quot; is debated but the first known reference is in &quot;The light of nature pursued&quot; by Abraham Tucker in 1768. 

The name may have come from a corruption of cratch-cradle, or manger cradle (although this derivation is disputed by the OED). The connection between the two words, &quot;cratches&quot; and &quot;cradle&quot;, may come from the Christian story of the birth of Jesus, in which a manger is used as a cradle.

In an 1858 &quot;Punch&quot; cartoon it is referred to as &quot;scratch cradle&quot;, a name supported by Brewer&#x27;s 1898 &quot;Dictionary&quot;. As &quot;Cat&#x27;s cradle&quot; often is used to refer to string figures and games in general, Jayne uses &quot;Real Cat&#x27;s-Cradle&quot; to refer to the specific game.

Different cultures have different names for the game, and often different names for the individual figures. The French word for manger is &quot;crèche&quot;, and cattle feed racks are still known as &quot;cratches&quot;. In Japan it is called “ayatori.” In Korea it is called &quot;sil-tteu-gi.&quot; In Russia the whole game is called simply, &quot;the game of string&quot;, and the &quot;diamonds&quot; pattern is called &quot;carpet&quot;, with other pattern names such as &quot;field&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, and &quot;sawhorse&quot; for the other figures—a &quot;cat&quot; isn&#x27;t mentioned. The game may have originated in China. In China the game is called 翻繩 &quot;fan sheng&quot; (), In Israel the game is called &quot;Knitting Grandmother&quot; (in Hebrew: &quot;סבתא סורגת&quot;, &quot;Savta Soreget&quot;). In some regions of the U.S., this game also is known as &quot;Jack in the Pulpit&quot;.

==World records==

Geneva Hultenius, Maryann Divona, and Rita Divona completed 21,200 changes of cat&#x27;s cradles in 21 hours in Chula Vista, California between August 17–18, 1974. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; reported it as a world record in the 1975 and 1976 editions.

Jane Muir and Robyn Lawrick completed 22,700 changes of cat&#x27;s cradles in 21 hours at Calgary Market Mall, Alberta, Canada on August 25, 1976.

<doc id="491968" wikidata="Q456407" url="?curid=491968" title="Transshipment">
<text>Transshipment, trans-shipment or transhipment is the shipment of goods or containers to an intermediate destination, then to another destination.

One possible reason for transshipment is to change the means of transport during the journey (e.g., from ship transport to road transport), known as transloading. Another reason is to combine small shipments into a large shipment (consolidation), or the opposite: dividing a large shipment into smaller shipments (deconsolidation). Transshipment usually takes place in transport hubs. Much international transshipment also takes place in designated customs areas, thus avoiding the need for customs checks or duties, otherwise a major hindrance for efficient transport.

An item handled (from the shipper&#x27;s point of view) as a single movement is not generally considered transshipped, even if it changes from one mode of transport to another at several points. Previously, it was often not distinguished from transloading, since each leg of such a trip was typically handled by a different shipper.

Transshipment is normally fully legal and an everyday part of world trade. However, it can also be a method used to disguise intent, as is the case with illegal logging, smuggling, or grey-market goods.

==Transshipment at container ports or terminals==
The transshipment of containers at a container port or terminal can be defined as the number (or proportion) of containers, possibly expressed in TEU, of the total container flow that is handled at the port or terminal and, after temporary storage in the stack, transferred to another ship to reach their destinations. The exact definition of transshipment may differ between ports, mostly depending on the inclusion of inland water transport (barges operating on canals and rivers to the hinterland). The definition of transshipment may:
*include only seaborne transfers (a change to another international deep-sea container ship); or
*include both seaborne and inland waterway ship transfers (sometimes called &quot;water-to-water&quot; transshipment). Most coastal container ports in China have a large proportion of riverside &quot;transshipment&quot; to the hinterland.
In both cases, a single, unique, transshipped container is counted twice in the port performance, since it is handled twice by the waterside container cranes (separate unloading from arriving ship A, waiting in the stack, and loading onto departing ship B).

== Transshipment at sea ==

Transshipment at sea is done by transferring goods from one ship to another. 

=== Fisheries ===
In global fisheries transshipment is used to transfer catch to refrigerated cargo vessels that also supply fishing vessels with fuel, food, equipment and personnel allowing them to stay at sea for months or even years. This guarantees that fish quickly find their way to the market without a decrease in quality.

Since transshipment at sea encounters often happen on the high seas, in regions with poor regulation and oversight, they are also used to disguise criminal activities such as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, forced labor, human trafficking and drug smuggling. Several states and regional fishery management organizations have therefore prohibited the practice for certain vessel types or issued a complete ban within their zone of jurisdiction.

=== Bulk products ===
Transshipment at sea also occurs in the export of bulk products. Choosing to transship reduces capital costs for port developers and can overcome problems arising from limited access to deep water. Loading barges typically specify 4 to 7 meters of draft. Since at least 2011, transshipment has been used in northern Australia in the export of bulk minerals including bauxite, iron ore and potash from mines in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

== Transshipment at a break-of-gauge ==
At a break-of-gauge, cargo is transloaded from boxcars or covered goods wagons on one track to wagons on another track of a different rail gauge, or else containers are transloaded from flatcars on one track to flatcars on another track of a different gauge.

<doc id="491972" wikidata="Q924476" url="?curid=491972" title="Florida group">
<text>The Florida group (Sp.: &quot;grupo Florida&quot;) was an &quot;avant-garde&quot; literary-artistic group created in the 1920s in Buenos Aires, known by their embracing slogan &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;. The name refers to Florida Street, the location of a favored meeting point, the Richmond tea room.

The group was identified with the magazines &quot;Proa&quot; and &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;, the latter named after the long poem &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;, generally considered the greatest work of nineteenth-century Argentine literature. The group is also often referred to as the Martín Fierro group (Sp. &quot;grupo Martín Fierro&quot;).

==Members==

Among the best-known members of the Florida group were Oliverio Girondo, Norah Lange, Ricardo Güiraldes, Norah Borges, Péle Pastorino, Francisco Luis Bernárdez, Leopoldo Marechal, Conrado Nalé Roxlo, and Raúl González Tuñón.

Güiraldes was something of a father figure to many Florida members; already a major figure, he spent the 1920s writing his masterpiece Don Segundo Sombra and studying Hindu philosophy. He died in 1927, while planning a trip to India.

Nicolás Olivari, who co-founded the more political Boedo group, later became a member of the Florida group. The fiercely independent Roberto Arlt met with both groups on an irregular basis, but committed to none.

==Tendencies==

Eventually, the group evolved into two branches, the Florida meeting in Downtown Buenos Aires at the Galeria Pacifico, with an artistic and literary agenda following feminist approach, and the Boedo meeting in the Offshores of the city at the futbol stadium of Club Atletico San Lorenzo, with predominantly male attendants with a socio-political agenda following an avant-garde labour approach.

Jorge Luis Borges was not a regular in Florida meetings, but was a frequent contributor to &quot;Proa&quot; and &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;. Actually, Borges claimed that the entire Florida-Boedo rivalry was a pointless imitation of European fashions and that he should indeed belong to Boedo because of geography (he lived at that time in Bulnes Street, the name Boedo Street takes after it crosses Rivadavia Avenue).

Arturo Cancela suggested in a letter to &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; that both sides merge under the common name of &quot;Schools of Floredo street&quot; and name Manuel Gálvez as president, as he lived on Pueyrredón street, equidistant from both groups. By 1930, all the involved parties had concluded that the perceived rivalry was no longer an issue. Girondo (for Florida) and Castelnuovo (for Boedo) wrote newspaper articles to that effect.

==Members&#x27; prosecution: military coup &amp; the Peronist Party==

After the 1930 military coup that launched the &quot;Infamous Decade&quot;, the Florida constituency gravitated towards Victoria Ocampo&#x27;s &quot;Sur&quot; magazine, which thrived in spite of the ever-deteriorating state of Argentine politics — until the advent of Peronism in 1945.

During the 1960s and 1970s, left-wing and Peronist Argentine commentators identified &quot;the Florida Group&quot; to be a Liberalist Euro-centered movement mainly following the British and French avant-garde, cataloguing it with many of the perceived illnesses of Argentine society such as ignoring the aspirations and culture of the lower classes (which Peronism would articulate), looking towards Europe for inspiration, and being out of touch with any kind of productive work. González Tuñón alone was excepted from this treatment, because of the social themes of his poetry.

<doc id="491975" wikidata="Q7341840" url="?curid=491975" title="Robert Balling">
<text>Robert C. Balling, Jr. is an American climatologist. He is a professor of geography at Arizona State University, and the former director of its Office of Climatology. His research interests include climatology, global climate change, and geographic information systems. Balling has declared himself one of the scientists who oppose the consensus on global warming, arguing in a 2009 book that anthropogenic global warming &quot;is indeed real, but relatively modest&quot;, and maintaining that there is a publication bias in the scientific literature.

==Education and career==
Balling was born and raised in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and moved to Springfield, Ohio, in 1970 to attend Wittenberg University. Balling gained bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in geography in 1974 (Wittenberg University, BA) and 1975 (Bowling Green State University, MA), before gaining his PhD in geography from the University of Oklahoma in 1979. He was assistant professor at the University of Nebraska (1979–1984), before joining the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University. He gained tenure there in 1987, and served as the director of the Office of Climatology until 2004.

==Research==
Balling has published much research pertaining to various factors that influence the Earth&#x27;s climate. In 1988, Balling published a study which found that the construction of golf courses around Palm Springs, CA may have cooled the city over the preceding 15 years, in contrast to the warming effect usually associated with urban areas (also known as the urban heat island effect). Seven years later, Balling and Randall S. Cerveny, one of his ASU colleagues, published a study which found that the moon, when it is full, can cause Earth&#x27;s troposphere to warm by more than 0.03 °F. However, it remained unclear why the moon might be able to do this. When interviewed by the New York Times, Balling suggested the main reason might be that infrared radiation from the Sun is reflected towards Earth by the full moon. In 1998, Balling and Cerveny published a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; which found that man-made air pollutants, especially ozone and carbon monoxide, were influencing weather patterns on the East Coast of the United States. Their study also concluded that this effect was the strongest on Saturdays, and that this was so because &quot;...the end of the week brings worse air pollution than the beginning.&quot;

==Funding controversy==
Balling was mentioned as a fossil fuel industry – funded scientist in Ross Gelbspan&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;The Heat is On&quot;. This led the Minnesota &quot;Star Tribune&quot; to run an editorial speaking of a &quot;disinformation campaign&quot; by some climatologists. Balling and his colleague Patrick Michaels took a complaint against the Star Tribune to the Minnesota News Council. By a 9–4 decision the council &quot;voted to sustain the complaint that the Star Tribune editorial unfairly characterized the scientific reputations of Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling.&quot; At the 1998 hearing, Balling &quot;acknowledged that he had received $408,000 in research funding from the fossil fuel industry over the last decade (of which his University takes 50% for overhead).&quot;

Between December 1998 and September 2001 Balling was listed as a &quot;Scientific Adviser&quot; to the Greening Earth Society, a group that was funded and controlled by the Western Fuels Association (WFA), an association of coal-burning utility companies. WFA founded the group in 1997, according to an archived version of its website, &quot;as a vehicle for advocacy on climate change, the environmental impact of CO2, and fossil fuel use.&quot; In 2001, while it was directed by Balling, ASU&#x27;s office of climatology received $49,000 from ExxonMobil.

From 1989 to 2002, Balling received more than $679,000 from fossil-fuel-industry organizations; as of 2007, he also had received more than $7 million in research funding from the National Science Foundation and the EPA. He has also come under scrutiny because he was listed as a tentative author of the Heartland Institute&#x27;s NIPCC report; however, ASU&#x27;s vice president of public affairs, Virgil Renzulli, pointed out that this did not imply that Balling had been receiving money from Heartland. Balling himself added that his prior involvement with the Heartland Institute&#x27;s activities amounted only to appearing at a luncheon they held in 2008.

On February 24, 2015, Arizona State Representative Raúl Grijalva wrote letters to seven universities where climate change deniers (including Balling) worked, citing concerns about these scientists&#x27; conflicts of interest and non-disclosure of corporate funding. In these letters, Grijalva requested records on the funding and testimony prepared before a government body.

==Views on global warming==
Balling believes that humans are increasing the level of CO2 in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and that the Earth should warm as a result. Balling also considers the mainstream description of climate change to be &quot;a vastly overrated threat whose proposed solutions are worse than the problem.&quot; In particular, he has dismissed the idea that use of renewable energy could be an effective strategy for combating global warming as &quot;absurd.&quot; In the book &quot;Climate of Extremes&quot;, Balling, along with his co-author Patrick Michaels, contend that certain phenomena usually attributed to anthropogenic global warming have actually been occurring for more than a century. The phenomena named include the loss of ice on Mount Kilimanjaro. Balling has made similar statements about current sea level rise; namely, that it has been occurring for 8,000 years and it is therefore &quot;quite a stretch&quot; to blame it on global warming.

===Reaction to Balling&#x27;s views on global warming===
In the December 1995 issue of Harper&#x27;s Magazine, Ross Gelbspan described Balling and other global warming deniers as &quot;extraordinarily adept at draining the [global warming] issue of all sense of crisis.&quot; &quot;Climate of Extremes&quot; was reviewed in Foreign Affairs by Richard N. Cooper, who concluded that &quot;Even if the authors have cherry-picked their scientific papers, this book is a useful antidote to the heavy dose of hype to which the public is regularly subjected.&quot; By contrast, &quot;The Satanic Gases&quot;, another Balling-Michaels collaboration which was published in 2000, received a scathing review from &quot;American Scientist&quot;. Reviewer John Firor argued that the book &quot;does not fulfill&quot; its claim (on the dust jacket) that global warming predictions are &quot;simply wrong&quot;, that Michaels and Balling criticized the Kyoto Protocol without having read it, and that they quoted a well-known scientist out of context. After Balling wrote an article for TCS Daily harshly criticizing An Inconvenient Truth as scientifically inaccurate, his article was itself criticized as inaccurate by Judd Legum, who said that the article used &quot;misleading scientific arguments.&quot; Legum&#x27;s critique was endorsed by geochemist Eric Steig, a contributor to RealClimate, who said that &quot;All those points are accurate,&quot; and that &quot;Some of them could probably have been stronger; that is, Balling is even more wrong that Legum indicates.&quot;

<doc id="491976" wikidata="Q2333441" url="?curid=491976" title="Kappa Alpha Theta">
<text>Kappa Alpha Theta (), commonly referred to simply as Theta, is an international women’s fraternity (the term &quot;sorority&quot; had not yet been invented) founded on January 27, 1870, at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. It was the first Greek-letter fraternity established for women. The organization has 147 chapters at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. The organization was the first women&#x27;s fraternity to establish a chapter in Canada. Theta&#x27;s total living initiated membership, as of 2020, was more than 250,000. There are more than 200 alumnae chapters and circles worldwide.

Kappa Alpha Theta is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), an umbrella organization that encompasses 26 social sororities found throughout North America. The organization&#x27;s own headquarters are located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==History==
The &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; of Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at Indiana Asbury University, now DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, on January 27, 1870. The university began admitting women in 1867 after 30 years of a male-only student body. However, women were excluded from male-only clubs and societies. In response to the lack of women&#x27;s organizations, the fraternity&#x27;s founding members established the first Greek letter women&#x27;s organization. The Founders were:
*Elizabeth McReynolds Locke Hamilton (Bettie Locke)
*Alice Olive Allen Brant (Alice Allen)
*Elizabeth Tipton Lindsey (Bettie Tipton)
*Hannah Virginia Fitch Shaw (Hannah Fitch)

Bettie Locke developed the idea for a Greek letter women&#x27;s society through the encouragement of her father, a professor at Indiana Asbury and a member of Beta Theta Pi, and the members of Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) at Indiana Asbury, which included her brother. Initially, the collegiate men of FIJI offered Locke their badge as a token of their friendship, but voted against initiating her as a member. Locke refused to wear the badge as she did not know the secrets and purposes the badge represented, since she was unable to become a member. Ultimately, the fraternity gifted her a symbolic silver fruit basket instead to represent their relationship and fondness for her.

Upon discovering that there were no Greek letter fraternities for women in existence (only literary societies for women existed at the time), Locke decided to create her own Greek letter fraternity for women. Kappa Alpha Theta&#x27;s ritual, organizational structure, badge, and coat of arms were influenced by those of Beta Theta Pi and Phi Gamma Delta due to her familial connections. Locke and her friend Alice Allen wrote a constitution, planned rituals, designed a badge, and sought out women on campus to become members. Along with Hannah Fitch and Bettie Tipton, the first initiation was held in secret on January 27, 1870, establishing the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; of Kappa Alpha Theta.

Theta&#x27;s grand convention voted to establish a magazine in 1885 and to place its editorship with &quot;Kappa chapter&quot; at Kansas. In the intervening years, Kappa Alpha Theta&#x27;s magazine has undergone a change of title from &quot;The Journal&quot; to &quot;The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine&quot; and a change of publication schedule (from monthly to quarterly). &quot;The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine&quot; currently is published in April, June, September, and December of each year.

In 1887, Theta became an international organization with the establishment of the &quot;Sigma chapter&quot; at the University of Toronto. This became the first Canadian women&#x27;s fraternity.

G. William Domhoff, writing in &quot;Who Rules America?&quot;, listed Kappa Alpha Theta as one of &quot;the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige&quot; in the mid-1960s.

==Symbols==
Kappa Alpha Theta&#x27;s colors are black and gold. The official symbols are both the kite and twin stars, while the official flower is the black and gold pansy. The fraternity does not recognize an official stone. The badge is a black and gold kite with a white chevron in the middle.

== Chapters ==
Kappa Alpha Theta has more than 143 active college chapters and more than 212 alumnae chapters across the United States and Canada. Alumnae chapters are alumnae groups that have been granted charters from Grand Council. The following is a list of the chapters of Kappa Alpha Theta: 

== Philanthropy ==
The Kappa Alpha Theta Foundation was founded in 1960 and is the philanthropic arm of the organization. The Theta Foundation awards annual undergraduate and graduate scholarships to its members, awarding more than $1.1 million per year. In addition to scholarships, the Theta Foundation also supports the sorority&#x27;s educational programs as well as its international philanthropy, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA&#x27;s) are community volunteers who serve as the voice for abused and neglected foster care children who are going through the court system. CASA&#x27;s are appointed by a judge and their purpose is to ensure all legal actions made are in the child&#x27;s best interest. In order to directly volunteer at CASA you must be 21 years of age or older.

== Notable members ==

Some notable alumni of Kappa Alpha Theta include Agnes de Mille, Laura Bush, Barbara Bush, Jenna Bush, Tory Burch, Melinda French Gates, Amy Holmes, Sheryl Crow, Gretchen Whitmer, Kerri Strug, Rue McClanahan, Amy Grant, Jennifer Cook and Tiffany Trump 

Laura Bush was a member of the &quot;Beta Sigma chapter&quot; at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas. Her daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush were members at Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively. Tory Burch, an American fashion designer, businesswoman, and philanthropist was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia. Amy Holmes, an American journalist and political commentator, was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta at Princeton University. Sheryl Crow was a member at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan&#x27;s current governor, was a Theta at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. Amy Grant, an American singer, was a member of the &quot;Alpha Eta chapter&quot; at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

The first women admitted to Phi Beta Kappa honor society were Thetas.

==Local chapter misconduct==
In 2000, the chapter at the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati was temporarily suspended for hazing. The pledges were forced to endure several demeaning tasks, one of which included crawling up the steps of the sorority house for the amusement of their big sisters.

In 2000, the chapter at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida was shut down after a drinking party sent newly pledged members to the hospital. One member passed out and was placed on a respirator that night.

In 2008, the chapter at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York was suspended for four years after an alcohol-hazing related incident.

In 2014, the chapter at Columbia University in New York City was under national scrutiny after hosting a racially and ethnically insensitive event that went viral. Some of the costumes worn by sorority members were based on stereotypes meant to represent Mexico, Japan, the Netherlands, Ireland, Jamaica, and other countries. The sorority publicly apologized for the event.

In 2016, the 137-year old chapter at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan was suspended by the university for underage drinking and hazing. The chapter was disbanded by the national organization a few weeks later for violating the suspension.

In 2018, chapters at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi and Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina were closed for failure to meet quota. There was a great deal of opposition, since members felt they were being unfairly punished, simply for being less popular than other National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities on campus, and not for risk management or academic issues.

In February 2022, the members of the Eta Mu chapter at Occidental College in Los Angeles voted to disband the chapter following a controversy with a member, who reportedly sent anti-Asian and anti-Black messages in a private group chat among friends in a December 2020 incident that did not surface until two years later.

In February 2022, the chapter at Southern Methodist University (SMU) was placed on a two-year suspension by the university for pressuring pledges to drink large amounts of alcohol and other hazing activities that endangered their safety and mental health. The chapter was sanctioned for a similar violation in 2020. After being suspended in 2022, members of the chapter created an off-campus based organization known as &quot;The Society&quot; to continue to recruit new members and uphold the chapter&#x27;s legacy. SMU officials stated &quot;The Society&quot; was another violation of the Student Code of Conduct and worked to disband the organization and penalize fraternities seen socializing with them. Also the CEO of Kappa Alpha Theta, Jennifer Schmaltz, delayed the return of the chapter an additional year because she did not like its similarities to the sorority. Parents of &quot;The Society&quot; members hired lawyers on behalf of their daughters to fight to keep the organization until the official return of Kappa Alpha Theta at SMU.

<doc id="491981" wikidata="Q1700972" url="?curid=491981" title="John Marshall Harlan">
<text>John Marshall Harlan (June 1, 1833 – October 14, 1911) was an American lawyer and politician who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1877 until his death in 1911. He is often called &quot;The Great Dissenter&quot; due to his many dissents in cases that restricted civil liberties, including the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, and &quot;Giles v. Harris&quot;. Many of Harlan&#x27;s views expressed in his notable dissents would become the official view of the Supreme Court starting from the 1950s Warren Court and onward. 

Born into a prominent, slave-holding family near Danville, Kentucky, Harlan experienced a quick rise to political prominence. When the American Civil War broke out, Harlan strongly supported the Union and recruited the 10th Kentucky Infantry. Despite his opposition to the Emancipation Proclamation, he served in the war until 1863, when he was elected attorney general of Kentucky. Harlan lost his re-election bid in 1867 and joined the Republican Party in the following year, quickly emerging as the leader of the Kentucky Republican Party. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Harlan to the Supreme Court.

Harlan&#x27;s jurisprudence was marked by his life-long belief in a strong national government, his sympathy for the economically disadvantaged, and his view that the Reconstruction Amendments had fundamentally transformed the relationship between the federal government and the state governments. He was the sole dissenter in both the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; (1883) and &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), which permitted state and private actors to engage in ethnic segregation. He also wrote dissents in major cases such as &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; (1895), which struck down a federal income tax; &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot; (1895), which severely limited the power of the federal government to pursue antitrust actions; &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), which invalidated a state law setting maximum working hours on the basis of substantive due process; and &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot; (1911), which established the rule of reason. He was the first Supreme Court justice to advocate the incorporation of the Bill of Rights, and his majority opinion in &quot;Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago&quot; (1897) incorporated the Takings Clause. 

Harlan was largely forgotten in the decades after his death but many scholars now consider him to be one of the greatest Supreme Court justices of his era. His grandson John Marshall Harlan II later served on the Supreme Court from 1955 to 1971.

==Early life and education==
Harlan was born in 1833 at Harlan&#x27;s Station, 5 miles (8.0 km) west of Danville, Kentucky, on Salt River Road. He was born into a prominent slaveholding family whose earliest members had settled in the region in 1779. Harlan&#x27;s father was James Harlan, a lawyer and prominent Whig politician who represented Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives and served as Secretary of State of Kentucky. Harlan&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Davenport, was the daughter of a pioneer from Virginia. Harlan grew up on the family estate near Frankfort, Kentucky. He was named after Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, whom his father admired. The first ancestor of the Harlan family was George Harlan, an Englishman who arrived to the American Colony of Pennsylvania in the 1600s.

John had several older brothers, including a mixed-race half-brother, Robert James Harlan, born in 1816 into slavery, and whom his father raised in his own household and had tutored by Richard and James Harlan, two of John Marshall Harlan&#x27;s older brothers. According to historian Allyson Hobbs, Robert became highly successful, making a fortune in the California Gold Rush before returning east and settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. He &quot;remained close to the other Harlans&quot;; she suggests this might have influenced his half-brother John Marshall Harlan, &quot;who argued on behalf of equal rights under the law in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;.&quot;

After attending school in Frankfort, John Harlan enrolled at Centre College. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi and graduated with honors. Though his mother wanted Harlan to become a merchant, James insisted that his son follow him into the legal profession, and Harlan joined his father&#x27;s law practice in 1852. While James Harlan could have trained his son in the office, as was the norm of &quot;reading the law&quot; in that era, he sent John to attend law school at Transylvania University in 1850, where George Robertson and Thomas Alexander Marshall were among his instructors. Harlan finished his legal education in his father&#x27;s law office and was admitted to the Kentucky Bar in 1853.

==Politician and lawyer==
===Rise: 1851–1861===
A member of the Whig Party like his father, Harlan got an early start in politics when, in 1851, he was offered the post of adjutant general of the state by governor John L. Helm. He served in the post for the next eight years, which gave him a statewide presence and familiarity with many of Kentucky&#x27;s leading political figures. With the Whig Party&#x27;s dissolution in the early 1850s, Harlan shifted his affiliation to the Know Nothings, despite his discomfort with their opposition to Catholicism. Harlan&#x27;s personal popularity within the state was such that he was able to survive the decline of the Know Nothing movement in the late 1850s, winning election in 1858 as the county judge for Franklin County, Kentucky. The following year, he renounced his allegiance to the Know Nothings and joined the state&#x27;s Opposition Party, serving as their candidate in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Democrat William E. Simms for the seat in Kentucky&#x27;s 8th congressional district.

Throughout the 1850s, Harlan criticized both abolitionists and pro-slavery radicals. Like many other anti-secession Southerners, he supported the Constitutional Union ticket of John Bell and Edward Everett in the 1860 presidential election. Harlan agreed to serve as a presidential elector for Bell, and he delivered speeches on behalf of the party throughout Kentucky during the campaign. In the secession crisis that followed Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s victory in the 1860 election, Harlan sought to prevent Kentucky from seceding.

=== Military Service: 1861–1863 ===
When the Civil War erupted in April 1861, John Marshall Harlan was a staunch Unionist who worked tirelessly to keep Kentucky in the Union, writing several pro-Union editorials and representing the Union in state court. On August 13, 1861, After the state legislature voted to expel all Confederate forces from Kentucky, Harlan recruited and was elected captain of the newly organized Crittenden Union Zouaves, a militia unit formed to support the Union cause. By October 4, 1861, Harlan and his command were officially enrolled into the Union Army. Soon after, on October 20, 1861, he was mustered in as Colonel of the 10th Kentucky Volunteer Infantry Regiment in Lebanon, Kentucky, for a three-year term.

In September 1861, Harlan played a key role in the defense of Lebanon Junction, Kentucky, a vital transportation hub. Under General William T. Sherman, Harlan’s unit worked to secure ammunition and defend strategic railroad bridges. In one notable incident, Harlan personally led efforts to transport supplies across the Rolling Fork River after Confederate forces burned the bridge, earning commendation for his resourcefulness and determination.

The 10th Kentucky Infantry soon became part of General George H. Thomas’s division. On January 19, 1862, Harlan fought at the Battle of Mill Springs, a significant Union victory that disrupted Confederate operations in Kentucky. In April 1862, his regiment participated in the Siege of Corinth, Mississippi, following the Union victory at the Battle of Shiloh.

Harlan’s most notable engagement came on December 29, 1862, during a skirmish with Confederate cavalry commander John Hunt Morgan at the Rolling Fork River Bridge, known as &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Christmas Raid.&quot; After marching his forces from Munfordville to Elizabethtown, Harlan led his troops to defend the bridge, engaging Morgan’s forces with cannon and rifle fire. This skirmish successfully disrupted Morgan’s attempt to destroy critical railroad bridges, preserving vital Union supply lines. In his official report, Harlan claimed that his command &quot;saved the Rolling Fork Bridge and most probably prevented any attempt to destroy the bridge at Shepherdsville,&quot; safeguarding property essential to Union operations in the Western Theater.

Throughout his military service, Harlan publicly argued that the Union’s goal in taking up arms was to preserve the Union rather than abolish slavery. In a wartime speech, he asserted that the war &quot;was not for the purpose of giving freedom to the Negro.&quot; Harlan vowed to resign if President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which he denounced as &quot;unconstitutional and null and void&quot; when it took effect on January 1, 1863. However, contrary to public perception, Harlan did not resign over the proclamation.

Harlan’s resignation came after the sudden death of his father on March 6, 1863, prompting him to leave the army to care for his family and resume his legal and political career. He formally resigned his commission on March 17, 1863. In his resignation letter, Harlan expressed his regret at leaving the army and reaffirmed his dedication to the Union cause, writing:“It was my fixed purpose to remain in the Federal army until it had effectually suppressed the existing armed rebellion and restored the authority of the national government over every part of the nation. ... That cause will always have the warmest sympathies of my heart, for there are no conditions upon which I will consent to a dissolution of the Union.&quot;Harlan’s time in the army was not without moments of controversy and complexity. In the fall of 1861, during an encounter near Elizabethtown, Harlan and his unit came across Confederate General Basil Duke, who was traveling incognito in civilian clothes to visit his wife in Lexington. Despite being recognized by Harlan, Duke was allowed to escape when Harlan discreetly pressed his foot on the brake of the handcar carrying Union soldiers, preventing them from stopping to apprehend Duke. Harlan later explained that he believed Duke was merely on his way to visit his wife and was not acting as a spy.

===Party leader: 1863–1877===

Weeks after leaving the Army, Harlan was nominated by the Union Party to run for Attorney General of Kentucky. Campaigning on a platform of vigorous prosecution of the war, he won the election by a considerable margin. As attorney general for the state, Harlan issued legal opinions and advocated for the state in a number of court cases. Party politics, however, occupied much of his time. Though still a committed unionist, he opposed Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation and supported Democratic candidate George B. McClellan&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign in the 1864 presidential election. Harlan also opposed ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, attacking it as a &quot;direct interference, by a portion of the states, with the local concerns of other states.&quot;

Harlan’s attitudes toward slavery remained complex throughout the war. He owned a few household slaves and did not emancipate them until forced to by the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865, which he described as &quot;a flagrant invasion of the right of self-government.&quot; 

After the end of the Civil War in 1865, Harlan initially refused to join either the Democratic Party, which he viewed as too accepting of former rebels, or the Republican Party, whose Reconstruction policies he opposed. He sought re-election in 1867 on a third-party ticket, but lost his office in a Democratic sweep of the state.

Despite his earlier opposition to emancipation and the Reconstruction Amendments, Harlan underwent a significant political transformation after his defeat. He joined the Republican Party in 1868, supporting the party’s Reconstruction policies and its platform of civil rights for Black Americans. He supported Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s candidacy in the 1868 presidential election. Moving to Louisville, Harlan formed a successful partnership with John E. Newman, a former circuit-court judge who, like Harlan, was a Unionist turned Republican. In 1870, Harlan and Newman briefly took on a new partner, Benjamin Bristow, but President Grant appointed Bristow as U.S. solicitor general later that year.

While growing his legal practice, Harlan also worked to build up the Republican Party organization in the state. He served as the Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky in 1871; though he finished a distant second to incumbent Democratic Governor Preston Leslie, Harlan nonetheless established himself as the leader of the Kentucky Republican Party during the campaign. Harlan&#x27;s views on Reconstruction shifted in the early 1870s, and he came to support Reconstruction measures such as the Enforcement Act of 1870, though he still opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 as a federal overreach. Harlan reluctantly accepted the party&#x27;s gubernatorial nomination in 1875, and he once again lost by a substantial margin, this time to Democrat James B. McCreary. The following year, Harlan worked to nominate Bristow at the 1876 Republican National Convention, seeking to position Bristow as a more electable alternative to Republican front-runner James G. Blaine. When Rutherford B. Hayes instead emerged as the compromise candidate, Harlan switched his delegation&#x27;s votes and subsequently campaigned on Hayes&#x27; behalf in the 1876 election.

==Supreme Court Justice==
===Nomination===

Though Harlan was considered for several positions in the new administration, most notably Attorney General, initially the only job he was offered was as a member of a commission sent to Louisiana to resolve disputed statewide elections there. Justice David Davis, however, had resigned from the Supreme Court in January 1877 after being elected to the Senate by the Illinois General Assembly. Seeking to appoint a Southerner to the Supreme Court in the aftermath of the acrimonious and disputed 1876 presidential election, Hayes settled on Harlan. Though Harlan&#x27;s nomination prompted some criticism from Republican Stalwarts, he was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on November 29, 1877, and took the judicial oath of office on December 10, 1877.

===Life on the Court===
Harlan greatly enjoyed his time as a justice, serving until his death in 1911. From the start, he established good relationships with his fellow justices and he was close friends with a number of them. Though Harlan often disagreed with the other justices, occasionally quite vociferously, he was able to separate differences over legal matters from personal relationship. During his tenure, money problems continually plagued him, particularly as he began to put his three sons through college. Debt was a constant concern, and in the early 1880s, he considered resigning from the Court and returning to private practice. He ultimately decided to remain on the Court, but supplemented his income by teaching constitutional law at the Columbian Law School, which later became the George Washington University Law School.

When Harlan began his service, the Supreme Court faced a heavy workload that consisted primarily of diversity and removal cases, with only a few constitutional issues. Justices also rode circuit in the various federal judicial circuits; though these usually corresponded to the region from which the justice was appointed, due to his junior status, Harlan was assigned the Seventh Circuit based in Chicago. Harlan rode the Seventh Circuit until 1896, when he switched to his home circuit, the Sixth, upon the death of its previous holder, Justice Howell Edmunds Jackson. Harlan became the senior associate justice on the Court following the retirement of Stephen Johnson Field in 1897, and he served as acting chief justice after the death of Melville Fuller in 1910.

===Jurisprudence===
During Harlan&#x27;s tenure on the Supreme Court, major Supreme Court decisions tended to address issues arising from industrialization and the Reconstruction Amendments. Beginning in the 1880s, the Supreme Court increasingly began to adopt a laissez-faire philosophy, striking down economic regulations while at the same time allowing states to curtail the rights of African Americans. Harlan differed from many of his colleagues, often voting to uphold federal regulations and to protect the civil rights of African Americans. His judicial opinions were influenced by his life-long belief in a strong national government, his sympathy for the economically disadvantaged, and his view that the Reconstruction Amendments had fundamentally transformed the relationship between the federal government and the state governments. Though Harlan believed the Court had the power to review state and federal actions on a broad array of topics, he tended to oppose judicial activism in favor of deference to legislatures.

====Earlier cases, 1877–1896====

Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in the waning days of Reconstruction, outlawing segregation in public accommodations such as railroads. The Supreme Court did not rule on the Civil Rights Act of 1875 until 1883, when it struck down the law in &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;. In his majority opinion, Justice Joseph P. Bradley held that the Thirteenth Amendment &quot;simply abolished slavery,&quot; and that the Fourteenth Amendment did not authorize Congress to bar racial discrimination by private actors. Only Harlan dissented, vigorously, charging that the majority had subverted the Reconstruction Amendments: &quot;The substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism.&quot; Harlan argued that the Fourteenth Amendment gave Congress the authority to regulate public accommodations, and further argued that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to &quot;eradicate&quot; the vestiges of slavery, such as restrictions on freedom of movement.

Harlan joined the Court&#x27;s unanimous decision in &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot; (1883), which ruled that anti-miscegenation laws were constitutional.

Harlan was the first justice to argue that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights (making rights guarantees applicable to the individual states), in &quot;Hurtado v. California&quot; (1884).

Harlan was one of four justices to file a dissenting opinion in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; (1895), which struck down a federal income tax levied by the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894. Harlan described the majority opinion as a &quot;disaster to the country&quot; because it &quot;impairs and cripples the just powers of the national government.&quot; He was the sole dissenter in another 1895 case, &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot;, in which the Court severely curtailed the power of the federal government to pursue antitrust actions under the Sherman Antitrust Act. In his dissent, he wrote that &quot;the common government of all the people is the only one that can adequately deal with a matter which directly and injuriously affects the entire commerce of the country.&quot; During the 1890s, he also wrote several dissents in cases where Court decisions curtailed the regulatory powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).

====&quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;====
In 1896, Associate Justice Henry Billings Brown delivered the majority decision in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which established the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal.&quot; Whereas the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; had struck down a federal law barring segregation by private actors, the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Plessy&quot; allowed state governments to engage in segregation. Rejecting the argument that segregation violated the Thirteenth Amendment, Brown wrote that &quot;a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude.&quot; In response to the plaintiff&#x27;s claims regarding the Fourteenth Amendment, Brown wrote that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to &quot;enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law,&quot; but added that the amendment &quot;could not have been intended to abolish distinction based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.&quot;

Harlan, the lone dissenting justice, strongly disapproved of the majority opinion, writing that &quot;the judgement this day rendered, will, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the &quot;Dred Scott Case.&quot;&quot; He accepted the appellant&#x27;s argument that the Thirteenth Amendment barred segregation in public accommodations, as he believed that segregation imposed &quot;badges of slavery or servitude&quot; upon African Americans. He also accepted the appellant&#x27;s argument that the segregation in public accommodations violated the Fourteenth Amendment on the basis that these accommodations constituted &quot;public highway[s].&quot; He further wrote that &quot;our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.&quot; Harlan rejected the idea that the law in question was race-neutral, writing that &quot;everyone knows that the statute in question [was intended] to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons,&quot; adding that the law was &quot;cunningly devised&quot; to overturn the results of the Civil War.

Harlan did not embrace the idea of full social racial equality. While he had appeared to advocate for equality among those of different races and for a color-blind Constitution, in his &quot;Plessy&quot; dissent, he also stated &quot;[t]here is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States... I allude to the Chinese race.&quot;

====Later cases, 1897–1911====

In &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; (1898), Harlan joined Chief Justice Fuller&#x27;s dissent proclaiming the dangers of having large numbers of Chinese immigrants in the United States. The Court&#x27;s holding was that persons of Chinese descent born in the United States were citizens by birth. Fuller and Harlan argued that the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (that is, the concept of a child inheriting their father&#x27;s citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been more pervasive in U.S. legal history since independence. In the view of the minority, excessive reliance on &quot;jus soli&quot; (birthplace) as the principal determiner of citizenship would lead to an untenable state of affairs in which &quot;the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country, whether of royal parentage or not, or whether of the Mongolian, Malay or other race, were eligible to the presidency, while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not&quot;.

Harlan was also the most staunchly anti-imperialist justice of the Supreme Court, arguing consistently in the Insular Cases (from 1901 to 1905) that the Constitution did not permit the demarcation of different rights between citizens of the states and the residents of newly acquired territories in the Philippines, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico, a view that was consistently in the minority. In &quot;Hawaii v. Mankichi&quot; (1903) his opinion stated: &quot;If the principles now announced should become firmly established, the time may not be far distant when, under the exactions of trade and commerce, and to gratify an ambition to become the dominant power in all the earth, the United States will acquire territories in every direction... whose inhabitants will be regarded as &#x27;subjects&#x27; or &#x27;dependent peoples,&#x27; to be controlled as Congress may see fit... which will engraft on our republican institutions a &quot;colonial&quot; system entirely foreign to the genius of our Government and abhorrent to the principles that underlie and pervade our Constitution.&quot;

Harlan delivered the majority opinion in &quot;Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago&quot; (1897), holding that due process required fair compensation to be given for any private property seized by the state. The decision incorporated the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s Takings Clause, representing the first time that part of the Bill of Rights was applied to state governments. The Court would not incorporate another provision of the Bill of Rights until &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot; (1925). Harlan wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;, the first time the Court upheld the use of the Sherman Antitrust Act to break up a large corporation. Harlan also wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Adair v. United States&quot; (1908), holding that Congress did not have the power to ban &quot;yellow-dog contracts&quot;.

During his final years on the Court, Harlan continued to write dissents in major cases, such as &quot;Giles v. Harris&quot; (1903), a case challenging the use of grandfather clauses to restrict voting rolls and &quot;de facto&quot; exclude blacks. He also dissented in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), but he agreed with the majority &quot;that there is a liberty of contract which cannot be violated even under the sanction of direct legislative enactment.&quot; In his dissent in &quot;Hodges v. United States&quot; (1906), Harlan reiterated his belief that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to protect African Americans from discrimination and violence. He was the lone dissenter in &quot;Ex parte Young&quot; (1908), arguing that the Eleventh Amendment prevented suits against state officials acting on behalf of the state. In his partial dissent in the 1911 case of &quot;Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, Harlan argued against the Court&#x27;s establishment of the rule of reason, which held that in some extenuating circumstances a trust should not be broken up even if it has a monopoly. In both &quot;Standard Oil&quot; and &quot;United States v. American Tobacco Co.&quot; (1911), Harlan strongly criticized the majority opinion for adopting the rule of reason; as the rule was not present in the original legislation, he believed that the Court was usurping Congress&#x27;s legislative prerogatives.

==Death==
Harlan died on October 14, 1911, after 33 years serving on the Supreme Court, the third-longest tenure on the court up to that time and sixth-longest ever. He was the last veteran of the Waite Court to remain on the bench. He was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C., where his body resides along with those of three other justices. Harlan, who suffered from financial problems throughout his tenure on the Court, left minimal assets for the support of his widow, Malvina Shanklin Harlan, and two unmarried daughters. In the months following Harlan&#x27;s death, leading members of the Supreme Court Bar established a fund for the benefit of the Harlan survivors.

==Personal life==
===Family===
In December 1856, Harlan married Malvina French Shanklin, the daughter of an Indiana businessman. According to friends and Shanklin&#x27;s memoirs, theirs was a happy marriage, which lasted until Harlan&#x27;s death. They had six children, three sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Richard, became a Presbyterian minister and served as president of Lake Forest College. Their second son, James S. Harlan, practiced in Chicago and served as attorney general of Puerto Rico and chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Their youngest son, John Maynard Harlan, also practiced in Chicago and served as an alderman. John Maynard&#x27;s son, John Marshall Harlan II, served as a Supreme Court Associate Justice from 1955 until 1971.

===Religious beliefs===

Harlan was fervently religious, and legal scholar James W. Gordon argued that his faith ”was the most important lens through which he viewed the people and events of his life”. A conservative Presbyterian, he favored the Old School branch of that denomination, opposed higher criticism, and stridently adhered to Calvinism. During his tenure as a justice, he was an elder at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., and there he taught a Sunday school class of middle-aged men from 1896 until his death in 1911.

==Legacy==

Harlan was largely forgotten in the decades after his death, but his reputation began to improve in the mid-twentieth century, and many scholars now consider him to be one of the greatest Supreme Court justices of his era. He is most known for his reputation as the &quot;Great Dissenter,&quot; and he is especially remembered for his dissent in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;. Historian D. Grier Stephenson writes that &quot;more than any justice with whom he served, Harlan understood the Reconstruction Amendments to establish a nationally protected right against racial discrimination, although it is a measure of the Court that he frequently articulated those promises in dissent.&quot; Legal scholar Bernard Schwartz writes that &quot;Harlan&#x27;s key dissents have generally been affirmed in the court of history. A century later, his rejection of the narrow view toward civil rights adopted by the Court majority has been generally approved.&quot; Harlan&#x27;s view that the Fourteenth Amendment made the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states has also largely been adopted by the Supreme Court.

Harlan is commemorated by John Marshall Harlan Community Academy High School, a Chicago public high school, as well as by John Marshall Harlan High School in Texas. During World War II the Liberty ship was built and named in his honor. Centre College, Harlan&#x27;s alma mater, instituted the John Marshall Harlan Professorship in Government in 1994 in honor of Harlan&#x27;s reputation as one of the Supreme Court&#x27;s greatest justices. Named for Justice Harlan, the &quot;Harlan Scholars&quot; of the University of Louisville/Louis D. Brandeis School of Law is an undergraduate organization for students interested in attending law school. Collections of Harlan&#x27;s papers are at the University of Louisville and at the Library of Congress in Washington. Other papers are collected at many other libraries.

On March 12, 1906, Harlan donated a King James Version Bible to the Supreme Court. This Bible had become known as the &quot;Harlan Bible&quot;, and as of 2015, has been signed by every succeeding Supreme Court justice after taking the oath of office.

<text>Phaseolus vulgaris, the common bean, is a herbaceous annual plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds or green, unripe pods. Its leaf is also occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder. Its botanical classification, along with other &quot;Phaseolus&quot; species, is as a member of the legume family, Fabaceae. Like most members of this family, common beans acquire the nitrogen they require through an association with rhizobia, which are nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

The common bean has a long history of cultivation. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit, but many cultivars are classified either as &quot;bush beans&quot; or &quot;climbing beans&quot;, depending on their style of growth. The other major types of commercially grown beans are the runner bean (&quot;Phaseolus coccineus&quot;) and the broad bean (&quot;Vicia faba&quot;). 

Beans are grown on every continent except Antarctica. In 2022, 28 million tonnes of dry common beans were produced worldwide, led by India with 23% of the total.

Raw dry beans contain the toxic compound phytohaemagglutinin, which can be deactivated by cooking beans for ten minutes at boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water which should then be discarded.

== Description ==

Bush varieties form erect bushes tall, while pole or running varieties form vines long. All varieties bear alternate, green or purple leaves, which are divided into three oval, smooth-edged leaflets, each long and wide. The white, pink, or purple flowers are about 1 cm long and have 10 stamens. The flowers are self-pollinating, which facilitates the selection of stable cultivars. The flowers give way to pods long and 1–1.5 cm wide. These may be green, yellow, black, or purple, each containing 4–8 beans. Some varieties develop a string along the pod; these are generally cultivated for dry beans, as green stringy beans are not commercially desirable. The beans are smooth, plump, kidney-shaped, up to 1.5 cm long, range widely in color and are often mottled in two or more colors. The beans maintain their germination capacity for up to 5 years.

Like most species from &quot;Phaseolus&quot;, the genome of &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; has 11 chromosomal pairs (2n = 22). Its genome is one of the smallest in the legume family at 625 Mbp per haploid genome.

Raw or undercooked beans contain a toxic protein called phytohaemagglutinin.

== Taxonomy ==
The common bean, like all species of &quot;Phaseolus&quot; is a member of the legume family Fabaceae.

In &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753, Carl Linnaeus classified the beans known by him into genus &quot;Phaseolus&quot; and genus &quot;Dolichos&quot;, naming 11 species of &quot;Phaseolus&quot;, including 6 cultivated species and 5 &quot;wild&quot; species.

The beans cultivated in Europe prior to the Columbian Exchange were of Asian origin and are unrelated to New World &quot;Phaseolus&quot; species. The Eurasian species were transferred to other genera including &quot;Vigna&quot;, &quot;Vicia&quot; and &quot;Lablab&quot;, so members of the &quot;Phaseolus&quot; genus are now all from the Americas.

=== Etymology ===
Ancient Greeks used the word φάσηλος (&quot;phasēlos&quot;) to refer to the beans of Asian origins that were cultivated in Europe at the time. The Romans used both the Latinized &quot;phaseolus&quot; and their own &quot;faba&quot; to refer to different pre-Columbian species of beans, presumably using the word &quot;faseolus&quot; for smaller seeds like those belonging to the genus &quot;Vigna&quot; such as the black-eyed peas and the word &quot;faba&quot; for larger seeds, such as the fava beans. This latter word, &quot;faba&quot;, was related to the Proto-Germanic &quot;bauno&quot;, from which the Old English word &quot;bean&quot; is derived and has the meaning of &quot;bean, pea, legume&quot;. When &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot; arrived in Europe in the 16th century, this species was yet another seed in a pod, thus there were already words in the European languages describing it.

In the Americas, &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; is also known as &quot;ayacotl&quot; in nahuatl (Aztec language), &quot;búul&quot; in Mayan (Maya language) and &quot;purutu&quot; in Quechua (Inca language). In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, the Spanish name &#x27;poroto&#x27; is used, being derived from its corresponding Quechua word. Additional names include the Castilian Spanish &quot;frijol&quot;, the Portuguese &quot;feijão&quot;, and the Catalan &quot;fesol&quot;.

== Distribution ==
Wild &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; is native to the Americas. It was originally believed that it had been domesticated separately in Mesoamerica and in the southern Andes region some 8,000 years ago, giving the domesticated bean two gene pools. However, recent genetic analyses show that it was domesticated in Mexico first, then split into the Mesoamerican and Andean &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; gene pools.

Beans, squash and maize (corn) are the three Mesoamerican crops that constitute the &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, central to indigenous American agriculture.

The common bean arrived in Europe as part of the Columbian exchange.

== Cultivation ==
Good commercial yield in favorable environments under irrigation is 6 to 8 ton/ha fresh and 1.5 to 2 ton/ha dry seed.

=== Cultivars and varieties ===
Archeologists found large-seeded varieties of the domesticated bean in the highlands of Peru, dating to 2300 BC, and spreading to the coastal regions by around 500 BC. Small-seeded varieties were found in sites in Mexico, dating to 300 BC, which then spread north and east of the Mississippi River by 1000 AD.

Many well-known bean cultivars and varieties belong to this species, and the list below is in no way exhaustive. Both bush and running (pole) cultivars/varieties exist. The colors and shapes of pods and seeds vary over a wide range.

=== Production ===

In 2022, world production of dry common beans was 28 million tonnes, led by India with 23% of the total. Brazil and Myanmar were secondary producers.

== Toxicity ==

The toxic compound phytohaemagglutinin, a lectin, is present in many common bean varieties but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. White kidney beans contain about a third as many toxins as the red variety; broad beans (&quot;Vicia faba&quot;) contain 5 to 10% as much as red kidney beans.

Phytohaemagglutinin can be inactivated by cooking beans for ten minutes at boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). Insufficient cooking, such as in a slow cooker at 80 °C/ 176 °F, is insufficient to deactivate all toxins. To safely cook the beans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature for long enough to destroy the toxin completely. For dry beans, the FDA also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water which should then be discarded. Outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with cooking kidney beans in slow cookers.

The primary symptoms of phytohaemagglutinin poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is from one to three hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours. Consumption of as few as four or five raw, soaked kidney beans can cause symptoms. Canned red kidney beans are safe to use immediately, as they have already been cooked.

Beans are high in purines, which are metabolized to uric acid. Uric acid is not a toxin but may promote the development or exacerbation of gout. However, more recent research has questioned this association, finding that moderate intake of purine-rich foods is not associated with an increased risk of gout.

== Uses ==
=== Nutrition ===
Raw green beans are 90% water, 7% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contain negligible fat. In a reference amount of , raw green beans supply 36 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin K (41% DV) and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of vitamin C, vitamin B6, and manganese.

Dry white common beans, after boiling, are 63% water, 25% carbohydrates, 10% protein, and contain little fat. In a reference amount of , boiled white common beans supply 139 calories and are a rich source of folate and manganese, with moderate amounts of thiamine and several dietary minerals.

===Dry beans===
Dry beans will keep indefinitely if stored in a cool, dry place, but as time passes, their nutritive value and flavor degrade, and cooking times lengthen. Dried beans are almost always cooked by boiling, often after being soaked in water for several hours. While the soaking is not strictly necessary, it shortens cooking time and results in more evenly textured beans. In addition, soaking beans removes 5 to 10% of the gas-producing sugars that can cause flatulence for some people. The methods include simple overnight soaking and the power soak method, in which beans are boiled for three minutes and then set aside for 2–4 hours. Before cooking, the soaking water is drained off and discarded. Dry common beans take longer to cook than most pulses: cooking times vary from one to four hours but are substantially reduced with pressure cooking.

In Mexico, Central America, and South America, the traditional spice used with beans is &quot;epazote&quot;, which is also said to aid digestion. In East Asia, a type of seaweed, &quot;kombu&quot;, is added to beans as they cook for the same purpose. Salt, sugar, and acidic foods such as tomatoes may harden uncooked beans, resulting in seasoned beans at the expense of slightly longer cooking times.

Dry beans may also be bought cooked and canned as refried beans, or whole with water, salt, and sometimes sugar.

===Green beans and wax beans===
The three commonly known types of green beans are string or snap beans, which may be round or have a flat pod; stringless or French beans, which lack a tough, fibrous string running along the length of the pod; and runner beans, which belong to a separate species, &quot;Phaseolus coccineus&quot;. Green beans may have a purple rather than green pod, which changes to green when cooked. Wax beans are &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; beans that have a yellow or white pod. Wax bean cultivars are commonly grown; the plants are often of the bush or dwarf form.

As the name implies, snap beans break easily when the pod is bent, giving off a distinct audible snap sound. The pods of snap beans (green, yellow, and purple) are harvested when they are rapidly growing, fleshy, tender (not tough and stringy), and bright in color, and the seeds are small and underdeveloped (8 to 10 days after flowering).

Green beans and wax beans are often steamed, boiled, stir-fried, or baked in casseroles.

===Shelling beans===
Shell, shelled, or shelling beans are beans removed from their pods before being cooked or dried. Common beans can be used as shell beans, but the term also refers to other species of beans whose pods are not typically eaten, such as lima beans, soybeans, peas, and fava beans. Fresh shell beans are nutritionally similar to dry beans but are prepared more like vegetables, often steamed, fried, or made into soups.

===Popping beans===
The &quot;nuña&quot; is an Andean subspecies, &quot;P. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;nunas&quot; (formerly &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; Nuñas group), with round, multicolored seeds that resemble pigeon eggs. When cooked on high heat, the bean explodes, exposing the inner part in the manner of popcorn and other puffed grains.

=== Other uses ===
Bean leaves have been used to trap bedbugs in houses. Microscopic hairs (trichomes) on the bean leaves entrap the insects.

Beans have been used as devices in various methods of divination since ancient times. Fortune-telling using beans is called favomancy.

&quot;P. vulgaris&quot; has been found to bio-accumulate zinc, manganese, and iron and have some tolerance to their respective toxicities, suggesting suitability for natural bio-remediation of heavy-metal-contaminated soils.

==In culture==
In 1528, Pope Clemente VII received some white beans, which thrived. Five years later, he gave a bag of beans as a present to his niece, Catherine, on her wedding to Prince Henri of France, along with the county of the Lauragais, whose county town is Castelnaudary, now synonymous with the white bean dish of cassoulet.

<text>A British comic is a periodical published in the United Kingdom that contains comic strips. It is generally referred to as a comic or a comic magazine, and historically as a comic paper. As of 2014, the three longest-running comics of all time were all British.

British comics are usually comics anthologies which are typically aimed at children, and are published weekly, although some are also published on a fortnightly or monthly schedule. The two most popular British comics, &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;, were released by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in British popular culture during this period, Anita O’Brien, director curator at London&#x27;s Cartoon Museum, states: &quot;When comics like &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;Dandy&quot; were invented back in the 1930s – and through really to the 1950s and 60s – these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.&quot;

In 1954, &quot;Tiger&quot; comics introduced &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase &quot;real &#x27;Roy of the Rovers&#x27; stuff&quot; is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip&#x27;s trademark. Other comics such as &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Viz&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot; also flourished. Some comics, such as &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and other &quot;2000 AD&quot; titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and &quot;small press&quot; titles have also appeared in the UK, notably &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Escape Magazine&quot;. While the bestselling comics in the UK have historically been native products, American comic books and Japanese manga are also popular.

==Overview==
The description &quot;comics&quot; derived from the names of popular titles such as &quot;Comic Cuts&quot;, and from the fact that in the beginning all the titles presented only comical (i.e. humorous) content.

British comics typically differ from the American comic book. Although historically they shared the same format size, based on a sheet of 30 x 22 inch imperial paper, folded, British comics have moved away from this size, adopting a standard magazine size. Until that point, the British comic was also usually printed on newsprint, with black or a dark red used as the dark colour and the four colour process used on the cover. &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; both switched to an all-colour format in 1993.

Originally aimed at the semi-literate working class (in that it replaced the text-based stories of the story papers with picture-based stories, which were less challenging for a poorly educated readership), the comic gradually came to be seen as childish (in part because, due to gradual improvements in public education, children were eventually the only remaining market for a format designed to be unchallenging for the reader). Hence by the mid 20th Century it was being marketed exclusively towards children.

Historically, strips were of one or two pages in length, with a single issue of a comic containing upwards of a dozen separate strips, featuring different characters. In more recent times, strips have become longer and have tended to continue over a number of issues and periods of time.

Whilst some comics contained only strips, other publications such as &quot;Jackie&quot; have had a slightly different focus, providing their girl readers with articles about, and photographs of, pop stars and television/film actors, plus more general articles about teenage life, whilst throwing in a few comic strips for good measure. For boys there were, historically, similar publications based upon soccer, such as &quot;Shoot!&quot;, which featured non-fiction picture articles about popular footballers, league clubs, and general football news, accompanied by a limited range of football-based comic strips.

In British comics history, there are some extremely long-running publications such as &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; published by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co., a newspaper company based in Dundee, Scotland. &quot;The Dandy&quot; began in 1937 and &quot;The Beano&quot; in 1938. &quot;The Beano&quot; is still going today while &quot;The Dandy&quot; ceased print publication in 2012. The &quot;Boys&#x27; Own Paper&quot;, another long-running publication which was aimed at boys in a slightly older age group, lasted from 1879 to 1967.

There has been a continuous tradition, since the 1950s, of black and white comics, published in a smaller page size format, many of them war titles such as &quot;Air Ace&quot;, inspiring youngsters with tales of the exploits of the army, navy and Royal Air Force, mainly in the two world wars. There have also been some romance titles and some westerns in this format.

On 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting characters and series from British comics. The collection featured &quot;The Beano, The Dandy, Eagle, The Topper, Roy of the Rovers, Bunty, Buster, Valiant, Twinkle&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

==History==

===19th century===

In the 19th century, story papers (containing illustrated text stories), known as &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot; from their cover price, served as entertainment for British children. Full of close-printed text with few illustrations, they were essentially no different from a book, except that they were somewhat shorter and that typically the story was serialised over many weekly issues in order to maintain sales.

These serial stories could run to hundreds of instalments if they were popular. And to pad out a successful series, writers would insert quite extraneous material such as the geography of the country in which the action was occurring, so that the story would extend into more issues. Plagiarism was rife, with magazines profiting from competitors&#x27; successes under a few cosmetic name changes. Apart from action and historical stories, there was also a fashion for horror and the supernatural, with epics like &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; running for years. Horror, in particular, contributed to the epithet &quot;penny dreadful&quot;. Stories featuring criminals such as &#x27;Spring-Heeled Jack&#x27;, pirates, highwaymen (especially Dick Turpin), and detectives (including Sexton Blake) dominated decades of the Victorian and early 20th-century weeklies.
Comic strips—stories told primarily in strip cartoon form, rather than as a written narrative with illustrations—emerged only slowly. Scottish-born newspaper proprietor James Henderson began publishing &quot;Funny Folks&quot; in 1874. Writer Denis Gifford considered &quot;Funny Folks&quot; to be the first British comic, though at first it tackled topical and political subjects along the same lines as &quot;Punch&quot;. The magazine was heavily illustrated, with cartoons by John Proctor, known as Puck, among others, and benefitted from innovations in the use of cheap paper and photographic printing. &quot;Ally Sloper&#x27;s Half Holiday&quot; (1884) is regarded as the first comic strip magazine to feature a recurring character (Ally Sloper). This strip cost one penny and was designed for adults. Ally, the recurring character, was a working-class fellow who got up to various forms of mischief and often suffered for it.

In 1890 two more comic magazines debuted before the British public, &quot;Comic Cuts&quot; and &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot;, both published by Amalgamated Press. These magazines notoriously reprinted British and American material, previously published in newspapers and magazines, without permission. The success of these comics was such that Amalgamated&#x27;s owner, Alfred Harmsworth, was able to launch the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspapers on the profits.

Comics were also published as accompaniments to women&#x27;s magazines at the end of the century. &quot;Jungle Jinks,&quot; which held the honor of being the longest running British comic until 1954, first appeared in 1898 as a supplement to &quot;Home Chat;&quot; drawn by Mabel F. Taylor, it was the first anthropomorphic animal British comic.

===20th century===

Over the next thirty years or so, comic publishers saw the juvenile market as the most profitable, and thus geared their publications accordingly, so that by 1914 most comics were standalone booklets aimed at eight- to twelve-year-olds.

The interwar period is notable mainly for the publication of annuals by Eagle Press, and also the emergence of D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd. D. C. Thomson launched both &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; in the late 1930s, which thrived during the Second World War. Their successful mix of irreverence and slapstick led to many similar titles, notably &quot;Buster&quot;, &quot;Topper&quot; and &quot;Beezer&quot;. However, the originators of this format have outlasted all rivals, and &quot;The Beano&quot; is still published today.
In the early 1950s, &quot;lurid American &#x27;crime&#x27; and &#x27;horror comics&#x27; reached Britain&quot;, prompting what in retrospect has been characterised as a moral panic. Copies of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, which arrived as ballast in ships from the United States, were first only available in the &quot;environs of the great ports of Liverpool, Manchester, Belfast and London&quot;, but by &quot;using blocks made from imported American matrices&quot;, British versions of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; were printed in London and Leicester (by companies like Arnold Book Company) and sold in &quot;small back-street newsagents.&quot; The ensuing outcry was heard in Parliament, and at the urging of the Most Reverend Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Major Gwilym Lloyd George, the Home Secretary and Minister of Welsh Affairs, and the National Union of Teachers, Parliament passed the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955. The act prohibited &quot;any book, magazine or other like work which is of a kind likely to fall into the hands of children or young persons and consists wholly or mainly of stories told in pictures (with or without the addition of written matter), being stories portraying (a) the commission of crimes; or (b) acts of violence or cruelty; or (c) incidents of a repulsive or horrible nature; in such a way that the work as a whole would tend to corrupt a child or young person into whose hands it might fall.&quot; Although the act had a sunset clause, in 1969 the Act was made permanent, and continues to be in force today, represented, for example, in the Royal Mail prohibition against mailing horror comics and the matrices used to print them.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the most popular comic for older age-group boys was &quot;Eagle&quot; published by Hulton Press. &quot;Eagle&quot; was published in a more expensive format, and was a gravure-printed weekly, with regular sales of nearly one million. (This format was used originally by &quot;Mickey Mouse Weekly&quot; during the 1930s.) &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s success saw a number of comics launched in a similar format — &quot;TV Century 21&quot;, &quot;Look and Learn&quot; and &quot;TV Comic&quot; being notable examples. Comics published in this format were known in the trade as &quot;slicks.&quot; At the end of the 1960s, these comics moved away from gravure printing, preferring offset litho due to cost considerations arising from decreasing readership.

However, the boys&#x27; adventure comic was still popular, and titles such as &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot;, published by IPC Magazines, saw new adventure heroes become stars, including &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; who would eventually gain his own title. Odhams Press was a company that mainly printed (adventure-oriented) new material; it also reprinted American Marvel Comics material in its Power Comics line, which included the titles &quot;Smash!&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;.

By 1970 the British comics market was in a long-term decline, as comics lost popularity in the face of the rise of other popular pastimes for children. Initially, the challenge was the rising popularity of television, a trend which the introduction of colour television to Britain during 1969 set in stone. In an effort to counter the trend, many publishers switched the focus of their comics to television-related characters. The television shows of Gerry Anderson, such as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, had begun this in the mid-1960s with the launch of tie-in comics such as &quot;TV Century 21&quot; and &quot;Lady Penelope&quot;, which included strips related to Anderson&#x27;s TV shows (as well as other popular programs of the era). Polystyle Publications already published a TV-related comic for young children called &quot;TV Comic&quot;, and in 1971 moved into the older market with &quot;Countdown&quot; (later retitled &quot;TV Action&quot;). The teenage market saw &quot;Look-in&quot; magazine feature strips solely based on popular television programs.

Another strand of the reaction to television was the launch of comics focused entirely on association football (a sport as popular as television amongst boys), with titles such as &quot;Shoot&quot; and &quot;Scorcher and Score&quot;. Those comics that didn&#x27;t compete with the popularity of television began to close down, merging with the few survivors.

In the 1970s very few boys&#x27; comics in the &quot;slick&quot; format were launched, although Polystyle&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; was one exception, launching in 1971 with content similar to &quot;TV21&quot; (which had disappeared by then) and &quot;TV Comic&quot;. &quot;Vulcan&quot;, a reprint title, was another, in 1976. Girls&#x27; titles which had launched in the slick format in the 1960s continued in that format into the 1970s; and others, such as &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Judy&quot;, changed to become slicks. They found themselves in the same market as teenage titles for girls such as &quot;Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Blue Jeans&quot;, which had changed their content and were featuring mainly product-related articles and photo comics.

In 1972, Marvel set up a publishing arm in the UK, Marvel UK, reprinting American superhero strips. These proved extremely popular, and a range of weekly titles was being published by 1975. So much so that in 1976 the parent company briefly published a minimal amount of new material specifically for the UK market in &quot;Captain Britain&quot;. The American reprint material proved to be more successful and continued to appear into the 1980s, at which stage Marvel UK also began diversifying into home-produced original material, both UK-originated strips featuring American created characters such as Captain Britain, the Hulk and the Black Knight, and wholly original strips like &quot;Night Raven&quot;. They also began producing television-based material, initially with &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot;, launched in 1979.

In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, the underground comics movement inspired two new comics in the UK: &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Nasty Tales&quot; were launched with the underground premise of counter-culture rebellion. &quot;Oz&quot; notoriously featured the children&#x27;s character &quot;Rupert the Bear&quot; performing sexual acts. Both magazines were tried at the Old Bailey under the Obscene Publications Act because of their content. The &quot;Oz&quot; defendants were convicted, although the conviction was overturned on appeal. The &quot;Nasty Tales&quot; defendants were cautioned. However, both these comics ceased publication soon after their trial, as much due to the social changes at the end of the counter-culture movement as any effect of the court cases. These were always adult magazines, not aimed at the mainstream children&#x27;s market.

In the mid-1970s, British comics became more action-oriented. The first such title to be launched was &quot;Warlord&quot; in 1974. Published by DC Thomson, it proved to be a success, and led to its then-rival, IPC Magazines Ltd, producing &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;, a comic notably grimmer in style than its competitor. &quot;Battle&#x27;s&quot; success led to IPC launching another, similarly styled title, &quot;Action&quot;, which became a success too but also became controversial, due to its violent content, such as a front cover illustration which appeared to show armed children beating up a helpless police officer. Complaints about its tone eventually led to questions being asked in the House of Commons. As a result, and despite the comics&#x27; popularity, IPC decided to drastically tone down the content after 36 issues, and issue 37 was pulped. When it returned to newsstands it was far less violent, which neutered the comic&#x27;s appeal. The title quickly declined and was merged with &quot;Battle&quot;.
&quot;Action&#x27;s&quot; position as the UK&#x27;s most popular title was taken over by &quot;2000 AD&quot;, a science-fiction comic launched in 1977 by IPC. Created as a comic for older boys, it also held appeal for teenage and even adult readers. In the 1960s IPC began to source comic art from Spain, mainly for financial reasons. This trend was continued through to the launch of &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Carlos Ezquerra is the most notable Spanish artist to have worked in British comics, having worked on both &quot;Battle&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and is credited with the creation of the look of Judge Dredd.

&quot;Star Wars Weekly&quot;, published by Marvel UK, launched in 1977, lasted until 1986. In 1982 &quot;Eagle&quot; was relaunched, this time including photo comics, but still with &quot;Dan Dare&quot; as the lead story. The comic moved it from the front page to the centre pages to allow a more magazine-style cover.

In 1978 &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; by Bryan Talbot began serialisation in &quot;Near Myths&quot; (and continued in other comics after that title folded). &quot;Luther Arkwright&quot; was later collected as a graphic novel, and has been called the first British graphic novel.

In 1982 Dez Skinn launched &quot;Warrior&quot;, possibly the most notable comic of the period, as it contained both the &quot;Marvelman&quot; and &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; strips, by Alan Moore. &quot;Warrior&quot; was a British equivalent of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine. Marvelman was a Captain Marvel clone that Skinn acquired, although the legality of that acquisition has been questioned. In Moore&#x27;s hands, the strip became an &quot;adult&quot; style superhero, and was later reprinted, with the story continued, in an American full-color comic, with the name changed from &quot;Marvelman&quot; to &quot;Miracleman&quot; to avoid any lawsuits that Marvel Comics may have considered. Eventually, &quot;Warrior&quot; succumbed to copyright issues.

Adult comics also witnessed a slight resurgence with &quot;Pssst!&quot;, an attempt to market a French-style monthly bande dessinée, and &quot;Escape&quot; magazine, published by Paul Gravett, former &quot;Pssst!&quot; promotions man. &quot;Escape&quot; featured early work from Eddie Campbell and Paul Grist, amongst others. Neither comic managed to survive in the vagaries of the comics market, &quot;Escape&quot; beset by lack of publisher interest.

During this period a number of smaller publishers were formed to provide inventive publications appealing to niche markets. Congress Press was one of these companies, releasing titles such as &quot;Birthrite&quot;, &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; and a graphic novel, &quot;Spookhouse&quot;. Other small publishers of the era included Harrier Comics (1984–1989) and Acme Press (1986–1995).

Most of the surviving titles published by IPC, Fleetway, and DC Thomson were merged into each other in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the popularity of comics waned further in response to a surge in the popularity of television (a popularity which received another major boost from the late 1970s onward as domestic videocassette recorders became available), and due to the popularity of video games (as inexpensive home computers such as the ZX Spectrum, mainly used for gaming, became available from 1980). Although new comics titles were launched in this period, none seemed to find a sustainable audience.

Notable comics of the period included &quot;Deadline&quot;, &quot;Toxic!&quot;, &quot;Crisis&quot;, and &quot;Revolver&quot;. &quot;Deadline&quot; was conceived by Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins, and mixed original strips with reprints of U.S. strips, notably &quot;Love &amp; Rockets&quot;, and articles and interviews on the British independent music scene of the time. &quot;Tank Girl&quot; was its most notable strip. &quot;Crisis&quot; was published by Fleetway Publications, a company formed from IPC&#x27;s comics holdings. It was aimed at readers who had outgrown &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and featured first works by Garth Ennis and Sean Phillips amongst others.

One publication of that period did find an audience. &quot;Viz&quot; began life in 1979 as a fanzine style publication, before, in 1989, becoming the biggest-selling comic in the country. Based upon bad taste, crude language, crude sexual innuendo, and the parodying of strips from &quot;The Dandy&quot; (among them &quot;Black Bag – the Faithful Border Bin Liner&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Dandy&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Black Bob&quot; series about a Border Collie), the popularity of &quot;Viz&quot; depended entirely upon a variant of Sixties counter-culture; and it promptly inspired similarly themed titles, including &quot;Smut&quot;, &quot;Spit!&quot;, &quot;Talking Turkey&quot;, &quot;Elephant Parts&quot;, &quot;Gas&quot;, &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, &quot;Poot!&quot;, &quot;UT&quot; and &quot;Zit&quot;, all of which failed to achieve &quot;Viz&quot;&#x27;s longevity and folded, while &quot;Viz&quot; remained one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s top-selling magazines.

===21st century===
Beginning in 2000, the British market arrested its long decline. However, there is no sign of any great growth in circulation for the few remaining titles, and no sign of any new launches from mainstream publishers into the comics arena. An ever-increasing number of small press and fanzine titles are being produced, such as &quot;Solar Wind&quot; or &quot;FutureQuake&quot;, aided by the cheapness and increasingly professional appearance of desktop publishing programs. It is from this scene that the UK&#x27;s new talents now tend to emerge (e.g. Al Ewing, Henry Flint or Simon Spurrier).

The English musician Peter Gabriel issued in 2000 The Story of OVO which was released in a CD-booklet-shaped comic book as part of the CD edition with the title &quot;OVO The Millennium Show&quot;. The 2000 Millennium Dome Show based on it.

After they were purchased by Rebellion Developments, both &quot;2000 AD&quot; and the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; have seen the release of more adaptations and trade paperbacks, including complete reprint collections of the entire runs of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; and &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;. Starting in 2006 the &quot;Megazine&quot; began a regular small press section which usually features an article on a title by Matthew Badham or David Baillie and a small press story.

While British companies and creators have helped create the market for collected volumes there have, with a few exceptions like Raymond Briggs, been very few British original graphic novels published. Briggs himself has said &quot;On the Continent, graphic novels have been as accepted as films or books for many years, but England has had a snobby attitude towards them. They&#x27;ve always been seen as something just for children&quot;. However, thanks to the strong sales for Briggs&#x27; &quot;Ethel and Ernest&quot;, and &quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot; winning &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s best first novel award, publishers have started expanding into this area. Random House UK&#x27;s imprint Jonathan Cape has tripled its graphic novel output and Random House has also established Tanoshimi to publish manga. Other publishers have also been increasing their output, which, as well as producing original works like &quot;Alice in Sunderland&quot;, have also been included adaptations of works of literature. There are a number of new publishers who are specifically targeting this area, including Classical Comics and Self Made Hero, the latter having an imprint focused on manga adaptations of the works of Shakespeare.

This highlights another recent change, as there has been an increase in British original English-language manga. Self Made Hero&#x27;s &#x27;Manga Shakespeare&#x27; imprint draws on talent discovered in Tokyopop&#x27;s UK/Irish version of &quot;Rising Stars of Manga&quot;, including members of the UK collective Sweatdrop Studios, who have also contributed to other British-based efforts like ILYA&#x27;s &quot;Mammoth Book of Best New Manga&quot; and &quot;MangaQuake&quot;. Creators involved in those collections who have gone on to do several manga style graphic novels include British based Japanese creators such as Chie Kutsuwada and Michiru Morikawa, as well as, conversely, a British writer based in Japan, Sean Michael Wilson.

Released at the start of the 21st century was &quot;Toxic&quot;, a comic which mixed comic strips alongside game reviews and other articles. Beginning in 2002, this comic proved very successful and is still running. Its influence can be felt on other comics as well most notably when &quot;The Dandy&quot;, Britain&#x27;s longest-running comic at the time, became the &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot; in August 2007; it borrowed many of the features prevalent in &quot;Toxic&quot;, mixing articles alongside comic strips. However, &quot;The Dandy&quot; eventually moved away with this strategy in October 2010, when the comic was revamped, and published its final issue on its 75th anniversary in 2012. The &quot;BeanoMAX&quot; (which also started in 2007) also borrowed some of &quot;Toxic&quot;&#x27;s features. That title was then replaced by &quot;The 100% Official Dennis the Menace and Gnasher Megazine&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Epic&quot; before ending in 2019.

&quot;The DFC&quot; launched at the end of May 2008 drawing together creators from the small press and manga, as well as figures from mainstream British comics and other fields, including author Philip Pullman. As it transpired, it didn&#x27;t make it to its first birthday, ending with issue 43. A new more successful comic, however, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, began in January 2012, a successor to &quot;The DFC&quot; which has already reached 500 issues.

Starting in May 2023, Rebellion published a five-issue series of &quot;Battle Action&quot;, with each issue featuring two complete stories.

==Reprint market for US comics ==
After World War II, the UK was intent on promoting homegrown publishers, and thus banned the direct importation of American periodicals, including comic books. As a result, U.S. comic books typically arrived in the UK as ballast on ships. Although the comics-reading public in the UK was not always able to get reliable supplies of American comics, it has always enjoyed the different approach to comics writing from the other side of the Atlantic.

&quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; — a female version of Tarzan (with an element of H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot; who must be obeyed&quot; – She... Na!) — was licensed from the Eisner &amp; Iger studio for a British/Australasian tabloid, &quot;Wags&quot;, in 1937. The success of this character led to the Sheena stories being repackaged for publication in the United States for Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Jumbo Comics&quot;, thus exporting the character back to her country of origin.

Beginning in the 1940s, the available American comics were supplemented by a variety of black-and-white reprints of Fawcett&#x27;s Captain Marvel, characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, The Phantom, and Marvel Comics&#x27; 1950s monster comics. Several reprint companies were involved in this repackaging American material for the British market, notably L. Miller &amp; Son, the Arnold Book Company, Alan Class Comics, and the importer/distributor/publisher Thorpe &amp; Porter.

Thorpe &amp; Porter began by publishing Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot; series and &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; in the UK. They also republished similar formatted titles under various names. Thorpe &amp; Porter&#x27; Stratos imprint published a long-running Western comics series, &quot;Kid Colt, Outlaw&quot;, which contained black-and-white reprints from both Atlas Comics and DC. T &amp; P also published some material never published in the US.

When Captain Marvel ceased publication in the United States because of a lawsuit, L. Miller &amp; Son copied the entire Captain Marvel idea in every detail, and began publishing their own knock-off under the names Marvelman and Young Marvelman, taking advantage of different copyright laws. These clone versions, created by British writer/artist Mick Anglo, continued for a few years and, as seen above, were revived years later in &quot;Warrior&quot;. The British publishers reprinted many other American series, including the early 1950s &quot;Eerie&quot; and &quot;Black Magic&quot; in black-and-white format. These usually contained the American stories related to the cover but also additional backup stories to fill up the 64 pages.

In 1959, the UK ban on direct importation was lifted. Thorpe &amp; Porter became the sole UK distributor of both DC and Marvel comics. The comics were printed on American printing presses — along with a special cover giving the British price instead of the price in cents — and shipped across the Atlantic. Thus it was that brand-new American-printed copies of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1, &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15, and countless others appeared in the UK.

Thorpe &amp; Porter went bankrupt in 1966 and was purchased by the distribution arm of DC Comics, then known as IND. As a result, T &amp; P&#x27;s output became almost exclusively reprints of DC titles. Marvel Comics superhero reprints appeared in Odhams Press&#x27; Power Comics line in 1966–1969, overlapping for a period with Alan Class Comics&#x27; reprinting of some of Marvel&#x27;s superhero characters. Marvel reprints also appeared in City Magazines&#x27; &quot;TV21&quot; in 1970–1971. And in 1972 Marvel launched Marvel UK, cornering the market on Marvel reprints; key titles included &quot;The Mighty World of Marvel&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man Comics Weekly&quot;. The importation of Marvel&#x27;s American comics continued to be erratic due to Marvel UK&#x27;s promotion of their own reprints, which meant some titles were not offered for periods — &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; being a prime example.

The reprint market really took off in the 1980s with Titan Books releasing collections of British material, as well as signing deals with DC Comics to release that company&#x27;s titles in the UK. Igor Goldkind was Titan&#x27;s (and Forbidden Planet&#x27;s, which was owned by the same company) marketing consultant at the time; he helped popularise the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; for the trade paperbacks they were releasing, which generated a lot of attention from the mainstream press.

Panini Comics took over in 1994, reprinting many of Marvel&#x27;s titles, as well as Marvel UK reprints. Panini&#x27;s titles include &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; (originally holding two issues of either &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; or &quot;Ultimate Marvel Team-Up&quot;, now existing as a double feature with &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;) and also a Collector&#x27;s Edition line of comics, featuring a cardboard cover, three stories and a letters page on the inside back cover. Other titles include &quot;Astonishing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Essential X-Men&quot;, and &quot;Mighty World of Marvel&quot;, which reprints a variety of Marvel Comics. Beginning in 2003, Panini also published one DC comic, &quot;Batman Legends&quot;, reprinting various &quot;Batman&quot; adventures (e.g. two parts of a multi-title crossover and an issue of &quot;)&quot;; this title is now published by Titan Magazines.

=== Reprints of Japanese and European comics ===
Since 2005, a small selection of American translations of the most popular Japanese comics have been reprinted in the UK by major publishers such as Random House (through their Tanoshimi imprint) and the Orion Publishing Group. Both no longer publish British versions of Japanese comics; Random House abandoned all Japanese comics translations in early 2009, while Orion switched to publishing the original American versions.

Simultaneously, the very small press Fanfare/Ponent Mon published a few UK-exclusive English-language editions of alternative Japanese manga and French bande dessinée.

<text>The Psion Series 5 is a personal digital assistant (PDA) from Psion. It came in two main variants, the &quot;Series 5&quot; (launched in 1997) and the &quot;Series 5mx&quot; (1999), the latter having a faster processor, clearer liquid crystal display (LCD), and updated software. There was also a rare &quot;Series 5mx Pro&quot;, which differed only in having the operating system (OS) loaded into random-access memory (RAM) and hence upgradeable. Ericsson marketed a version of the Series 5mx renamed as &quot;MC218&quot;.

The Psion Series 5 was a major upgrade from the Psion Series 3. A Psion Series 4 does not exist, due to Psion&#x27;s concern of tetraphobia in their Asian markets. The external appearance of the Psion Series 5 and the Psion Series 5mx are broadly similar, but their mainboards, screens and other internal components were different and not interchangeable.

The Series 5 was the first to feature a unique sliding clamshell design, whereby the keyboard slides forward as the device opens to counterbalance the display, and brace it such that touchscreen actuation does not topple the device, a feature mentioned in the granted European patent EP 0766166B1. This novel design approach was the work of Martin Riddiford, an industrial designer for Design. A simplified version of this design was also used in the Psion Revo.

The moving parts and hinges can wear out or break. The most serious common problem arose because of a design fault in the screen cable where tooling holes caused needless stresses due to extra bending of the cable at this point each time the Psion Series 5 was opened or closed, and eventually leading to failure of the cable, which caused a serious display malfunction and horizontal lines appearing. The screen cable to the Psion Series 5 was more durable than the screen cable of the Psion Series 5mx. There was an after-market cable available for the 5mx which aimed to eliminate this problem.

At its heart was the 32-bit ARM710-based CL-PS7110 central processing unit (CPU) running at 18 MHz (Series 5) or 36 MHz (5mx), with 4, 8, or 16 MB of RAM. It was powered by two AA batteries, typically giving 10–20 hours of use. The display is a touch-sensitive, backlit half-Video Graphics Array (VGA, pixel) LCD with 16 greyscales. The keyboard, which has a key-pitch of 12.5 mm, is generally considered to be amongst the best for its size, with large-travel keys and touch-type capability. Both RS-232 and infra-red serial connections were provided. A speaker and microphone were also provided, giving dictation as well as music playing ability. External storage was on CompactFlash.
The EPOC operating system, since renamed Symbian OS, was built-in, along with application software including a word processor, spreadsheet, database, email, contact and diary manager, and Psion&#x27;s Open programming language (OPL) for developing software. A Java virtual machine, the mobile browser STNC HitchHiker and synchronizing software for Microsoft Windows was bundled with the 5mx as optional installations and, later, the &quot;Executive Edition&quot; of the 5mx was bundled with various hardware and software extras including version 3.62 of the Opera web browser and a mains electric outlet adapter. A wealth of third-party software was also available, including games, utilities, navigation, reference, communication, and productivity applications, and standard programming tools like Perl and Python.

An open-source software project, OpenPsion, formerly PsiLinux, supports Linux on the Psion 5mx and other Psion PDAs.

Psion&#x27;s experience designing for this form factor and attention to detail made these machines a favourite with power users, many of whom kept using them, despite their age and the appearance of Symbian OS for mobile phones and other PDAs with more impressive specifications.

In 2017, a team of original Psion engineers created a startup company, Planet Computers, to make an Android device in a similar form factor, the Gemini (PDA). The Cosmo Communicator is a development of this device, enhancements including an external touchscreen on the rear of the clamshell lid, mainly to facilitate use as a mobile phone without opening. In 2022 they introduced an updated model called &quot;Astro Slide 5G&quot;, but according to many backers on the Indiegogo crowdfunding website, have largely failed to deliver the product to many that paid for it, and have since 2023 not provided any further updates on the project, leaving the backers disappointed and asking for their money paid to be returned.

<text>Gagarin (), known until 1968 as Gzhatsk (), is a town and the administrative centre of Gagarinsky District of Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located on the Gzhat River, northeast of Smolensk, the administrative centre of the oblast. Population: 

The town&#x27;s former name is from that of the Gzhat River, which is of Baltic origin (cf. Old Prussian &quot;gudde&quot;, meaning &quot;forest&quot;).

==Geography==
===Climate===
Gagarin has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

==History==
In 1718, a village on the territory of modern Gagarin was transformed by a decree of Peter the Great to a transshipment landing stage (called Gzhatsky landing stage). From the mid-18th century, Gzhatsk was a &quot;sloboda&quot;, and in 1776, by a decree by Catherine the Great, it was granted uyezd town status and a coat of arms showing &quot;a barge loaded with bread ready for departure, on a field argent&quot;, meaning that the town was a good landing stage for grain.

The town was built at the crossing of the Moscow road (east-west) and the Smolensk road (north-south, paralleling the river). By the plan of 1773, it was laid out in triangular form. One part paralleled the Gzhat River, another—the road to Moscow, and the base of the triangle connected them.

On August 29, 1812, in the village of Tsaryovo-Zaymishche near Gzhatsk, Mikhail Kutuzov accepted command of the Russian army. On the day of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion, the town was set on fire and burned for several days. It was near Gzhatsk where Denis Davydov&#x27;s guerrilla group started to operate. Russian troops entered the town again on November 2, 1812. When the town was rebuilt in 1817, the former regular layout was basically kept.

On , 1917, Soviet power was proclaimed in Gzhatsk and its uyezd. A year later, there was a counterrevolutionary insurrection.

During World War II, the town housed a flax factory, a sawmill, a brickyard, a roller-mill, a bakehouse complex, a weaving factory, a power station, and a number of guilds. In the course of the war, Gzhatsk was occupied by the German Army from October 9, 1941 until March 6, 1943, when it was liberated by the troops of the Soviet Western Front.

In 1968, the town was renamed Gagarin in honor of the first person to travel into space, Yuri Gagarin, who was born in 1934 in the nearby village of Klushino.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Gagarin serves as the administrative center of Gagarinsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with one rural locality (the settlement of Trufany), incorporated within Gagarinsky District as Gagarinskoye Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Gagarinsky Municipal District.

==International relations==
Gagarin is twinned with:

* Barysaw, Belarus
* Krupki, Belarus
* Orsha, Belarus
* Ratingen, Germany

<text>George Dalgarno (c. 1616 – 1687) was a Scottish intellectual interested in linguistic problems. Originally from Aberdeen, he later worked as a schoolteacher in Oxford in collaboration with John Wilkins, although the two parted company intellectually in 1659.

==Life==
Dalgarno matriculated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1631. Subsequently, he was a schoolteacher in Oxford in the 1650s. In 1657, he was encouraged to upgrade a system of shorthand on which he was working, by Samuel Hartlib, to a more ambitious universal system and he published on the subject later the same year. This effort brought him into contact with members of the Oxford Philosophical Club, one of the precursors of the Royal Society.

==Works==
Dalgarno was the author of &quot;Didascalocophus or the Deaf and Dumb man&#x27;s tutor&quot; (1680), which proposed a totally new linguistic system for use by deaf mutes. 

Dalgarno was also interested in constructing what he called a &#x27;philosophical language&#x27;, now more usually referred to as universal language. A modern translation of his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Art of Signs&quot;, 1661) was published in 2001 in an edition that also includes his autobiography and other manuscript writings.

<text>OLT Express Germany (formerly OLT Ostfriesische Lufttransport GmbH or OLT) was an airline based in Bremen in Germany. The company moved to Bremen from Emden in February 2012. It operated regional scheduled and charter flights linking northern Germany to other parts of the country and Bremen to other European destinations. Its main base was Bremen Airport.

==History==

===Founding and first years===
OLT was founded on 1 November 1958 by Martin Dekker and Jan Janssen as Ostfriesische Lufttaxi - Dekker und Janssen OHG, initially operating air taxi flights to islands in the North Sea from Emden. The first aircraft was a KZ VII from Skandinavisk Aero Industri A/S in Copenhagen. In 1961 the airline hired its first own staff: a pilot and a &#x27;groundstewardess&#x27;.

OLT had, by 1968, five aircraft and operated 13,174 flights. After Janssen&#x27;s death the company AGIV (Aktiengesellschaft für Verkehrswesen) and the shipping company Reederei Visser &amp; van Doornums became 1970 new shareholders and the airlines was renamed into Ostfriesische Lufttaxi GmbH. A schedule service from Emden to Bremen and Hamburg was introduced then. Soon later AGIV became the single shareholder of OLT and positioned the new CEO Christian Ulrich Baron von Kaltenborn-Stachau.

===39 Years of operation as OLT - Ostfriesische Lufttransport===

In 1972 the airlines was renamed again, now into Ostfriesische Lufttransport GmbH (OLT) and Kaltenborn-Stachau took over 26%. Several new schedule services were introduced like from Kassel, Düsseldorf to Cologne/Bonn in 1973 and Hanover, Saarbrücken, Stuttgart, Münster/Osnabrück and Frankfurt in 1974. For the regional airlines business strategy the company DLT (Deutsche Lufttransport-Gesellschaft mbH) was created and OLT was renamed into DLT Luftverkehrsgesellschaft. But soon later AGIV decided to split the Emden (OLT) operation away from DLT. This unit (Emden operation) was sold then to AG EMS and OLT restart its old core activities under its own name. To ensure a flexible operation, especially in the charter sector, OLT organised 1976 a joint platform called OFD with the participating airlines OLT, FLN and Dollart GmbH.

At the beginning 1990s, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the airlines faced an increase of their business activities. OLT started operations in the former East German provinces and 1990 took over Roland Air from Bremen. In 1991 OLT set up a base in Bremen and started with its scheduled services there. In 1996 all OFD activities were integrated into OLT and therefore under the control of AG EMS.

OLT is one of very few airlines that has succeeded in driving a low-cost rival off a route. In December 2005, easyJet started daily flights between Bristol and its base in Hamburg. OLT was operating twice-daily weekday-only services. The route being a predominantly business route, frequency won out over price and easyJet cancelled the route at the end of October 2006.

=== OLT Express Germany===
OLT announced on 4 August 2011 it would undergo major restructuring after losing its shuttle flights contract with Airbus Industries. Effective October 2011 all Fokker and Saab aircraft operations would stop and 100 of its 120 employees were to leave the company. Only the &#x27;island-hopping&#x27; services from Emden to Heligoland and Borkum with small aircraft were to remain. In August 2011, OLT was bought by a Polish shadow banking Ponzi scheme company Amber Gold, which also bought Polish regional carrier Jet Air and the Polish charter airline Yes Airways. These two Polish companies were combined under the brand OLT Express while OLT became OLT Express Germany. The island flights were taken over by a new independent company, OFD Ostfriesischer-Flug-Dienst.

OLT Express Germany completed the purchase of Contact Air in September 2012. The purchase included Contact Air&#x27;s wet-lease contract to operate two aircraft on behalf of Swiss International Air Lines. The same week as the Contact Air purchase Amber Gold was reported to be experiencing financial difficulty and funding for the deal was in question. On 27 July, the Polish OLT Express suspended all services without notice.

In August 2012 Dutch company Panta Holdings announced it was buying OLT Germany from Amber Gold and also finalised the purchase of Contact Air. Panta also owns Denim Air and Maas Air Leasing. Both subsidiaries own Fokker aircraft and Maas leased out two Fokker 100 to Contact Air. In December 2012 it was announced that the wet-lease contract with Swiss International Air Lines would not be renewed and was scheduled to conclude in March 2013.

OLT Express Germany ceased all operations on 27 January 2013 due to financial difficulties. The company filed for bankruptcy two days later.

<doc id="492011" wikidata="Q206696" url="?curid=492011" title="Helvetic Republic">
<text>The Helvetic Republic (; ; ) was a sister republic of France that existed between 1798 and 1803, during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was created following the French invasion and the consequent dissolution of the Old Swiss Confederacy, marking the end of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; in Switzerland. Throughout its existence, the republic incorporated most of the territory of modern Switzerland, excluding the cantons of Geneva and Neuchâtel and the old Prince-Bishopric of Basel.

The Swiss Confederacy, which until then had consisted of self-governing cantons united by a loose military alliance (and ruling over subject territories such as Vaud), was invaded by the French Revolutionary Army and turned into an ally known as the &quot;Helvetic Republic&quot;. The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernizing reforms took place. Resistance was strongest in the more traditional Catholic cantons, with armed uprisings breaking out in spring 1798 in the central part of Switzerland. The French and Helvetic armies suppressed the uprisings, but opposition to the new government gradually increased over the years, as the Swiss resented their loss of local democracy, the new taxes, the centralization and the hostility to religion. Nonetheless, there were long-term effects to the Helvetic citizens.

The Republic&#x27;s name &quot;Helvetic&quot;, after the , the Gaulish inhabitants of the Swiss Plateau in antiquity, was not an innovation; rather, the Swiss Confederacy had occasionally been dubbed &#x27; in humanist Latin since the 17th century, and&#x27;, the Swiss national personification, made her first appearance in 1672. In Swiss history, the Helvetic Republic represents an early attempt to establish a centralized government in the country.

==History==

During the French Revolutionary Wars of the 1790s, the French Republican armies expanded eastward. In 1793, the National Convention had imposed friendship with the United States and the Swiss Confederation as the sole limit while delegating its powers in foreign policy to the Committee of Public Safety, but the situation changed when the more conservative Directoire took power in 1795 and Napoleon conquered Northern Italy in 1796. The French Republican armies enveloped Switzerland on the grounds of &quot;liberating&quot; the Swiss people, whose own system of government was deemed feudal, especially for annexed territories such as Vaud.

Some Swiss nationals, including Frédéric-César de La Harpe, had called for French intervention on these grounds. The invasion proceeded largely peacefully since the Swiss people failed to respond to the calls of their politicians to take up arms.

On 5 March 1798, French troops completely overran Switzerland and the Old Swiss Confederation collapsed. On 12 April 1798, 121 cantonal deputies proclaimed the Helvetic Republic, &quot;One and Indivisible&quot;. On 14 April 1798, a cantonal assembly was called in the canton of Zürich, but most of the politicians from the previous assembly were re-elected. The new régime abolished cantonal sovereignty and feudal rights. The occupying forces established a centralised state based on the ideas of the French Revolution.

Many Swiss citizens resisted these &quot;progressive&quot; ideas, particularly in the central areas of the country. Some of the more controversial aspects of the new regime limited freedom of worship, which outraged many of the more devout citizens.
In response, the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden raised an army of about 10,000 men led by Alois von Reding to fight the French. This army was deployed along the defensive line from Napf to Rapperswil. Reding besieged French-controlled Lucerne and marched across the Brünig pass into the Berner Oberland to support the armies of Bern. At the same time, the French General Balthasar Alexis Henri Antoine of Schauenburg marched out of occupied Zürich to attack Zug, Lucerne and the Sattel pass. Even though Reding&#x27;s army won victories at Rothenthurm and Morgarten, Schauenburg&#x27;s victory near Sattel allowed him to threaten the town of Schwyz. On 4 May 1798, the town council of Schwyz surrendered.

On 13 May, Reding and Schauenburg agreed to a cease-fire, the terms of which included the rebel cantons merging into a single one, thus limiting their effectiveness in the central government. However, the French failed to keep their promises in respecting religious matters and before the year was out there was another uprising in Nidwalden which the authorities crushed, with towns and villages burnt down by French troops.

No general agreement existed about the future of the Swiss. Leading groups split into the &quot;&quot;, who wanted a united republic, and the &quot;Federalists&quot;, who represented the old aristocracy and demanded a return to cantonal sovereignty. Coup attempts became frequent and the new régime had to rely on the French to survive. Furthermore, the occupying forces insisted that the accommodation and feeding of the soldiers be paid for by the local populace, which drained the economy. The treaty of alliance of 19 August with France, which also reaffirmed the French annexation of the Prince-Bishopric of Basel and imposed French rights over the Upper Rhine and the Simplon Pass for evident strategic reasons towards Germany and Italy, also broke the tradition of neutrality established by the Confederation. All this made it difficult to establish a new working state.

In 1799, Switzerland became a virtual battle-zone between the French, Austrian, and Imperial Russian armies, with the locals supporting mainly the latter two, rejecting calls to fight with the French armies in the name of the Helvetic Republic.

Instability in the Republic reached its peak in 1802–1803; it included the &#x27; uprising and the &#x27; civil war of 1802. By then, the Republic was 12 million francs in debt, having started with a treasury of 6 million francs. This, together with local resistance, caused the Helvetic Republic to collapse, and its government took refuge in Lausanne.

At that time, Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul of France, summoned representatives of both sides to Paris in order to negotiate a solution. Although the Federalist representatives formed a minority at the conciliation conference, known as the &quot;Helvetic Consulta&quot;, Bonaparte characterised Switzerland as federal &quot;by nature&quot; and considered it unwise to force the country into any other constitutional framework.

On 19 February 1803, the Act of Mediation abolished the Helvetic Republic and restored the cantons. With the abolition of the centralized state, Switzerland became a confederation once again, called the Swiss Confederation.

==Constitution==
Before the advent of the Helvetic Republic, each individual canton had exercised complete sovereignty over its own territory or territories. Little central authority had existed, with matters concerning the country as a whole confined mainly to meetings of leading representatives from the cantons: the Diets.

The constitution of the Helvetic Republic came mainly from the design of Peter Ochs, a magistrate from Basel. It established a central two-chamber legislature which included the Grand Council (with 8 members per canton) and the Senate (4 members per canton). The executive, known as the Directory, comprised 5 members. The Constitution also established actual Swiss citizenship, as opposed to just citizenship of one&#x27;s canton of birth. Under the Old Swiss Confederacy, citizenship was granted by each town and village only to residents. These citizens enjoyed access to community property and in some cases additional protection under the law. Additionally, the urban towns and the rural villages had differing rights and laws. The creation of a uniform Swiss citizenship, which applied equally for citizens of the old towns and their tenants and servants, led to conflict. The wealthier villagers and urban citizens held rights to forests, common land and other municipal property which they did not want to share with the &quot;new citizens&quot;, who were generally poor. The compromise solution, which was written into the municipal laws of the Helvetic Republic, is still valid today. Two politically separate but often geographically similar organizations were created. The first, the so-called municipality, was a political community formed by-election and its voting body consists of all resident citizens. However, the community land and property remained with the former local citizens who were gathered together into the &quot;&quot;.

After an uprising led by Alois von Reding in 1798, some cantons were merged, thus reducing their anti-centralist effectiveness in the legislature. Uri, Schwyz, Zug and Unterwalden together became the canton of Waldstätten; Glarus and the Sarganserland became the canton of Linth, and Appenzell and St. Gallen combined as the canton of Säntis.

Due to the instability of the situation, the Helvetic Republic had over 6 constitutions in a period of four years.

==Legacy==
The Helvetic Republic did highlight the desirability of a central authority to handle matters for the country as a whole (as opposed to the individual cantons which handled matters at the local level). In the post-Napoleonic era, the differences between the cantons (varying currencies and systems of weights and measurements) and the perceived need for better co-ordination between them came to a head and culminated in the Swiss Federal Constitution of 1848. The Republic&#x27;s 5-member Directory resembles the 7-member Swiss Federal Council, Switzerland&#x27;s executive.

The Helvetic Republic is still very controversial within Switzerland. Carl Hilty described the period as the first democratic experience in Swiss territory, while within conservatism it is seen as a time of national weakness and loss of independence. For cantons such as Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino, the three who in 1898 celebrated the centenary of their independence, the Republic was a time of political freedom and liberation from the rule of other cantons. However, the period was also marked by foreign domination and instability, and for the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden it signified military defeat.
In 1995, the Federal Assembly chose not to celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished. The Federal Councilors took part in official events in Aargau in January 1998. 

The Helvetic period represents a key step toward the modern federal state. For the first time, the population was defined as Swiss, not as inhabitants of a specific canton.

==Administrative divisions==


The Helvetic Republic reduced the formerly sovereign cantons to mere administrative division, though keeping the denomination of cantons, while also raising to such status unrepresented territories previously ruled as subjects of the Confederation. In order to weaken the old power-structures, it defined new boundaries for some cantons. The Act of 1798 and subsequent developments resulted in the following cantons:
* Aargau (without Baden and Fricktal)
* Baden
* Basel
* Bellinzona
* Bern (without Oberland)
* Fribourg
* Fricktal, created in 1802
* Léman (corresponding to Vaud)
* Linth
* Lugano
* Lucerne
* Oberland
* Raetia (corresponding to Graubünden/Grisons)
* Säntis
* Schaffhausen
* Solothurn
* Thurgau
* Waldstätten
* Valais
* Zürich

<text>carbon fixation or the Hatch–Slack pathway is one of three known photosynthetic processes of carbon fixation in plants. It owes the names to the 1960s discovery by Marshall Davidson Hatch and Charles Roger Slack.

 fixation is an addition to the ancestral and more common carbon fixation. The main carboxylating enzyme in photosynthesis is called RuBisCO, which catalyses two distinct reactions using either (carboxylation) or oxygen (oxygenation) as a substrate. RuBisCO oxygenation gives rise to phosphoglycolate, which is toxic and requires the expenditure of energy to recycle through photorespiration. photosynthesis reduces photorespiration by concentrating around RuBisCO.

To enable RuBisCO to work in a cellular environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen, leaves generally contain two partially isolated compartments called mesophyll cells and bundle-sheath cells. is initially fixed in the mesophyll cells in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase in which the three-carbon phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) reacts with to form the four-carbon oxaloacetic acid (OAA). OAA can then be reduced to malate or transaminated to aspartate. These intermediates diffuse to the bundle sheath cells, where they are decarboxylated, creating a -rich environment around RuBisCO and thereby suppressing photorespiration. The resulting pyruvate (PYR), together with about half of the phosphoglycerate (PGA) produced by RuBisCO, diffuses back to the mesophyll. PGA is then chemically reduced and diffuses back to the bundle sheath to complete the reductive pentose phosphate cycle (RPP). This exchange of metabolites is essential for photosynthesis to work.

Additional biochemical steps require more energy in the form of ATP to regenerate PEP, but concentrating allows high rates of photosynthesis at higher temperatures. Higher CO2 concentration overcomes the reduction of gas solubility with temperature (Henry&#x27;s law). The concentrating mechanism also maintains high gradients of concentration across the stomatal pores. This means that plants have generally lower stomatal conductance, reduced water losses and have generally higher water-use efficiency. plants are also more efficient in using nitrogen, since PEP carboxylase is cheaper to make than RuBisCO. However, since the pathway does not require extra energy for the regeneration of PEP, it is more efficient in conditions where photorespiration is limited, typically at low temperatures and in the shade.

==Discovery==
The first experiments indicating that some plants do not use carbon fixation but instead produce malate and aspartate in the first step of carbon fixation were done in the 1950s and early 1960s by Hugo Peter Kortschak and Yuri Karpilov. The pathway was elucidated by Marshall Davidson Hatch and Charles Roger Slack, in Australia, in 1966. While Hatch and Slack originally referred to the pathway as the &quot;C4 dicarboxylic acid pathway&quot;, it is sometimes called the Hatch–Slack pathway.

== Anatomy ==
 plants often possess a characteristic leaf anatomy called &quot;kranz anatomy&quot;, from the German word for wreath. Their vascular bundles are surrounded by two rings of cells; the inner ring, called bundle sheath cells, contains starch-rich chloroplasts lacking grana, which differ from those in mesophyll cells present as the outer ring. Hence, the chloroplasts are called dimorphic. The primary function of kranz anatomy is to provide a site in which can be concentrated around RuBisCO, thereby avoiding photorespiration. Mesophyll and bundle sheath cells are connected through numerous cytoplasmic sleeves called plasmodesmata whose permeability at leaf level is called bundle sheath conductance. A layer of suberin is often deposed at the level of the middle lamella (tangential interface between mesophyll and bundle sheath) in order to reduce the apoplastic diffusion of (called leakage). The carbon concentration mechanism in plants distinguishes their isotopic signature from other photosynthetic organisms.

Although most plants exhibit kranz anatomy, there are, however, a few species that operate a limited cycle without any distinct bundle sheath tissue. &quot;Suaeda aralocaspica&quot;, &quot;Bienertia cycloptera&quot;, &quot;Bienertia sinuspersici&quot; and &quot;Bienertia kavirense&quot; (all chenopods) are terrestrial plants that inhabit dry, salty depressions in the deserts of the Middle East. These plants have been shown to operate single-cell -concentrating mechanisms, which are unique among the known mechanisms. Although the cytology of both genera differs slightly, the basic principle is that fluid-filled vacuoles are employed to divide the cell into two separate areas. Carboxylation enzymes in the cytosol are separated from decarboxylase enzymes and RuBisCO in the chloroplasts. A diffusive barrier is between the chloroplasts (which contain RuBisCO) and the cytosol. This enables a bundle-sheath-type area and a mesophyll-type area to be established within a single cell. Although this does allow a limited cycle to operate, it is relatively inefficient. Much leakage of from around RuBisCO occurs. 

There is also evidence of inducible photosynthesis by non-kranz aquatic macrophyte &quot;Hydrilla verticillata&quot; under warm conditions, although the mechanism by which leakage from around RuBisCO is minimised is currently uncertain.

== Biochemistry ==
In plants, the first step in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis is the fixation of by the enzyme RuBisCO to form 3-phosphoglycerate. However, RuBisCo has a dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity. Oxygenation results in part of the substrate being oxidized rather than carboxylated, resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration. Oxygenation and carboxylation are competitive, meaning that the rate of the reactions depends on the relative concentration of oxygen and .

In order to reduce the rate of photorespiration, plants increase the concentration of around RuBisCO. To do so two partially isolated compartments differentiate within leaves, the mesophyll and the bundle sheath. Instead of direct fixation by RuBisCO, is initially incorporated into a four-carbon organic acid (either malate or aspartate) in the mesophyll. The organic acids then diffuse through plasmodesmata into the bundle sheath cells. There, they are decarboxylated creating a -rich environment. The chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells convert this into carbohydrates by the conventional pathway.

There is large variability in the biochemical features of C4 assimilation, and it is generally grouped in three subtypes, differentiated by the main enzyme used for decarboxylation ( NADP-malic enzyme, NADP-ME; NAD-malic enzyme, NAD-ME; and PEP carboxykinase, PEPCK). Since PEPCK is often recruited atop NADP-ME or NAD-ME it was proposed to classify the biochemical variability in two subtypes. For instance, maize and sugarcane use a combination of NADP-ME and PEPCK, millet uses preferentially NAD-ME and &quot;Megathyrsus maximus&quot;, uses preferentially PEPCK.

===NADP-ME===
The first step in the NADP-ME type pathway is the conversion of pyruvate (Pyr) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), by the enzyme Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). This reaction requires inorganic phosphate and ATP plus pyruvate, producing PEP, AMP, and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The next step is the carboxylation of PEP by the PEP carboxylase enzyme (PEPC) producing oxaloacetate. Both of these steps occur in the mesophyll cells:

:pyruvate + Pi + ATP → PEP + AMP + PPi
:PEP + → oxaloacetate

PEPC has a low KM for — and, hence, high affinity, and is not confounded by O2 thus it will work even at low concentrations of .

The product is usually converted to malate (M), which diffuses to the bundle-sheath cells surrounding a nearby vein. Here, it is decarboxylated by the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) to produce and pyruvate. The is fixed by RuBisCo to produce phosphoglycerate (PGA) while the pyruvate is transported back to the mesophyll cell, together with about half of the phosphoglycerate (PGA). This PGA is chemically reduced in the mesophyll and diffuses back to the bundle sheath where it enters the conversion phase of the Calvin cycle. For each molecule exported to the bundle sheath the malate shuttle transfers two electrons, and therefore reduces the demand of reducing power in the bundle sheath. 

===NAD-ME===

Here, the OAA produced by PEPC is transaminated by aspartate aminotransferase to aspartate (ASP) which is the metabolite diffusing to the bundle sheath. In the bundle sheath ASP is transaminated again to OAA and then undergoes a futile reduction and oxidative decarboxylation to release . The resulting Pyruvate is transaminated to alanine, diffusing to the mesophyll. Alanine is finally transaminated to pyruvate (PYR) which can be regenerated to PEP by PPDK in the mesophyll chloroplasts. This cycle bypasses the reaction of malate dehydrogenase in the mesophyll and therefore does not transfer reducing equivalents to the bundle sheath.

===PEPCK===

In this variant the OAA produced by aspartate aminotransferase in the bundle sheath is decarboxylated to PEP by PEPCK. The fate of PEP is still debated. The simplest explanation is that PEP would diffuse back to the mesophyll to serve as a substrate for PEPC. Because PEPCK uses only one ATP molecule, the regeneration of PEP through PEPCK would theoretically increase photosynthetic efficiency of this subtype, however this has never been measured. An increase in relative expression of PEPCK has been observed under low light, and it has been proposed to play a role in facilitating balancing energy requirements between mesophyll and bundle sheath.

===Metabolite exchange===
While in photosynthesis each chloroplast is capable of completing light reactions and dark reactions, chloroplasts differentiate in two populations, contained in the mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. The division of the photosynthetic work between two types of chloroplasts results inevitably in a prolific exchange of intermediates between them. The fluxes are large and can be up to ten times the rate of gross assimilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1093/jxb/erw303&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The type of metabolite exchanged and the overall rate will depend on the subtype. To reduce product inhibition of photosynthetic enzymes (for instance PECP) concentration gradients need to be as low as possible. This requires increasing the conductance of metabolites between mesophyll and bundle sheath, but this would also increase the retro-diffusion of out of the bundle sheath, resulting in an inherent and inevitable trade off in the optimisation of the concentrating mechanism.

== Light harvesting and light reactions ==
To meet the NADPH and ATP demands in the mesophyll and bundle sheath, light needs to be harvested and shared between two distinct electron transfer chains. ATP may be produced in the bundle sheath mainly through cyclic electron flow around Photosystem I, or in the mesophyll mainly through linear electron flow depending on the light available in the bundle sheath or in the mesophyll. The relative requirement of ATP and NADPH in each type of cells will depend on the photosynthetic subtype. The apportioning of excitation energy between the two cell types will influence the availability of ATP and NADPH in the mesophyll and bundle sheath. For instance, green light is not strongly adsorbed by mesophyll cells and can preferentially excite bundle sheath cells, or &quot;vice versa&quot; for blue light. Because bundle sheaths are surrounded by mesophyll, light harvesting in the mesophyll will reduce the light available to reach bundle sheath cells. Also, the bundle sheath size limits the amount of light that can be harvested.

== Efficiency ==
Different formulations of efficiency are possible depending on which outputs and inputs are considered. For instance, average quantum efficiency is the ratio between gross assimilation and either absorbed or incident light intensity. Large variability of measured quantum efficiency is reported in the literature between plants grown in different conditions and classified in different subtypes but the underpinnings are still unclear. One of the components of quantum efficiency is the efficiency of dark reactions, biochemical efficiency, which is generally expressed in reciprocal terms as ATP cost of gross assimilation (ATP/GA).

In photosynthesis ATP/GA depends mainly on and O2 concentration at the carboxylating sites of RuBisCO. When concentration is high and O2 concentration is low photorespiration is suppressed and assimilation is fast and efficient, with ATP/GA approaching the theoretical minimum of 3.

In photosynthesis concentration at the RuBisCO carboxylating sites is mainly the result of the operation of the concentrating mechanisms, which cost circa an additional 2 ATP/GA but makes efficiency relatively insensitive of external concentration in a broad range of conditions.

Biochemical efficiency depends mainly on the speed of delivery to the bundle sheath, and will generally decrease under low light when PEP carboxylation rate decreases, lowering the ratio of /O2 concentration at the carboxylating sites of RuBisCO. The key parameter defining how much efficiency will decrease under low light is bundle sheath conductance. Plants with higher bundle sheath conductance will be facilitated in the exchange of metabolites between the mesophyll and bundle sheath and will be capable of high rates of assimilation under high light. However, they will also have high rates of retro-diffusion from the bundle sheath (called leakage) which will increase photorespiration and decrease biochemical efficiency under dim light. This represents an inherent and inevitable trade off in the operation of photosynthesis. plants have an outstanding capacity to attune bundle sheath conductance. Interestingly, bundle sheath conductance is downregulated in plants grown under low light and in plants grown under high light subsequently transferred to low light as it occurs in crop canopies where older leaves are shaded by new growth.

==Evolution and advantages==

 plants have a competitive advantage over plants possessing the more common carbon fixation pathway under conditions of drought, high temperatures, and nitrogen or limitation. When grown in the same environment, at 30 °C, grasses lose approximately 833 molecules of water per molecule that is fixed, whereas grasses lose only 277. This increased water use efficiency of grasses means that soil moisture is conserved, allowing them to grow for longer in arid environments.

 carbon fixation has evolved in at least 62 independent occasions in 19 different families of plants, making it a prime example of convergent evolution. This convergence may have been facilitated by the fact that many potential evolutionary pathways to a phenotype exist, many of which involve initial evolutionary steps not directly related to photosynthesis. plants arose around during the Oligocene (precisely when is difficult to determine) and were becoming ecologically significant in the early Miocene around . metabolism in grasses originated when their habitat migrated from the shady forest undercanopy to more open environments, where the high sunlight gave it an advantage over the pathway. Drought was not necessary for its innovation; rather, the increased parsimony in water use was a byproduct of the pathway and allowed plants to more readily colonize arid environments.

Today, plants represent about 5% of Earth&#x27;s plant biomass and 3% of its known plant species. Despite this scarcity, they account for about 23% of terrestrial carbon fixation. Increasing the proportion of plants on earth could assist biosequestration of and represent an important climate change avoidance strategy. Present-day plants are concentrated in the tropics and subtropics (below latitudes of 45 degrees) where the high air temperature increases rates of photorespiration in plants.

==Plants that use carbon fixation==

About 8,100 plant species use carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants. All these 8,100 species are angiosperms. carbon fixation is more common in monocots compared with dicots, with 40% of monocots using the pathway, compared with only 4.5% of dicots. Despite this, only three families of monocots use carbon fixation compared to 15 dicot families. Of the monocot clades containing plants, the grass (Poaceae) species use the photosynthetic pathway most. 46% of grasses are and together account for 61% of species. has arisen independently in the grass family some twenty or more times, in various subfamilies, tribes, and genera, including the Andropogoneae tribe which contains the food crops maize, sugar cane, and sorghum. Various kinds of millet are also . Of the dicot clades containing species, the order Caryophyllales contains the most species. Of the families in the Caryophyllales, the Chenopodiaceae use carbon fixation the most, with 550 out of 1,400 species using it. About 250 of the 1,000 species of the related Amaranthaceae also use .

Members of the sedge family Cyperaceae, and members of numerous families of eudicots – including Asteraceae (the daisy family), Brassicaceae (the cabbage family), and Euphorbiaceae (the spurge family) – also use .

No large trees (above 15 m in height) use , however a number of small trees or shrubs smaller than 10 m exist which do: six species of Euphorbiaceae all native to Hawaii and two species of Amaranthaceae growing in deserts of the Middle-East and Asia.

==Converting plants to ==

Given the advantages of , a group of scientists from institutions around the world are working on the Rice Project to produce a strain of rice, naturally a plant, that uses the pathway by studying the plants maize and &quot;Brachypodium&quot;. As rice is the world&#x27;s most important human food—it is the staple food for more than half the planet—having rice that is more efficient at converting sunlight into grain could have significant global benefits towards improving food security. The team claims rice could produce up to 50% more grain—and be able to do it with less water and nutrients.

The researchers have already identified genes needed for photosynthesis in rice and are now looking towards developing a prototype rice plant. In 2012, the Government of the United Kingdom along with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation provided US$14 million over three years towards the Rice Project at the International Rice Research Institute. In 2019, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation granted another US$15 million to the Oxford-University-led C4 Rice Project. The goal of the 5-year project is to have experimental field plots up and running in Taiwan by 2024.

C2 photosynthesis, an intermediate step between and Kranz , may be preferred over for rice conversion. The simpler system is less optimized for high light and high temperature conditions than , but has the advantage of requiring fewer steps of genetic engineering and performing better than under all temperatures and light levels. In 2021, the UK Government provided £1.2 million on studying C2 engineering.

<text>A multiple rocket launcher (MRL) or multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) is a type of rocket artillery system that contains multiple launchers which are fixed to a single platform, and shoots its rocket ordnance in a fashion similar to a volley gun. Rockets are self-propelled in flight and have different capabilities than conventional artillery shells, such as longer effective range, lower recoil, typically considerably higher payload than a similarly sized gun artillery platform, or even carrying multiple warheads.

Unguided rocket artillery is notoriously inaccurate and slow to reload compared to gun artillery. A multiple rocket launcher helps compensate for this with its ability to launch multiple rockets in rapid succession, which, coupled with the large kill zone of each warhead, can easily deliver saturation fire over a target area. However, modern rockets can use GPS or inertial guidance to combine the advantages of rockets with the higher accuracy of precision-guided munitions.

==History==
The first multiple rocket launchers, known as Huo Che, were invented during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty, in which the Chinese fire lance was fixed backward on a pike or arrow and shot at an enemy as early as 1180. This form of rocket was used during the Mongol siege of Kaifeng.

Chinese militaries later created multiple rocket launchers that fired up to 100 small fire-arrow rockets simultaneously. The typical powder section of the arrow-rockets was 1/3 to 1/2 ft (10 to 15 cm) long. Bamboo arrow shafts varied from 1.5 ft (45 cm) to 2.5 ft (75 cm) long and the striking distance reached 300 to 400 paces. The Chinese also enhanced rocket tips with poison and made sure that the launchers were mobile. They designed a multiple rocket launcher to be carried and operated by a single soldier. Various forms of MRLs evolved, including a launcher mounted on a wheelbarrow.

The Joseon dynasty of Korea used an expanded variant of such a launcher (called a &quot;hwacha&quot;) made of 100 to 200 holes containing rocket arrows placed on a two-wheeled cart. The range of the fired arrows is estimated to have been 2,000 meters. The &quot;hwacha&quot; was used to great effect against invading armies during the Japanese invasions of 1592–1598, most notably the Battle of Haengju, in which 40 hwachas were deployed to repel 30,000 Japanese soldiers.

European armies preferred relatively large single-launch rockets prior to World War II. Napoleonic armies of both sides followed the British adoption of Mysorean rockets as the Congreve rocket. These were explosive steel-cased bombardment rockets with minimal launchers. European navies developed naval multiple launcher mounts with steadily improving explosive rockets for light and coastal vessels. These weapons were largely replaced by conventional light artillery during the late nineteenth century.

===World War II===

The first self-propelled MRLs—and arguably the most famous—was the Soviet BM-13 Katyusha, first used during World War II and exported to Soviet allies afterwards. They were simple systems in which a rack of launch rails was mounted on the back of a truck. This set the template for modern MRLs. The Americans mounted tubular launchers atop M4 Sherman tanks to create the T34 Calliope rocket launching tank, only used in small numbers, as their closest equivalent to the Katyusha. The Germans began using a towed six-tube multiple rocket launcher during World War II, the Nebelwerfer, called the &quot;Screaming Mimi&quot; by the Allies. The system was developed before the war to skirt the limitations of the Treaty of Versailles. Later in the war, 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41s were mounted on modified Opel Maultier &quot;Mule&quot; halftracks, becoming Panzerwerfer 42 4/1s. Another version produced in limited numbers towards the end of the war was a conversion of the Schwerer Wehrmachtschlepper (&quot;heavy military transport&quot;, sWS) halftrack to a configuration similar to the Panzerwerfer 42 4/1, mounting the 10-barreled 15 cm Nebelwerfer.

Another German halftrack MRL system was inspired by the Russian BM-13. Keeping the Soviet 82 mm rocket caliber as well as the launch and rocket stabilisation designs, it was developed into a system of two rows of 12 guide rails mounted to a Maultier chassis, each row providing the capacity for 24 rockets, underslung as well as on top of the rails, for 48 rockets total. This vehicle was designated 8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer (8 cm multiple rocket launcher). As the launch system was inspired by and looked similar to the BM-13, which the Germans had nicknamed &quot;Stalin-Orgel&quot; or &quot;Stalin-Organ&quot;, the Vielfachwerfer soon became known as the &quot;Himmler-Orgel&quot;, or &quot;Himmler-Organ&quot;.

==Types==

There are two main types of MRLs:
* With tubes or pipes, usually made of steel, non-removable from launcher, with options to be reloaded on the battlefield with rockets loaded manually or semi-automatically. This was the most usual type until the 21st century. It is more convenient for battlefield usage because it does not require special tools to reload modules and test them before using them on launchers as with other types.
* With containers, pods or modules that can be removed from the launcher and quickly replaced with same or different types of rockets and calibers. They are usually reloaded at a factory or within specially-equipped army workshops. These are more modern types of weapons as they are not necessarily related to just one type of rocket and give more options to commanders in the field to deal with different tactical situations using different types of rockets or to quickly reload. They are also easier to upgrade for different types of rockets.

==Current usage==

Like all artillery, MRLs have a reputation of devastating morale on ill-disciplined or already-shaken troops. The material effect depends on circumstances, as well-covered field fortifications may provide reasonable protection.

MRLs are still unable to properly engage reverse slope positions in mountain warfare because it is more difficult to determine the trajectory compared to that of a howitzer by adding or removing propellant increments. Simple MRL rocket types have a rather long minimum firing range for the same reason. An approach to lessen this limit is the addition of drag rings to the rocket nose. The increased drag slows the rocket down relative to a clean configuration and creates a less flat trajectory. Pre-packaged MRL munitions do not offer this option but some MRL types with individually loaded rockets do.

Improvised MRLs based on helicopter or aircraft-mounted rocket pods (typically of 57–80mm caliber) especially on light trucks and pickups (so-called &quot;technicals&quot;) are often seen in civil wars when rebels make use of captured launchers and munitions.

Modern MRL systems can use modern land navigation (especially satellite navigation such as GPS) for quick and accurate positioning. The accurate determination of the battery position previously required such effort that making a dispersed operation of the battery was at times impractical. MRL systems with GPS can have their MRLs dispersed and fire from various positions at a single target, just as previously multiple batteries were often united on one target area.

Radar may be used to track weather balloons to determine winds or to track special rockets that self-destruct in the air. The tracking allows determination of the influence of winds and propellant temperatures on the rockets&#x27; flight paths. These observations can then be factored into the firing solution for the rocket salvo for effect. Such tracking radars can also be used to predict the range error of individual rockets. Trajectory-correcting munitions may then benefit from this, as a directional radio may send a coded message to the rocket to deploy air brakes at just the right time to correct most of the range error. This requires that the rockets were originally aimed too far, as the range can only be shortened by the air brakes, not extended.

A more sophisticated system makes use of radar data and a one-way radio datalink to initiate a two dimensional (range and azimuth) correction of the rocket&#x27;s flight path with steering by fins or nose thrusters. The latter is more common with systems which can be used to upgrade old rockets and the IMI ACCULAR is an example.

Fin-stabilised rockets also allow for easy course corrections using rudders or minute charges. Precision-guided munitions have been introduced to exploit this. Guidance principles such as satellite navigation, inertial navigation systems and semi-active laser seekers are used for this. This improves dispersion from a CEP of hundreds of meters at dozens of kilometers&#x27; range to just a few meters and largely independent of the range of the round (except for INS, as INS navigation creates a small dispersion that is about proportional to range). This in turn made great increases of rocket (or missile) ranges useful; previously dispersion had made rockets too inefficient and often too dangerous to friendly troops at long ranges.
Long-range MRL missiles often fly a higher quasi-ballistic trajectory than shorter-ranged rockets and thus pose a de-confliction challenge, as they might collide with friendly aircraft in the air.

The differences between an MRL missile and a large anti-tank guided missile, such as the Nimrod, have blurred due to guided MRL missiles such as the M31 GMLRS (guided unitary multiple launch rocket system), which passed flight tests in 2014.

<text>Prentis Cobb Hale Jr. (July 30, 1910 – February 16, 1996) was an American entrepreneur.

The son of Prentis Cobb Hale I, who with two brothers, founded Hale Brothers &amp; Co. Inc., in Sacramento, California in 1881. Prentis Hale Jr. earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1933 and an LL.B. in 1936, both at Stanford University. He was admitted to the California Bar in 1936.

In 1936, he began his business career as a stock clerk working in the basement of the family business, Hale Bros. Stores. By 1948, he was the company&#x27;s president. Hale Bros merged with Los Angeles–based Broadway Department Stores to form Broadway-Hale Stores Inc. He was chairman of the new company from 1950 to 1972. Edward W. Carter (1911–1996) succeeded Hale in the post, followed by Philip M. Hawley. The company, later known as Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., owned the Emporium, Weinstock&#x27;s and The Broadway, as well as Neiman-Marcus, prior to its two famous bankruptcies.

He was also a vice president of the Bank of America and a member of the Bohemian Club. He died in San Francisco on February 16, 1996. 

He had four children with his first wife, Marialice King Hale, who died by suicide in March 1969. He later married Denise Minnelli, the former wife of director Vincente Minnelli.

<text>The Peace Center is a performing arts center located in Greenville, South Carolina. It is composed of a concert hall, theater, and amphitheatre. Located adjacent to Falls Park, the center hosts over 300 events each year, including classical music, Broadway shows, pop stars, and magic shows including David Copperfield.

==About==

Under consideration since at least the 1970s, a new Greenville performing arts center was being designed and was of utmost importance for then-mayor Bill Workman. The Peace Center is named after the local Peace family who donated $10 million towards its development. The center was opened in 1990 and is built on the former site of three dilapidated factories – one that produced wagons for the Confederate Army, a textile plant built in the 1880s, and a former home of Duke&#x27;s Mayonnaise.
There are three resident companies: Greenville Symphony Orchestra, Carolina Ballet Theatre, and the International Ballet. In January 2004, the Peace Center hosted a debate among Democratic presidential candidates. In May 2011, it was the site of the first Republican debate for the 2012 presidential election. In February 2016, it was the site of the ninth Republican debate for the 2016 presidential election.

The TD Stage at the Peace Center (formerly the Peace Center Amphitheater) opened September 12, 2012, hosting Vince Gill. The night started with Mayor Knox White and TD executives hosting a ribbon cutting ceremony. Seating capacity is projected to be 1,400+. Patrons are able to sit along the tiered seat-walls or use blankets or lawn chairs in the open-seating areas.

The Brian Setzer Orchestra performed at the Peace Center in 2006 for their Christmas Rocks Tour, and also played some of their hits like &quot;Jump, Jive, and Wail&quot;.

In 2022, a $36 million renovation project was revealed.

<text>Juan José Ibarretxe Markuartu (born 15 March 1957) is a former president of the Basque Autonomous Community in Spain. Also a leading member of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) during the period, he held office from 2 January 1999 to 7 May 2009. Ibarretxe is an advocate of Basque independence by peaceful means.

==Origins and early political career==

He was born in Llodio in the province of Álava, and holds a degree in Economics from the University of the Basque Country. In 1983 he was elected a member of the Basque Parliament for Álava, representing the PNV, and from then on rose steadily to prominence. From 1986-1990 and 1991-1994 he was the President of the PNV Economic and Budgetary Commission. On 4 January 1995, then Basque President José Antonio Ardanza appointed him Vice President.

==Lehendakari==
On 28 March 1998, he was nominated PNV presidential candidate to compete in the October 25 Basque election, and became lehendakari (president) on 2 January 1999. In October 2003 he released the highly controversial Ibarretxe Plan (&quot;Plan Ibarretxe&quot;), which foresaw a future Basque country freely associated with Spain, with its own separate legal system and European Union (EU) representation. In October 2007 while in office he was prosecuted for holding talks with other political agents in search for a compromise leading to peace, considered illegal by the judge for the participation of former members of Batasuna.

==Private life and hobbies==

Ibarretxe grew up speaking only Spanish, but now speaks Basque acceptably and English. He is an avid cycling fan and has presided over a cycling club in Llodio. He is married and has two children. He is a non-practising Roman Catholic.

<doc id="492026" wikidata="Q215721" url="?curid=492026" title="Theodore Bikel">
<text>Theodore Meir Bikel ( ; May 2, 1924 – July 21, 2015) was an Austrian-American actor, singer, musician, composer, unionist, and political activist. 

He made his stage debut in &quot;Tevye the Milkman&quot; in Mandatory Palestine, where he lived as a teenager. He later studied acting at Britain&#x27;s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and made his London stage debut in 1948 and in New York in 1955. He was also a widely recognized and recorded folk singer and guitarist. In 1959, he co-founded the Newport Folk Festival, and created the role of Captain von Trapp opposite Mary Martin as Maria in the original Broadway production of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. In 1969, Bikel began acting and singing on stage as Tevye in the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, a role he performed more often than any other actor to date. The production won nine Tony Awards, and was one of the longest-running musicals in Broadway history.

He also appeared in films, including &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952), &quot;The Kidnappers&quot; (1953), &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957), &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966), and &quot;200 Motels&quot; (1971). For his portrayal of Sheriff Max Muller in &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958), he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Bikel was president of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America until 2014, and was president of Actors&#x27; Equity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He served as the chairman of the board of directors of Partners for Zionist Israel, where he also lectured.

Bikel was portrayed by Michael Chernus in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

==Early years==
Theodore Bikel was born into a Jewish family in Vienna, Austria, the son of Miriam (née Riegler) and Josef Bikel, from Bukovina. As an active Zionist, his father named him after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Following the German annexation of Austria in 1938, Bikel&#x27;s family fled to Palestine, where his father&#x27;s contacts helped the family obtain British passports. Bikel studied at the Mikve Yisrael agricultural school and joined Kibbutz Kfar HaMaccabi.

Bikel started acting while in his teens. He performed with Habimah Theatre in 1943, and was one of the founding members of the Cameri Theatre, which became a leading Israeli theatre company. He described his acting experience there as similar to, if not better than, the method acting techniques taught at the Actors Studio in New York. &quot;The Habimah people were much closer to the Method, indeed, than Lee Strasberg was, because they were direct disciples of Stanislavski.&quot;

In 1945, he moved to London to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Finding work almost immediately, from the mid 40s to the late 50s, Bikel appeared in a slew of British B-movies, and the occasional &#x27;A&#x27; film too, usually playing heavies and crooks of various European nationalities despite having perfected his English accent. He played the lead role in 1956 English film drama Flight from Vienna. Despite his success in the UK, the ever-ambitious Bikel travelled to the States in 1954 to pursue his career in the more lucrative Hollywood movie industry and on Broadway, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1961.

Bikel did not return to live in Palestine, nor did he take part in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Bikel wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Theo&quot;: &quot;A few of my contemporaries regarded [not returning to Palestine] as a character flaw, if not a downright act of desertion. In me there remains a small, still voice that asks whether I can ever fully acquit myself in my own mind.&quot;

==Career==
===Actor===
In 1948, Michael Redgrave recommended Bikel to his friend Laurence Olivier as understudy for the parts of both Stanley Kowalski and Harold &quot;Mitch&quot; Mitchell in the West End theatre district premiere of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in London, (England / United Kingdom). Aside from being an understudy, Bikel&#x27;s main role in the production was the relatively minor part of Pablo Gonzales. He graduated from supporting actor and understudy, though, to star opposite the director&#x27;s wife, Vivien Leigh, with a sudden, unplanned performance when a co-star, playing the role of Mitch, came down with a case of flu. Bikel showed up backstage and went directly to Leigh&#x27;s dressing room to ask if she wanted to rehearse with him, to make sure he was right for the role. She replied that she did not need to: &quot;Go and do it,&quot; she said. &quot;You are a professional, and Larry gave you this job because he trusted you to do it well.&quot; After the show, Leigh told him, &quot;Well done.&quot;

For most of his acting career, he was known for his versatility in playing characters of different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds; he claimed he took on those different personalities so his acting would &quot;never get stale&quot;. On television, he played an Armenian merchant on &quot;Ironside&quot;, a Polish professor on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, an American tyrannical college / law school professor on &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (television version of the earlier feature film &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (1973), starring John Houseman as &quot;Professor Kingsley&quot;), a Bulgarian villain on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, a Belarusian on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and an Italian on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

In movies, he played an Imperial German naval gunboat officer of the First World War era in &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951) opposite Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn and in the World War II combat film on a Nazi German U-boat / submarine in &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957) starring Robert Mitchum and Curd Jürgens, a Southern &quot;redneck&quot; sheriff chasing two chained escaped convicts Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis in &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, and a Russian submarine captain whose boat gets grounded on the beach near the rural village on Gloucester Island of the New England rocky coast causing residents to panic of a threatening Russian Soviet Union / Red Navy invasion in the Cold War era comedy &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming!!!&quot; (1966), along with Alan Arkin, Brian Keith, Jonathan Winters and Carl Reiner. He also portrayed the sadistic General Jouvet in &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957), and was screen tested for the role of Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), though the part ultimately fell to German actor Gert Fröbe. In &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), he played the overbearing Hungarian linguist Zoltan Karpathy.

He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in &quot;Tonight in Samarkand&quot;, and in 1958 was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for &quot;The Rope Dancers&quot;. In 1959, he created the role of Austria-Hungary Empire naval Captain von Trapp in the original stage musical production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which earned him a second &quot;Tony&quot; nomination. Bikel did not like his role because his ability to sing was underused; neither did he like performing the same role of the captain repeatedly. When the famous longtime musical composers, Rodgers and Hammerstein, realized Bikel was an accomplished folksinger, they wrote the song &quot;Edelweiss&quot; (purporting within the story to be an Austrian folk song) specifically for him to sing and accompany himself on the guitar.

In 1964, he played Zoltan Karpathy, the dialect expert, in the film version of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Since his first appearance as Tevye in the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1967), Bikel had performed the role more often than any other actor (more than 2,000 times). When an injury required 74-year-old fellow Israeli performer Chaim Topol (veteran of many productions of the stage show and star of the later 1967 motion picture &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;) to withdraw from a high-budget, much-promoted 2009 North American tour of the revival musical, Bikel substituted for him in several appearances in 2010.

Bikel was a guest star on many popular television series in the 1950s (often called the first &quot;Golden Age of Television&quot;). He appeared in an episode of the 1954 NBC legal drama &quot;Justice&quot; based on cases from the Legal Aid Society of New York. He also appeared in the episode entitled &quot;The Faithful Pilgrimage&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot; anthology series. That particular episode was written by Rod Serling. He also appeared in a second episode of &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot; entitled &quot;Return of the Stranger&quot;. Bikel also appeared in an acting role in Frank Zappa&#x27;s experimental film &quot;200 Motels&quot; (1971).

Bikel continued guest-starring in the following decades of the 1960s and 1970s beginning on Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (episode &quot;Four O&#x27;Clock&quot; as Oliver Crangle). He appeared on episodes of the Western series of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and the World War II drama &quot;Combat!&quot; in the season-three episode &quot;Mountain Man&quot; as Francois Perrault. Then the police dramas of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot; (1977, &quot;The Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case&quot;), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, then back to family Western on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, and the long-running &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. International intrigue on &quot;&quot;, 1980s primetime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;, the iconic &#x27;70s sitcom of &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1978), along with more police / detective dramas on &quot;Knight Rider&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;; and &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot; (1987 episode &quot;Elegy for a Tramp&quot; as Gerringer).

In the early 1990s, he appeared on the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, in the episode &quot;Family&quot;, playing Sergey Rozhenko, Worf&#x27;s Belarusian-born adoptive father. Bikel continued in the sci-fi genre with performing two roles in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; universe, in 1994 as Rabbi Koslov in the first-season episode &quot;TKO&quot; and in 1998, as Ranger leader Lenonn in the TV movie &quot;Babylon 5: In the Beginning&quot;.

Bikel was nominated for the Drama Desk Award in 2010 for outstanding solo performance for &quot;Sholom Aleichem: Laughter Through Tears&quot;, an off-Broadway play that he also wrote. In 2012, Bikel played the title role in &quot;Visiting Mr. Green&quot; with the Harold Green Jewish Theatre Company in Toronto, Canada. In 2013, Bikel starred in &quot;Journey 4 Artists&quot;, a documentary that celebrates the power of music and religious diversity.

===Folk singer and composer===
In 1955, at the suggestion of Jac Holzman of Elektra Records, Bikel began recording songs, including several albums of Jewish folk songs and songs from Russia and other countries, making over 20 contemporary and folk music albums during his career. For those, he played acoustic guitar alone or accompanied by other musicians. He was able to sing in 21 different languages, including Yiddish, Hebrew, German, Russian, Hungarian, Romanian, French, medieval Spanish, Zulu, and English. His early albums included &quot;Israeli Folk Songs&quot; (1955) and &quot;Songs of Russian Old &amp; New&quot; (1960). Bikel&#x27;s live performances were issued on two albums: &quot;Bravo Bikel&quot; (1959), and &quot;Bikel on Tour&quot; (1963).

In 1959, Bikel co-founded the Newport Folk Festival (together with Pete Seeger, Harold Leventhal, Oscar Brand, and George Wein). He performed a number of recorded duets with Judy Collins at various festivals and on television. During an interview, when asked what inspired him to become involved in organizing a folk festival, he said that music was &quot;one of the few answers to the chaos that we have,&quot; one of the only recourses to avoid social strife, and a means of giving youth hope for a better world.

In 1962, Bikel became the first singer besides Dylan to perform &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; in public. Bikel viewed the then 21-year-old Bob Dylan as one of those young performers expressing emotional and social messages through song. In 1963, Bikel joined Dylan, Seeger, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Joan Baez for the festival grand finale as they sang &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;. Following the festival, Bikel, Seeger, and Dylan traveled to a planned rally in Greenwood, Mississippi, to perform Dylan&#x27;s newly written song, &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot;, about the man who murdered Medgar Evers. Originally, only Bikel and Seeger were scheduled to perform, but Bikel wanted Dylan to go with them. He told Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what. Buy him a ticket. Don&#x27;t tell him where it came from. Tell him it&#x27;s time to go down and experience the South.&quot;

Bikel&#x27;s close friendship with Seeger was sometimes tested as a result of the Newport festival&#x27;s choice of performers. On one occasion, Seeger became infuriated during Bob Dylan&#x27;s legendary 1965 performance accompanied by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Seeger expected Bikel to support him: &quot;Theo, for Chrissake—tell them. Set them straight!&quot; Bikel, as well as Seeger, was shocked when Bob Dylan turned electric at the festival, an event some call &quot;Dylan&#x27;s declaration of musical independence&quot;, but Bikel stepped forward and told Seeger, &quot;Peter, this band, these rebels—they are us. They are what we were 20 years ago. Remember?&quot; Seeger stared at him &quot;like a trauma victim&quot;, as Bikel succeeded in calming Seeger down enough to let the group finish their songs.

His album &quot;A Folksinger&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1964) featured Jim McGuinn (as he was then known) on banjo. Bikel (with business partner Herb Cohen) opened the first folk music coffee house in Los Angeles, The Unicorn. Its popularity led to the two opening a second club, Cosmo Alley, which, in addition to folk music, presented poets such as Maya Angelou and comics including Lenny Bruce. Bikel became increasingly involved with civil-rights issues and progressive causes, and was a Eugene McCarthy delegate to the 1968 Democratic Convention.

==Personal life==
Bikel was married four times. He married Ofra Ichilov in 1952. They divorced the following year. His second marriage was in 1967 to Rita Weinberg Call, with whom he had two children. They divorced in 2008. He married conductor Tamara Brooks later that year. She died in 2012. He married journalist and foreign correspondent Aimee Ginsburg on December 29, 2013.

===Political activism===
Bikel was a longtime activist in the civil-rights and human-rights movements, participating as a fundraiser with performances. He co-founded the Actors Federal Credit Union in 1962, and in 1968, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was president of Actors&#x27; Equity from 1977 to 1982, in which office he supported human-rights causes. Since 1988, he had been president of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America.

Upon hearing of his death, Actors’ Equity wrote: &quot;From the time he joined Equity in 1954, Bikel has been an advocate for the members of our union and his extraordinary achievements paved the way for so many. No one loved theater more, his union better, or cherished actors like Theo did. He has left an indelible mark on generations of members past and generations of members to come. We thank you, Theo, for all you have done.&quot;

Bikel was an active supporter and campaigner for John F. Kennedy. He did some of his campaigning during the run of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which got him into trouble with the producers, who did not think it was becoming for an actor. He recalls, &quot;I would go out sometimes between matinee and evening performances, go to a rally and speak from a flat-bed truck, and then come back to the theater.&quot; The producers stopped complaining, however, when after one show he was picked up backstage by a limousine carrying Eleanor Roosevelt, and he accompanied her to a Democratic rally as her special guest.

In 1968, Bikel supported the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy and attended the 1968 Democratic National Convention after being elected as a pro-McCarthy delegate in New York.

At the 1977 AFL–CIO Convention, Bikel welcomed Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky upon his release from the Soviet Union. He was arrested in front of the Soviet Embassy in Washington in 1986 while protesting the plight of Soviet Jews.

President Jimmy Carter appointed him to serve on the National Council for the Arts in 1977 for a six-year term. In 2007, he served as chair of the board of directors of Meretz USA (now Partners for Zionist Israel).

He was a member of the high-IQ collective Mensa International.

==Death==
Bikel died on July 21, 2015, at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles of natural causes, according to publicist Harlan Boll, survived by Ms. Ginsburg, his sons from his second marriage, Robert and Daniel, and three grandchildren. He was buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Danielle Harris (born June 1, 1977) is an American actress. She is known as a &quot;scream queen&quot; for her roles in multiple horror films, including four entries in the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise: &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot; (1988) and &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; (1989) as Jamie Lloyd, and &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007) and &quot;Halloween II&quot; (2009) as Annie Brackett. Other such roles include Tosh in &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998), Belle in &quot;Stake Land&quot; (2010), and Marybeth Dunston in the &quot;Hatchet&quot; series (2010–17). In 2012, she was inducted into the &quot;Fangoria&quot; Hall of Fame.

Harris began her career as a child actress, with various appearances on television and prominent roles in films such as &quot;Marked for Death&quot; (1990), &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; (1991), &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; (1991), &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993) and &quot;Daylight&quot; (1996). She is also known for her voice work, which includes playing Debbie Thornberry for the full run of the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; (1998–2004) and in the related films &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; (2002) and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; (2003).

In 2013, Harris made her feature directorial debut with the horror film &quot;Among Friends&quot;, after previously directing &quot;Madison&quot; (a segment in the unfinished anthology film &quot;Prank&quot;) in 2008 and a &quot;Stake Land&quot; companion short film in 2010.

== Early life ==

Harris was born in Plainview, New York and was raised by her mother Fran, along with her sister Ashley. Harris is Jewish. While living in Florida during elementary school, Harris won a beauty contest, winning a trip to New York City for ten days. While there, she was offered various modeling jobs, but turned them down because they were all far from her home. Her mother was eventually transferred back to New York for work and Harris began work as a model. She also began appearing in television commercials.

== Career ==

=== 1985–1989: Early roles and &quot;Halloween&quot; ===

In 1985, at age seven, Harris was cast in the role of Samantha &quot;Sammi&quot; Garretson in the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and stayed on the program for three years. Her character was considered a &quot;miracle child&quot;, extracted as an embryo from the womb of her deceased mother and implanted in a family friend, whom her father later married. In 1987, Harris made a guest appearance in the series &quot;&quot;.

Following her early television work, Harris successfully auditioned for the role of Jamie Lloyd in the fourth edition of the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise, beating out several other young actresses, Melissa Joan Hart among them. &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot; was released in October 1988, grossing over $17 million on a $5 million budget. On doing this type of film at such a young age, Harris said:

Harris returned the following year for the sequel, &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot;, which did not perform as well as its predecessor at the box office. Harris portrayed Jamie Lloyd once again, this time her character being traumatized and mute for the first half of the film. Critics cited Harris&#x27; performance as one of the strongest aspects of the film.

=== 1990s: Film, television and voice work ===

In 1990, Harris appeared in &quot;Marked for Death&quot; as protagonist John Hatcher (Steven Seagal)&#x27;s niece Tracey. The action film had a $12 million budget and earned $43 million domestically and $57 million worldwide. 1991 saw Harris partake in several film and television projects, including the made-for-television films &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch My Daughter&quot;, as a young girl who is kidnapped and molested, and &quot;The Killing Mind&quot;, in which she portrayed main character Isobel as a child. Later that year, Harris made an appearance in the sketch-oriented show &quot;In Living Color&quot;.

Harris&#x27; next film role was in the 1991 comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot;, as Melissa Crandell, with the story revolving around five siblings whose mother goes to Australia for two months, only to have her children&#x27;s babysitter die. The young protagonists choose not to tell their mother and attempt to live on their own. The same year, Harris had a guest role in the series &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot;, portraying a character who receives a heart transplant then begins to act like the heart&#x27;s original owner, and also guest starred in an episode of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, as Susie Maxwell. Harris had the role of Darian Hallenbeck in the 1991 action film &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, alongside Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans. The film grossed $7,923,669 in its opening weekend, and the total gross was $59,509,925. Reviews were mixed, and some critics cited the Christmastime release for such a violent film as a reason for its underwhelming box office.

1992 saw Harris participate in the pilot for the potential CBS series &quot;1775&quot;, although it was not picked up. Between 1992 and 1993, Harris had the recurring role of Molly Tilden on the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; (which she would reprise in a 2021 episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot; sequel series &quot;The Conners&quot;), then joined Roseanne Barr again in 1993 for the television film &quot;The Woman Who Loved Elvis&quot;, this time as Elvis Presley&#x27;s daughter Priscilla. She appeared in an episode of &quot;Jack&#x27;s Place&quot; the same year, portraying a teenage runaway. Also in 1993, Harris portrayed Gwenie in the film &quot;Free Willy&quot;, which had a US gross of $7,868,829 in its opening weekend, and went on to make $77,698,625 in the US and $153,698,625 worldwide. In 1994, she appeared on the drama series &quot;The Commish&quot;, playing the role of Sheri Fisher for one episode. The same year, Harris portrayed the main character&#x27;s daughter Jessica in the television film &quot;Roseanne: An Unauthorized Biography&quot;, based upon her former co-star Roseanne Barr. She then guest starred in the sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, as Theresa &quot;T.K.&quot; Keiner.

In 1995, Harris learned that the producers of &quot;&quot; were looking for an actress over the age of 18 to play the role of Jamie Lloyd. Only 17 at the time, Harris got emancipated in order to participate, but was dissatisfied with the fate of the character in the script and the low salary offered. She abstained from reprising her role and was replaced by J. C. Brandy, although she can still be seen in &quot;&quot; of the film, which replays &quot;Halloween 5&quot;″s ending. Harris has since admitted to being glad she did not rejoin the series at this point, believing that this allowed her to make her later return in the 2007 remake of the original &quot;Halloween&quot;.

In 1996, Harris shared dual roles with Katherine Heigl for the television film &quot;Wish Upon a Star&quot;: Harris played Hayley Wheaton, a nerdy girl who switches bodies with her older, more popular sister Alexia (Heigl). Also in 1996, Harris starred in the films &quot;Shattered Image&quot; and &quot;Back to Back&quot;, and, the same year, had the role of young survivor Ashley Crighton in &quot;Daylight&quot;, the disaster film toplined by Sylvester Stallone. While &quot;Daylight&quot; has a 26% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and grossed $33 million in the United States, it took in over $126 million overseas, resulting in gross earnings of $159,212,469 worldwide. In 1997, Harris appeared in two episodes of the medical drama &quot;ER&quot; as Laura Quentin. In 1998, Harris had the lead role of Lulu in the film &quot;Dizzyland&quot;, where she portrayed a sexually abused teenager, and also appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot;. She then appeared in the popular slasher &quot;Urban Legend&quot;, her first horror film since her early &quot;Halloween&quot; credits. She portrayed Tosh, a goth girl who is murdered while her roommate Natalie (Alicia Witt) is resting on the other side of the room.

Beginning in 1998, Harris was among the main cast of Nickelodeon&#x27;s animated children&#x27;s series &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, chosen to voice Debbie Thornberry, the sister of a girl who can talk to animals. The protagonist, Eliza, travels the world with her family and uses her special ability to help the animals. The series lasted for five seasons, with a total of 91 episodes. It spawned several animated films early in the next decade, with its series finale airing in 2004. Harris would continue to make film and television appearances while doing &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;: she portrayed a teenage witch named Aviva in a 1998 episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;, starred in the 1999 film &quot;Goosed&quot; as protagonist Charlene in her younger years, and appeared as Justine in the television film &quot;Hard Time: Hostage Hotel&quot;.

=== 2000s: Continued work and return to &quot;Halloween&quot; ===

 Harris had a supporting role in the crime and comedy film &quot;Poor White Trash&quot; in 2000 and went on to star in the 2001 comedy &quot;Killer Bud&quot;. Between 2000 and 2002, Harris was a cast member of the series &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;. Her character, Plum Wilkinson, featured in all but eight episodes and was involved in a romantic relationship with Kevin Dillon. Her animated series &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; had spin-off movies in the early 2000s: the television film &quot;The Origin of Donnie&quot; from 2001 was followed by the 2002 theatrical release of &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;, which grossed $40,108,697 in the US, and a further film, &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, dealt with the Thornberrys meeting the characters from the popular series &quot;Rugrats&quot;. Released in 2003, it opened at #4 at the box office and grossed $39 million in the US, about the same as the &quot;Thornberrys Movie&quot;. Harris also appeared in an episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, had a supporting role as Leila in the 2003 television film &quot;The Partners&quot; and was in the theatrically released films &quot;Debating Robert Lee&quot; and &quot;Em &amp; Me&quot; (both 2004). From 2004 to 2005, she was a main cast member of the animated sitcom &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;, appearing in all 14 episodes.

In January 2007, it was announced that Harris was cast as Annie Brackett in the remake of horror landmark &quot;Halloween&quot;. This marked Harris&#x27; first participation in the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise since &quot;The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; eighteen years prior. The remake, also called &quot;Halloween&quot; and directed by Rob Zombie, had Scout Taylor-Compton and Malcolm McDowell in main roles. Harris has revealed that Zombie wanted no one from previous &quot;Halloweens&quot; in the film, but, once she auditioned, he changed his mind. The film, which cost $15 million to make, opened at #1 at the box office and went on to gross $80,253,908 worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing &quot;Halloween&quot; in unadjusted U.S. dollars, which it remained for more than a decade. Unlike in the original version, Annie Brackett survives, after Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) tries his hand at torture instead of killing her quickly. Annie encounters her attacker with her chest exposed, having undressed for the most part, which marked Harris&#x27; first onscreen nudity. Harris admits that she refused the offers to cover her body while the cameras were not rolling, to better portray a vulnerable Annie against the monster. On facing Michael Myers once again and at the same time doing her first nude scene, she also commented:

Harris then began to appear in more horror productions and fantastic films. That same year, she starred in the also Halloween-themed &quot;Left for Dead&quot;. For Fearnet, she hosted &quot;Route 666: America&#x27;s Scariest Home Haunts&quot;. 2009 saw her in a leading role in &quot;Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet&quot;, as Felicia Freeze in the comedic superhero adventure film &quot;Super Capers&quot; and alongside Robert Patrick in &quot;The Black Waters of Echo&#x27;s Pond&quot;. &quot;Fear Clinic&quot;, a Fearnet original web series featuring Harris as well as veterans Robert Englund and Kane Hodder, made its debut the week of Halloween 2009. Also in 2009, Harris reprised her role of Annie Brackett in the sequel &quot;Halloween II&quot;. &quot;Halloween II&quot; was officially released on August 28, 2009, in North America, and was met with negative reception from most critics. On October 30, 2009, it was re-released in North America to coincide with the Halloween holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than that of the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. The film would go on to earn $33,392,973 in North America and $5,925,616 in foreign countries, giving &quot;Halloween II&quot; a worldwide total of $39,318,589.

=== 2010–present: Numerous horror films and directorial debut ===
Harris continued to develop her &quot;scream queen&quot; identity with growing genre credits. She starred alongside Lance Henriksen, Bill Moseley, AFI&#x27;s Davey Havok and Nicki Clyne in the illustrated film series &quot;Godkiller&quot;. Beginning with 2010&#x27;s &quot;Hatchet II&quot;, Harris has taken over the leading role of Marybeth in the &quot;Hatchet&quot; series, after Tamara Feldman declined to reprise her character. Further genre credits include Jim Mickle&#x27;s second feature film, the vampire/post-apocalyptic epic &quot;Stake Land&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Havenhurst&quot; and Michael Biehn&#x27;s &quot;The Victim&quot;, with lead roles in &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;See No Evil 2&quot;, &quot;Inoperable&quot;, &quot;Camp Cold Brook&quot; and others. She equally provided the voice and basis for an animated Barbara in &quot;Night of the Living Dead: Darkest Dawn&quot;, director Zebediah de Soto&#x27;s prequel/re-telling of George A. Romero&#x27;s 1968 original. Work in other types of films includes dramas like &quot;The Trouble with the Truth&quot; and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. Harris made her directorial debut with the horror comedy &quot;Among Friends&quot;, in which she also has an appearance. The film, which was picked up for distribution by Lionsgate, was released on August 27, 2013.

Since the 2010s, Harris has had guest appearances in the television shows &quot;Psych&quot; (as a murder suspect), &quot;Bones&quot; (as a murder victim), as herself in &quot;Holliston&quot; and &quot;Naked Vegas&quot;, and also returned to voice Debbie Thornberry for a saucy &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; parody of &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, among others.

On April 3, 2022, Harris appeared as a guest for the 2022 Dead Meat Horror Awards along with other horror film stars such as Tony Todd, Bonnie Aarons, Ray Chase and Heather Langenkamp. In 2021, she started a podcast with longtime friend and &quot;Halloween&quot; co-star Scout Taylor-Compton called &quot;Talk Scary to Me&quot;, which can be heard on any podcast platform, with new episodes airing each Tuesday.

== Public image ==

Harris has been referred to as &quot;horror&#x27;s reigning scream queen&quot; by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and various other outlets, and was called &quot;the Natalie Portman of Horror&quot; by director Sylvia Soska. She has provided the cover feature for such publications as &quot;Girls and Corpses&quot;, &quot;Gorezone magazine&quot;, &quot;Invasion magazine&quot; and &quot;Scream Sirens&quot; as well as a subject for the photo-book &quot;The Bloody Best Project&quot;, a collection of artistic pictures showcasing the celebrities of the horror film industry. Harris was also featured in Five Finger Death Punch&#x27;s first music video, &quot;The Bleeding&quot;, in 2007. In 2011, Harris won the Best Actress Award at the Shockfest Film Festival for her starring role in the short &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;. The 2012 Burbank International Film Festival gave Harris its Best Actress Award for her portrayal of literary heroine Wendy Alden in &quot;Shiver&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 2013, Harris became engaged to David Gross. The couple married in a private ceremony in Holualoa, Hawaii, on January 4, 2014, and had a son in 2017. Their second son was born in late 2018.

=== Stalking incident ===

Harris was stalked in 1995 by an obsessed fan, Christopher Small, who wrote letters threatening to kill her. Small was later arrested after taking a teddy bear and a shotgun to her home. On January 29, 2007, Harris appeared on an episode of the &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; show, sharing her experience with other equally affected people. The stalker was obsessed with her character of Molly Tilden from the television series &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In October 2009, Harris was granted a restraining order against Small, who began sending her messages on Twitter.

<text>The Superjesus are an Australian rock band formed in Adelaide in late 1994. Their debut album, &quot;Sumo&quot; (February 1998), peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart, their second album, &quot;Jet Age&quot; (October 2000) reached No. 5 and their third album, &quot;Rock Music&quot; (May 2003) peaked at No. 14. Their top 40 singles include &quot;Down Again&quot; (1997), &quot;Now and Then&quot; (1998), &quot;Gravity&quot; (2000) and &quot;Stick Together&quot; (2003). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 they won Best New Talent for &quot;Eight Step Rail&quot; and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot;. The group disbanded in mid-2004, and reunited in 2013. The band has undergone multiple line-up changes, with lead vocalist Sarah McLeod and bassist Stuart Rudd serving as mainstays. As of 2024, they are joined by lead guitarist Cam Blokland.

==History==
===Career beginnings: 1994–1996===
The Superjesus formed in late 1994 as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in Adelaide by Paul Berryman on drums, Sarah McLeod (ex-Fallen Down Monster) on lead vocals and guitar, Stuart Rudd on bass guitar and Chris Tennent on lead guitar. Rudd and Tennent had been jamming together for about a year when Rudd tried out for McLeod&#x27;s latest band. Tennent was McLeod&#x27;s guitar teacher at the time and a veteran of the Adelaide music scene, having played in various bands since the 1980s. Paul Berryman successfully auditioned for the group and they started rehearsing for over a year before their first gig.

Hell&#x27;s Kitchen changed their name to the Superjesus on the eve of the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. Tennent provided the new name. Berryman explained, &quot;It was basically just a piss-take on commonly used words in the &#x27;90s. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot;, the Jesus Lizard, Jesus Jones; there&#x27;s just heaps of Jesus&#x27; out there in the music world so we thought we would have that and super was kind of like a &#x27;90s catch word.&quot; Their debut five-track extended play, &quot;Eight Step Rail&quot;, was released in August 1996 on Aloha Records.

===Career peak: 1997–2004===
&quot;Eight Step Rail&quot; reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50 in February 1997. Its feature track, &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot;, received high rotation on national youth alternative music radio station, Triple J – it was listed at No. 81 on the station&#x27;s Hottest 100 for 1996. AllMusic&#x27;s Jonathan Lewis described how &quot;their wall of guitar noise (somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;-era Smashing Pumpkins) made them an overnight success on Australian radio ... McLeod&#x27;s voice was a major drawcard.&quot; Jasper Cooper of Oz Music Project felt that on the EP, &quot;Musically, the band inherited much from contemporaries such as the Smashing Pumpkins, but McLeod&#x27;s appeal at the band&#x27;s fore, lent The Superjesus their own niche and stature. The single track &#x27;Shut My Eyes&#x27; was the band&#x27;s tour de force, something that was still unmatched in their latter albums.&quot;

They followed with a tour of Australia&#x27;s east coast, then supported shows by Clouds, Hoodoo Gurus and United Kingdom band, Bush. As songwriters, Tennent typically composed the music and McLeod supplied the lyrics – the pair had also developed a personal relationship. In January 1997 the Superjesus appeared at the Big Day Out and, in April, they travelled to Triclops Sound Studios, Atlanta to record their debut album, &quot;Sumo&quot;, with Matt Serletic (Collective Soul) producing and Jeff Tomei (Smashing Pumpkins, Hole) as audio engineer. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 they won Best New Talent for &quot;Eight Step Rail&quot; and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot;. McLeod and Tennent&#x27;s personal relationship had ended and late that year; he temporarily left the group. Aaron Tokona (of Weta) filled in on guitar when the Superjesus toured New Zealand. Tokona turned down the offer to become a permanent member and remained with Weta.

With Tennent back on board they released &quot;Sumo&quot; in February 1998 through EastWest/Warner Music Australasia, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum by ARIA for shipment of 70,000 copies. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as &quot;a big sounding album backed by a generous budget.&quot; Its local success led to a United States version – with an altered track listing – being issued in June. Lewis felt that they &quot;show that guitar rock with McLeod&#x27;s vocals soaring over the top is definitely their strength. Unfortunately, it is also their weakness, with &quot;Sumo&quot; containing too little variation in style.&quot; An extended version titled &quot;Sumo II&quot;, including a bonus seven-track enhanced CD of live performances, was released in October. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 &quot;Sumo&quot; had them nominated for Best Group, Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Cover Art (artwork by Chris and William Tennent).

In January 1999, they appeared at the Big Day Out, again, and then took a few months off. Chris Tennent left the Superjesus permanently in mid-1999 when they were due to resume. The group relocated to Melbourne in November where they recruited Tim Henwood (ex-Jen Anderson Band, Supermann, Plasticine, Barker) on guitar. Henwood and McLeod became the principal songwriters. The band released their second album, &quot;Jet Age&quot;, in October 2000, which was produced by Ed Buller (Psychedelic Furs, Suede, Ben Lee) and peaked at No. 5. Louise Buckingham of femail.com.au noticed that the group&#x27;s &quot;rock engine is winding up and are fuelled to commence take-off down the runway of Australian rock music. With the recent release of blazing new album &quot;Jet Age&quot; and with the hit-single &quot;Gravity&quot; now a friend to the radio waves, The Superjesus have proved they are keen to move into a new musical era.&quot; Amazon.com&#x27;s editorial reviewer declared that it was an &quot;intelligent, mature, sophisticated&quot; release. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, &quot;Jet Age&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Album and Best Cover Art (Darren Glindemann).

Henwood left in mid-2001 and eventually formed The Androids (he later joined Rogue Traders). McLeod considered disbanding the Superjesus but took up lead guitar while working for their third album as a trio, &quot;Rock Music&quot; (May 2003), with Marc Waterman producing, which reached No. 14. Patch Brown had replaced Henwood, but due to stylistic differences during recording, he was replaced in turn by Jason Slack, a Slippery Rock Graduate. Tim Cashmere of &quot;Undercover&quot; felt that &quot;they are just as powerful as before&quot; with McLeod &quot;singing better than ever over her chunkier-than-ever riffs.&quot; MediaSearch&#x27;s Carmine Pascuzzi cautioned that &quot;Those who have been ready to write them off should rethink as Sarah McLeod sings beautifully and the band work in harness efficiently to produce a strong effort. The riffs and tenacity are very much on show... They still have a knack for really rocking out, yet indulging in some slower ballads.&quot;

In June 2004, the Superjesus split with Warner Music Australasia as the members took time off to pursue other projects. McLeod worked on a solo album, &quot;Beauty Was a Tiger&quot;. She then fronted the Sydney-based three-piece band, Screaming Bikini.

===Reformation: 2012–present===
On 27 November 2012 McLeod announced on radio station Triple M The Superjesus would reunite for a one-off show on 1 February 2013. Later, McLeod told the Northern Star &quot;We only got back together in 2013 because our drummer [Paul Berryman] came back to Australia from Seattle, so we [bass player Stuart Rudd and lead singer McLeod] thought we could play one single show, see how the crowd responded and, more importantly, how we responded to each other and see if we had some musical chemistry together. The one show was better than we had hoped, crowd-wise and for ourselves.&quot; The band, with the line-up of Berryman, Henwood, McLeod and Rudd, played at the Stone Music Festival with Van Halen and Aerosmith in Sydney in April, before embarking on their first national tour in 10 years – The Resurrection Tour – in May and June.

In early 2015 the Superjesus undertook the She Who Rocks Tour sharing the stage with the Baby Animals, fronted by Suze DeMarchi. In June that year the Superjesus released their first single in over a decade, &quot;The Setting Sun&quot;. In November they followed with &quot;St. Peters Lane&quot;, and embarked on The Setting Sun Tour. In December, Henwood departed to return to The Androids and was replaced with former member, Jason Slack and in April 2016, drummer Paul Berryman departed due to family commitments and residing in the United States. Meanwhile, McLeod traveled to New York City for three months to write new material for a planned fourth album.

In August 2016, the band released an EP, entitled &quot;Love and Violence&quot;, released through Golden Robot Records. The Superjesus supported the EP with a national tour commencing in October.

In March 2017, The Superjesus were inducted into the South Australian Music Hall of Fame. In 2018, The Superjesus celebrated 20 years of &quot;Sumo&quot; by re-releasing the album in August with bonus tracks and a national tour.

In January 2019, The Superjesus appeared at the &#x27;Under the Southern Stars&#x27; concert tour of five states starting off at Hastings, Victoria, with performances in Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia scheduled throughout January. Appearing with The Superjesus at the Hastings concert were Hoodoo Gurus, Eskimo Joe, You Am I, British India, The Getaway Plan and Scott Darlow. In November, The Superjesus travelled overseas and performed in the South American country of Brazil. The band was also featured and interviewed on a documentary, celebrating the ABC TV Australian music show &quot;Recovery&quot;, hosted by Dylan Lewis.

===The Superjesus: 2022-present===
In September 2022, the band announced a headlining tour for January 2023 in support of a forthcoming new single, &#x27;Money&#x27;. The following month, the band confirmed that they would release their fourth studio album in 2023, which is being recorded at Studio 85 in the Blue Mountains and produced by drummer, Murray Sheridan. In December 2022, the band formally inducted lead guitarist Cam Blokland and drummer Murray Sheridan into the line-up.

The Superjesus toured Australia from August through to December 2023, promoting their new single &quot;Lights Out&quot;.

On 21 March 2025, the band will release their 4th studio album titled &quot;The Superjesus&quot;.

<text>Loganair is a Scottish regional airline headquartered at Glasgow Airport in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. The airline primarily operates domestic flights within the United Kingdom. It is the largest regional airline in Scotland by passenger numbers and fleet size.

In addition to its main base at Glasgow, it has hubs at Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Newcastle upon Tyne airports. It holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

== History ==
===Early years===

Loganair was established on 1 February 1962 by Willie Logan of the Logan Construction Company Ltd, operating as its air charter arm with a Piper PA-23 Aztec based at Edinburgh.

In 1967, Loganair took delivery of three Britten-Norman Islander twin-engine eight-seat light commuter airliners and began regular flights between the Orkney Islands, and started operating in Shetland in 1970. In 1966, after Renfrew Airport closed, the airline established its head office at Glasgow Airport. This aspect of Loganair&#x27;s operations ceased on 31 March 2006 when the new contract for air ambulance work was awarded to Gama Aviation.

Between 1968 and 1983, the company was owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, Towards the end of this period, Loganair bought Short 360 and Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft. The company brought jet aircraft into the fleet with two British Aerospace 146s. In December 1983 it became a subsidiary of the Airlines of Britain Group. Further aircraft were added to the fleet: British Aerospace Jetstream 31, British Aerospace Jetstream 41, and British Aerospace ATP aircraft. In the late 1980s Loganair was the fastest-growing scheduled operator at Manchester Airport, and, in terms of number of flights, was the airport&#x27;s second-busiest carrier.

After a restructure of British Midland Group in early 1994, Loganair&#x27;s routes outside Scotland and the aircraft used to operate them were transferred to Manx Airlines. In mid 1994, the airline became a franchisee of British Airways, operating the remaining Shorts 360 and BN-2 Islanders in the British Airways livery. This would stand until July 2008, when it became the new franchisee of Flybe. 

In 1996 Airlines of Britain announced it would split its regional airlines into a separate grouping which would enable it to increase its franchise links with British Airways while British Midland looked to increase ties with Lufthansa. The new airline was renamed the British Regional Airlines Group (BRAL), with the British Airways franchise operations of Manx Airlines and Loganair operating under the British Regional Airlines banner.

In 1997 a management buy-out occurred with Loganair becoming independent of BRAL and operating just six aircraft (one de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and five Britten Norman Islanders) with 44 staff.

===Operations as Flybe franchise===
In June 2005, Loganair was awarded a contract from the Irish Government to operate a daily return service from Knock to Dublin. This public service obligation (PSO) route operated for a period of three years as British Airways, with effect from 22 July 2005. The operation ceased in July 2008, the contract having been lost to Aer Arann. The airline also bought routes from Citiexpress in March 2004.

Until October 2008, Loganair was a British Airways franchisee, operating flights sold through BA using BA flight codes. Loganair&#x27;s inter-island operations between the Orkney and Shetland Islands carried out using Britten-Norman Islanders were removed from the franchise agreement in 2004. The flights have since been marketed under Loganair&#x27;s own name, rather than British Airways&#x27;. Loganair became a franchise airline of Flybe, operating in the Flybe colours. Flights are also operated under a codeshare agreement with British Airways connecting flights from Scotland to London. The franchise has been criticised by residents in the Scottish islands for what they perceive to be excessively high fares, and a Facebook campaign set up in June 2015 to highlight the issue attracted over 7400 &quot;likes&quot; over the course of its first weekend.

===Purchase of ScotAirways===
On 8 July 2011, it was announced that Loganair had agreed to purchase Cambridge based ScotAirways. ScotAirways continued to trade as a separate entity (using its original name of Suckling Airways) and holding its own licences and approvals until April 2013.

Services to Belfast and to Birmingham from Dundee ended on 2 December 2012. After CityJet had terminated its services between Dundee and London City Airport in January 2014, Loganair took over the route, operating from Dundee to London Stansted Airport, with the support of a PSO agreement.

In May 2015, two Viking Air DHC-6-400 Twin Otter aircraft were acquired by Highlands and Islands Airports to be operated by Loganair on the Scottish Government&#x27;s Public Service Obligation routes between Glasgow and Campbeltown, Tiree and Barra. In August 2015 the airline became part of a new regional airline group, Airline Investments Limited (AIL), along with East Midlands-based airline bmi regional.

On 21 November 2016, Flybe and Loganair announced that their franchise agreement would terminate on 31 August 2017. Despite headlines, it is unclear who initiated the termination. Loganair later relaunched its website without renewed interline agreements with Flybe or Aer Lingus.

In April 2017, pending the termination of the Flybe franchise agreement, Loganair unveiled its new independent corporate livery on Saab 340B Freighter G-LGNN. From 1 September the airline began operating &quot;in its own right&quot; for the first time in 24 years. Loganair signed a codeshare agreement with British Airways (BA), effective from 1 September 2017 (coinciding with the launch of independent operations), allowing passengers to book through flights onto BA&#x27;s global network.

===Reactions to the demise of other airlines===
In February 2019, following Flybmi&#x27;s cessation of operations, Loganair announced that it was to take over Flybmi&#x27;s routes from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg, from Newcastle to Stavanger and Brussels, and from City of Derry Airport to London-Stansted. A BALPA tribunal into Loganair&#x27;s swift action following the closure of Flybmi found that the carrier had been acting lawfully, despite the fact that it had created several contingency plans for the demise of UK airlines Eastern Airways and Flybe.

In March 2020, following Flybe&#x27;s cessation of operations, Loganair announced that it was to take over several Flybe routes from Scotland and Newcastle.

===Potential sale===
In October 2022, Loganair confirmed that the existing sole owners, brothers Stephen and Peter Bond, were seeking a buyer to act as the company&#x27;s &quot;custodian for the next generation&quot;. The sale process was suspended in October 2023, with the Bond brothers retaining their stake while a fleet renewal programme is completed.

==Destinations==

, Loganair serves 44 destinations in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, the Republic of Ireland and continental Europe. Part of Loganair&#x27;s operations includes the world&#x27;s shortest scheduled commercial route, between Westray Airport and Papa Westray Airport, a distance of 1.7 miles, and the use of Barra Airport, the only airport in the world to use a beach as a runway.
After the collapse of the original Flybe in March 2020, Loganair took over a number of former Flybe routes from Scotland, the North of England and other parts of the UK, with service beginning as little as 10 days later.

In March 2023, Loganair secured a lease from British Airways for 30 additional slot pairs at Heathrow, previously leased to the relaunched Flybe before its demise in January 2023, and called on the UK government to reform competition remedies in order to ensure that Heathrow slots remain permanently available for UK regional connectivity.

=== Codeshare agreements ===
Loganair has codeshare agreements with the following airlines (as of April 2022):

* Aurigny
* Blue Islands
* British Airways

===Fleet development===
In June 2018, Loganair announced plans to add two additional Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft for summer 2019. The aircraft were to be transferred from sister company Flybmi, and would initially operate flights from Loganair&#x27;s Glasgow base to Derry and Stornoway. Loganair also planned to use the Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft to launch new routes to European airports not previously served from Glasgow. In November 2018, the company announced that approximately twenty ATR 42 aircraft would be added to replace the Saab 2000 and Saab 340 aircraft in the third quarter of 2019.

In April 2019, its Dornier 328 fleet was withdrawn and stored. Loganair returned the last of its Saab 2000 aircraft to the lessor on 25 March 2020.

Its Saab 340s were retired in January 2024, to be replaced by eight new ATRs which will complement the existing ATR fleet. In January 2024, Loganair announced plans to introduce a hydrogen fuel cell-powered Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander on its Orkney island-hopping routes by 2027. The aircraft could be either a new build or a conversion of one of the airline&#x27;s existing Islanders.

In September 2024, Loganair announced that it was exploring use-cases for hybrid-electric aircraft as part of an exclusive partnership with manufacturer Heart Aerospace.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 12 June 1986, a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft with 16 people on board struck high ground on the island of Islay in poor weather. The pilots had mistakenly identified the coastal village of Laphroaig as the town of Port Ellen, near Islay Airport. There was one fatality, a pilot.
* In 1996, a Britten-Norman Islander was destroyed in Shetland. The accident occurred during a night time return flight to the aircraft&#x27;s home base following a medical evacuation flight. The aircraft crashed short of the runway whilst attempting to land after a previous discontinued approach in strong gusting cross winds. The pilot had exercised his discretion to extend the period for which he was allowed to fly that day. The pilot&#x27;s medical certificate had expired nineteen days earlier thus invalidating his pilot&#x27;s licence. The pilot was killed in the crash and a doctor on board was seriously injured; a nurse seated at the rear of the aircraft sustained minor injuries.
* On 27 February 2001, Flight 670, a Short 360 registered G-BNMT operating a Royal Mail flight to Belfast, crashed into the Firth of Forth shortly after taking off from Edinburgh at 1730GMT. Both crew members were killed. There were no passengers on board. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) inquiry later blamed a buildup of slush in the aircraft&#x27;s engines for the crash. Protective covers had not been fitted to the engine intakes while the aircraft was parked for several hours in heavy snow at Edinburgh.
* On 15 March 2005, a Britten-Norman Islander crashed into the sea while descending toward Campbeltown Airport in western Scotland. The aircraft was operating on an unscheduled air ambulance flight. Both occupants, the pilot and one passenger (a paramedic with the Scottish Ambulance Service), died in the crash. As a result of this accident, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) accepted Safety Recommendation UNKG-2006-101 from the UK&#x27;s accident investigation report, which the European Commission adopted into regulation, making passenger shoulder harnesses mandatory on all commercial air transport aircraft weighing less than and having fewer than nine passenger seats.
*On 15 December 2014, Flight 6780, a Saab 2000 registered G-LGNO, was struck by lightning whilst approaching Sumburgh Airport. The flight subsequently suffered from control difficulties and nosedived from after the crew tried taking over the controls, but failed to achieve control. The pilot was under the belief that a lightning strike would automatically disengage the autopilot, and the control difficulties were due to opposition from the autopilot system trying to bring them back to the preprogrammed altitude, and it was determined that they only regained control due to a computer malfunction disabling the autopilot system. Once control was regained, they were able to safely return to Aberdeen. There were 33 occupants onboard and no injuries were reported. The subsequent investigation into the incident also revealed that the Saab 2000 was the only Saab model at the time that did not automatically disengage the autopilot with pilot manual control input.
*On 16 June 2020, a Loganair Embraer ERJ-145EP registered as G-SAJS sustained minor damage at its stand on the apron at Aberdeen Airport after it was struck in a low-speed collision by a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 registered as G-JECK. The Dash 8, wearing the livery of the defunct airline Flybe, became wedged underneath the ERJ&#x27;s right hand engine. No passengers were aboard either aircraft the time of the collision, and no injuries were reported.

<doc id="492039" wikidata="Q130910" url="?curid=492039" title="Archosaur">
<text>Archosauria () or archosaurs () is a clade of diapsid sauropsid tetrapods, with birds and crocodilians being the only extant representatives. Although broadly classified as reptiles, which traditionally exclude birds, the cladistic sense of the term includes all living and extinct relatives of birds and crocodilians such as non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, phytosaurs, aetosaurs and rauisuchians as well as many Mesozoic marine reptiles. Modern paleontologists define Archosauria as a crown group that includes the most recent common ancestor of living birds and crocodilians, and all of its descendants.

The base of Archosauria splits into two clades: Pseudosuchia, which includes crocodilians and their extinct relatives; and Avemetatarsalia, which includes birds and their extinct relatives (such as non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs). Older definitions of the group Archosauria rely on shared morphological characteristics, such as an antorbital fenestra in the skull, serrated teeth, and an upright stance. Some extinct reptiles, such as proterosuchids and euparkeriids, also possessed these features yet originated prior to the split between the crocodilian and bird lineages. The older morphological definition of Archosauria nowadays roughly corresponds to Archosauriformes, a group named to encompass crown-group archosaurs and their close relatives.

The oldest true archosaur fossils are known from the Early Triassic period, though the first archosauriforms and archosauromorphs (reptilians closer to archosaurs than to lizards or other lepidosaurs) appeared in the Permian. Archosaurs quickly diversified in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (~252 Ma), which wiped out most of the then-dominant therapsid competitors such as the gorgonopsians and anomodonts, and the subsequent arid Triassic climate allowed the more drought-resilient archosaurs (largely due to their uric acid-based urinary system) to eventually become the largest and most ecologically dominant terrestrial vertebrates from the Middle Triassic period up until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (~66 Ma). Birds and several crocodyliform lineages were the only archosaurs to survive the K-Pg extinction, rediversifying in the subsequent Cenozoic era. Birds in particular have become among the most species-rich groups of terrestrial vertebrates in the present day.

==Distinguishing characteristics==
Archosaurs can traditionally be distinguished from other tetrapods on the basis of several synapomorphies, or shared characteristics, which were present in their last common ancestor. Many of these characteristics appeared prior to the origin of the clade Archosauria, as they were present in archosauriforms such as &quot;Proterosuchus&quot; and &quot;Euparkeria&quot;, which were outside the crown group.

The most obvious features include teeth set in deep sockets, antorbital and mandibular fenestrae (openings in front of the eyes and in the jaw, respectively), and a pronounced fourth trochanter (a prominent ridge on the femur). Being set in sockets, the teeth were less likely to be torn loose during feeding. This feature is responsible for the name &quot;thecodont&quot; (meaning &quot;socket teeth&quot;), which early paleontologists applied to many Triassic archosaurs. Additionally, non-muscular cheek and lip tissue appear in various forms throughout the clade, with all living archosaurs lacking non-muscular lips, unlike most non-avian saurischian dinosaurs. Some archosaurs, such as birds, are secondarily toothless. Antorbital fenestrae reduced the weight of the skull, which was relatively large in early archosaurs, rather like that of modern crocodilians. Mandibular fenestrae may also have reduced the weight of the jaw in some forms. The fourth trochanter provides a large site for the attachment of muscles on the femur. Stronger muscles allowed for erect gaits in early archosaurs, and may also be connected with the ability of the archosaurs or their immediate ancestors to survive the catastrophic Permian-Triassic extinction event.

Unlike their close living relatives, the lepidosaurs, archosaurs lost the vomeronasal organ.

==Origins==
Archosaurs are a subgroup of archosauriforms, which themselves are a subgroup of archosauromorphs. Both the oldest archosauromorph (&quot;Protorosaurus speneri&quot;) and the oldest archosauriform (&quot;Archosaurus rossicus&quot;) lived in the late Permian. The oldest true archosaurs appeared during the Olenekian stage (247–251 Ma) of the Early Triassic. A few fragmentary fossils of large carnivorous crocodilian-line archosaurs (informally termed &quot;rauisuchians&quot;) are known from this stage. These include &quot;Scythosuchus&quot; and &quot;Tsylmosuchus&quot; (both of which have been found in Russia), as well as the &quot;Xilousuchus&quot;, a ctenosauriscid from China. The oldest known fossils of bird-line archosaurs are from the Anisian stage (247–242 Ma) of Tanzania, and include &quot;Asilisaurus&quot; (an early silesaurid), &quot;Teleocrater&quot; (an aphanosaur), and &quot;Nyasasaurus&quot; (a possible early dinosaur).

== Archosaurian domination in the Triassic ==
Synapsids are a clade that includes mammals and their extinct ancestors. The latter group are often referred to as &quot;mammal-like reptiles,&quot; but should be termed &quot;protomammals, stem mammals, or basal synapsids,&quot; because they are not true reptiles by modern cladistic classification. They were the dominant land vertebrates throughout the Permian, but most perished in the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Very few large synapsids survived the event, but one form, &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; (a herbivorous dicynodont), attained a widespread distribution soon after the extinction. Following this, archosaurs and other archosauriforms quickly became the dominant land vertebrates in the early Triassic. Fossils from before the mass extinction have only been found around the Equator, but after the event fossils can be found all over the world. Suggested explanations for this include:
* Archosaurs made more rapid progress towards erect limbs than synapsids, and this gave them greater stamina by avoiding Carrier&#x27;s constraint. An objection to this explanation is that archosaurs became dominant while they still had sprawling or semi-erect limbs, similar to those of &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; and other synapsids.
* Archosaurs have more efficient respiratory systems featuring unidirectional air flow, as opposed to the tidal respiration of synapids. The ability to breathe more efficiently in hypoxic conditions may have been advantageous to early archosaurs during the suspected drop in oxygen levels at the end of the Permian.
* The Early Triassic was predominantly arid, because most of the Earth&#x27;s land was concentrated in the supercontinent Pangaea. Archosaurs were probably better at conserving water than early synapsids because:
** Modern diapsids (lizards, snakes, crocodilians, birds) excrete uric acid, which can be excreted as a paste, resulting in low water loss as opposed to a more dilute urine. It is reasonable to suppose that archosaurs (the ancestors of crocodilians, dinosaurs and pterosaurs) also excreted uric acid, and therefore were good at conserving water. The aglandular (glandless) skins of diapsids would also have helped to conserve water.
** Modern mammals excrete urea, which requires a relatively high urinary rate to keep it from leaving the urine by diffusion in the kidney tubules. Their skins also contain many glands, which also lose water. Assuming that early synapsids had similar features, e.g., as argued by the authors of &quot;Palaeos&quot;, they were at a disadvantage in a mainly arid world. The same well-respected site points out that &quot;for much of Australia&#x27;s Plio-Pleistocene history, where conditions were probably similar, the largest terrestrial predators were not mammals but gigantic varanid lizards (&quot;Megalania&quot;) and land crocs.&quot;

However, this theory has been questioned, since it implies synapsids were necessarily less advantaged in water retention, that synapsid decline coincides with climate changes or archosaur diversity (neither of which tested) and the fact that desert dwelling mammals are as well adapted in this department as archosaurs, and some cynodonts like &quot;Trucidocynodon&quot; were large sized predators.
A study favors competition amidst mammaliaforms as the main explanation for Mesozoic mammals being small.

==Main forms==

Since the 1970s, scientists have classified archosaurs mainly on the basis of their ankles. The earliest archosaurs had &quot;primitive mesotarsal&quot; ankles: the astragalus and calcaneum were fixed to the tibia and fibula by sutures and the joint bent about the contact between these bones and the foot.

The Pseudosuchia appeared early in the Triassic. In their ankles, the astragalus was joined to the tibia by a suture and the joint rotated round a peg on the astragalus which fitted into a socket in the calcaneum. Early &quot;crurotarsans&quot; still walked with sprawling limbs, but some later crurotarsans developed fully erect limbs. Modern crocodilians are crurotarsans that can employ a diverse range of gaits depending on speed.

&quot;Euparkeria&quot; and the Ornithosuchidae had &quot;reversed crurotarsal&quot; ankles, with a peg on the calcaneum and socket on the astragalus.

The earliest fossils of Avemetatarsalia (&quot;bird ankles&quot;) appear in the Anisian age of the Middle Triassic. Most Ornithodirans had &quot;advanced mesotarsal&quot; ankles. This form of ankle incorporated a very large astragalus and very small calcaneum, and could only move in one plane, like a simple hinge. This arrangement, which was only suitable for animals with erect limbs, provided more stability when the animals were running. The earliest avemetatarsalians, such as Teleocrater and Asilisaurus, retained &quot;primitive mesotarsal&quot; ankles. The ornithodirans differed from other archosaurs in other ways: they were lightly built and usually small, their necks were long and had an S-shaped curve, their skulls were much more lightly built, and many ornithodirans were completely bipedal. The archosaurian fourth trochanter on the femur may have made it easier for ornithodirans to become bipeds, because it provided more leverage for the thigh muscles. In the late Triassic, the ornithodirans diversified to produce dinosaurs and pterosaurs.

==Classification==

===Modern classification===
Archosauria is normally defined as a crown group, which means that it only includes descendants of the last common ancestors of its living representatives. In the case of archosaurs, these are birds and crocodilians. Archosauria is within the larger clade Archosauriformes, which includes some close relatives of archosaurs, such as proterochampsids and euparkeriids. These relatives are often referred to as archosaurs despite being placed outside of the crown group Archosauria in a more basal position within Archosauriformes. Historically, many archosauriforms were described as archosaurs, including proterosuchids and erythrosuchids, based on the presence of an antorbital fenestra. While many researchers prefer to treat Archosauria as an unranked clade, some continue to assign it a traditional biological rank. Traditionally, Archosauria has been treated as a Superorder, though a few 21st century researchers have assigned it to different ranks including Division and Class.

===History of classification===
Archosauria as a term was first coined by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1869, and included a wide range of taxa including dinosaurs, crocodilians, thecodonts, sauropterygians (which may be related to turtles), rhynchocephalians (a group that according to Cope included rhynchosaurs, which nowadays are considered to be more basal archosauromorphs, and tuataras, which are lepidosaurs), and anomodonts, which are now considered synapsids. It was not until 1986 that Archosauria was defined as a crown-clade, restricting its use to more derived taxa.

Cope&#x27;s term was a Greek-Latin hybrid intended to refer to the cranial arches, but has later also been understood as &quot;leading reptiles&quot; or &quot;ruling reptiles&quot; by association with Greek ἀρχός &quot;leader, ruler&quot;.

The term &quot;thecodont&quot;, now considered an obsolete term, was first used by the English paleontologist Richard Owen in 1859 to describe Triassic archosaurs, and it became widely used in the 20th century. Thecodonts were considered the &quot;basal stock&quot; from which the more advanced archosaurs descended. They did not possess features seen in later avian and crocodilian lines, and therefore were considered more primitive and ancestral to the two groups. With the cladistic revolution of the 1980s and 90s, in which cladistics became the most widely used method of classifying organisms, thecodonts were no longer considered a valid grouping. Because they are considered a &quot;basal stock&quot;, thecodonts are paraphyletic, meaning that they form a group that does not include all descendants of its last common ancestor: in this case, the more derived crocodilians and birds are excluded from &quot;Thecodontia&quot; as it was formerly understood. The description of the basal ornithodires &quot;Lagerpeton&quot; and &quot;Lagosuchus&quot; in the 1970s provided evidence that linked thecodonts with dinosaurs, and contributed to the disuse of the term &quot;Thecodontia&quot;, which many cladists consider an artificial grouping.

With the identification of &quot;crocodilian normal&quot; and &quot;crocodilian reversed&quot; ankles by Sankar Chatterjee in 1978, a basal split in Archosauria was identified. Chatterjee considered these two groups to be Pseudosuchia with the &quot;normal&quot; ankle and Ornithosuchidae with the &quot;reversed&quot; ankle. Ornithosuchids were thought to be ancestral to dinosaurs at this time. In 1979, A.R.I. Cruickshank identified the basal split and thought that the crurotarsan ankle developed independently in these two groups, but in opposite ways. Cruickshank also thought that the development of these ankle types progressed in each group to allow advanced members to have semi-erect (in the case of crocodilians) or erect (in the case of dinosaurs) gaits.

===Phylogeny===
In many phylogenetic analyses, archosaurs have been shown to be a monophyletic grouping, thus forming a true clade. One of the first studies of archosaur phylogeny was authored by French paleontologist Jacques Gauthier in 1986. Gauthier split Archosauria into Pseudosuchia, the crocodilian line, and Ornithosuchia, the dinosaur and pterosaur line. Pseudosuchia was defined as all archosaurs more closely related to crocodiles, while Ornithosuchia was defined as all archosaurs more closely related to birds. Proterochampsids, erythrosuchids, and proterosuchids fell successively outside Archosauria in the resulting tree. Below is the cladogram from Gauthier (1986):
In 1988, paleontologists Michael Benton and J. M. Clark produced a new tree in a phylogenetic study of basal archosaurs. As in Gauthier&#x27;s tree, Benton and Clark&#x27;s revealed a basal split within Archosauria. They referred to the two groups as Crocodylotarsi and Ornithosuchia. Crocodylotarsi was defined as an apomorphy-based taxon based on the presence of a &quot;crocodile-normal&quot; ankle joint (considered to be the defining apomorphy of the clade). Gauthier&#x27;s Pseudosuchia, by contrast, was a stem-based taxon. Unlike Gauthier&#x27;s tree, Benton and Clark&#x27;s places &quot;Euparkeria&quot; outside Ornithosuchia and outside the crown group Archosauria altogether.

The clades Crurotarsi and Ornithodira were first used together in 1990 by paleontologist Paul Sereno and A. B. Arcucci in their phylogenetic study of archosaurs. They were the first to erect the clade Crurotarsi, while Ornithodira was named by Gauthier in 1986. Crurotarsi and Ornithodira replaced Pseudosuchia and Ornithosuchia, respectively, as the monophyly of both of these clades were questioned. Sereno and Arcucci incorporated archosaur features other than ankle types in their analyses, which resulted in a different tree than previous analyses. Below is a cladogram based on Sereno (1991), which is similar to the one produced by Sereno and Arcucci:
Ornithodira and Crurotarsi are both node-based clades, meaning that they are defined to include the last common ancestor of two or more taxa and all of its descendants. Ornithodira includes the last common ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs (which include birds), while Crurotarsi includes the last common ancestor of living crocodilians and three groups of Triassic archosaurs: ornithosuchids, aetosaurs, and phytosaurs. These clades are not equivalent to &quot;bird-line&quot; and &quot;crocodile-line&quot; archosaurs, which would be branch-based clades defined as all taxa more closely related to one living group (either birds or crocodiles) than the other.

Benton proposed the name Avemetatarsalia in 1999 to include all bird-line archosaurs (under his definition, all archosaurs more closely related to dinosaurs than to crocodilians). His analysis of the small Triassic archosaur &quot;Scleromochlus&quot; placed it within bird-line archosaurs but outside Ornithodira, meaning that Ornithodira was no longer equivalent to bird-line archosaurs. Below is a cladogram modified from Benton (2004) showing this phylogeny:
In Sterling Nesbitt&#x27;s 2011 monograph on early archosaurs, a phylogenetic analysis found strong support for phytosaurs falling outside Archosauria. Many subsequent studies supported this phylogeny. Because Crurotarsi is defined by the inclusion of phytosaurs, the placement of phytosaurs outside Archosauria means that Crurotarsi must include all of Archosauria. Nesbitt reinstated Pseudosuchia as a clade name for crocodile-line archosaurs, using it as a stem-based taxon. Below is a cladogram modified from Nesbitt (2011):

==Extinction and survival==
Crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs and dinosaurs survived the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event about 200 million years ago, but other archosaurs had become extinct at or prior to the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.

Non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs perished in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately million years ago, but crown-group birds (the only remaining dinosaur group) and many crocodyliforms survived. Both are descendants of archosaurs, and are therefore archosaurs themselves under phylogenetic taxonomy.

Crocodilians (which include all modern crocodiles, alligators, and gharials) and birds flourish today in the Holocene. It is generally agreed that birds have the most species of all terrestrial vertebrates.

==Archosaur lifestyle==

===Hip joints and locomotion===

Like the early tetrapods, early archosaurs had a sprawling gait because their hip sockets faced sideways, and the knobs at the tops of their femurs were in line with the femur.
In the early to middle Triassic, some archosaur groups developed hip joints that allowed (or required) a more erect gait. This gave them greater stamina, because it avoided Carrier&#x27;s constraint, i.e. they could run and breathe easily at the same time. There were two main types of joint which allowed erect legs:
*The hip sockets faced sideways, but the knobs on the femurs were at right angles to the rest of the femur, which therefore pointed downwards. Dinosaurs evolved from archosaurs with this hip arrangement.
*The hip sockets faced downwards and the knobs on the femurs were in line with the femur. This &quot;pillar-erect&quot; arrangement appears to have evolved independently in various archosaur lineages, for example it was common in &quot;Rauisuchia&quot; (non-crocodylomorph paracrocodylomorphs) and also appeared in some aetosaurs.
It has been pointed out that an upright stance requires more energy, so it may indicate a higher metabolism and a higher body temperature.

===Diet===
Most were large predators, but members of various lines diversified into other niches. Aetosaurs were herbivores and some developed extensive armor. A few crocodyliforms were herbivores, e.g., &quot;Simosuchus&quot;, &quot;Phyllodontosuchus&quot;. The large crocodyliform &quot;Stomatosuchus&quot; may have been a filter feeder. Sauropodomorphs and ornithischian dinosaurs were herbivores with diverse adaptations for feeding biomechanics.

===Land, water and air===
Archosaurs are mainly portrayed as land animals, but:
*Many phytosaurs and crocodyliforms dominated the rivers and swamps and even invaded the seas (e.g., the teleosaurs, Metriorhynchidae and Dyrosauridae). The Metriorhynchidae were rather dolphin-like, with paddle-like forelimbs, a tail fluke and smooth, unarmoured skins.
*Two clades of ornithodirans, the pterosaurs and the birds, dominated the air after becoming adapted to a volant lifestyle.
*Some dinosaurs like &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; have been argued to have had a semiaquatic lifestyle. Hesperornithes and penguins also adapted to this lifestyle.

===Metabolism===
The metabolism of archosaurs is still a controversial topic. They certainly evolved from cold-blooded ancestors, and the surviving non-dinosaurian archosaurs, crocodilians, are cold-blooded. But crocodilians have some features which are normally associated with a warm-blooded metabolism because they improve the animal&#x27;s oxygen supply:
*4-chambered hearts. Both birds and mammals have 4-chambered hearts, which completely separate the flows of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood. Non-crocodilian reptiles have 3-chambered hearts, which are less efficient because they let the two flows mix and thus send some de-oxygenated blood out to the body instead of to the lungs. Modern crocodilians&#x27; hearts are 4-chambered, but are smaller relative to body size and run at lower pressure than those of modern birds and mammals. They also have a pulmonary bypass, which makes them functionally 3-chambered when under water, conserving oxygen.
*a secondary palate, which allows the animal to eat and breathe at the same time.
*a hepatic piston mechanism for pumping the lungs. This is different from the lung-pumping mechanisms of mammals and birds, but similar to what some researchers claim to have found in some dinosaurs.

Historically there has been uncertainty as to why natural selection favored the development of these features, which are very important for active warm-blooded creatures, but of little apparent use to cold-blooded aquatic ambush predators that spend the vast majority of their time floating in water or lying on river banks.
Paleontological evidence shows that the ancestors of living crocodilians were active and endothermic (warm-blooded). Some experts believe that their archosaur ancestors were warm-blooded as well. This is likely because feather-like filaments evolved to cover the whole body and were capable of providing thermal insulation. Physiological, anatomical, and developmental features of the crocodilian heart support the paleontological evidence and show that the lineage reverted to ectothermy when it invaded the aquatic, ambush predator niche. Crocodilian embryos develop fully 4-chambered hearts at an early stage. Modifications to the growing heart form a pulmonary bypass shunt that includes the left aortic arch, which originates from the right ventricle, the foramen of Panizza between the left and right aortic arches, and the cog-tooth valve at the base of the pulmonary artery. The shunt is used during diving to make the heart function as 3-chambered heart, providing the crocodilian with the neurally controlled shunting used by ectotherms. The researchers concluded that the ancestors of living crocodilians had fully 4-chambered hearts, and were therefore warm-blooded, before they reverted to a cold-blooded or ectothermic metabolism. The authors also provide other evidence for endothermy in stem archosaurs. It is reasonable to suggest that later crocodilians developed the pulmonary bypass shunt as they became cold-blooded, aquatic, and less active.

If the crocodilian ancestors and other Triassic archosaurs were warm-blooded, this would help to resolve some evolutionary puzzles:
*The earliest crocodylomorphs, e.g., &quot;Terrestrisuchus&quot;, were slim, leggy terrestrial predators whose build suggests a fairly active lifestyle, which requires a fairly fast metabolism. And some other crurotarsan archosaurs appear to have had erect limbs, while those of rauisuchians are very poorly adapted for any other posture. Erect limbs are advantageous for active animals because they avoid Carrier&#x27;s constraint, but disadvantageous for more sluggish animals because they increase the energy costs of standing up and lying down.
*If early archosaurs were completely cold-blooded and (as seems most likely) dinosaurs were at least fairly warm-blooded, dinosaurs would have had to evolve warm-blooded metabolisms in less than half the time it took for synapsids to do the same.

===Respiratory system===
A recent study of the lungs of &quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot; (the American alligator) has shown that the airflow through them is unidirectional, moving in the same direction during inhalation and exhalation. This is also seen in birds and many non-avian dinosaurs, which have air sacs to further aid in respiration. Both birds and alligators achieve unidirectional air flow through the presence of parabronchi, which are responsible for gas exchange. The study has found that in alligators, air enters through the second bronchial branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits through the first bronchial branch. Unidirectional airflow in both birds and alligators suggests that this type of respiration was present at the base of Archosauria and retained by both dinosaurs and non-dinosaurian archosaurs, such as aetosaurs, &quot;rauisuchians&quot; (non-crocodylomorph paracrocodylomorphs), crocodylomorphs, and pterosaurs. The use of unidirectional airflow in the lungs of archosaurs may have given the group an advantage over synapsids, which had lungs where air moved tidally in and out through a network of bronchi that terminated in alveoli, which were cul-de-sacs. The better efficiency in gas transfer seen in archosaur lungs may have been advantageous during the times of low atmospheric oxygen which are thought to have existed during the Mesozoic.

==Reproduction==
Most (if not all) archosaurs are oviparous. Birds and crocodilians lay hard-shelled eggs, as did extinct dinosaurs, and crocodylomorphs. Hard-shelled eggs are present in both dinosaurs and crocodilians, which has been used as an explanation for the absence of viviparity or ovoviviparity in archosaurs. However, both pterosaurs and baurusuchids have soft-shelled eggs, implying that hard shells are not a plesiomorphic condition. The pelvic anatomy of &quot;Cricosaurus&quot; and other metriorhynchids and fossilized embryos belonging to the non-archosaur archosauromorph &quot;Dinocephalosaurus,&quot; together suggest that the lack of viviparity among archosaurs may be a consequence of lineage-specific restrictions.

Archosaurs are ancestrally superprecocial as evidenced in various dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and crocodylomorphs. However, parental care did evolve independently multiple times in crocodilians, dinosaurs, and aetosaurs. In most such species the animals bury their eggs and rely on temperature-dependent sex determination. The notable exception are Neornithes which incubate their eggs and rely on genetic sex determination – a trait that might have given them a survival advantage over other dinosaurs.

<doc id="492042" wikidata="Q1087887" url="?curid=492042" title="Ryōtarō Shiba">
<text>, also known as , was a Japanese author. He is best known for his novels about historical events in Japan and on the Northeast Asian sub-continent, as well as his historical and cultural essays pertaining to Japan and its relationship to the rest of the world.

==Career==
Shiba took his pen name from Sima Qian, the great Han dynasty historian (Shiba is the Japanese rendition of Sima). He studied Mongolian at the Osaka School of Foreign Languages (now the School of Foreign Studies at Osaka University) and began his career as a journalist with the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot;, one of Japan&#x27;s major newspapers. After World War II Shiba began writing historical novels. The magazine &quot;Shukan Asahi&quot; (:ja:週刊朝日) printed Shiba&#x27;s articles about his travels within Japan in a series that ran for 1,146 installments. Shiba received the Naoki Prize for the 1959 novel &quot;Fukurō no Shiro&quot; (&quot;Castle of Owls&quot;). In 1993 Shiba received the Government&#x27;s Order of Cultural Merit. Shiba was a prolific author who frequently wrote about the dramatic change Japan went through during the late Edo and early Meiji periods. His most monumental works include &quot;Kunitori Monogatari&quot;, &quot;Ryoma ga Yuku&quot; (see below), &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;, and &quot;Saka no Ue no Kumo&quot;, all of which have spawned dramatizations, most notably Taiga dramas aired in hour-long segments over a full year on NHK television. He also wrote numerous essays that were published in collections, one of which—&quot;Kaidō wo Yuku&quot;—is a multi-volume journal-like work covering his travels across Japan and around the world. Shiba is widely appreciated for the originality of his analyses of historical events, and many people in Japan have read at least one of his works.

Several of Shiba&#x27;s works have been translated into English, including &quot; Drunk as a Lord: Samurai Stories &quot; (2001), his fictionalized biographies of Kukai (&quot;Kukai the Universal: Scenes from His Life&quot;, 2003) and Tokugawa Yoshinobu (&quot;The Last Shogun: The Life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu&quot;, 2004), as well as &quot; The Tatar Whirlwind: A Novel of Seventeenth-Century East Asia&quot; (2007) and &quot; Clouds Above the Hill &quot; (2012, 2013, 2014).

==&quot;Ryōma Goes His Way&quot;==
One of Shiba&#x27;s best known works, , is a historical novel about Sakamoto Ryōma, a samurai who was instrumental in bringing about Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration, after which values and elements from Western culture were introduced into the country, sparking dramatic change. The late Edo period was a very confused time when the country split into two factions. Japan had banned international trade for over two hundred years and isolated itself from the rest of the world. During the Edo period, the Japanese government, which was led by the Tokugawa clan, had agreed to open the country to trade with the United States and several European countries. However, many people were against this and they started a movement called &quot;Sonnō-Jōi&quot; (revere the emperor and expel the barbarians). They believed that they should stand up and fight the foreigners to protect the country from outside domination. The Tokugawa had usurped political power from the emperor, but he was still considered by many to be the sacred symbol of Japan. To protect the country, the Sonnō-Jōi faction sought to restore the emperor&#x27;s political authority by overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate. Partisans of these two political institutions caused civil war-like confusion, and assassinations were frequent.

In &quot;Ryōma ga Yuku&quot;, Sakamoto Ryōma, the protagonist, starts out as a member of the Sonnō-Jōi faction but gradually realizes that people need to realize how much stronger other countries have grown during Japan&#x27;s two centuries of national seclusion. Japan was almost powerless in the face of the technology and well-developed industry of the contemporary Western powers. He believed that Japan needed to adopt elements of Western culture to develop into a country that could stand equally among nations.

Sakamoto Ryōma was not well known in Japan prior to the publication of &quot;Ryōma ga Yuku&quot;. &quot;Ryōma ga Yuku&quot; is Shiba&#x27;s best selling work in Japanese, with 21,250,000 copies sold.

==&quot;Kaidō wo Yuku&quot;==
 is a series of travel essays initially published in &quot;Shūkan Asahi&quot;, a weekly magazine, from 1971 until 1996. Shiba wrote the series with an intercultural perspective, making observations about the history, geography, and people of the places he visited. Though mostly about different areas of Japan, the series includes several volumes on foreign lands as well—China, Korea, the &quot;Namban&quot; countries (Spain and Portugal), Ireland, the Netherlands, Mongolia, Taiwan, and New York.

The work, now available in multi-volume book form, was also developed into documentary series and broadcast on NHK, Japan&#x27;s public television broadcaster.

The series ran for 1,146 installments.

==&quot;Clouds Above the Hill&quot;==
Another well-known work, , is a historical epic centering on the careers of two ambitious brothers who work their way up from a rural backwater to positions of eminence in the new post-1868 Meiji period. In it, the Akiyama brothers strive to build a Japanese military capable of holding its own in an unstable region and the Russo-Japanese War becomes the central stage for their involvement in the frenzied modernisation and ascendancy of Japan in the region and subsequently, the world. It is Shiba&#x27;s second best selling work in Japanese, with 14,750,000 copies sold.

==Battles of Khalkhin Gol==
Shiba began working on a novel based on the Battles of Khalkhin Gol and conducted research. However, as he delved deeper into his research, his motivation to write dwindled.

In the end, he gave up writing.

==Death==
Shiba suffered internal bleeding and lapsed into a coma on February 10, 1996. He died two days later.

<doc id="492043" wikidata="Q842275" url="?curid=492043" title="Photorespiration">
<text>Photorespiration (also known as the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle or C2 cycle) refers to a process in plant metabolism where the enzyme RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP, wasting some of the energy produced by photosynthesis. The desired reaction is the addition of carbon dioxide to RuBP (carboxylation), a key step in the Calvin–Benson cycle, but approximately 25% of reactions by RuBisCO instead add oxygen to RuBP (oxygenation), creating a product that cannot be used within the Calvin–Benson cycle. This process lowers the efficiency of photosynthesis, potentially lowering photosynthetic output by 25% in plants. Photorespiration involves a complex network of enzyme reactions that exchange metabolites between chloroplasts, leaf peroxisomes and mitochondria.

The oxygenation reaction of RuBisCO is a wasteful process because 3-phosphoglycerate is created at a lower rate and higher metabolic cost compared with RuBP carboxylase activity. While photorespiratory carbon cycling results in the formation of G3P eventually, around 25% of carbon fixed by photorespiration is re-released as and nitrogen, as ammonia. Ammonia must then be detoxified at a substantial cost to the cell. Photorespiration also incurs a direct cost of one ATP and one NAD(P)H.

While it is common to refer to the entire process as photorespiration, technically the term refers only to the metabolic network which acts to rescue the products of the oxygenation reaction (phosphoglycolate).

==Photorespiratory reactions==

Addition of molecular oxygen to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate produces 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG, or PG). PGA is the normal product of carboxylation, and productively enters the Calvin cycle. Phosphoglycolate, however, inhibits certain enzymes involved in photosynthetic carbon fixation (hence is often said to be an &#x27;inhibitor of photosynthesis&#x27;). It is also relatively difficult to recycle: in higher plants it is salvaged by a series of reactions in the peroxisome, mitochondria, and again in the peroxisome where it is converted into glycerate. Glycerate reenters the chloroplast and by the same transporter that exports glycolate. A cost of 1 ATP is associated with conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) (Phosphorylation), within the chloroplast, which is then free to re-enter the Calvin cycle.

Several costs are associated with this metabolic pathway; the production of hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisome (associated with the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate). Hydrogen peroxide is a dangerously strong oxidant which must be immediately split into water and oxygen by the enzyme catalase. The conversion of 2× 2Carbon glycine to 1× serine in the mitochondria by the enzyme glycine-decarboxylase is a key step, which releases , NH3, and reduces NAD to NADH. Thus, one molecule is produced for every two molecules of (two deriving from RuBisCO and one from peroxisomal oxidations). The assimilation of NH3 occurs via the GS-GOGAT cycle, at a cost of one ATP and one NADPH.

Cyanobacteria have three possible pathways through which they can metabolise 2-phosphoglycolate. They are unable to grow if all three pathways are knocked out, despite having a carbon concentrating mechanism that should dramatically lower the rate of photorespiration (see below).

==Substrate specificity of RuBisCO==
The oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle reaction is catalyzed by RuBP oxygenase activity:

:RuBP + → Phosphoglycolate + 3-phosphoglycerate + 2 

During the catalysis by RuBisCO, an &#x27;activated&#x27; intermediate is formed (an enediol intermediate) in the RuBisCO active site. This intermediate is able to react with either or . It has been demonstrated that the specific shape of the RuBisCO active site acts to encourage reactions with . Although there is a significant &quot;failure&quot; rate (~25% of reactions are oxygenation rather than carboxylation), this represents significant favouring of , when the relative abundance of the two gases is taken into account: in the current atmosphere, is approximately 500 times more abundant, and in solution is 25 times more abundant than .

The ability of RuBisCO to specify between the two gases is known as its selectivity factor (or Srel), and it varies between species, with angiosperms more efficient than other plants, but with little variation among the vascular plants.

A suggested explanation of RuBisCO&#x27;s inability to discriminate completely between and is that it is an evolutionary relic: The early atmosphere in which primitive plants originated contained very little oxygen, the early evolution of RuBisCO was not influenced by its ability to discriminate between and .

==Conditions which affect photorespiration==
Photorespiration rates are affected by:

===Altered substrate availability: lowered or increased O2===
Factors which influence this include the atmospheric abundance of the two gases, the supply of the gases to the site of fixation (i.e. in land plants: whether the stomata are open or closed), the length of the liquid phase (how far these gases have to diffuse through water in order to reach the reaction site). For example, when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during drought: this limits the supply, while production within the leaf will continue. In algae (and plants which photosynthesise underwater); gases have to diffuse significant distances through water, which results in a decrease in the availability of relative to . It has been predicted that the increase in concentrations predicted over the next 100 years may lower the rate of photorespiration in most plants by around 50%. However, at temperatures higher than the photosynthetic thermal optimum, the increases in turnover rate are not translated into increased assimilation because of the decreased affinity of Rubisco for .

===Increased temperature===
At higher temperatures RuBisCO is less able to discriminate between and . This is because the enediol intermediate is less stable. Increasing temperatures also lower the solubility of , thus lowering the concentration of relative to in the chloroplast.

==Biological adaptation to minimize photorespiration==
The vast majority of plants are C3, meaning they photorespire when necessary. Certain species of plants or algae have mechanisms to lower the uptake of molecular oxygen by RuBisCO. These are commonly referred to as Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms (CCMs), as they increase the concentration of so that RuBisCO is less likely to produce glycolate through reaction with .

===Biochemical carbon concentrating mechanisms===
Biochemical CCMs concentrate carbon dioxide in one temporal or spatial region, through metabolite exchange. C4 and CAM photosynthesis both use the enzyme Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) to add to a 4-carbon sugar. PEPC is faster than RuBisCO, and more selective for .

====C4====
C4 plants capture carbon dioxide in their mesophyll cells (using an enzyme called phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which catalyzes the combination of carbon dioxide with a compound called phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)), forming oxaloacetate. This oxaloacetate is then converted to malate and is transported into the bundle sheath cells (site of carbon dioxide fixation by RuBisCO) where oxygen concentration is low to avoid photorespiration. Here, carbon dioxide is removed from the malate and combined with RuBP by RuBisCO in the usual way, and the Calvin cycle proceeds as normal. The concentrations in the Bundle Sheath are approximately 10–20 fold higher than the concentration in the mesophyll cells.

This ability to avoid photorespiration makes these plants more hardy than other plants in dry and hot environments, wherein stomata are closed and internal carbon dioxide levels are low. Under these conditions, photorespiration does occur in C4 plants, but at a much lower level compared with C3 plants in the same conditions. C4 plants include sugar cane, corn (maize), and sorghum.

====CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism)====

CAM plants, such as cacti and succulent plants, also use the enzyme PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide, but only at night. Crassulacean acid metabolism allows plants to conduct most of their gas exchange in the cooler night-time air, sequestering carbon in 4-carbon sugars which can be released to the photosynthesizing cells during the day. This allows CAM plants to minimize water loss (transpiration) by maintaining closed stomata during the day. CAM plants usually display other water-saving characteristics, such as thick cuticles, stomata with small apertures, and typically lose around 1/3 of the amount of water per fixed.
====C2====

C2 photosynthesis (also called glycine shuttle and photorespiratory CO2 pump) is a CCM that works by making use of – as opposed to avoiding – photorespiration. It performs &quot;carbon refixation&quot; by delaying the breakdown of photorespired glycine, so that the molecule is shuttled from the mesophyll into the bundle sheath. Once there, the glycine is decarboxylated in mitochondria as usual, releasing CO2 and concentrating it to triple the usual concentration.

Although C2 photosynthesis is traditionally understood as an intermediate step between C3 and C4, a wide variety of plant lineages do end up in the C2 stage without further evolving, showing that it is an evolutionary steady state of its own. C2 may be easier to engineer into crops, as the phenotype requires fewer anatomical changes to produce.

====Algae====
There have been some reports of algae operating a biochemical CCM: shuttling metabolites within single cells to concentrate in one area. This process is not fully understood.

===Biophysical carbon-concentrating mechanisms===
This type of carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) relies on a contained compartment within the cell into which is shuttled, and where RuBisCO is highly expressed. In many species, biophysical CCMs are only induced under low carbon dioxide concentrations. Biophysical CCMs are more evolutionary ancient than biochemical CCMs. There is some debate as to when biophysical CCMs first evolved, but it is likely to have been during a period of low carbon dioxide, after the Great Oxygenation Event (2.4 billion years ago). Low periods occurred around 750, 650, and 320–270 million years ago.

====Eukaryotic algae====
In nearly all species of eukaryotic algae (&quot;Chloromonas&quot; being one notable exception), upon induction of the CCM, ~95% of RuBisCO is densely packed into a single subcellular compartment: the pyrenoid. Carbon dioxide is concentrated in this compartment using a combination of CO2 pumps, bicarbonate pumps, and carbonic anhydrases. The pyrenoid is not a membrane-bound compartment but is found within the chloroplast, often surrounded by a starch sheath (which is not thought to serve a function in the CCM).

====Hornworts====
Certain species of hornwort are the only land plants that are known to have a biophysical CCM involving concentration of carbon dioxide within pyrenoids in their chloroplasts.

====Cyanobacteria====
Cyanobacterial CCMs are similar in principle to those found in eukaryotic algae and hornworts, but the compartment into which carbon dioxide is concentrated has several structural differences. Instead of the pyrenoid, cyanobacteria contain carboxysomes, which have a protein shell, and linker proteins packing RuBisCO inside with a very regular structure.
Cyanobacterial CCMs are much better understood than those found in eukaryotes, partly due to the ease of genetic manipulation of prokaryotes.

==Possible purpose of photorespiration==
Lowering photorespiration may not result in increased growth rates for plants. Photorespiration may be necessary for the assimilation of nitrate from soil. Thus, a lowering in photorespiration by genetic engineering or because of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may not benefit plants as has been proposed. Several physiological processes may be responsible for linking photorespiration and nitrogen assimilation. Photorespiration increases availability of NADH, which is required for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Certain nitrite transporters also transport bicarbonate, and elevated has been shown to suppress nitrite transport into chloroplasts. However, in an agricultural setting, replacing the native photorespiration pathway with an engineered synthetic pathway to metabolize glycolate in the chloroplast resulted in a 40 percent increase in crop growth.

Although photorespiration is much lower in C4 species, it is still an essential pathwaymutants without functioning 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism cannot grow in normal conditions. One mutant was shown to rapidly accumulate glycolate.

Although the functions of photorespiration remain controversial, it is widely accepted that this pathway influences a wide range of processes from bioenergetics, photosystem II function, and carbon metabolism to nitrogen assimilation and respiration. The oxygenase reaction of RuBisCO may prevent depletion near its active sites and contributes to the regulation of CO2. concentration in the atmosphere The photorespiratory pathway is a major source of hydrogen peroxide () in photosynthetic cells. Through production and pyrimidine nucleotide interactions, photorespiration makes a key contribution to cellular redox homeostasis. In so doing, it influences multiple signalling pathways, in particular, those that govern plant hormonal responses controlling growth, environmental and defense responses, and programmed cell death.

It has been postulated that photorespiration may function as a &quot;safety valve&quot;, preventing the excess of reductive potential coming from an overreduced NADPH-pool from reacting with oxygen and producing free radicals (oxidants), as these can damage the metabolic functions of the cell by subsequent oxidation of membrane lipids, proteins or nucleotides. The mutants deficient in photorespiratory enzymes are characterized by a high redox level in the cell, impaired stomatal regulation, and accumulation of formate.

<text>Presbyopia is a physiological insufficiency of optical accommodation associated with the aging of the eye; it results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects. Also known as age-related farsightedness (or as age-related long sight in the UK), it affects many adults over the age of 40. A common sign of presbyopia is difficulty in reading small print, which results in having to hold reading material farther away. Other symptoms associated can be headaches and eyestrain. Different people experience different degrees of problems. Other types of refractive errors may exist at the same time as presbyopia. This condition is similar to hypermetropia or far-sightedness, which starts in childhood and exhibits similar symptoms of blur in the vision for close objects.
Presbyopia is a typical part of the aging process. It occurs due to age-related changes in the lens (decreased elasticity and increased hardness) and ciliary muscle (decreased strength and ability to move the lens), causing the eye to focus right behind rather than on the retina when looking at close objects. It is a type of refractive error, along with nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Diagnosis is by an eye examination.
Presbyopia can be corrected using glasses, contact lenses, multifocal intraocular lenses, or LASIK (PresbyLASIK) surgery. The most common treatment is glass correction using appropriate convex lens. Glasses prescribed to correct presbyopia may be simple reading glasses, bifocals, trifocals, or progressive lenses.
People over 40 are at risk for developing presbyopia and all people become affected to some degree. An estimated 25% of people (1.8 billion globally) had presbyopia .

==Signs and symptoms==
The first symptoms most people notice are difficulty reading fine print, particularly in low light conditions, eyestrain when reading for long periods, blurring of near objects or temporarily blurred vision when changing the viewing distance. Many extreme presbyopes complain that their arms have become &quot;too short&quot; to hold reading material at a comfortable distance.

Presbyopia, like other focal imperfections, becomes less noticeable in bright sunlight when the pupil becomes smaller. As with any lens, increasing the focal ratio of the lens increases depth of field by reducing the level of blur of out-of-focus objects (compare the effect of aperture on depth of field in photography).

The onset of presbyopia varies among those with certain professions and those with miotic pupils. In particular, farmers and homemakers seek correction later, whereas service workers and construction workers seek correction earlier. Scuba divers with interest in underwater photography may notice presbyopic changes while diving before they recognize the symptoms in their normal routines due to the near focus in low light conditions.

===Interaction with myopia===
People with low near-sightedness can read comfortably without eyeglasses or contact lenses even after age forty, but higher myopes might require two pairs of glasses (one for distance, one for near), bifocal, or progressive lenses. However, their myopia does not disappear and the long-distance visual challenges remain. Myopes considering refractive surgery are advised that surgically correcting their nearsightedness may be a disadvantage after age forty, when the eyes become presbyopic and lose their ability to accommodate or change focus, because they will then need to use glasses for reading. Myopes with low astigmatism find near vision better, though not perfect, without glasses or contact lenses when presbyopia sets in, but the more astigmatism, the poorer the uncorrected near vision.

A surgical technique offered is to create a &quot;reading eye&quot; and a &quot;distance vision eye&quot;, a technique commonly used in contact lens practice, known as monovision. Monovision can be created with contact lenses, so candidates for this procedure can determine if they are prepared to have their corneas reshaped by surgery to cause this effect permanently.

==Mechanism==
The cause of presbyopia is lens stiffening by decreasing levels of -crystallin, a process which may be sped up by higher temperatures. It results in a near point greater than (or equivalently, less than 4 diopters).

In optics, the closest point at which an object can be brought into focus by the eye is called the eye&#x27;s near point. A standard near point distance of is typically assumed in the design of optical instruments, and in characterizing optical devices such as magnifying glasses.

There is some confusion over how the focusing mechanism of the eye works. In the 1977 book, &quot;Eye and Brain&quot;, for example, the lens is said to be suspended by a membrane, the &#x27;zonula&#x27;, which holds it under tension. The tension is released, by contraction of the ciliary muscle, to allow the lens to become more round, for close vision. This implies the ciliary muscle, which is outside the zonula, must be circumferential, contracting like a sphincter, to slacken the tension of the zonula pulling outwards on the lens. This is consistent with the fact that our eyes seem to be in the &#x27;relaxed&#x27; state when focusing at infinity, and also explains why no amount of effort seems to enable a myopic person to see farther away.

The ability to focus on near objects declines throughout life, from an accommodation of about 20 dioptres (ability to focus at away) in a child, to 10 dioptres at age 25 (), and levels off at 0.5 to 1 dioptre at age 60 (ability to focus down to only). The expected, maximum, and minimum amplitudes of accommodation in diopters (D) for a corrected patient of a given age can be estimated using Hofstetter&#x27;s formulas: expected amplitude (age in years); maximum amplitude (age in years); minimum amplitude (age in years).

==Diagnosis==
A basic eye exam, which includes a refraction assessment and an eye health exam, is used to diagnose presbyopia.

==Treatment==
In the visual system, images captured by the eye are translated into electric signals that are transmitted to the brain where they are interpreted. As such, in order to overcome presbyopia, two main components of the visual system can be addressed: image capturing by the optical system of the eye and image processing in the brain.

===Image capturing in the eye===
Solutions for presbyopia have advanced significantly in recent years due to widened availability of optometry care and over-the-counter vision correction options.

====Corrective lenses====
Corrective lenses provide vision correction over a range as high as +4.0 diopters. People with presbyopia require a convex lens for reading glasses; specialized preparations of convex lenses usually require the services of an optometrist.

Contact lenses can also be used to correct the focusing loss that comes along with presbyopia. Multifocal contact lenses can be used to correct vision for both the near and the far. Some people choose contact lenses to correct one eye for near and one eye for far with a method called monovision.

====Surgery====

Refractive surgery has been done to create multifocal corneas. PresbyLASIK, a type of multifocal corneal ablation LASIK procedure may be used to correct presbyopia. Results are, however, more variable and some people have a decrease in visual acuity. Concerns with refractive surgeries for presbyopia include people&#x27;s eyes changing with time. Other side effects of multifocal corneal ablation include postoperative glare, halos, ghost images, and monocular diplopia.

===Image processing in the brain===
A number of studies have claimed improvements in near visual acuity by the use of training protocols based on perceptual learning and requiring the detection of briefly presented low-contrast Gabor stimuli; study participants with presbyopia were enabled to read smaller font sizes and to increase their reading speed.

=== Eye drops ===
Pilocarpine, eye drops that constrict the pupil, has been approved by the FDA for presbyopia. Research on other drugs is in progress. Eye drops intended to restore lens elasticity are also being investigated.

==Etymology==
The term is from and ( ).

==History==
The condition was mentioned as early as the writings of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. Glass lenses first came into use for the problem in the late 13th century.

<text>Jacob&#x27;s Ladder is a 1990 American psychological horror film directed by Adrian Lyne, produced by Alan Marshall and written by Bruce Joel Rubin. It stars Tim Robbins as Jacob Singer, an American infantryman whose experiences during his military service in Vietnam result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to learn the truth. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Peña and Danny Aiello.

&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; was made by Carolco Pictures ten years after being written by Rubin. Despite only being moderately successful upon its release, the film garnered a cult following, and its plot and special effects became a source of influence for various other works, such as the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; video game series. A remake was released in 2019.

==Plot==

On October 6, 1971, American infantryman Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division, deployed in a village in Vietnam&#x27;s Mekong Delta, when his close-knit unit comes under sudden attack. As many of Jacob&#x27;s comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering catatonia, convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be stabbed with a bayonet by an unseen assailant.

Jacob awakens in the New York City Subway, where, after he glimpses what he believes to be a tentacle protruding from a sleeping homeless person, an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975; he is a postal worker and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his girlfriend, Jezebel. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. Jacob is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. He attempts to contact his regular doctor at the local VA hospital, but is first told that there is no record of him ever being a patient there, and then that his doctor has died in a car explosion.

At a party thrown by friends, a psychic reads Jacob&#x27;s palm and tells him that he is already dead, which Jacob dismisses as a joke. After declining to dance with her, he appears to witness an enormous creature penetrating Jezebel before he collapses. At home, Jacob experiences a dangerous fever, which Jezebel attempts to bring down with a painful ice bath. Jacob briefly wakes up in another reality where he lives with his wife and sons, including a still-alive Gabe. First-person perspective scenes of apparent flashbacks to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter that is then shot down.

One of Jacob&#x27;s former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences, but is soon afterwards killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However, the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob&#x27;s comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is his home, but his chiropractor friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart:

Eckhart saw Hell too. He said: &quot;The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won&#x27;t let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they&#x27;re not punishing you&quot;, he said. &quot;They&#x27;re freeing your soul. So, if you&#x27;re frightened of dying and ... you&#x27;re holding on, you&#x27;ll see devils tearing your life away. But if you&#x27;ve made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.&quot;

Jacob is approached by a distressed man who had been following him from a distance and who also dragged him away from Paul&#x27;s burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army&#x27;s chemical warfare division where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which massively increased aggression. Michael claims that, to test the drug&#x27;s effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob&#x27;s unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael&#x27;s story triggers a vision of Jacob wounded in Vietnam, which shows his attacker as a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family&#x27;s home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. The scene turns to a triage tent in 1971 as military medics declare Jacob dead, commenting that he had put up a tremendous fight to stay alive but now looks peaceful in death.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s title refers to the Biblical story of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, or the dream of a meeting place between Heaven and Earth (Genesis 28:12). Its little-known alternative title is &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, in a reference to &quot;Inferno&quot; by Dante Alighieri. Screenwriter and co-producer Bruce Joel Rubin perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the &quot;Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State&quot;, the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Rubin said: &quot;The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. Once you have a meditative life you start to see that the world is really far different than what it appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues everything in our lives.&quot; Before writing his scripts for &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;, which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal; previously, he had also written afterlife-themed &quot;Brainstorm&quot; and &quot;Deadly Friend&quot;.

Rubin&#x27;s work on &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; began in 1980, sparked by his nightmare in which he dreamt about being trapped in a New York City Subway station. For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success. He was immediately given offers from studios specializing in low-budget horror productions, but insisted on holding out in favor of better funded studios and directors. The script began attracting attention after getting listed as one of &quot;American Film&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten unproduced screenplays. Thom Mount of Universal Pictures said he &quot;loved it, but it was not for his studio&quot;. Directors Michael Apted, Sidney Lumet and Ridley Scott all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin&#x27;s &quot;too metaphysical&quot; stories as &quot;Hollywood does not make ghost movies&quot;. Eventually, after &quot;Deadly Friend&quot; was filmed by Wes Craven in 1986, Rubin&#x27;s screenplays for both &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot; were picked by Paramount Pictures. In 1988, Adrian Lyne, who described Rubin&#x27;s work as &quot;certainly one of the best scripts I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;, decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; as he had originally planned (incidentally, Tom Hanks, an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in &quot;Bonfire&quot;). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film&#x27;s ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The independent film studio Carolco Pictures decided to take over the production of &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, giving Lyne a greater creative control and a budget of $25 million. Rubin became the film&#x27;s co-producer, along with Mario Kassar, Alan Marshall and Andrew G. Vajna.

Lyne, who downplayed Rubin&#x27;s &quot;intimidating&quot; Old Testament themes, said that he prepared for making the film by watching &quot;endless&quot; documentary films about the war in Vietnam and reading &quot;countless&quot; chronicles of near-death experiences. The film&#x27;s plot device of a long period of subjective time passing in an instant has been explored by several authors. A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was Robert Enrico&#x27;s 1962 short film &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;, one of Lyne&#x27;s favorite films, which was in turn based on Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s 1890 short story of the same title. Cinematographer Jeffrey L. Kimball based the film&#x27;s dream sequences on the art of Francis Bacon.

Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were among the first actors to audition for the roles of Jacob and Jezzie, but Carolco Pictures initially demanded more established stars in the role. Dustin Hoffman, Richard Gere and Al Pacino were considered for the role of Jacob, while Andie MacDowell, Julia Roberts, Demi Moore and Madonna were considered for the role of Jezzie. Lyne ultimately decided to cast Robbins and Peña anyway. Cast in the role of Jacob, Tim Robbins said the film presented for him &quot;a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well.&quot;

Filming began in New York City on September 11, 1989, and took place on location in Staten Island, Queens, and Brooklyn. Jacob and Jezzie&#x27;s apartment was filmed on a soundstage in West 23rd Street, while the subway dream sequences were shot on an abandoned level of Bergen Street station. The Seaview Hospital of Staten Island; the Essex County Veterans Courthouse of Newark, New Jersey; and Madison Square Garden were also featured as locations in the film. The film&#x27;s military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames). The war scenes were filmed in the jungles near Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, featuring the UH-1 helicopters provided by the Puerto Rico National Guard. Filming concluded at Tortuguero Lagoon in January 1990 with a $40 million budget.

All of the film&#x27;s special effect sequences were filmed in camera, with no use of post-production effects. In several scenes of &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, Lyne used a body horror technique in which an actor is recorded shaking his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition&#x27;s commentary track, Lyne said he was inspired by the art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay&#x27;s 1986 stop motion short film &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot;.

In the film, Jacob is told by Michael that the horrific events he experienced on his final day in Vietnam were the product of an experimental drug called &quot;the Ladder&quot;, which was used on troops without their knowledge. At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, NATO code for a deliriant and hallucinogen known as 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the Pentagon. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was Martin A. Lee&#x27;s book &quot;Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and Sixties Rebellion&quot;, but noted that &quot;nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ—a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit maniac behavior—was used on U.S. troops.&quot;

According to Lyne&#x27;s audio commentary, test screenings indicated that the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience. In response, about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from the last third of the film, were removed from the final cut.

==Release==
===Theatrical release===
&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; opened on November 2, 1990, distributed by TriStar Pictures. &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; with the music by Maurice Jarre was released by Varèse Sarabande in 1993 and then by Waxwork Records in March 2020 on a single LP. Rubin&#x27;s companion book, released by Applause Theater Book Publishers on the same day as the film, features a final draft of the screenplay, including the deleted scenes, and his essay on making of the screenplay and the film.

===Home media===
The Special Edition DVD was released by Artisan Entertainment on July 14, 1998, containing three deleted scenes (&quot;Jezzie&#x27;s Transformation&quot;, &quot;The Antidote&quot; and &quot;The Train Station&quot;) along with several other special features, such as audio commentary by Adrian Lyne and a 26-minute making-of documentary &quot;Building &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;&quot;. On September 14, 2010, the film was released on Blu-ray Disc by Lions Gate Entertainment and retains all of the special features of the DVD version, along with two promotional trailers, omitting only a TV spot that came with the DVD.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film took the number one spot at the weekend box office in North America, garnering ticket sales of $7.5 million from 1,052 screens. However, the attendance dropped fast and its overall domestic box office result was only $26,118,851.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 68 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Even with its disorienting leaps of logic and structure, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; is an engrossing, nerve-shattering experience&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that watching it left him &quot;reeling with turmoil and confusion, with feelings of sadness and despair,&quot; and called it a &quot;thoroughly painful and depressing experience — but, it must be said, one that has been powerfully written, directed and acted.&quot; He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that this &quot;slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death,&quot; is &quot;both quaint and devastating.&quot;

Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt disappointed with the film that is &quot;ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; is so &#x27;dark&#x27; it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it&#x27;s hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination or not. You just want out.&quot; Kim Newman called the film &quot;effectively the blunt remake&quot; of &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;.

According to IGN&#x27;s review of the DVD release in 2004, &quot;After movies like &quot;Se7en&quot;, it may not pack the same subtle horror for today&#x27;s audiences it did when it was first released, but it&#x27;s still a great film.&quot; IGN&#x27;s review of &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;″s 2010 Blu-ray release called it &quot;an emotionally poignant, creepy horror masterpiece.&quot; According to &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; is &quot;a bizarrely cohesive hybrid of war movie, character study, art film, and horror flick&quot; and &quot;the very act of watching the film is so emotionally draining that the viewer leaves the film feeling worked-in; the thought of repeat viewings is daunting yet insatiable.&quot; John Kenneth Muir called the film&#x27;s nightmarish hospital scene &quot;one of the most terrifying moments in all of 1990s horror cinema.&quot; Muir further wrote: &quot;In its musings about death, about the end we all fear&quot;, Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; proves a deeply affecting and meaningful motion picture. After a screening, you&#x27;ll immediately want to hug the people you love and then go outside and breathe the fresh air, or otherwise affirm your very existence.&quot;

Rubin&#x27;s script was included on the list of &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s ten best unproduced screenplays&quot; by &quot;American Film&quot; magazine in 1983. In 1991, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; was nominated at Horror Hall of Fame II for best horror film of the year, losing to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. The film was also featured in Bravo&#x27;s 2004 documentary miniseries &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; and in the 2009 book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. In 2013, the Jacob Burns Film Center projectionist Andrew Robinson chose it as his favorite scary film. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; lists this film in the vetsploitation subgenre.

==Legacy==
&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; greatly inspired the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; horror franchise, including the video games &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; (2001), &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; (2003), &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot; (2004), and &quot;Silent Hill: Homecoming&quot; (2008), as well as the series&#x27; 2006 film adaptation by Christophe Gans. The film&#x27;s influence on their works was also recognized by Ryan Murphy, writer of the 2011 TV series &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot;, and by Shinji Mikami, creator of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series and director of the 2014 video game &quot;The Evil Within&quot;. Kim Manners prepared for directing &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Grotesque&quot; by listening to the music from &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. The music video for the 2010 song &quot;Nightmare&quot; by Avenged Sevenfold is a homage to the famous hospital scene from the film, chosen by the director Wayne Isham, because the band&#x27;s deceased drummer The Rev was a fan of the film. Director Christopher Nolan has said that &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, specifically its use of abstract imagery, was an influence on his 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

Several direct references to &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; exist within the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; games, particularly &quot;Silent Hill 2,&quot; whose plot is largely inspired by the film; the head-twitching effect seen in the film recurs throughout the game series, and in &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, the protagonist, James Sunderland, wears an M-1965 field jacket nearly identical to the one Jacob wears in the film. Other references to the film itself include the mentions in the 2002 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Night Route&quot; (dialog) and the 2010 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Squirt and the Whale&quot; (visual). &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; refers to the film in the 2020 episode &quot;Never Ricking Morty&quot; with a flashback when Morty stabs Rick with a bayonet, reminiscent of what happens to the main protagonist at the beginning of the film.

In music, Claytown Troupe used a sample of Michael&#x27;s quote &#x27;It&#x27;s a fast trip ... &#x27; at the beginning of the track &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s Edge&quot; from their 1991 album &quot;Out There&quot;. UNKLE sampled dialogue from the film in their 1998 &quot;Rabbit in Your Headlights&quot; and again in 2003 in &quot;Inside&quot;. VNV Nation&#x27;s track &quot;Forsaken&quot; from the 1998 album &quot;Praise the Fallen&quot; ends with the quotation from Eckhart. &quot;Devils&quot; from IVardensphere&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;APOK&quot; begins with the same quotation. A sample of Jacob&#x27;s cry &#x27;Stop it, you&#x27;re killing me!&#x27; is used in &quot;Next in Line&quot; from Nevermore&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;The Politics of Ecstasy&quot;. Biosphere&#x27;s track &quot;City Wakes Up&quot; from album &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; features a sample of departing train sounds from the subway scene.

The film&#x27;s possible influence can be arguably seen in many other works ranging from M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s 1999 hit psychological horror film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; to Peter Arnett&#x27;s controversial 1998 CNN report &quot;Valley of Death&quot; about the 1970 Operation Tailwind. Jeff Millar of &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s 1994 psychological thriller &quot;A Pure Formality&quot; uses the plot device of &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; mixed with several other sources. According to &quot;Premiere&quot;, Massy Tadjedin&#x27;s 2005 psychological thriller &quot;The Jacket&quot; &quot;is a film for those who don&#x27;t remember &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, perhaps for someone like Jacob himself,&quot; as it &quot;resembles &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; too much for its own good.&quot;

&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; is a longtime running gag on the podcast &quot;How Did This Get Made?&quot;, in which a group of comedians examines various bad movies. At some point in every episode, either co-host Jason Mantzoukas or an audience member will posit that week&#x27;s film might be &quot;a &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; situation.&quot;

==Remake==
A remake directed by David M. Rosenthal and written by Jeff Buhler, Sarah Thorp and Jake Wade Wall was released in 2019, to negative reception. The film stars Michael Ealy, Jesse Williams, Nicole Beharie, Karla Souza, and Guy Burnet.

<text>Ernesto Beckmann Geisel (, ; 3 August 1907 – 12 September 1996) was a Brazilian Army officer and politician, who served as the 29th president of Brazil from 1974 to 1979, during the Brazilian military dictatorship.

Born to German Lutheran immigrants, Geisel attended military prep schools from an early age. He then moved to Rio de Janeiro, graduating as an artillery officer from the Military School of Realengo, now the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras. He entered politics in 1964 when he was appointed Chief of the Military House under President Castelo Branco. He was part of the group of Castelo Branco&#x27;s military supporters who opposed Marshal Costa e Silva&#x27;s candidacy for the presidency. Castelo Branco promoted him to the rank of Army General in 1966 and appointed him Minister of the Superior Military Court in 1967. During the Emílio Médici government, he became president of Petrobras, while his brother, Orlando Geisel, served as Minister of the Army. Orlando&#x27;s support was decisive in Médici&#x27;s decision to select him as a presidential candidate. In 1974, he ran for president as the candidate of the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), with Adalberto Pereira dos Santos as his running mate. They won with 400 votes (84.04%) against the opposition ticket of Ulysses Guimarães and Barbosa Lima Sobrinho from the MDB, which received 76 votes (15.96%).

He assumed the presidency of Brazil on March 15, 1974. His government was marked by the beginning of political openness and a softening of the repression imposed by the military dictatorship, but he faced strong opposition from hardline politicians. Significant events during his tenure included the merger of Guanabara with Rio de Janeiro, the division of Mato Grosso with the creation of Mato Grosso do Sul, the resumption of diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, recognition of Angola&#x27;s independence, the signing of nuclear agreements with West Germany, the initiation of Brazil&#x27;s democratization process, the repeal of AI-5, and significant progress in the construction of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant.

In his post-presidency years, Geisel maintained influence over the military throughout the 1980s. In the 1985 presidential election, he supported the victorious opposition candidate, Tancredo Neves, which helped reduce military resistance to Tancredo&#x27;s presidency. He later served as president of Norquisa, a holding company in the petrochemical sector.

==Early life and family==
Ernesto Geisel was born in Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul province. His father was Guilherme Augusto Geisel (born Wilhelm August Geisel), a German teacher from Herborn who immigrated to the Empire of Brazil in 1883 at age 16. His mother was the homemaker Lydia Beckmann, born in Brazil in Teutônia, to German parents from Osnabrück.

In Bento Gonçalves, where Ernesto was raised, there were only two families of German origin (Geisels and Drehers), and most of the population was composed of Italian immigrants. Remembering the contact with the local Italian immigrants during his childhood Geisel described the cultural contrasts between the strict and rigorous education that his German parents imposed compared to the freedom and more relaxed way of life of his Italian friends had that he admired.

Geisel was raised in a Lutheran family, they belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil, and his grandfather was a priest. He claimed to come from a relatively poor family of lower middle class. At home, Geisel spoke German as well as Portuguese because his father, who spoke Portuguese so well that he became a teacher of that language, did not want his children to speak Portuguese with a foreign accent. As an adult, Geisel reported that he was able to understand German but could not write it and had some difficulty speaking it.

Geisel married Lucy Markus, the daughter of an army colonel, in 1940. They had a daughter, Amália Lucy (later a university professor), and a son, Orlando, from whose 1957 death in a train accident Geisel never completely recovered. His widow died in an automobile accident in March 2000.

==Military career==

Geisel along with his brother Orlando (1905–1979, who would be Minister of Army in Emílio Garrastazu Médici&#x27;s government), entered the army in 1921 and in 1925 was the first of his class when he graduated from the Military High School of Porto Alegre. He acquired higher military education at the Military School of Realengo, and graduated it in 1928 as the first in his class and joined artillery unit as an &quot;Aspirante&quot;. Promoted to lieutenant in 1930.

Geisel witnessed and participated in the most prominent events of Brazilian history in the 20th century, such as the Revolution of 1930, the Getúlio Vargas dictatorship of Estado Novo and its overthrow in 1945. Geisel was military attache in Uruguay (1946–47).

Promoted to brigadier-general in 1960, Geisel participated in the 1964 military coup d&#x27;état that overthrew the leftist president João Goulart. Geisel was an important figure during the coup and became Chief of the Military Staff of President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco from 1964 until 1967.

In 1964 he was promoted to Lieutenant-General and in 1966 to the highest 4-star General de exército rank. In 1969 he was made president of the state-owned oil company Petrobras.

==Presidency (1974–1979)==
In 1973, President Emílio Garrastazu Médici selected Geisel to be his successor as the president. There had been intense behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the hard-liners against him and by the more moderate supporters of Castelo Branco for him. Fortunately for Geisel, his older brother, Orlando Geisel was the Minister of Army, and his close ally General João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo the chief of Médici&#x27;s military staff.

At that time the president of Brazil was chosen by the military command and then approved by the Congress to keep up the appearance of democracy. However, since the pro-military party, the National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA), had an overwhelming majority in Congress, the military&#x27;s chosen candidate could not possibly be defeated. For the first time during the era of military rule, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) actually put up a candidate in the person of longtime deputy Ulysses Guimarães. When Guimarães accepted the nomination, he decided to run an &quot;anticandidacy&quot; for president, knowing that Geisel&#x27;s victory was a foregone conclusion. As expected, Geisel was elected by a vast majority (400-76, with 21 blank votes and six abstentions) and was inaugurated on March 15, 1974 for a five-year mandate.

===Economy===
During the Brazilian Miracle from 1968 to 1973, the Brazilian economy had grown at a rate of more than 10% per year, the fastest in the world. But due to the oil shock crisis in 1974, development fell to 5–6% per year. Because much of the country&#x27;s oil had to be imported, Brazil&#x27;s foreign debt began to rise. This strategy was effective in promoting growth, but it also raised Brazil&#x27;s import requirements markedly, increasing the already large current-account deficit. The current account was financed by running up the foreign debt. The expectation was that the combined effects of import substitution industrialization and export expansion eventually would bring about growing trade surpluses, allowing the service and repayment of the foreign debt.

President Geisel sought to maintain high economic growth rates, while dealing with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis. He maintained massive investments in infrastructure – highways, telecommunications, hydroelectric dams, mineral extraction, factories, and atomic energy. Fending off nationalist objections, he opened Brazil to oil prospecting by foreign firms for the first time since the early 1950s.

===Relaxation of dictatorship===

Geisel adopted a more moderate stance with regards to political opposition. Together with his Chief of Staff, Minister Golbery do Couto e Silva Geisel devised a plan of gradual, slow democratization that would eventually succeed despite all the threats and opposition from hard-liners. He replaced several regional commanders with trusted officers and labeled his political program &quot;abertura&quot; and &quot;distensão&quot;, meaning a gradual relaxation of authoritarian rule. It would be, in his words, &quot;the maximum of development possible with the minimum of indispensable security.&quot;. In 1974 elections opposition won more votes than before. However, the torture of regime&#x27;s left-wing and Communist opponents by DOI-CODI was still ongoing, as demonstrated by the 1975 murder of Vladimir Herzog.

In 1977 and 1978, the presidential succession issue caused further political confrontation between Geisel and hard-liners. Noting that Brazil was only a &quot;relative democracy,&quot; Geisel attempted in April 1977 to restrain the growing strength of the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party by allowing other opposition parties to run, thereby splitting the opposition vote. In October, he dismissed far-right Minister of Army, General Sylvio Couto Coelho da Frota, who had tried to become a candidate.

In 1978 Geisel had to deal with the first labor strikes since 1964 and electoral victories of the opposition MDB. In late December 1978 he announced the end of the authoritarian Institutional Act 5, allowed exiled citizens to return, restored habeas corpus and full political rights, repealed the extraordinary powers of the president, and planned the indirect election of General João Figueiredo as his successor.

In 2018, an unearthed CIA memorandum from 11 April 1974 sent by William Colby to U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger details the summary executions of over 100 &quot;subversives&quot; which were personally authorized by Ernesto Geisel himself.

===Foreign policy===

In his 5 years of government, Geisel adopted a more pragmatic foreign policy. Despite being a conservative and deeply anti-communist, Geisel made significant overtures towards the communist bloc. Brazil established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and socialist-led governments of Angola and Mozambique, signaling a growing distance between Brasília and Washington. Although both countries remained allies, Geisel was keen to seek new alliances and, more importantly, new economic opportunities in other parts of the world, especially Africa and Asia.

Brazil shifted its foreign policy to meet its economic needs. &quot;Responsible pragmatism&quot; replaced strict alignment with the United States and a worldview based on ideological frontiers and blocs of nations. Because Brazil was 80% dependent on imported oil, Geisel shifted the country from a critical support of Israel to a more neutral stance on Middle Eastern affairs. Brazil moved closer to Latin America, Europe and Japan.

The 1975 agreement with West Germany to build nuclear reactors produced confrontation with the Carter administration, which also scolded the Geisel government for abusing human rights. Frustrated with what he saw as the highhandedness and lack of understanding of the Carter administration, Geisel renounced the military alliance with the United States in April 1977.

<text>Hans-Ulrich Rudel (2 July 1916 – 18 December 1982) was a German ground-attack pilot during World War II and a post-war neo-Nazi activist.

The most decorated German pilot of the war and the only recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, Rudel was credited with the destruction of 519 tanks, one battleship, one cruiser, 70 landing craft and 150 artillery emplacements. He claimed nine aerial victories and the destruction of more than 800 vehicles. He flew 2,530 ground-attack missions exclusively on the Eastern Front, usually flying the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber.

Rudel surrendered to US forces in 1945 and immigrated to Argentina. An unrepentant Nazi, he helped fugitives escape to Latin America and the Middle East, and sheltered Josef Mengele, the former SS doctor at Auschwitz. He worked as an arms dealer to several right-wing regimes in South America, for which he was placed under observation by the US Central Intelligence Agency.

In the West German federal election of 1953, Rudel was the top candidate for the far-right German Reich Party but was not elected. After the 1955 military coup d&#x27;etat that deposed constitutional president Juan Perón, Rudel moved to Paraguay, where he acted as a foreign representative for several German companies.

==Early life==
Rudel was born on 2 July 1916, in Konradswaldau, in Lower Silesia, Prussia. He was the third child of Lutheran minister Johannes Rudel. As a boy, Rudel was a keen sportsman and attended the humanities-oriented &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Lauban. He joined the Hitler Youth in 1933. After graduating with Abitur in 1936, he participated in the compulsory Reich Labour Service (RAD). Following the labour service, Rudel joined the Luftwaffe in the same year and began his military career as an air reconnaissance pilot.

==World War II==

German forces invaded Poland in 1939 starting World War II in Europe. As an air observer, Rudel flew on long-range reconnaissance missions over Poland. During 1940, he served as a regimental adjutant for the 43rd Aviators Training Regiment, based at Vienna.

In early 1941, he underwent training as a &quot;Stuka&quot; pilot. He was posted to 1 &quot;Staffel&quot; Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 (StG 2), which was moved to occupied Poland in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941. On 21 September 1941, Rudel took part in an attack on the Soviet battleship &quot;Marat&quot; of the Baltic Fleet. &quot;Marat&quot; was sunk at her moorings on 23 September 1941 after being hit by one bomb near the forward superstructure. It caused the explosion of the forward magazine which demolished the superstructure and the forward part of the hull. 326 men were killed and the ship gradually settled to the bottom in of water. Her sinking is commonly credited to Rudel alone, but Rudel dropped only one of the two bombs that sank her. Rudel&#x27;s unit then took part in Operation Typhoon, Army Group Center&#x27;s attempt to capture the Soviet capital.

Rudel&#x27;s gunner from October 1941 was Erwin Hentschel, who served with Rudel for the next two and a half years, both men earning the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross during that period. Hentschel completed 1,400 sorties with Rudel.

In early 1942, Rudel got married while home on leave. Later in the year, he took part in the Battle of Stalingrad. From May 1941 to January 1942, Rudel flew 500 missions. In February 1943, Rudel flew his 1,000th combat mission, which made him into a national hero. He then participated in the experiments with using the Ju 87 G in the anti-tank role. The anti-tank unit took part in operations against the Soviet Kerch–Eltigen Operation. The footage from an onboard gun camera was used in &quot;Die Deutsche Wochenschau&quot;, a Reich Ministry of Propaganda newsreel. In April 1943, Rudel was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, receiving the Oak Leaves from Hitler personally in Berlin.

Rudel participated in the Battle of Kursk with the same unit. On the first day of the German offensive, 5 July, he flew a Ju-87G, the first time one had seen action. It was a equipped as an anti-tank aircraft by having two 37 mm (1.46 in) &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 3,7 cannons mounted in under-wing gun pods. The concept was Rudel&#x27;s idea and proved very successful. On 12 July 1943 he claimed 12 Soviet tanks in one day. Ferdinand Schörner, a senior German general, commented &quot;Rudel alone replaces a whole division&quot;. The fighting was intense and Rudel was fortunate to survive, as the slow moving s were vulnerable and suffered a high casualty rate. In October 1943, Rudel was credited with the destruction of his 100th tank and was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (one of only 160 awarded) on 25 November.

Rudel was appointed &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; of III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; on 22 February 1944. On 20 March, Rudel performed a forced landing behind Soviet lines and he and Erwin Hentschel, his longtime gunner, made their way to the German lines. The men attempted to swim across the Dniester River but Hentschel drowned in the attempt. Upon his return, Ernst Gadermann, previously the troop doctor of III. &quot;Gruppe&quot;, joined Rudel as his new radio operator and air gunner. Rudel was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (one of only 27 awarded) on 29 March 1944, the tenth member of the Wehrmacht to receive this award. The presentation was made by Hitler personally.
Rudel was promoted to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; on 1 September 1944, and appointed leader of SG 2, replacing Stepp, on 1 October 1944. On 22 December 1944, Rudel completed his 2,400th combat mission, and the next day, he reported his 463rd tank destroyed. On 29 December 1944, Rudel was promoted to &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel), and was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the only person to receive this decoration. This award, intended as one of 12 to be given as a post-war victory award for Nazi Germany, was presented to him by Hitler on 1 January 1945, four months before Nazi Germany was defeated.

On 8 February 1945, Rudel was badly wounded in the right foot, and landed inside German lines as his radio operator shouted flight instructions. Rudel&#x27;s leg was amputated below the knee. He returned to flying on 25 March 1945. He claimed 26 more tanks destroyed by the end of the war. Over the course of the war he destroyed 519 Soviet tanks, flying 2,530 missions. On 19 April 1945, the day before Hitler&#x27;s final birthday, Rudel met with Hitler in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. On 8 May 1945, Rudel fled westward from an airfield near Prague, landing in US controlled territory, and turned himself in. The Americans refused to hand him over to the Soviet Union.

==Continued National Socialist activities==

While Rudel was interned, his family fled from the advancing Red Army and found refuge with Gadermann&#x27;s parents in Wuppertal. Rudel was released in April 1946 and went into private business. In 1948, he emigrated to Argentina via the ratlines, travelling via the Austrian Zillertal to Italy. In Rome, with the help of South Tyrolean smugglers, and aided by the Austrian bishop Alois Hudal, he bought himself a fake Red Cross passport with the cover name &quot;Emilio Meier&quot;, and took a flight from Rome to Buenos Aires, where he arrived on 8 June 1948. Rudel authored books on the war, supporting the regime and attacking the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; for &quot;failing Hitler&quot;.

===In South America===
After Rudel moved to Argentina, he became a close friend and confidant of the President of Argentina Juan Perón, and Paraguay&#x27;s dictator Alfredo Stroessner. In Argentina, he founded the &quot;Kameradenwerk&quot; (lit. &quot;comrades&#x27; agency&quot;), a relief organization for Nazi war criminals. Prominent members of the &quot;&quot;Kameradenwerk&quot; included SS officer Ludwig Lienhardt, whose extradition from Sweden had been demanded by the Soviet Union on war crime charges, Kurt Christmann, a member of the Gestapo sentenced to 10 years for war crimes committed at Krasnodar, Austrian war criminal Fridolin Guth, and the German spy in Chile, August Siebrecht. The group maintained close contact with other internationally wanted fascists, such as Ante Pavelić and Carlo Scorza. In addition to these war criminals that fled to Argentina, the &quot;Kameradenwerk&quot;&quot; also assisted Nazi criminals imprisoned in Europe, including Rudolf Hess and Karl Dönitz, with food parcels from Argentina and sometimes by paying their legal fees. In Argentina, Rudel became acquainted with notorious Nazi concentration camp doctor and war criminal Josef Mengele. Rudel, together with Willem Sassen, a former &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and war correspondent for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, who initially worked as Rudel&#x27;s driver, helped to relocate Mengele to Brazil by introducing him to Nazi supporter Wolfgang Gerhard. In 1957, Rudel and Mengele together travelled to Chile to meet with Walter Rauff, the inventor of the mobile gas chamber.

In Argentina, Rudel lived in Villa Carlos Paz, roughly from the populous Córdoba City, where he rented a house and operated a brickworks. There, Rudel wrote his wartime memoirs &quot;Trotzdem&quot; (&quot;Nevertheless&quot; or &quot;In Spite of Everything&quot;). The book was published in November 1949 by the Dürer-Verlag in Buenos Aires. Dürer-Verlag (1947–1958) issued a variety of apologia by former Nazis and their collaborators. Besides Rudel, among the early editors were Wilfred von Oven, the personal Press adjutant of Goebbels, and Naumann. Sassen convinced Adolf Eichmann to share his view on The Holocaust. Together with Eberhard Fritsch, a former Hitler Youth leader, Sassen began interviewing Eichmann in 1956 with the intent of publishing his views. The Dürer-Verlag went bankrupt in 1958.

Discussion ensued in West Germany on Rudel being allowed to publish the book, because he was a known Nazi. In the book, he supported Nazi policies. This book was later re-edited and published in the United States, as the Cold War intensified, under the title, &quot;Stuka Pilot&quot;, which supported the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Pierre Clostermann, a French fighter pilot, had befriended Rudel and wrote the foreword to the French edition of his book &quot;Stuka Pilot&quot;, while RAF ace Douglas Bader wrote the foreword in the English version In 1951, he published a pamphlet &quot;Dolchstoß oder Legende?&quot; (&quot;Stab in the Back or Legend?&quot;), in which he claimed that &quot;Germany&#x27;s war against the Soviet Union was a defensive war&quot;, moreover, &quot;a crusade for the whole world&quot;. In the 1950s, Rudel befriended Savitri Devi, a writer and proponent of Hinduism and Nazism, and introduced her to a number of Nazi fugitives in Spain and the Middle East.

With the help of Perón, Rudel secured lucrative contracts with the Brazilian military. He was also active as a military adviser and arms dealer for the Bolivian regime, Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Stroessner in Paraguay. He was in contact with Werner Naumann, formerly a State Secretary in Goebbels&#x27; Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in Nazi Germany. Following the Revolución Libertadora in 1955, a military and civilian uprising that ended the second presidential term of Perón, Rudel was forced to leave Argentina and move to Paraguay. During the following years in South America, Rudel frequently acted as a foreign representative for several German companies, including Salzgitter AG, Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Focke-Wulf, Messerschmitt, Siemens and Lahmeyer International, a German consulting engineering firm.

According to the historian Peter Hammerschmidt, based on files of the German Federal Intelligence Service and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the BND, under the cover-up company &quot;Merex&quot;, was in close contact with former SS and Nazi Party members. In 1966, Merex, represented by Walter Drück, a former &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and BND agent, helped by the contacts established by Rudel and Sassen, sold discarded equipment of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; (German Federal armed forces) to various dictators in Latin America. According to Hammerschmidt, Rudel assisted in establishing contact between Merex and Friedrich Schwend, a former member of the Reich Security Main Office and involved in Operation Bernhard. Schwend, according to Hammerschmidt, had close links with the military services of Peru and Bolivia. In the early sixties, Rudel, Schwend and Klaus Barbie, founded a company called &quot;La Estrella&quot;, the star, which employed a number of former SS officers who had fled to Latin America. Rudel, through La Estrella, was also in contact with Otto Skorzeny, who had his own network of former SS and Wehrmacht officers.

Rudel returned to West Germany in 1953 and became a leading member of the Neo-Nazi nationalist political party, the German Reich Party (&quot;Deutsche Reichspartei&quot; or DRP). In the West German federal election of 1953, Rudel was the top candidate for the DRP, but was not elected to the &quot;Bundestag&quot;. According to Josef Müller-Marein, editor-in-chief of &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Rudel had an egocentric character. Rudel heavily criticized the Western Allies during World War II for not having supported Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. Müller-Marein concluded his article with the statement: &quot;Rudel no longer has a &quot;Geschwader&quot; (squadron)!&quot; In 1977, he became a spokesman for the German People&#x27;s Union, a nationalist political party founded by Gerhard Frey.

===Public scandals===
In October 1976, Rudel inadvertently triggered a chain of events, which were later dubbed the Rudel Scandal (&quot;Rudel-Affäre&quot;). The German 51st Reconnaissance Wing, the latest unit to hold the name &quot;Immelmann&quot;, held a reunion for members of the unit, including those from World War II. The Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Defence, Hermann Schmidt authorized the event. Fearing that Rudel would spread Nazi propaganda on the German Air Force airbase in Bremgarten near Freiburg, Schmidt ordered that the meeting could not be held at the airbase. News of this decision reached &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Walter Krupinski, at the time commanding general of NATO&#x27;s Second Allied Tactical Air Force, and a former World War II fighter pilot. Krupinski contacted Gerhard Limberg, Inspector of the Air Force, requesting that the meeting be allowed at the airbase. Limberg later confirmed Krupinski&#x27;s request, and the meeting was held on &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; premises, a decision to which Schmidt still had not agreed. Rudel attended the meeting, at which he signed his book and gave a few autographs but refrained from making any political statements.

During a routine press event, journalists who had been briefed by Schmidt questioned Krupinski and his deputy Karl Heinz Franke about Rudel&#x27;s presence. In this interview, the generals compared Rudel&#x27;s past as a Nazi and Neo-Nazi supporter to the career of prominent Social Democrat leader Herbert Wehner, who had been a member of the German Communist Party in the 1930s, and who had lived in Moscow during World War II, where he was allegedly involved in NKVD operations. Calling Wehner an extremist, they described Rudel as an honorable man, who &quot;hadn&#x27;t stolen the family silver or anything else&quot;. When these remarks became public, the Federal Minister of Defense Georg Leber, complying with §50 of the &quot;&quot; (Military law), ordered the generals into early retirement as of 1 November 1976. Leber, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), was heavily criticized for his actions by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) opposition, and the scandal contributed to the minister&#x27;s subsequent retirement in early 1978. On 3 February 1977, the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; debated the scandal and its consequences. The Rudel Scandal subsequently triggered a military-tradition discussion, which the Federal Minister of Defense Hans Apel ended with the introduction of &quot;Guidelines for Understanding and Cultivating Tradition&quot; on 20 September 1982.

During the 1978 World Cup, held in Argentina, Rudel visited the Germany national team in its training camp in Ascochinga. The German media criticized the German Football Association, and viewed Rudel&#x27;s visit as being sympathetic to the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina following the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état. During the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, he visited the German team at Malmö on 8 June 1958. There he was welcomed by team manager Sepp Herberger.

==Personal life, death and funeral==

Rudel was married three times. His 1942 marriage to Ursula Bergmann, nicknamed &quot;Hanne&quot;, produced two sons, Hans-Ulrich and Siegfried. They divorced in 1950. According to the news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, one reason for the divorce was that his wife had sold some of his decorations, including the Oak Leaves with Diamonds, to an American collector, but she also refused to move to Argentina. On 27 March 1951, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published Ursula Rudel&#x27;s denial of selling his decorations, and further stated she had no intention of doing so. Rudel married his second wife, Ursula née Daemisch, in 1965. The marriage produced his third son, Christoph, born in 1969. Rudel survived a stroke on 26 April 1970. Following his divorce in 1977, he married Ursula née Bassfeld.

Rudel died following another stroke in Rosenheim on 18 December 1982, and was buried in Dornhausen on 22 December 1982. During Rudel&#x27;s burial ceremony, two &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; F-4 Phantoms appeared to make a low altitude flypast over his grave. Dornhausen was situated in the middle of a flightpath regularly flown by military aircraft, and Bundeswehr officers denied deliberately flying aircraft over the funeral. Four mourners were photographed giving Nazi salutes at the funeral, and were investigated under a law banning the display of Nazi symbols. The Federal Minister of Defence Manfred Wörner declared that the flight of the aircraft had been a normal training exercise.

==Summary of military career==
Rudel flew 2,530 combat missions on the Eastern Front of World War II. The majority of these were undertaken while flying the Junkers Ju 87, although 430 were flown in ground-attack variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. He was credited with the destruction of 519 tanks, severely damaging the battleship &quot;Marat&quot;, as well as sinking a cruiser (incomplete and heavily damaged &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;), a destroyer (the ) and 70 landing craft. Rudel also claimed to have destroyed more than 800 vehicles of all types, over 150 artillery, anti-tank or anti-aircraft positions, 4 armored trains, as well as numerous bridges and supply lines. Rudel was also credited with 9 aerial victories, 7 of which were fighter aircraft and 2 Ilyushin Il-2s. He was shot down or forced to land 30 times due to anti-aircraft artillery, was wounded five times and rescued six stranded aircrew from enemy-held territory.

In 1976, Rudel attended a conference in the United States with various members of the United States military and defense industry as part of the continuous development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II; Rudel&#x27;s status as a highly decorated attack aircraft pilot and particularly his experience at destroying Soviet tanks from the air was considered relevant to a potential conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

==In fringe culture==
Rudel remained popular with the German far-right after his death, especially with the German People&#x27;s Union, the DVU, and its leader Gerhard Frey. Frey and the DVU established the &quot;Ehrenbund Rudel – Gemeinschaft zum Schutz der Frontsoldaten&quot; (Honour federation Rudel – Community for the protection of the front soldiers) in 1983 during a memorial service for Rudel. British holocaust denier David Irving was given the Hans-Ulrich Rudel Award by Frey in June 1985; he delivered a memorial speech on the death of Rudel.

<text>Estelle Axton (&quot;née&quot; Stewart; September 11, 1918 – February 24, 2004) was an American record executive and co-founder of Stax Records, along with her brother Jim Stewart.

==Biography==
Born in Middleton, Tennessee, Estelle Stewart grew up on a farm. Some of her earliest musical experiences came from playing the organ and piano in church, as well as playing in a quartet with her sister, father, and uncle. She moved to Memphis as a school teacher, married Everett Axton, and was working in a bank when, in 1958, her brother Jim Stewart asked for help to develop Satellite Records, which he had set up to issue recordings of local country and rockabilly artists. She convinced her husband that they should remortgage their house and, in 1959, joined Satellite as an equal partner. The following year, Axton and Stewart turned the Capitol Theatre, in a black Memphis neighborhood, into a recording studio and record shop, and began making hit records with predominantly black artists.

Satellite was forced to change its name in 1961 after it was discovered that a Los Angeles label already owned the title, and it changed its name to Stax, taking its name from Stewart and Axton&#x27;s surnames. Axton was actively involved with selecting and developing the artists on the label, who included Rufus Thomas, Otis Redding, Booker T &amp; the MGs, and Isaac Hayes. 

She sold her interest in the company in 1970. After a non-compete agreement expired, Axton formed Fretone Records whose biggest hit, &quot;Disco Duck&quot;, by Rick Dees, was licensed for distribution by RSO Records.

In December 2006, the Recording Academy announced that Axton would be honored with a Trustee&#x27;s Award as part of the upcoming Grammys.

Axton was the founder of the Memphis Songwriters Association in 1973, formed to foster the education and advancement of local songwriters.

Axton went on, with her friend Cordell Jackson, the founder of Moon Records, to work with the Music Industries of Memphis, later named the Memphis Music Association, to assist in the development of Memphis music as a global force once again. Their collaboration and guidance helped launch the first Memphis Demo Derby, the brainchild of the PR director Brett Hamilton, which was designed to present and showcase Memphis musical talent to A&amp;R reps, studio heads, producers and the like. The event was such a huge success, it continued for several years. Joe Savarin, the founder of the Handy Awards, and Wanda Freeman of Tenant Laboratories lent a hand in spite of public opposition. The MMA was the umbrella organization for all Memphis music and still exists today.

In 2012, Axton was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, along with her brother and Stax co-founder Jim Stewart.

Axton died on February 24, 2004, at Saint Francis Hospital hospice in Memphis. She was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery East in Memphis.
