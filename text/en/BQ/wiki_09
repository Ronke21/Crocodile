<text>An engineering society is a professional organization for engineers of various disciplines. Some are umbrella type organizations which accept many different disciplines, while others are discipline-specific. Many award professional designations, such as European Engineer, professional engineer, chartered engineer, incorporated engineer or similar. There are also many student-run engineering societies, commonly at universities or technical colleges.

<text>The Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration () is a senior minister in the Government of Ireland and leads the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. The Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration has overall responsibility for law and order in Ireland.

The current Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration is Jim O&#x27;Callaghan, TD.

He is assisted by two Ministers of State:
*Niall Collins, TD – Minister of State for International law, law reform and youth justice
*Colm Brophy, TD – Minister of State for Migration

==History==
From 1919 until 1924 the position was known as the Minister for Home Affairs. In 1997, the functions of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform were transferred to this Minister, and it was renamed as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a title which it retained until 2010. The minister held the title of Minister for Justice and Equality from 2011 to 2020. As of 2020, the position is known as Minister for Justice. This followed a transfer of functions to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

==Overview==
The Minister&#x27;s main areas of responsibility include:
*Implementing government policy and proposing new policy on crime, immigration, asylum, criminal and civil law reform and the criminal justice system in general.
*Implementation of government policy and proposing new policy in relation to national security (an area many countries assign to a separate &#x27;Home&#x27; or &#x27;Homeland Security&#x27; minister)
*Control and reform of the Garda Síochána
*Pardons (which are formally given by the President on the binding &quot;advice&quot; of the government, after proposal by the Minister for Justice - a rarely used power)
*Implementation of core elements of the Good Friday Agreement.

<text>Handa Island () or usually Handa, is an island in Eddrachillis Bay off the west coast of Sutherland, Scotland. It is and at its highest point. 

The island is of national importance for its birdlife and maritime vegetation, and is a Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and a Special Protection Area (SPA). Notable seabirds include guillemots, great skuas, puffins and razorbills. Handa also forms part of the North-West Sutherland national scenic area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland. 

A small ferry sails to Handa from Tarbet on the mainland and boat trips operate to it from Fanagmore. The island receives five thousand visitors per annum.

==Etymology==
The island&#x27;s name is of mixed Gaelic and Norse origin. The Norse name was &quot;Sandey&quot; meaning &quot;sand isle&quot; from . It was recorded in Joan Blaeu&#x27;s 1654 &quot;Atlas of Scotland&quot; as &quot;Ellan-Handey&quot; with the addition of the Gaelic &quot;Eilean&quot; (meaning simply &quot;island&quot;) and the Norse form having become &quot;Handey&quot; and ultimately &quot;Handa&quot; due to aspiration in Gaelic. MacBain and Haswell-Smith support the derivation of &quot;sand isle&quot;, although Mac an Tàilleir translates the modern Gaelic of Eilean Shannda as &quot;island at the sandy river&quot;.

==Geography and geology==

Handa is composed of Torridonian red sandstone and surrounded by cliffs covered with birds. In the north is a hill with two peaks, with the south and east being lower lying. The north and west have cliffs, and there are beaches in the south and east. The Sound of Handa separates it from the mainland and smaller islands around Handa include Glas-Leac to the south, Eilean an Aigeach to the north east and Stac an t-Sealbhaig to the north.

The Great Stac of Handa was first climbed in 1876 by Donald McDonald, a native of St Kilda, who crossed the 24m gap between the stack and Handa &quot;swinging hand-over hand from a rope&quot;. It was first climbed from the sea in August 1969 by Graeme Hunter, Hamish MacInnes and Douglas Lang. The height of the stack, which is one of the tallest in Scotland, is variously recorded as , &quot;about 107m&quot; and 115m. The nearby Stacan Geodh Bhrisidh
is high and was also first climbed by that trio in the same year.

==Flora and fauna==
Handa is noted for its birdlife, which includes puffins, razorbills and guillemots. The SPA designation lists six priority species: fulmar, great skua, guillemot, kittiwake, and razorbill. The breeding colonies of razorbills and guillemots on Handa are the largest in the UK, representing 11% and 9% of the total British population respectively. The arctic skua and kittiwake populations are also of national importance, representing &gt;1% and 2% of the British population respectively. Other birds at Handa include eider ducks and oystercatchers, and seals and otters can often be seen at Boulder Bay on the island&#x27;s southern coast. Dolphins, basking sharks and several species of whale regularly visit the seas surrounding Handa.

Handa is also of national importance for its maritime vegetation. The exposed cliff tops are home to maritime grassland species that can tolerate salt, such as thrift, sea plantain and &quot;Festuca rubra&quot;. In less exposed areas can be found herb-rich grasslands which support species such as Yorkshire fog, bluebell and Scots lovage. Heather and crowberry are also widespread across the island.

==History==
In the past the island was used as a burial place, and there are still the remains of a chapel in the south east, commemorated in the name Tràigh an Teampaill (Beach of the Temple). The use of Handa as burial place is thought to be due to the fact that wolves would dig up graves on the mainland so frequently that the inhabitants of Eddrachillis resorted to burying their dead on the island:

It had a population of 65 in 1841 but following the 1847 Highland Potato Famine the inhabitants emigrated to Nova Scotia. In some ways this is surprising, since it is recorded that the islanders had a fairly varied diet including oats, fish and seabirds, rather than depending heavily on a potato crop. The islanders had a parliament, similar to that of St Kilda, which met daily, and the oldest widow on the island was considered its &quot;Queen&quot;.

The island is now part of the Scourie Estate, owned by Dr Jean Balfour (until her 2023 death) and J.C. Balfour. The Balfours leased Handa to the RSPB for 25 years, however this lease was not renewed, because the Balfours wished a Scottish-based body to run the island; as a result the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) took it over. Under the SWT the island is managed by one warden and a handful of volunteers during the summer months.

<text>A bicycle-sharing system, bike share program, public bicycle scheme, or public bike share (PBS) scheme, is a shared transport service where bicycles are available for shared use by individuals at low cost.

The programmes themselves include both docking and dockless systems, where docking systems allow users to rent a bike from a dock, i.e., a technology-enabled bicycle rack and return at another node or dock within the system – and dockless systems, which offer a node-free system relying on smart technology. In either format, systems may incorporate smartphone web mapping to locate available bikes and docks. In July 2020, Google Maps began including bike share systems in its route recommendations.

With its antecedents in grassroots mid-1960s efforts; by 2022, approximately 3,000 cities worldwide offer bike-sharing systems, e.g., Dubai, New York, Paris, Mexico City, Montreal and Barcelona.

== History ==
The first bike sharing projects were initiated by various sources, such as local community organizations, charitable projects intended for the disadvantaged, as way to promote bicycles as a non-polluting form of transportation – and bike-lease businesses.
The earliest well-known community bicycle program was started in the summer of 1965 by Luud Schimmelpennink in association with the group Provo in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. the group Provo painted fifty bicycles white and placed them unlocked in Amsterdam for everyone to use freely. This so-called White Bicycle Plan () provided free bicycles that were supposed to be used for one trip and then left for someone else. Within a month, most of the bikes had been stolen and the rest were found in nearby canals. The program is still active in some parts of the Netherlands, e.g., at Hoge Veluwe National Park where bikes may be used within the park. It originally existed as one in a series of White Plans proposed in the street magazine produced by the anarchist group PROVO. Years later, Schimmelpennink admitted that &quot;the Sixties experiment never existed in the way people believe&quot; and that &quot;no more than about ten bikes&quot; had been put out on the street &quot;as a suggestion of the bigger idea.&quot; As the police had temporarily confiscated all of the &quot;White Bicycles&quot; within a day of their release to the public, the White Bicycle experiment had actually lasted less than one month.

Ernest Callenbach&#x27;s novel &quot;Ecotopia&quot; (1975) illustrated the idea. In the utopian novel of a society that does not use fossil fuels, Callenbach described a bicycle sharing system which is available to inhabitants and is an integrated part of the public transportation system.

To prevent thefts, bike sharing programs gravitated to smart card control systems.&#x27; One of the first &#x27;smart bike&#x27; programs was the &quot;Grippa™&quot; bike storage rack system used in Portsmouth (UK)&#x27;s &quot;Bikeabout&quot; system. The &quot;Bikeabout&quot; scheme was launched in October 1995 by the University of Portsmouth, UK as part of its &quot;Green Transport Plan&quot; in an effort to cut car travel by staff and students between campus sites. Funded in part by the EU&#x27;s ENTRANCE program, the &quot;Bikeabout&quot; scheme was a &quot;smart card&quot; fully automated system. For a small fee, users were issued magnetic striped &#x27;smart cards&#x27; readable at a covered &#x27;bike store&#x27; kiosk, unlocking the bike from its storage rack. Station-located CCTV cameras limited vandalism. On arrival at the destination station, the smart card unlocked cycle rack and recorded the bike&#x27;s return, registering if the bike was returned with damage or if the rental time exceeded a three-hour maximum. Implemented with an original budget of approximately £200,000, the Portsmouth &quot;Bikeabout&quot; scheme was never very successful in terms of rider usage, in part due to the limited number of bike kiosks and hours of operation. Seasonal weather restrictions and concerns over unjustified charges for bike damage also imposed barriers to usage. The &quot;Bikeabout&quot; program was discontinued by the university in 1998 in favor of expanded minibus service; the total costs of the &quot;Bikeabout&quot; program were never disclosed.

One of the first community bicycle projects in the United States was started in Portland, Oregon in 1994 by civic and environmental activists Tom O&#x27;Keefe, Joe Keating and Steve Gunther. It took the approach of simply releasing a number of bicycles to the streets for unrestricted use. While Portland&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Bike Project&quot; was successful in terms of publicity, it proved unsustainable due to theft and vandalism of the bicycles. The &quot;Yellow Bike Project&quot; was eventually terminated, and replaced with the &quot;Create A Commuter&quot; (CAC) program, which provides free secondhand bicycles to certain preselected low-income and disadvantaged people who need a bicycle to get to work or attend job training courses.

In 1995, a system of 300 bicycles using coins to unlock the bicycles in the style of shopping carts was introduced in Copenhagen. It was initiated by Morten Sadolin and Ole Wessung. The idea was developed by both Copenhageners after they were victims of bicycle theft one night in 1989. Copenhagen&#x27;s &quot;ByCylken&quot; program was the first large-scale urban bike share program to feature specially designed bikes with parts that could not be used on other bikes. To obtain a bicycle, riders pay a refundable deposit at one of 100 special locking bike stands, and have unlimited use of the bike within a specified &#x27;city bike zone.&#x27; The fine for not returning a bicycle or leaving the bike sharing zone exceeds US$150, and is strictly enforced by the Copenhagen police. Originally, the program&#x27;s founders hoped to completely finance the program by selling advertising space on the bicycles, which was placed on the bike&#x27;s frame and its solid disc-type wheels. This funding source quickly proved to be insufficient, and the city of Copenhagen took over the administration of the program, funding most of the program costs through appropriations from city revenues along with contributions from corporate donors. Since the City Bikes program is free to the user, there is no return on the capital invested by the municipality, and a considerable amount of public funds must constantly be re-invested to keep the system in service, to enforce regulations, and to replace missing bikes.

The modern wave of electronically locked bikes took off in France. In 1998 the city of Rennes France launched Velo a la cart using a magnetic card to release bicycles, which was operated by Clear Channel. Then the French advertising company, JCDecaux begain launching larger systems in Vienna (2003), Lyon (2005), and Paris (2007), among others. The Paris system captured the attention of the world and catalyzed steep growth in bikesharing systems around Europe, Asia, South America, and North America. In North America, the BIXI project (a portmanteau of the French &quot;bicyclette&quot; and &quot;taxi&quot; or &quot;bycyle taxi&quot;) launched by the City of Montreal in 2009. It garnered a sizable ridership and the city created the Public Bike System Company to begin selling the underlying infrastructure to several other cities, including Washington D.C.&#x27;s Capital Bikeshare (2010), New York City&#x27;s Citi Bike (2013), and London&#x27;s &quot;Boris bikes (2010)&quot;. The PBSC was privatised in 2014 and was later acquired by Lyft in 2022. Separately in 2018, Lyft had acquired Motivate, an operator of many BIXI-based systems. Meanwhile, the original BIXI system has been operated directly by the City of Montreal since 2014.

In 2016, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) launched Biketown, also known as Biketown PDX, a bicycle-sharing system in Portland, Oregon. It is operated by Motivate, with Nike, Inc. as the title sponsor. At launch, the system had 100 stations and 1,000 bicycles serving the city&#x27;s central and eastside neighbourhoods, with hopes to expand outward.

Bike share technology has evolved over the course of decades, and development of programs in Asia has grown exponentially. Of the world&#x27;s 15 biggest public bike share programs, 13 are in China. In 2012, the biggest are in Wuhan and Hangzhou, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bikes respectively.

As of December 2016, roughly 1,000 cities worldwide have a bike-sharing program.

==Categorization==
Bike-sharing systems have developed and evolved with society changes and technological improvements. The systems can be grouped into five categories or generations. Many bicycle programmes paint their bicycles in a strong solid colour, such as yellow or white. Painting the bicycles helps to advertise the programme, as well as deter theft (a painted-over bicycle frame is normally less desirable to a buyer). However, theft rates in many bike-sharing programmes remain high, as most shared-use bicycles have value only as basic transport, and may be resold to unsuspecting buyers after being cleaned and repainted. In response, some large-scale bike sharing programmes have designed their own bike using specialized frame designs and other parts to prevent disassembly and resale of stolen parts.

=== Staffed stations ===

; Short-term checkout

Also known as bicycle rental, bike hire or zero generation. In this system a bicycle can be rented or borrowed from a location and returned to that location. These bicycle renting systems often cater to day-trippers or tourists. This system is also used by cycling schools for potential cyclists who do not have a bicycle. The locations or stations are not automated but are run by employees or volunteers.

Regional programs have been implemented where numerous renting locations are set up at railway stations and at local businesses (usually restaurants, museums and hotels) creating a network of locations where bicycles can be borrowed from and returned (e.g. ZweiRad FreiRad with at times 50 locations). In this kind of network for example a railway station master can allocate a bicycle to a user that then returns it at a different location, for example a hotel. Some such systems require paying a fee, and some do not. Usually the user will be registered or a deposit will be left by the renting facility. The EnCicla Bike Share System in Medellín on its inception in 2011 had 6 staffed locations. It later grew to 32 automatic and 19 staffed stations making it a hybrid between a zero generation and third generation system.
;Long-term checkout

Sometimes known as bike library systems, these bicycles may be lent free of charge, for a refundable deposit, or for a small fee. A bicycle is checked out to one person who will typically keep it for several months, and is encouraged or obliged to lock it between uses. A disadvantage is a lower usage frequency, around three uses per day on average as compared to 2 to 15 uses per day typically experienced with other bike-sharing schemes. Advantages of long-term use include rider familiarity with the bicycle, and constant, instant readiness.

The bicycle can be checked out like a library book, a liability waiver can be collected at check-out, and the bike can be returned any time. For each trip, a Library Bike user can choose the bike instead of a car, thus lowering car usage. The long-term rental system generally results in fewer repair costs to the scheme administrator, as riders are incentivised to obtain minor maintenance in order to keep the bike in running order during the long rental period. Most of the long-term systems implemented to date are funded solely through charitable donations of second-hand bicycles, using unpaid volunteer labour to maintain and administer the bicycle fleet. While reducing or eliminating the need for public funding, such a scheme imposes an outer limit to program expansion. The Arcata Bike Library, in California, has loaned over 4000 bicycles using this system.

===White bikes===

Also known as free bikes, unregulated or first generation. In this type of programme the bicycles are simply released into a city or given area for use by anyone. In some cases, such as a university campus, the bicycles are only designated for use within certain boundaries. Users are expected to leave the bike unlocked in a public area once they reach their destination. Depending on the quantity of bicycles in the system availability of such bicycles can suffer because the bikes are not required to be returned to a centralised station. Such a system can also suffer under distribution problems where many bicycles end up in a valley of a city but few are found on the hills of a city. Since parked and unlocked bikes may be taken by another user at any time, the original rider might have to find an alternative transport for the return trip. This system does away with the cost of having a person allocating a vehicle to a user and it is the system with the lowest &quot;hemmschwelle&quot; or psychological barrier for a potential user. However, bicycle sharing programs without locks, user identification, and security deposits have also historically suffered loss rates from theft and vandalism. Many initiatives have been abandoned after a few years (e.g. Portland&#x27;s Yellow Bike Project was abandoned after 3 years), while others have been successful for decades (e.g. Austin&#x27;s Yellow Bike Project active since 1997). Most of these systems are based around volunteer work and are supported by municipalities. Bicycle repair and maintenance are done by a volunteer project or from the municipality contracted operator but also can be, and sometimes is, completed by individual users who find a defect on a free bike.

===Coin deposit stations===

Also known as &quot;Bycykel&quot; or as second generation, this system was developed by Morten Sadolin and Ole Wessung of Copenhagen after both were victims of bicycle theft one night in 1989. They envisioned a freely available bicycle sharing system that would encourage spontaneous usage and also reduce bicycle theft. The bicycles, designed for intense utilitarian use with solid rubber tires and wheels with advertising plates, have a slot into which a shopping cart return key can be pushed. A coin (in most versions a 20 DKK or 2 EUR coin) needs to be pushed into the slot to unlock the bike from the station. The bicycle can thus be borrowed free of charge and for an unlimited time and the deposit coin can be retrieved by returning the bicycle to a station again. Since the deposit is a fraction of the bike&#x27;s cost, and user is not registered this can be vulnerable to theft and vandalism. However, the distinct &quot;Bycykel&quot; design, well known to the public and to the law authorities does deter misuse to a degree. Implemented systems usually have a zone or area where it is allowed to drive in. The first coin deposit (small) systems were launched in 1991 in Farsø and Grenå, Denmark, and in 1993 in Nakskov, Denmark with 26 bikes and 4 stations. In 1995 the first large-scale 800 bike strong second generation bike-sharing program was launched in Copenhagen as Bycyklen. The system was further introduced in Helsinki (2000–2010) and Vienna in (2002) and in Aarhus 2003.

===Automated stations===

Also known as docking stations bicycle-sharing, or membership bicycles or third generation consist of bicycles that can be borrowed or rented from an automated station or &quot;docking stations&quot; or &quot;docks&quot; and can be returned at another station belonging to the same system. The docking stations are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control. Individuals registered with the program identify themselves with their membership card (or by a smart card, via cell phone, or other methods) at any of the hubs to check out a bicycle for a short period of time, usually three hours or less. In many schemes the first half-hour is free. In recent years, in an effort to reduce losses from theft and vandalism, many bike-sharing schemes now require a user to provide a monetary deposit or other security, or to become a paid subscriber. The individual is responsible for any damage or loss until the bike is returned to another hub and checked in.

Some cities allow to use the same card as for bus and rail transport to unlocks the bicycles.

This system was developed as &quot;Public Velo&quot; by Hellmut Slachta and Paul Brandstätter from 1990 to 1992, and first implemented in 1996 by the University of Portsmouth and Portsmouth City Council as &quot;Bikeabout&quot; with a magnetic card used by the students and on 6 June 1998 in Rennes as &quot;LE vélo STAR&quot;, a public city network with 200 bikes, 25 stations and electronic identification of the bikes or in Oslo in 2001. The smart card contactless technology was experimented in Vienna (Citybike Wien) and implemented at a large scale in 2005 in Lyon (Vélo&#x27;v) and in 2007 in Paris (Vélib&#x27;). Since then over 1000 bicycle sharing system of this generation have been launched. The countries with the most dock based systems are Spain (132), Italy (104), and China (79). , public bike share systems were available in 50 countries on five continents, including 712 cities, operating approximately 806,200 bicycles at 37,500 stations. , the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. By 2013, China had a combined fleet of 650,000 public bikes.

This bicycle-sharing system saves the labour costs of staffed stations (zero generation), reduces vandalism and theft compared to first and second generation systems by registering users but requires a higher investment for infrastructure compared to fourth generation &quot;dockless&quot; bikes. Third generation systems also allow adapting docking stations as recharging stations for E-bike sharing.

===Dockless bikes===

Also known as Call a Bike, free floating bike or fourth generation, the dockless bike hire systems consist of a bicycle with a lock that is usually integrated onto the frame and does not require a docking station. The earliest versions of this system consisted of &quot;for-rent-bicycles&quot; that were locked with combination locks and that could be unlocked by a registered user by calling the vendor to receive the combination to unlock the bicycle. The user would then call the vendor a second time to communicate where the bicycle had been parked and locked. This system was further developed by Deutsche Bahn in 1998 to incorporate a digital authentication codes (that changes) to automatically lock and unlock bikes. Deutsche Bahn launched Call a Bike in 2000, enabling users to unlock via SMS or telephone call, and more recently with an app. Recent technological and operational improvements by telephones and GPSs have paved the way for dramatic increase of this type of private app driven &quot;dockless&quot; bicycle-sharing system. In particular in China, Ofo and Mobike have become the world&#x27;s largest bike share operators with millions of bikes spread over 100 cities. Today dockless bike shares are designed whereby a user need not return the bike to a kiosk or station; rather, the next user can find it by GPS. Over 30 private companies have started operating in China. However, the rapid growth vastly outpaced immediate demand and overwhelmed Chinese cities, where infrastructure and regulations were not prepared to handle a sudden flood of millions of shared bicycles.

Not needing docking stations that may require city planning and building permissions, the system spread rapidly on a global scale. At times &quot;dockless bike-sharing systems&quot; have been criticized as &quot;rogue&quot; systems instituted without respect for local authorities. In many cities entrepreneurial companies have independently introduced this system, despite a lack of adequate parking facilities. City officials lack regulation experience for this mode of transportation and social habits have not developed either. In some jurisdictions, authorities have confiscated &quot;rogue&quot; dockless bicycles that are improperly parked for potentially blocking pedestrian traffic on sidewalks and in other cases new laws have been introduced to regulate the shared bikes.

In some cities Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s Call a Bike has &quot;Call a Bike fix&quot; system, which has fixed docking stations versus the &quot;flex&quot; dockless version, some systems are combined into a hybrid of third and fourth generation systems. Some Nextbike systems are also a 3rd and 4th generation hybrid. With the arrival of dockless bike shares, there were in 2017 over 70 private dockless bikeshares operating a combined fleet of 16 million share bikes according to estimates of Ministry of Transport of China. Beijing alone has 2.35 million share bikes from 15 companies.

In the United States, many major metropolitan areas are experimenting with dockless bikeshare systems, which have been popular with commuters but subject to complaints about illegal parking.

== Goals ==
People use bike-share for various reasons. Cost and time are primary motivators for using bike-sharing programs, in particular the perceived cost of travel and time saved traveling. Some who would otherwise use their own bicycle have concerns about theft, vandalism, parking, storage, and maintenance.

=== Sustainable alternative for short trips ===

Most large-scale urban bike sharing programmes have numerous bike check-out stations, and operate much like public transit systems, catering to tourists and visitors as well as local residents. Their central concept is to provide free or affordable access to bicycles for short-distance trips in an urban area as an alternative to private vehicles, thereby reducing congestion, noise, and air pollution. According to research in 2016, the bike sharing system in Shanghai saved 8,358 tonnes of petrol and decreased carbon dioxide and NOx emissions by 25,240 and 64 tonnes, respectively. The research also stated that bike sharing system has great potential to reduce energy consumption and emissions based on its rapid development.

=== Last mile problem ===
Bicycle-sharing systems have also been cited as a way to solve the &quot;last mile&quot; problem of public transit networks. According to a research conducted on YouBike system in Taipei, on 2014, the bike sharing system in residential area are more popular, and as a first/last mile of transport mode to and from the station to their desired locations. However, dock systems, serving only stations, resemble public transit and have therefore been criticized as less convenient than a privately owned bicycle used door-to-door.

==Operation==

Bicycle-sharing systems are an economic good, and are generally classified as a private good due to their excludable and rivalrous nature. While some bicycle-sharing systems are free, most require some user fee or subscription, thus excluding the good to paying consumers. Bicycle-sharing systems also provide a discrete and limited number of bikes, whose distribution can vary throughout a city. One person&#x27;s usage of the good diminishes the ability of others to use the same good. Nonetheless, the hope of many cities is to partner with bike-share companies to provide something close to a public good. Public good status may be achieved if the service is free to consumers and there are a sufficient number of bicycles such that one person&#x27;s usage does not encroach upon another&#x27;s use of the good.

===Partnership with public transport sector===
In a national-level programme that combines a typical rental system with several of the above system types, a passenger railway operator or infrastructure manager partners with a national cycling organisation and others to create a system closely connected with public transport. These programmes usually allow for a longer rental time of up to 24 or 48 hours, as well as tourists and round trips. In some German cities the national rail company offers a bike rental service called Call a Bike.

In Guangzhou, China, the privately operated Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit system includes cycle lanes, and a public bicycle system.

In some cases, like Santander Cycles in London, the bicycle sharing system is owned by the public transport authority itself.

In other cases, like YouBike in Taipei, Taiwan, the bicycle sharing system is built by a private company partner with the public transport sector through BOT mode. To be more specific in this case, it is offered by the Taipei City Department of Transportation in a BOT collaboration with local manufacturer Giant Bicycles.

=== Partnership with other modes of public transport ===
In many cities over the world, bike sharing system is connected to other public transportation. It is usually hoped to complement the shortcomings in the greater public transport system. Sometimes, in order to encourage residents to use public transport system, local government will give discount on transferring between bike sharing system and other public transports.

==== Medellin ====

The city of Medellin is home to 3.4 million inhabitants in 173 km2 and has long faced infrastructural mobility challenges. EnCicla is a bike sharing system in the city of Medellin (Colombia, South America). The bike sharing system is connected to other modes of transportation, such as the Metro.

In 2010, three EAFIT students (Lina Marcela López, José Agusto Ocampo, and Felipe Gutiérrez) developed the idea of the EnCicla bike sharing system as part of their final project. The implementation of the system was decided in operation in August 2012, with the subsequent pilot program confirming its prospects for success. EAFIT advocated for the city to lead the system. This was implemented accordingly, resulting in the inclusion of EnCicla in the agenda of the city of Medellin and its incorporation into the transportation network. In this regard, EnCicla consists of a mixture of shared, as well as separated, bike lanes on the roadway. In the first 3 months after the official launch, 15,700 bicycle rentals took place, with usage picking up sharply in subsequent months and years. In Medellin, an attempt was made to solve the demand problem with statistical analysis using historical data. The result of this analysis was the establishment of a heterogeneous bicycle fleet, with a minimum and maximum number for each station.

In total, in Medellin there exist more than 90 stations in 7 zones, with 13 connected to other transport systems. Since inception, more than 13 million bicycles have been rented by the approximately 9,100 active members. In this context, the most frequently used stations are located in the western zone, near universities and colleges. These stations are located near train stations, which means that there is a high volume of people. To use EnCicla, citizens must register on the official website. In general, the system can be used free of charge by anyone 16 years of age or older and is available from 5:30-22:00 during the week and from 6:30-21:00 on Saturdays. Local residents must register through EnCicla&#x27;s website prior to use, and tourists have the option of renting a bicycle using their passport.

The establishment of EnCicla in recent years has helped relieve the complex transportation system in Medelin. However, the repositioning of bicycles at stations results in increased CO2 emissions, which run counter to the environmental importance of the project. In parallel, various activities have been carried out to promote the establishment of the system. These include a program that gives people over 8 years of age the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills in cycling.

==== Taipei Metropolitan Area ====

YouBike, a bike sharing system in Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area, Taiwan, has automated stations near all Taipei Metro stations. The integration of YouBike stations and Taipei Metro aims at solving the &quot;last mile&quot; problem, thus improving transit accessibility and usability. It is hoped that YouBike could complement the shortcomings in the greater public transport. Commuters can check in or check out YouBikes near the metro stations to catch connections from the station to the destination.

===== Transfer Discount Offered for Commuters =====
Starting 30 March 2021, passengers renting a YouBike from any YouBike station in the Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area receive a discount of NT$5 when using their EasyCard to transfer between YouBike and Taipei Metro, local buses (except buses that charge by distance) or Danhai LRT within one hour. Plus, the trip is only eligible for a discount when the transfer is direct. Commuters shall not utilise other means of transportation, such as Taiwan Railways, Maokong Gondola, long-distance buses, Taiwan High Speed Rail, Taoyuan Metro, or taxis.

===== Transfer Behavior =====
According to the analysis of YouBike rental and its Taipei MRT (Taipei Rapid Transit System) transfer behavior from the Department of Transportation, New Taipei City Government, YouBike has already become an important feeder mode for metro commuters: up to 55% of the subjects (the commuters who ever utilise YouBike during September, 2015) transfer by YouBike before or after taking the Metro. Adopting the YouBike and MRT transaction data of EasyCard in New Taipei City in November, 2016, almost all popular YouBike stations can be found next to the Taipei metro stations. Furthermore, transfer analysis depending on the YouBike and MRT data indicates that, the transfer ratio of loyal users (who utilise YouBike more than five times per week) is up to 60%.

==== Seoul Metropolitan Area ====
Sharing bicycles in South Korea are called &#x27;Ddareungi&#x27; in Seoul capital area. Ddareungi is a sharing bicycle operated throughout Seoul. It is an unmanned sharing bicycle rental service that started pilot operation in 2014 and officially operated in October 2015.
The 1-hour pass for Ddareungi is KRW 1000(Approximate 1 USD), and to prevent theft, an additional charge of KRW 1000 per 30 minutes is charged for exceeding the usage time.

===== Transit Mileage =====
Transit Mileage is a benefit that can only be received by 365-day commuter pass users. If someone uses public transportation within 30 minutes of returning the bicycle, the mileage is accumulated. If it is difficult to travel by bus or subway, the section can be replaced with Ddareungi.

===== Bicycle Driving Ability Certification System Fee Benefits =====
Bicycle driving ability certification system requires completion of bicycle safety education, if a person passes both the written and practical exams, that person will receive certification and part of the Ddareungi usage fee can be reduced for two years.

===== QR Code Lock =====
From 1 March 2020, QR Code Lock was introduced as a method of renting and returning by recognizing QR codes. It is convenient because it can be rented or returned with a single scan by using a QR code-type locking device. When renting a bicycle, purchase a voucher from the bicycle app and scan the QR code on the bicycle to rent, and the lock is automatically unlocked and can be used immediately. It can return and rent a bicycle anywhere without going to a bicycle rental booth.

===== Sprout Ddareungyi =====
Existing sharing bicycles can only be used by those over the age of 15, so Sprout Ddareungyi, which can be rented from the age of 13 and older, has been launched in Seoul. The government released a policy for public bicycles with reduced size and weight compared to the existing Ddareungi bicycles so that even small-sized people, such as teenagers and the elderly, could use them conveniently.

The number of users of Seoul&#x27;s public bicycle &#x27;Ddareungi&#x27; has exceeded 3 million. It is used by about one in three Seoul citizens. General citizens have a high rate of use during commuting hours on weekdays, except on weekends, so after using public transportation such as Seoul Metropolitan Subway as well as Seoul Buses, when it is an ambiguous distance to use public transportation anymore, citizens use public bicycles near subway stations to move the most. In particular, considering that rentals and returns are made at rental stations near subway stations, citizens frequently use Ddareungi that are deployed in subway stations. To analyse, if the number of cases is classified based on the number of Ddareungi rental stations near subway stations in 2021, exit 1 of the Ttukseom Park area of Hangang Park, which is the most used in Seoul, is the first with 602 rentals, After that, Express Bus Terminal Station and Lotte World Tower&#x27;s Jamsil Station Exit 2 followed. It is analysed that the most frequently used Ttukseom area, exit 1, is usually used by citizens who enjoy leisure at Hangang Park except during rush hour.
==== Hamburg ====
The bicycle sharing system &quot;StadtRAD&quot; of Hamburg (Germany) was launched in 2009 and now includes 3,100 bicycles and 20 cargo bikes. The infrastructure includes 250 fixed stations distributed throughout the city. With the help of the app, it is possible to rent up to two bikes. For an annual fee of €5, the first 30 minutes of each rental are free. A total of 500,000 people are registered with the app.

&quot;StadtRAD&quot; is an integral part of the city&#x27;s mobility transition. The aim here is to reduce motorized private transport by strengthening Public transport, making it easier to switch between different modes of transport and developing the city into a bicycle city. To achieve this, the share of cyclists in total traffic should increase to 25%.

The administrative responsibility for implementing the mobility strategy is assumed by the Alliance for Cycling, which is assigned to the Authority for Transport and Mobility Change. Its task is to make the transport infrastructure bicycle-friendly by promoting the construction of bike and ride facilities, making subway stops barrier-friendly and expanding bicycle routes. In addition, it should be made easier to take bicycles on buses and trains, and traffic safety should be strengthened through traffic education in schools. Another focus is on the interconnection of the different mobility offers through the Switchh app. Citizens can switch between Carsharing, Motorized scooter or offers from the HVV by making reservations or bookings. The integration of &quot;StadtRAD&quot; is planned to take place in 2022.

For the practical implementation of the bicycle sharing system Stadtrad, the city has contracted &quot;Deutsche Bahn Connect&quot;. Deutsche Bahn Connect is committed to setting up and operating a public bike sharing system with fixed rental stations within the city boundaries.

In a study conducted by the University of Hamburg, users state that they use the Stadtrad mainly for leisure (55.9%) and regularly spend time in the city center (89.9%). The frequency of use is several times a month (24.9%) and several times a half year (24.9%). In addition, the study shows that the city bike has a positive image among users, they are largely satisfied with the service and recognize environmental and health benefits. Another study by the authors shows that implementing a green public service increases both perceived social and environmental value. Perceived social and environmental values have a positive influence on the user&#x27;s green attitude and intentions.

At the same time, however, the need for a reporting system for sharing systems is emphasized, which ideally should be standardized and comparable with other regions. Especially for outsourced projects, monitoring and control processes must be implemented to ensure consistent quality. This includes the use of advanced prediction models to balance the load effectively by forecasting bike-sharing activity and addressing underflow and overflow issues dynamically. In addition to the environmental benefits, financial and time constraints must also be considered in large urban planning projects. Hamburg has had increasing spending on bicycle infrastructure since 2011 and spent 15 million euros on it in 2017.

=== Partnership with car park operators ===
Some car park operators such as Vinci Park in France lend bikes to their customers who park a car.

===Partnership with car-share operations===
City CarShare, a San Francisco-based non-profit, received a federal grant in 2012 to integrate electric bicycles within its existing car-sharing fleet. The program is set to launch before the end of 2012 with 45 bikes. 

==Financing==
The financing of bicycle-sharing system have been maintained by a combination of fees, volunteer, charity, advertisements, business interest groups and government subsidies. The international expansion dockless bicycles in mid 2010s has been financed by investment capital.

===User fees===
User rent fees may range from the equivalent of US$0.50 to 30.00 per day, rent fees for 15- or 20-minute intervals can range from a few cents to 1.00. Many bike-share systems offer subscriptions that make the first 30–45 minutes of use either free or very inexpensive, encouraging use as transportation. This allows each bike to serve several users per day but reduces revenue. Monthly or yearly membership subscriptions and initial registration fees may apply. To reduce losses from theft often users are required to commit to temporary deposit via a credit card or debit card. If the bike is not returned within the subscription period, or returned with significant damage, the bike sharing operator keeps the deposit or withdraws money from the user&#x27;s credit card account. operated by private companies as is the case in most cities in China.

US

New York rental rates are among the highest in the world, as of the Citi Bike program&#x27;s launch in July 2012, but this is of course subject to change. The cost of annual membership in the US varies between $100 and about $220.

Europe

Bike riders shared in Europe usually pay between €0.50 to €1 per trip, and an average of €10–12 for a full day cycling.
===Volunteer work===
Many first and second generation bicycle sharing programs were and are community run organisations as &quot;Community Bike programmes&quot;, as done in IIT Bombay. Often maintenance and repair is performed by unpaid volunteers that complete this work in their own free time.

===Charity sources===
Charity fundraising drives and charitable organisations have and do support bicycle sharing programs, including Rotary Clubs and Lions Clubs.

===Advertisement revenue===
Second and third generation schemes in the 90s already prominently included advertising opportunities on the individual bikes in form of advertisement areas on the wheels or frame. Other schemes are completely branded according to a sponsor, notable example London&#x27;s bike share which was originally branded and sponsored by Barclays Bank and subsequently by Santander UK.

Several European cities, including the French cities of Lyon and Paris as well as London, Barcelona, Stockholm and Oslo, have signed contracts with private advertising agencies (JCDecaux in Brussels, Lyon, Paris, Seville, Dublin and Oslo; Clear Channel in Stockholm, Barcelona, Antwerp, Perpignan and Zaragoza) which supply the city with thousands of bicycles free of charge (or for a minor fee). In return, the agencies are allowed to advertise both on the bikes themselves and in other select locations in the city, typically in the form of advertising on stations or the bicycles themselves.

===Government subsidies===

Municipalities have operated and do operate bicycle share systems as a public service, paying for the initial investment, maintenance and operations if it is not covered by other revenue sources. Governments can also support bicycle share programs in forms of one time grants (often to buy a set of bicycles), yearly of monthly subsidies, or by paying part of the employee wages (example in repair workshops that employee long-term unemployed persons). Many of the membership-based systems are operated through public-private partnerships. Some schemes may be financed as a part of the public transportation system (for example Smoove). In Melbourne the government subsidises the sale of bicycle helmets to enable spontaneous cyclists comply with the mandatory helmet laws.

===Harvesting of user-data===
GPS traceable vehicle commute patterns and usage habits present valuable data for government agencies, marketing companies or researchers. Strong commuter patterns can be filtered out and potential transportation services (e.g. commuter bus) can be tailored to existing demand. Potential audiences can be better assessed and understood.

==Usage patterns==
Most bike-sharing systems allow the bicycles to be returned to any station in the system, which facilitates one-way trips because the users do not need to return the bicycles to the origin. Thus, one bike may take 10–15 rides a day with different users and can be ridden up to a year (as in Vélo&#x27;v in Lyon, France). Each bike has at least one rides with one unique user per day which indicates that in 2014 there were a minimum of at least 294 million unique bike share cyclists worldwide (806,200 bicycles × 365) although some estimates are much.

It was found—in cities like Paris and Copenhagen—that to have a major impact there had to be a high density of available bikes. Copenhagen has 2500 bikes which cannot be used outside the zone of the city centre (a fine of DKK 1000 applies to any user taking bikes across the canal bridges around the periphery). Since Paris&#x27;s Vélib&#x27; programme operates with an increasing fee past the free first half-hour, users have a strong disincentive to take the bicycles out of the city centre. The distance between stations is only in inner city areas.
in US, male users of bike sharing made up for more than 80% of total trips made in 2017.

A study published in 2015 in the journal &quot;Transportation&quot; concludes that bike sharing systems can be grouped into behaviourally similar categories based upon their size. Cluster analysis shows that larger systems have different usage patterns in different stations, whilst in smaller systems the different stations have similar daily utilization patterns.

==Global distribution of bike-sharing systems==

== Economic impact ==
Bike-share programs generate a number of economic externalities, both positive and negative. The positive externalities include reduction of traffic congestion and pollution, while the negative externalities can include degradation of urban aesthetic environment and reduction of parking. Furthermore, bike-share programs have pecuniary effects. Some of these economic externalities (e.g. reduced congestion) can be systematically evaluated using empirical data, and therefore may be internalized through government subsidy. On the other hand, &quot;nuisance&quot; externalities (e.g. street and sidewalk clutter) are more subjective and harder to quantify, and may not be able to be internalized.

=== Positive effects ===
==== Less traffic congestion ====
A primary goal of bicycle-sharing systems has been to reduce traffic congestion, particularly in large urban areas. Some empirical evidence indicates that this goal has been achieved to varying degrees in different cities. A 2015 article in &quot;Transport Reviews&quot; examined bike-share systems in five cities, including Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis. The article found that in D.C., individuals substituted bike-share rides for automobile trips 8 percent of the time, and almost 20 percent of the time in Minneapolis. A separate study on Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Capital Bikeshare found that the bike-share program contributed a 2 to 3 percent reduction in traffic congestion within the evaluated neighborhood. 2017 studies in Beijing and Shanghai have linked the massive increase of dockless bike shares to the decrease in the number of private automobile trips that are less than five kilometres. In Guangzhou, the arrival of dockless bike shares had a positive impact in the growth of cycling mode share.

==== Less pollution ====
Not only do bike-share systems intend to reduce traffic congestion, they also aim to reduce air pollution through decreased automobile usage, and indirectly through the reduction of congestion. The study on D.C.&#x27;s Capital Bikeshare estimated that the reduction in traffic congestion would be equivalent to roughly $1.28 million in annual benefits, accrued through the reduction in congestion-induced CO2 emissions. A separate study of transportation in Australia estimated that 1.5 kilograms of CO2 equivalent emissions are avoided by an urban resident who travels 5 kilometers by cycling rather than by car during rush hour periods.

Healthy transport

Bicycle-sharing systems have been shown to have a strong net positive health effect. Cycling is a good way for exercise and stress relief. It can increase recreation and improve sociability of a city, which make people live more happy and relaxed. The report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) point out that cycling also help preventing disease like obesity, heart disease (can reduce up to 82%) and diabetes (can reduce up to 58%). Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems has a positive effect on mental and physical health, which attract more people to use. (Demand increase)

==== Reduced car parking ====
Bike-share programs, especially the earlier services that required docking areas along urban streets, may encroach upon the space available for on-street car parking and other auto-centric uses. While some argue that this is a negative, it is generally considered a positive side effect, since it helps further the transition away from car-dependency.

=== Negative effects ===

==== Urban clutter ====
In some cities, the many dockless bike-share bicycles have cluttered streets and sidewalks, degrading the urban aesthetic environment and blocking pedestrian traffic. In particular, cycles on Chinese city streets have created sections of clogged sidewalks no longer walkable, and piles of illegally parked bicycles.
 Due to the vehicles being left in the public right of way, or abandoned obstructing pedestrians, the dockless vehicles have been called &quot;litter bikes&quot;.

Dockless cycles left randomly on public footpaths may impede access for wheelchair users and others who use mobility aids, and may be dangerous to people with visual impairments.

=== Pecuniary effects ===
As bicycle-sharing systems continue to grow and provide an affordable alternative for commuters, the relatively low price of these services may induce competitors to offer lower prices. For instance, municipal public transit organizations may lower prices for buses or subways to continue to compete with bike-share systems. Pecuniary effects may even extend to bicycle manufacturers and retailers, where these producers might reduce prices of bicycles and other complementary goods (e.g. helmets, lights). However, empirical research is needed to test these hypotheses.

=== Internalization of externalities ===
==== Public-private partnerships ====
In public economics, there is a role for government intervention in a market if market failures exist, or in the case of redistribution. As several studies have found, bike-share programs appear to produce net positive externalities in reduced traffic congestion and pollution, for example. The bike-sharing market does not produce at the social optimum, justifying the need for government intervention in the form of a subsidy for the provision of this good in order to internalize the positive externality. Many cities have adopted public-private partnerships to provide bike-shares, such as in Washington, D.C., with Capital Bikeshares. These partially government-funded programs may serve to better provide the good of bike-shares.

=== Dangers of over-supply ===

Many bike-share companies and public-private partnerships aim to supply shared bicycles as a public good. In order for bike-shares to be a public good, they must be both non-excludable and non-rival. Numerous bike-share programs already offer their services partly for free or at least at very low prices, therefore nearing the non-excludable requirement. However, in order to achieve the non-rival requirement, shared bicycles must be supplied at a certain density within an urban area. There are numerous challenges with attaining non-rivalry, for instance, redistribution of bicycles from low-demand regions to regions with high-demand. Mobike, a China-based company, has addressed this problem by paying their users to ride their bikes from low-demand areas to high-demand areas. Citi Bike in New York City has a similar &quot;Bike Angel&quot; program to give discounts and prizes to balancers.

Other companies such as oBike have introduced a points system to penalize negative behavior, namely, illegal parking of shared bicycles. Economists speculate that a combination of efficient pricing with well-designed regulatory policies could significantly mitigate problems of over-supply and clutter.

The Chinese bicycle-sharing market demonstrated the danger of oversupply in 2018. Companies took advantage of unclear regulations in the preceding years to introduce millions of shared bikes to the country&#x27;s cities. Users were not educated in how to use the systems properly and in many cases treated them as disposable, parking them anywhere. City governments were forced to impound the abandoned bikes when they blocked public thoroughfares, and millions of bikes went directly to junkyards after the companies that owned them went bankrupt.

==Health impacts==
A study published in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; reports observing an increase in cycling and health benefits where bicycle sharing systems are run. In the United States, bikesharing programs have proliferated in recent years, but collision and injury rates for bikesharing are lower than previously computed rates for personal bicycling; at least two people have been killed while using a bike share scheme.

There is also considerable evidence that bike-share programs must be adopted in tandem with city infrastructure, namely, the creation of bike lanes. A 2012 study published in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found that Toronto&#x27;s cyclists were 30–50% more likely to be involved in an accident on major roads without cycle lanes than on those with.

== Criticism ==
Despite their theoretical and observed benefits, bike-share programs have come under attack as their presence has grown throughout the world. Much of this criticism has focused on the use of public funding – concerned critics posit that the use of tax money for bike-share programs should instead be diverted towards other services that more residents use on a daily basis. However, this argument relies on a faulty assumption that taxpayer money is a significant source of bike-share funding. An analysis by People for Bikes, an organization that advocates for new and safe bike infrastructure, found that public investment in Salt Lake City&#x27;s Greenbike and Denver&#x27;s B-Cycle programs was significantly less than traditional public transit (e.g. bus or rail) in those same cities, on a per-trip basis. Both Greenbike and B-Cycle&#x27;s publicly funded subsidies amount to 10 percent or less of the total cost of one trip. In contrast, Salt Lake City&#x27;s bus and rail system (UTA) relies on 80 percent public funding for a single trip.

Other critics claim that bike-share programs fail to reach more low-income communities. Some efforts have attempted to address this issue, such as New York City&#x27;s Citi Bike&#x27;s discounted membership program, which is aimed at increasing ridership among low-income residents. However, around 80 percent of study respondents reported that they had no knowledge of the program&#x27;s discount.

A further criticism describes increasing discriminatory technical and organizational hurdles. In addition to registration—providing addresses—or security deposits—of money or bank card data—many systems require smartphones with certain operating systems and user accounts, usually by Apple or Google, or even a permanent or temporary mobile data connection for unlocking and returning the bicycles. Others offer the same functions via SMS, telephone, or a previously purchased chip card.

<text>In information geometry, the Fisher information metric is a particular Riemannian metric which can be defined on a smooth statistical manifold, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a smooth manifold whose points are probability distributions. It can be used to calculate the distance between probability distributions.

The metric is interesting in several aspects. By Chentsov’s theorem, the Fisher information metric on statistical models is the only Riemannian metric (up to rescaling) that is invariant under sufficient statistics.

It can also be understood to be the infinitesimal form of the relative entropy (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the Kullback–Leibler divergence); specifically, it is the Hessian of the divergence. Alternately, it can be understood as the metric induced by the flat space Euclidean metric, after appropriate changes of variable. When extended to complex projective Hilbert space, it becomes the Fubini–Study metric; when written in terms of mixed states, it is the quantum Bures metric.

Considered purely as a matrix, it is known as the Fisher information matrix. Considered as a measurement technique, where it is used to estimate hidden parameters in terms of observed random variables, it is known as the observed information.

==Definition==
Given a statistical manifold with coordinates formula_1, one writes formula_2 for the likelihood, that is the probability density of x as a function of formula_3. Here formula_4 is drawn from the value space &quot;R&quot; for a (discrete or continuous) random variable &quot;X&quot;. The likelihood is normalized over formula_4 but not formula_3: 
formula_7.

The Fisher information metric then takes the form:

: formula_8

The integral is performed over all values &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot;. The variable formula_3 is now a coordinate on a Riemann manifold. The labels &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; index the local coordinate axes on the manifold.

When the probability is derived from the Gibbs measure, as it would be for any Markovian process, then formula_3 can also be understood to be a Lagrange multiplier; Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce constraints, such as holding the expectation value of some quantity constant. If there are &quot;n&quot; constraints holding &quot;n&quot; different expectation values constant, then the dimension of the manifold is &quot;n&quot; dimensions smaller than the original space. In this case, the metric can be explicitly derived from the partition function; a derivation and discussion is presented there.

Substituting formula_11 from information theory, an equivalent form of the above definition is:

: formula_12

To show that the equivalent form equals the above definition note that

: formula_13

and apply formula_14 on both sides.

== Examples ==
The Fisher information metric is particularly simple for the exponential family, which has formula_15The metric is formula_16The metric has a particularly simple form if we are using the natural parameters. In this case, formula_17, so the metric is just formula_18.

=== Normal distribution ===
Multivariate normal distribution formula_19formula_20Let formula_21 be the precision matrix.

The metric splits to a mean part and a precision/variance part, because formula_22. The mean part is the precision matrix: formula_23. The precision part is formula_24.

In particular, for single variable normal distribution, formula_25. Let formula_26, then formula_27. This is the Poincaré half-plane model.

The shortest paths (geodesics) between two univariate normal distributions are either parallel to the formula_28 axis, or half circular arcs centered on the formula_29-axis.

The geodesic connecting formula_30 has formula formula_31where formula_32, and the arc-length parametrization is formula_33.

==Relation to the Kullback–Leibler divergence==
Alternatively, the metric can be obtained as the second derivative of the &quot;relative entropy&quot; or Kullback–Leibler divergence. To obtain this, one considers two probability distributions formula_34 and formula_35, which are infinitesimally close to one another, so that

: formula_36

with formula_37 an infinitesimally small change of formula_3 in the &quot;j&quot; direction. Then, since the Kullback–Leibler divergence formula_39 has an absolute minimum of 0 when formula_40, one has an expansion up to second order in formula_41 of the form
: formula_42.

The symmetric matrix formula_43 is positive (semi) definite and is the Hessian matrix of the function formula_44 at the extremum point formula_45. This can be thought of intuitively as: &quot;The distance between two infinitesimally close points on a statistical differential manifold is the informational difference between them.&quot;

== Relation to Ruppeiner geometry==
The Ruppeiner metric and Weinhold metric are the Fisher information metric calculated for Gibbs distributions as the ones found in equilibrium statistical mechanics.

== Change in free entropy==
The action of a curve on a Riemannian manifold is given by

:formula_46

The path parameter here is time &quot;t&quot;; this action can be understood to give the change in free entropy of a system as it is moved from time &quot;a&quot; to time &quot;b&quot;. Specifically, one has

: formula_47

as the change in free entropy. This observation has resulted in practical applications in chemical and processing industry: in order to minimize the change in free entropy of a system, one should follow the minimum geodesic path between the desired endpoints of the process. The geodesic minimizes the entropy, due to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, which states that the action is bounded below by the length of the curve, squared.

==Relation to the Jensen–Shannon divergence==
The Fisher metric also allows the action and the curve length to be related to the Jensen–Shannon divergence. Specifically, one has

: formula_48

where the integrand &quot;dJSD&quot; is understood to be the infinitesimal change in the Jensen–Shannon divergence along the path taken. Similarly, for the curve length, one has

: formula_49

That is, the square root of the Jensen–Shannon divergence is just the Fisher metric (divided by the square root of 8).

==As Euclidean metric==
For a discrete probability space, that is, a probability space on a finite set of objects, the Fisher metric can be understood to simply be the Euclidean metric restricted to a positive orthant (e.g. &quot;quadrant&quot; in formula_50) of a unit sphere, after appropriate changes of variable.

Consider a flat, Euclidean space, of dimension , parametrized by points formula_51. The metric for Euclidean space is given by

: formula_52

where the formula_53 are 1-forms; they are the basis vectors for the cotangent space. Writing formula_54 as the basis vectors for the tangent space, so that

: formula_55,

the Euclidean metric may be written as

: formula_56

The superscript &#x27;flat&#x27; is there to remind that, when written in coordinate form, this metric is with respect to the flat-space coordinate formula_57.

An &quot;N&quot;-dimensional unit sphere embedded in (&quot;N&quot; + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space may be defined as

: formula_58

This embedding induces a metric on the sphere, it is inherited directly from the Euclidean metric on the ambient space. It takes exactly the same form as the above, taking care to ensure that the coordinates are constrained to lie on the surface of the sphere. This can be done, e.g. with the technique of Lagrange multipliers.

Consider now the change of variable formula_59. The sphere condition now becomes the probability normalization condition

: formula_60

while the metric becomes

:formula_61

The last can be recognized as one-fourth of the Fisher information metric. To complete the process, recall that the probabilities are parametric functions of the manifold variables formula_3, that is, one has formula_63. Thus, the above induces a metric on the parameter manifold:

:formula_64

or, in coordinate form, the Fisher information metric is:

:formula_65

where, as before,

: formula_66

The superscript &#x27;fisher&#x27; is present to remind that this expression is applicable for the coordinates formula_3; whereas the non-coordinate form is the same as the Euclidean (flat-space) metric. That is, the Fisher information metric on a statistical manifold is simply (four times) the Euclidean metric restricted to the positive orthant of the sphere, after appropriate changes of variable.

When the random variable formula_68 is not discrete, but continuous, the argument still holds. This can be seen in one of two different ways. One way is to carefully recast all of the above steps in an infinite-dimensional space, being careful to define limits appropriately, etc., in order to make sure that all manipulations are well-defined, convergent, etc. The other way, as noted by Gromov, is to use a category-theoretic approach; that is, to note that the above manipulations remain valid in the category of probabilities. Here, one should note that such a category would have the Radon–Nikodym property, that is, the Radon–Nikodym theorem holds in this category. This includes the Hilbert spaces; these are square-integrable, and in the manipulations above, this is sufficient to safely replace the sum over squares by an integral over squares.

==As Fubini–Study metric==
The above manipulations deriving the Fisher metric from the Euclidean metric can be extended to complex projective Hilbert spaces. In this case, one obtains the Fubini–Study metric. This should perhaps be no surprise, as the Fubini–Study metric provides the means of measuring information in quantum mechanics. The Bures metric, also known as the Helstrom metric, is identical to the Fubini–Study metric, although the latter is usually written in terms of pure states, as below, whereas the Bures metric is written for mixed states. By setting the phase of the complex coordinate to zero, one obtains exactly one-fourth of the Fisher information metric, exactly as above.

One begins with the same trick, of constructing a probability amplitude, written in polar coordinates, so:

: formula_69

Here, formula_70 is a complex-valued probability amplitude; formula_71 and formula_72 are strictly real. The previous calculations are obtained by 
setting formula_73. The usual condition that probabilities lie within a simplex, namely that

: formula_74

is equivalently expressed by the idea the square amplitude be normalized:

: formula_75

When formula_70 is real, this is the surface of a sphere.

The Fubini–Study metric, written in infinitesimal form, using quantum-mechanical bra–ket notation, is

: formula_77

In this notation, one has that formula_78 and integration over the entire measure space &quot;X&quot; is written as

: formula_79

The expression formula_80 can be understood to be an infinitesimal variation; equivalently, it can be understood to be a 1-form in the cotangent space. Using the infinitesimal notation, the polar form of the probability above is simply

:formula_81

Inserting the above into the Fubini–Study metric gives:

: formula_82

Setting formula_83 in the above makes it clear that the first term is (one-fourth of) the Fisher information metric. The full form of the above can be made slightly clearer by changing notation to that of standard Riemannian geometry, so that the metric becomes a symmetric 2-form acting on the tangent space. The change of notation is done simply replacing formula_84 and formula_85 and noting that the integrals are just expectation values; so:

:formula_86

The imaginary term is a symplectic form, it is the Berry phase or geometric phase. In index notation, the metric is:

:formula_87

Again, the first term can be clearly seen to be (one fourth of) the Fisher information metric, by setting formula_88. Equivalently, the Fubini–Study metric can be understood as the metric on complex projective Hilbert space that is induced by the complex extension of the flat Euclidean metric. The difference between this, and the Bures metric, is that the Bures metric is written in terms of mixed states.

==Continuously-valued probabilities==
A slightly more formal, abstract definition can be given, as follows.

Let &quot;X&quot; be an orientable manifold, and let formula_89 be a measure on &quot;X&quot;. Equivalently, let formula_90 be a probability space on formula_91, with sigma algebra formula_92 and probability formula_93.

The statistical manifold &quot;S&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of &quot;X&quot; is defined as the space of all measures formula_94 on &quot;X&quot; (with the sigma-algebra formula_95 held fixed). Note that this space is infinite-dimensional, and is commonly taken to be a Fréchet space. The points of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are measures.

Pick a point formula_96 and consider the tangent space formula_97. The Fisher information metric is then an inner product on the tangent space. With some abuse of notation, one may write this as

:formula_98

Here, formula_99 and formula_100 are vectors in the tangent space; that is, formula_101. The abuse of notation is to write the tangent vectors as if they are derivatives, and to insert the extraneous &quot;d&quot; in writing the integral: the integration is meant to be carried out using the measure formula_94 over the whole space &quot;X&quot;. This abuse of notation is, in fact, taken to be perfectly normal in measure theory; it is the standard notation for the Radon–Nikodym derivative.

In order for the integral to be well-defined, the space &quot;S&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) must have the Radon–Nikodym property, and more specifically, the tangent space is restricted to those vectors that are square-integrable. Square integrability is equivalent to saying that a Cauchy sequence converges to a finite value under the weak topology: the space contains its limit points. Note that Hilbert spaces possess this property.

This definition of the metric can be seen to be equivalent to the previous, in several steps. First, one selects a submanifold of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) by considering only those measures formula_94 that are parameterized by some smoothly varying parameter formula_3. Then, if formula_3 is finite-dimensional, then so is the submanifold; likewise, the tangent space has the same dimension as formula_3.

With some additional abuse of language, one notes that the exponential map provides a map from vectors in a tangent space to points in an underlying manifold. Thus, if formula_107 is a vector in the tangent space, then formula_108 is the corresponding probability associated with point formula_109 (after the parallel transport of the exponential map to formula_94.) Conversely, given a point formula_109, the logarithm gives a point in the tangent space (roughly speaking, as again, one must transport from the origin to point formula_94; for details, refer to original sources). Thus, one has the appearance of logarithms in the simpler definition, previously given.

<text>Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is a microangiopathic subgroup of hemolytic anemia (loss of red blood cells through destruction) caused by factors in the small blood vessels. It is identified by the finding of anemia and schistocytes on microscopy of the blood film.

==Signs and symptoms==
In diseases such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and malignant hypertension, the endothelial layer of small vessels is damaged with resulting fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation. As red blood cells travel through these damaged vessels, they are fragmented resulting in intravascular hemolysis. The resulting schistocytes (red cell fragments) are also increasingly targeted for destruction by the reticuloendothelial system in the spleen, due to their narrow passage through obstructed vessel lumina. It is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus, where immune complexes aggregate with platelets, forming intravascular thrombi. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is also seen in cancer.

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia may be suspected based on routine medical laboratory tests such as a CBC (complete blood cell count). Automated analysers (the machines that perform routine full blood counts in most hospitals) are designed to flag blood specimens that contain abnormal amounts of red blood cell fragments or &quot;schistocytes&quot;.

== Causes ==
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation
* HELLP syndrome
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
* Hemolytic uremic syndrome
* Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
* Cancer
* Malignant hypertension
* Scleroderma renal crisis
* Malfunctioning cardiac valves (called the &quot;Waring Blender syndrome&quot;)
* Kasabach–Merritt syndrome
* Insertion of foreign bodies
* Drugs (e.g. cancer chemotherapy)
* Snake envenomation
* others diseases: eclampsia, renal allograft rejection, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, scleroderma, and vasculitides such as polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, antiphospholipid syndrome

==Pathophysiology==
In all causes, the mechanism of MAHA is the formation of a fibrin mesh due to increased activation of the system of coagulation. The red blood cells are physically cut by these protein networks. The resulting fragments are the schistocytes observed in light microscopy
==Diagnosis==
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia results in isolated increase in serum bilirubin levels. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia above 15% is present. The differential diagnoses are rifampicin or probenecid use, inherited disorders like Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome and other hemolytic disorders. On peripheral smears, fragmented RBCs, burr cells, helmet cells and triangle cells are seen.

==Treatment==
Platelets and cryoprecipitate are contraindicated as they facilitate further clot formation and RBC lysis. Plasmapheresis is one treatment for TTP; corticosteroids should also be considered. {mcn}

<text>The Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies, also called the Scottish Darien Company, was an overseas trading company created by an act of the Parliament of Scotland in 1695. The act granted the company a monopoly of Scottish trade to India, Africa and the Americas, extraordinary sovereign rights and 21 years of exemptions from taxation.

Financial and political troubles plagued its early years. The court of directors was divided between those residing and meeting in Edinburgh and those in London, amongst whom were both Scots and English. They were also divided by business intentions; some intended to trade in India and on the African coast, as an effective competitor to the English East India Company, while others were drawn to William Paterson&#x27;s Darien scheme, which ultimately prevailed.

In July 1698 the company launched its first expedition, led by Paterson, who hoped to establish a colony in Darien (on the Isthmus of Panama), which could then be used as a trading point between Europe and the Far East. Though five ships and 1,200 Scottish colonists landed successfully in Darien, the settlement was poorly provisioned and eventually abandoned. A second, larger expedition (launched before the fate of the first was known) took up the deserted settlement, but was quickly besieged by the Spanish. More than a thousand succumbed to hunger and disease, and in April 1700, two ships carried the few survivors home.

In 1700–01 the Company sent further expeditions to Java and China, but suffered shipwrecks at Malacca and seizure of cargo by pirates at Madagascar.

==Founding==

On 26 June 1695 the Parliament of Scotland passed the (c. 10), &quot;Act for a Company Tradeing to Affrica and the Indies&quot;, establishing the Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies. The subscription book of the Company of Scotland was opened in Edinburgh on 26 February 1696, inviting investments from a minimum of £100 up to a maximum of £3,000. Such was the popularity of the scheme that on the first day alone 69 subscriptions were taken, worth £50,400. A second book was open in Glasgow between 5 March and 22 April. Although attempts to raise funds in London, Hamburg and Amsterdam had been blocked, by the beginning of August 1696 the full target of £400,000 sterling had been reached.

When the Company of Scotland was first formed, it was managed by its promoters, whose key task was to encourage subscriptions to the company. Once the subscription target of £400,000 sterling had been reached, however, the company required a more formal management structure. On 3 April 1696 a general meeting of subscribers elected a committee of twenty from their number to work with the promoters to establish rules and a constitution. By the middle of the month they had agreed that the company would be managed by a court of directors and a council general. The court of directors was to be an elected body with a maximum of fifty members, with each £1,000 of stock entitling its holder to one vote in the election. Twenty-five members would be elected by the subscribers, with up to a further twenty-five being elected by the first twenty-five. Subscribers with a holding of £1,000 or more could stand for election. A different director was to act as president of the court at each meeting. The first court of twenty-five directors was elected by shareholders on 12 May 1696. Candidates for election had to own at least £1,000 of company stock and so a limited number of shareholders, 119 out of a total of 1,320 (1,267 individuals and 53 institutions), were eligible to become directors. The court&#x27;s directors came from across Scotland&#x27;s wealthy classes, comprising two nobles, eight merchants and 15 lairds. Shortly afterwards, the first twenty-five directors appointed William Paterson and three others as additional directors. From July 1696 the court of directors met in the company&#x27;s offices in Mylne Square on Edinburgh&#x27;s High Street.

The council general was to be a larger body than the court of directors, comprising both the directors themselves and representatives of the remaining subscribers, with one representative for each £10,000 of stock. Whilst the court of directors was responsible for the day-to-day running of the company, the council general was convened to discuss major decisions, such as capital-raising, the election of future directors and the payment of dividends. The council general was only convened as and when there were matters to discuss, and therefore meetings were not held at regular intervals.

==Consequences of failure==
All told, the venture, dubbed the Darien Scheme, drained Scotland of an estimated quarter of its liquid assets and played a key role in forcing the country to the 1707 Act of Union which united the Kingdoms of Scotland and England. By 1707, the company&#x27;s debt was over £14,000 (). 

The new joint government, in a political bargain, agreed to cover the costs of winding up the Company of Scotland, in addition to compensate for servicing the English national debt and higher taxes for Scotland.

<doc id="488699" wikidata="Q109546559" url="?curid=488699" title="Talisman Timescape">
<text>Talisman Timescape is a 1988 expansion for the second edition of the fantasy board game &quot;Talisman&quot;, both produced by Games Workshop (GW).

==Description==
&quot;Talisman Timescape&quot; adds a new &quot;Timescape&quot; board to &quot;Talisman&quot; as well as eight new characters (Astropath, Chainsaw Warrior, Astronaut, Space Pirate, Cyborg, Space Marine, Archaeologist, and Scientist). This is only an expansion set, not a complete game — the &quot;Talisman&quot; game is also required for play.

===Contents===
&quot;Timescape&quot; contains these items:
* &quot;Timescape&quot; game board
* 42 &quot;Timescape&quot; Cards
* 12 &quot;Timescape&quot; Purchase Cards
* 2 Spell Cards
* 8 Character Cards
* 8 cardboard playing pieces. (These could be replaced by separately purchased 25mm metal miniatures produced by GW&#x27;s sister company Citadel Miniatures.)
* 4 &quot;Timescape&quot; Data Sheets
* 1 rulesheet

===Setup===
After setting up the main &quot;Talisman&quot; game board, the &quot;Timescape&quot; board is set out beside the main gameboard, along with the deck of cards and Purchase cards. The eight new characters are shuffled into the main character deck.

===Gameplay===
Players may enter the &quot;Timescape&quot; board by encountering a Warp Gate, via the Horrible Black Void (from the &quot;Talisman The Adventure&quot; expansion set), or by visiting special encounters such as the Enchantress or the Warlock.

Once on the &quot;Timescape&quot; board, characters do not move from square to square as with the regular game, but are randomly teleported (via a die roll) to a new area, always moving in a clockwise direction. Unlike the main game, players cannot encounter each other in the &quot;Timescape&quot;, even if they are in the same area.

==Publication history==
&quot;Talisman&quot; was published by GW in 1983, and became a bestseller. GW published a second edition, and then several expansion sets including &quot;Talisman Expansion Set&quot; (1986), &quot;Talisman The Adventure&quot; (1986), &quot;Talisman Dungeon&quot; (1987), and &quot;Talisman Timescape&quot; in 1988. &quot;Timescape&quot; was designed by Canadian Frank Bourque, who loosely based the areas and characters (such as the Astropath and Space Marine) on GW&#x27;s popular &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; game.

==Reception==
In the 2018 book &quot;Storytelling in the Modern Board Game: Narrative Trends from the Late 1960s to Today&quot;, Marco Arnaudo said of &quot;Talisman Timescape&quot; and other expansion sets, &quot;Given that the pleasure of playing &quot;Talisman&quot; was never in strategy and optimization but in trying on heroic identities, discovering things, and defeating enemies, the addition of such expansions greatly increased the entertainment value of the game.&quot;

<doc id="488702" wikidata="Q5633" url="?curid=488702" title="Vištytis (lake)">
<text>Lake Vištytis (, , ) is a lake on the border between Lithuania (Vilkaviškis district) and Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast), near the tripoint with Poland. 

The small Lithuanian town of Vištytis on the northern shore was named after the lake. In the west, the extended Romincka Forest stretches along the Russian-Polish border. On the Lithuanian side, the lake and its environs are part of a protected area named Vištytis Regional Park. The lake has 15 inflows, but only one river, the Pissa, tributary to Pregolya, flows from this lake.

Lake Vištytis covers an area of , of which belongs to Lithuania. This is a marked increase over that belonged to Lithuania before ratification of a Russian–Lithuanian border treaty in 2003. On occasion, high winds or broken equipment can force tourist boats to the opposite western shore. Even if unintentional, such incidents constitute illegal border crossings and can lead to sanctions from the border guards. Before the 2003 treaty, the border ran along the waterline of the beaches on the Lithuanian side, so anyone paddling in the water was technically crossing into Russia. Sometimes the lake is used for smuggling goods, usually cigarettes, across the border.

Prior to World War II the lake formed part of the border between the German province of East Prussia and Lithuania.

<doc id="488714" wikidata="Q568553" url="?curid=488714" title="Link (The Legend of Zelda)">
<text>is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nintendo&#x27;s video game franchise &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Link was introduced as the hero of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game in 1986 and has appeared in a total of 21 entries in the series, as well as a number of spin-offs. Common elements in the series include Link travelling through Hyrule whilst exploring dungeons, battling creatures, and solving puzzles until he eventually defeats the series&#x27; primary antagonist, Ganon, and saves Princess Zelda.

Throughout the series, Link has made multiple appearances in a variety of incarnations, but has been traditionally depicted in his signature green cap and tunic wielding a sword and shield. He has appeared as both a child and young adult of the elf-like Hylian race. Within &quot;Zelda&quot; mythology, Link is the soul of a legendary hero that throughout history is reincarnated within a seemingly ordinary boy or young man whenever evil arises. To defeat Ganon, Link usually obtains the mystical Master Sword or a similar legendary weapon obtained after completing many trials.

In addition to the main series, Link has appeared in other Nintendo media, including merchandise, comics and manga, and an animated television series. He is a prominent character in various spin-off games, including &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;, &quot;Cadence of Hyrule&quot; and &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;. He has appeared in several other game franchises, including the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, &quot;SoulCalibur II&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;, and has also been referenced in other games, such as &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;.

Alongside fellow Nintendo character Mario, Link is one of the most recognizable characters in the video game industry. He has been instrumental in the establishment of the role-playing video game genre as the protagonist of the series, which has influenced numerous other video games with its concepts of open world and nonlinear gameplay. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Link is the most critically acclaimed video game playable character and the most ubiquitous action-adventure video game character. He was recognized by the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; as the second best video game character after Mario. Critics have named him as one of the greatest and most influential video game characters of all time.

== Concept and creation ==
=== Characterization ===
Link&#x27;s creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, said that his concept of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was based on his childhood memories as well as books and movies that he and video game designer Takashi Tezuka had enjoyed, notably J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Miyamoto wanted people to have the opportunity to be heroes and created Link as a normal boy, with &quot;a destiny to fight great evil&quot;. On the origin of the character&#x27;s name, Miyamoto said: &quot;Link&#x27;s name comes from the fact that originally, the fragments of the Triforce were supposed to be electronic chips. The game was to be set in both the past and the future and as the main character would travel between both and be the link between them, they called him Link&quot;. In the Nintendo book &quot;Hyrule Historia&quot; he said that the character is named Link because he, &quot;connects people together&quot; and, &quot;he was supposed to spread the scattered energy of the world through the ages&quot;.

Link is the playable character who appears in every installment of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. Although there are many iterations of Link, each with a similar role and appearance, they are not the same individual. The series spans thousands of years in Hyrule&#x27;s history across &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; fictional timeline, so that each version of the character is a different Link, sometimes being a descendant of earlier incarnations or a spiritual reincarnation. In some games, such as &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, the same version appears in both, continuing that character&#x27;s individual story. &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, which was released in 2011, explained Link&#x27;s incarnations by creating an origin story, in which the antagonist Demise curses the hero to be caught in an endless cycle of defeating evil in the form of Ganon.

As no canonical game in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series to date has contained substantial spoken dialogue for Link, he is mostly a silent protagonist, but not a mute character. His voice acting consists only of grunts, battle cries, and other sounds, although in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, he can be heard saying, &quot;Come on!&quot; Despite lacking spoken dialogue, Link interacts with other characters through visual responses, such as nodding or shaking his head, reactions from side characters, or game text that expresses his dialogue. Series producer, Eiji Aonuma explained that a core aspect of Link&#x27;s design is that players need to relate to him and put themselves in his shoes, while still playing as themselves. Link is silent to allow the player to interpret how he sounds, make decisions for the character and become the hero.

=== Character design ===
Link&#x27;s character design has been consistent, but it has evolved across the series. His sprite design was created by Tezuka. In an interview with &quot;Gamekult&quot;, Miyamoto said that Tezuka used the Disney character Peter Pan as a source of inspiration when creating Link in order to make the character recognizable. Due to the limited capabilities of the technology at the time, the development team was only able to use three colours and chose green as Link&#x27;s signature colour, as the first game was mainly set within a forest environment. Link&#x27;s sword and shield, long hat and ears were all created to make the character easily distinguishable. For &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, Miyamoto said that the team started by designing a grown-up model followed by a child model, but realised that both could be used in the game, &quot;to tell the story of a boy growing up&quot;. Link&#x27;s teenage appearance in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was designed with the aim of making him more handsome, influenced by developer Yoshiaki Koizumi&#x27;s wife declaring, &quot;all of Nintendo&#x27;s characters have funny noses; don&#x27;t you have any handsome ones?&quot; Nintendo illustrator Yusuke Nakano said that Link&#x27;s design in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was based on a well-known American actor at the time of the game&#x27;s development.

Prior to &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; a cartoon version of Link was created by graphic designer Yoshiki Haruhana as a way to evolve the series, which was well received by the development team. According to designer Satoru Takizawa, this oversized anime-inspired design with huge eyes offered a richer variety of expression and provided a better way of representing the puzzles and mechanisms than a more photorealistic design. After many experiments, the development team had decided that cel-shading was the best option for expressing a young, energetic boy. Although the team loved the idea of basing the next &quot;Zelda&quot; game on a cartoon Link, Aonuma held off presenting it to Miyamoto until later in the game&#x27;s development. When he did view it, Miyamoto reportedly cringed, believing that the game would not sell, but the team insisted that there was not enough time to develop a realistic art style. Toon Link eventually carved his own identity into the franchise by appearing in multiple entries in the series and being introduced as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros&quot;. Aonuma said that despite some initial outrage, gamers began to accept Toon Link, so &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; and &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot; were created with a similar artwork style.

Following the response to &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, Nintendo reversed the art style for &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; in 2006, by depicting Link in a more realistic style with a darker, grittier tone. Nakano and Takizawa stated in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Art and Artifacts&quot; that they had planned to design him aged mid-to-late twenties and that he would be well built, but this was rejected because the team expected that fans wanted to see Link as he appeared in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. Aonuma explained that the design team wanted to express Link as an older teenager: &quot;The fact that we&#x27;re seeing Link on horseback and swinging a sword, I think that&#x27;s one more way in which Link has matured&quot;. In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, Link has the ability to transform into a wolf. Aonuma said that the design team considered the animal to be the best representation of a hero and that this function gave the adult version of Link limited human abilities, allowing him to mature over the course of the game.
Link&#x27;s signature green tunic and cap have evolved over the course of the series. At a Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Takizawa described the subtle changes made to Link&#x27;s outfit. For &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; he, &quot;made the hat long, so it would flap in the wind and move around&quot;, but for &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, he made it more diminutive and gave it less motion. The release of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; in 2017 broke the conventions of Link&#x27;s design, notably by the absence of his signature green outfit. Takizawa explained that &quot;as the graphic fidelity has increased it becomes more difficult to make that hat look cool&quot;. For &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; nearly 100 designs were considered to ensure that Link remained a neutral character. Aonuma commented: &quot;We thought that the iconic green tunic and hat had become expected, so we wanted to mix things up and update his look. Interestingly, though, nobody on the team said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s make him blue!&#x27; It just organically ended up that way&quot;. 

Link&#x27;s physical features have also evolved, influenced by trends in masculinity. His handsomeness has been defined by soft, androgynous facial features, a sharp nose and a slight build. His hair has been inspired by the fashion of the era, beginning with a mullet in the 1980s, then followed by blond curtain bangs and pierced ears in the 1990s, moving to choppy, layered side-swept bangs by the release of &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. His look was updated in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; to include a ponytail and a wide variety of outfits. Although Link is a male character, Aonuma said that he wanted him to be gender neutral in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;: &quot;I wanted the player to think &#x27;Maybe Link is a boy or a girl&#x27;. If you saw Link as a guy, he&#x27;d have more of a feminine touch. Or vice versa, if you related to Link as a girl, it was with more of a masculine aspect&quot;. For &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, he created a more masculine Link, but later decided to return him to a more gender neutral character. He said that Link is definitely male in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, but wanted to create a character to which anyone could relate.

=== Portrayal ===
Link has been voiced by eight actors in the series and also voiced in other games: Nobuyuki Hiyama in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; as adult Link, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; as Fierce Deity Link, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;, Fujiko Takimoto in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; as young Link, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;A Link to the Past and Four Swords&quot;, and as Young Link in &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, Sachi Matsumoto in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot; and as Toon Link in &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, Akira Sasanuma in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Link&#x27;s Crossbow Training&quot;, Yūki Kodaira in &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;, Takashi Ōhara in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, Mitsuki Saiga in &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; and &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; (2019), and Kengo Takanashi in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. Link was voiced by Yuki Kaji in &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;. In &quot;Cadence of Hyrule&quot;, he was voiced by Caitlyn Bairstow. In the cutscenes of the CD-i titles , he was voiced by Jeffrey Rath. On television, Link was voiced by Jonathan Potts in both &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; animated series and &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Link is the &quot;Hero of Hyrule&quot;, the archetypal hero and protagonist of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. Whenever a great malevolence threatens the Kingdom of Hyrule, typically in the form of Ganon, Link is the counterpart who is destined to fight that evil and restore peace to the people of Hyrule. He begins each game as either a child or young adult who is often lazy and unprepared for battle, but develops his skills and experience over the course of the game as the player upgrades his weapons and health. His story varies from game to game, but typically involves a similar thread of solving dungeon puzzles, saving Princess Zelda and defeating Ganon or some other evil. He displays the characteristic traits of the Hylian race, being of humanoid form with elfin features, including pointed ears. Since the first &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game, he has been repeatedly depicted wearing his characteristic green cap and tunic and typically wields a sword and shield. Link&#x27;s age varies across the series, starting the first game at ten years old and its sequel at 16. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, he is initially aged nine and is aged up to 16 after the game&#x27;s time shift. In &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, Toon Link is 12, whereas in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; and &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Link is aged 16 or 17 years old. 

In the mythology of the series, Link is the reincarnated soul of a hero, chosen by the goddess Hylia to protect the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon and save Princess Zelda whenever the need arises. He is also the bearer of the Triforce of Courage, one of the three components that combine to form the Triforce, a sacred artefact and symbol of power. The Triforce of Courage symbolises the essence of Link, specifically the courage and curiosity of the player setting out on the adventure. In several &quot;Zelda&quot; games, Link&#x27;s main objective is to recover the fragments of the Triforce in order to defeat Ganon.

Although Link can carry an arsenal of weapons, including bows, boomerangs and magic rods, his signature weapon is the Master Sword, a powerful magic sword with the ability to repel evil. Throughout each game, Link is able to obtain various items during his adventures, which the player can then use in gameplay. Many of these objects possess magical properties that bestow specific abilities on Link, such as a magic cape that makes Link invisible when he wears it, or potions that replenish his health. Others have various practical purposes, such as the hookshot, which enables Link to pull items towards him, and bombs for detonating walls. Link has used various musical instruments on his travels, most notably, the Ocarina of Time, which when played is used for teleportation. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Link&#x27;s key tool is the Sheikah Slate, a handheld tablet featuring various runes that enable him to manipulate the game world. A similar device named the Purah Pad provides Link with a multitude of functions, including a camera, map and telescope, in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Link&#x27;s relationships with the other two main characters have been a defining aspect of the series. Ganon, Zelda and Link embody the three pieces of the Triforce, with Ganon representing Power, Zelda representing Wisdom and Link representing Courage. This trinity dictates the enduring relationships of the three characters who are repeatedly reincarnated across the series in an endless battle for good and evil. The nature of Zelda and Link&#x27;s relationship has been the subject of speculation and remains ambiguous. A romantic relationship was particularly emphasised in an official &quot;romance trailer&quot; for &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Game Informer&quot;, Aonuma said, &quot;we wanted the player to feel like this is a person who&#x27;s very important to me, who I need to find. We used that hint of a romance between the two to tug at the heartstrings&quot;.

=== &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series ===

Link made his debut on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (1986) as an 8-bit 2D character within a flat environment viewed from a top-down perspective. He was depicted as a short, stubby character with brown hair wearing a green cap and tunic. During the game, he meets an old man who offers him a sword and declares &quot;It&#x27;s dangerous to go alone!&quot;. Link must rescue Princess Zelda and the kingdom of Hyrule from the evil wizard Ganon, who has stolen the Triforce of Power. He explores 128 areas of Hyrule and nine dungeons, which contain special items that help him to defeat each dungeon boss; he must defeat them all before fighting Ganon.

Link&#x27;s second outing, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; (1987), depicted him as a slightly taller 2D sprite wearing a similar green outfit. In the production art, his outfit was largely the same, but he wore brown trousers and longer hair. His shield was decorated with a cross, but this was removed in the games that followed. The game switches between top-down exploration and side-scrolling action sequences. Link&#x27;s combat capability evolved with the ability to stab up and down with his sword while jumping. Experience points gained by defeating enemies enable his health and attack power to be levelled up. A series of magic spells also grant him special abilities, such as extra defence. To complete the adventure, Link must defeat his doppelgänger Dark Link to awaken sleeping Zelda.

&quot;A Link to the Past&quot; (1991) recreated Link in a 16-bit colour palette for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with the unusual characteristic of pink hair. By contrast, the game manual depicts Link as a tall blond character. Link&#x27;s sprite was designed to appear more expressive, by featuring an animated hat and a face that turns red when pulling objects. The game reverted to a top-down perspective and features items that upgrade Link&#x27;s moves with extra abilities such as running and swimming. It introduced several recurring elements, including the hookshot and the Master Sword. Link&#x27;s combat abilities were developed to be more complex, giving him the ability to move diagonally, swing his sword in an arc and perform a spin attack that enables multi-directional attacks. His heart containers, which featured in the first game, were broken into pieces, necessitating the player to locate them and upgrade his health in smaller increments.

The first handheld title in the series, &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; (1993) on the Game Boy, introduced Link in monochrome until the DX port brought the game to the Game Boy Color. It takes place on Koholint Island after Link is washed ashore and features a combination of mostly top-down adventuring and some side-scrolling action sequences. It was the first overhead game in which Link&#x27;s move set includes the ability to jump. Link is depicted in an anime art style in the game&#x27;s cutscenes. The game involves collecting eight musical instruments from eight dungeons to wake the sleeping Wind Fish.
&quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; (1998), which was released for the Nintendo 64 (N64), was the first 3D game in the &quot;Zelda&quot; series. Link was depicted with blonde hair and his horse Epona was introduced as a mode of transport. The plot&#x27;s time shifts allow the player to control Link first as a child and later as a young adult. His green outfit reflects his role in the story as a Kokiri and his shield was updated to display the crest of the kingdom of Hyrule. His abilities were extensively developed to perform a variety of movements, including a swipe, stab, roll, dodge and dive. The game&#x27;s Z-targeting system enables him to lock on to enemies and circle around them in combat. Through a built-in autojump function, he can also jump from a ledge. During his adventure, he is accompanied by the fairy Navi, who gives him hints about enemies and his surroundings.

Link returned on the N64 with the release of &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; (2000). Appearing again as a child, he must save the land of Termina from the evil of Majora&#x27;s Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, threatening to crash into Termina&#x27;s Clock Town in three days. Link uses the Ocarina of Time to play the Song of Time, which allows him to repeatedly travel back in time to relive the three days until he successfully prevents the disaster. During the game, Link finds various magical masks that transform him into a Goron, Deku Scrub, or Zora, which each grant him special abilities such as gliding, swimming underwater and rolling. In the final boss battle with Majora, Link is transformed into Fierce Deity Link, a dark, adult version of himself with white eyes, before finally reverting to his child form.

In &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, a pair of interconnected games released in 2001 for the Game Boy Color, Link is controlled from a top-down perspective within a flat 2D game world. The two games involve Link being sent on a mission to the foreign lands of Holodrum and Labrynna in order to stop the disruption of the seasons by the General of Darkness, Onox, and the disruption of time by the Sorceress of Shadows, Veran. Link&#x27;s key tools for uncovering areas and fighting his enemies are the Rod of Seasons and his magic harp.

In 2002, Nintendo published &quot;A Link to the Past &amp; Four Swords&quot; on the Game Boy Advance. &quot;Four Swords&quot; was an original title packaged together with the rereleased entry &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. Diverging from the traditional single-player approach, &quot;Four Swords&quot; was based on cooperative gameplay, allowing four players to interact together by connecting four Game Boy Advance systems. In &quot;Four Swords&quot;, four Links of different colours appear, each of which is controlled by a different player. The four versions of Link must then work together to complete the game&#x27;s challenges.

&quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, which was released in 2002 on the GameCube, depicted Link and the game world in a cute childlike graphical style. He appears as a preteen cartoon character with a large head and huge eyes. His facial expressions communicate a range of emotions. The game involves exploring the islands that are dotted around the map to encounter characters and uncover dungeons. Link&#x27;s key tool is the titular Wind Waker, a magical baton that enables him to manipulate the breeze as he crosses the Great Sea. Nintendo artist Satoru Takizawa explained that the game&#x27;s sequel was abandoned due to being set on land and Toon Link&#x27;s proportions not being suitable for horseback riding.

&quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, which was published for the GameCube in 2004, again reinterpreted traditional &quot;Zelda&quot; gameplay with a multiplayer approach. The plot centres on Link being split into four versions of himself by the Four Sword, resulting in four Links of different colours. He must embark on a quest that involves rescuing seven princesses from an evil sorcerer. The game depicts the Links in a 16-bit top-down perspective and involves each player controlling one of the four Links to explore the game world and defeat enemies in order to complete each level.

The release of &quot;The Minish Cap&quot; in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance returned the series to a single-player format. Link appears as a child viewed from a top-down perspective and is tasked with saving his friend Princess Zelda. After a mysterious stranger arrives at a festival celebrating the coming of the Picori, he destroys the sacred Picori Blade and turns Zelda to stone. During the game, Link is accompanied by a magical talking cap named Ezlo, who helps him on his quest and teaches him to shrink to the size of the Minish.

&quot;Twilight Princess&quot; (2006) was released on the GameCube and Wii and offers a darker adventure to previous entries in the series. The game features a more detailed depiction of a teenage Link who appears ready for battle wearing chainmail beneath his tunic. In the early part of the game, he becomes trapped in the Twilight, which transforms him into a wolf. Throughout the game, he is aided by Midna, an imp-like creature, who rides on his back and helps him on his quest. The game uses a variety of animal abilities for progression, such as the ability to follow scents. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; aimed to provide a stark contrast to the cartoonish style of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, presenting a game world drained of colour and a story with a more mature tone. In addition to the teenage protagonist Link, the game also features the Link from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; as the teenage Link&#x27;s ancestor and namesake &quot;the Hero&#x27;s Shade&quot;, who trains his descendant to defeat Ganondorf.

A direct sequel to &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS. It follows Link as he embarks on a journey to save his friend Tetra. The game was designed to appeal to a wider audience, with 3D cel-shaded graphics and a light-hearted tone. It takes inspiration from the style and tone of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, with Toon Link displaying various humorous expressions. The game made use of the console&#x27;s touchscreen functionality, which enabled the player to control Link using a stylus instead of the traditional button controls.

Following on from &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot; (2009) reintroduced Toon Link to the Nintendo DS. The game is a sequel to its predecessor and has a similar format but replaces sailing by boat with travelling by train. Link must explore four main map pieces, return the power of the spirit tracks using the Spirit Flute, and navigate the Spirit Tower, the main labyrinth hub, aided by the spirit of Zelda. The gameplay also incorporates the mechanic of controlling both Link and Zelda in a series of cooperative puzzles and boss battles.

&quot;Skyward Sword&quot; was released in 2011 on the Wii and made use of the Wii MotionPlus to swipe Link&#x27;s sword, control a mechanical beetle, and ride his loftwing through the skies. The plot involves a romantic relationship between Link and Zelda. Beginning in Skyloft, a land floating above the clouds, Link is forced to descend to the surface after Zelda is kidnapped and then travels between the two lands wielding the Goddess Sword, a magical sword that holds a spirit named Fi, who acts as his guide. During his journey, Link imbues the Goddess Sword with three sacred flames and reforges it into the Master Sword. The game introduced Link&#x27;s stamina meter for climbing surfaces and sprinting, and the ability to craft materials to make new items.

&quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; was released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS and is a sequel to &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. The plot revolves around a sorcerer named Yuga who has the ability to merge into walls and turn people into paintings. Link must foil his plan to revive Ganon. The storyline is set within the same world as &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and was designed with a similar art style. Players are able to explore the two separate worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, which are reminiscent of the contrasting worlds of light and dark in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. The game introduced the ability for Link to turn into a painting, allowing him to walk along walls and switch between the two worlds.

&quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot; (2015) was the second original &quot;Zelda&quot; entry for the Nintendo 3DS and a departure from the series&#x27; tradition, with a focus on a three-player cooperative campaign. Link appears alongside two companions that can be stacked to reach high places, solve puzzles and defeat tall enemies. The storyline revolves around the theme of fashion and is set in the realm of Hytopia, where a witch has cursed Princess Styla to wear an ugly brown body suit. As a result, the Hytopian king calls for adventurers to break the curse. The gameplay departs from the usual &quot;Zelda&quot; open-world structure and involves completing dungeons and collecting materials to fashion outfits that provide specific abilities.

&quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; was released on the Nintendo Switch and Wii U in 2017 and reinvented the franchise by creating a massive open world for Link to explore. He has the ability to climb most surfaces, jump from structures and soar across the sky using a paraglider. He was designed to interact with the environment, collect materials for cooking and react to cold and heat. The complex nature of the environment also determined that his preexisting autojump functionality had to be developed into the ability to jump manually. The game introduced significant changes to his design, notably the absence of his signature green outfit. The player can instead dress Link in a variety of outfits and more emphasis is placed on using a bow as a prominent weapon.

Link appears in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, a direct sequel to the previous game released in 2023, which is set in the same version of Hyrule. Link loses his right arm after being attacked by a substance called Gloom and is saved by the spirit Rauru who grafts his own arm onto Link. This new arm plays a major role as the source of his abilities. It was designed to distinguish him from previous iterations, as the theme of &quot;hands&quot; was chosen as a key recurring aspect of the game for creating items as well as cooperating with other characters. Link&#x27;s abilities include the Recall ability, which rewinds an object&#x27;s movement, the Fuse ability, which merges objects to create new weapons, the Ultrahand ability, which enables the construction of vehicles, and the Ascend ability, which enables Link to ascend through ceilings. In the main quest line, Link also obtains Autobuild, which gives the ability to rebuild vehicles automatically without needing to manually build with Ultrahand.

&quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot; (2024) is the first mainline &quot;Zelda&quot; game to feature Zelda rather than Link as the player character. Despite being originally intended as the protagonist, Link was ultimately replaced by Zelda as Aonuma felt that his sword fighting skills were not compatible with the copy and paste mechanism at the core of the game&#x27;s echoes concept. The game begins with Link being playable in a sequence in which he saves Zelda from Ganon but is sucked through a portal into another dimension. Link makes numerous appearances throughout the game, both in real form and as an Echo mini boss. He also accompanies Zelda in the final dungeon and boss fight.

=== Spin-off games ===
In 1989, Link appeared in &quot;Zelda&quot;, which was released in the Game &amp; Watch series of handheld electronic games. The unit features a multi-screen liquid-crystal display (LCD). The lower display renders Link fighting against dungeon monsters, while the upper display features the inventory. The gameplay is simpler than the NES game and replaces Ganon with eight dragons that kidnap Zelda. After battling through a dungeon, Link must defeat a dragon on the upper screen to receive a piece of the Triforce, before freeing Zelda with the eight recovered Triforce pieces. In the same year, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; Game Watch was released, which was part of the LCD wristwatch product line licensed to and developed by Nelsonic Industries. In addition to its timekeeping function, the unit features gameplay based on the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game but without a storyline. It features Link adventuring through eight dungeons comprising four rooms in each.

He also appears in &quot;Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce&quot; (Barcode Battler II), which was released by Epoch Co. in 1992 in Japan but not in North America. It was developed for the Barcode Battler II console and involves swiping cards to unlock various characters from &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;.

Link appears in and &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; CD-i games published by Philips Interactive Media for its Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-i) players. While the games were licensed by Nintendo to use official &quot;Zelda&quot; characters, they were not produced or supervised by Nintendo. As well as being critically panned, none of these games are recognized by Nintendo as part of the series&#x27; official chronology. Unlike the main series, Link has the ability to speak. His personality mirrors his animated series counterpart in which he yearns for adventure and repeatedly attempts to get a kiss from Zelda.

Nintendo released a shooting video game in 2007 for the Wii titled &quot;Link&#x27;s Crossbow Training&quot;. It is set within the &quot;Zelda&quot; universe and features Link as a playable character holding a crossbow. The game revisits the world of &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and features the same landmarks and enemies. It involves the use of the Wii remote and nunchuck to create a light gun, which targets enemies with an onscreen reticule.

In the 2014 hack and slash video game &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot; another incarnation appears as a Hyrulian soldier-in-training who helps to lead the campaign against the forces of evil. Young Link from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; also appears in the game as a playable character via downloadable content, while Toon Link from &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; appears as a playable character in &quot;Hyrule Warriors Legends&quot;, the Nintendo 3DS port of &quot;Warriors&quot;.

Link is also a playable character in the 2019 Nintendo Switch rhythm game &quot;Cadence of Hyrule&quot;, a crossover between &quot;Crypt of the NecroDancer&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. Players can choose to play as either Link or Zelda and both are required at the end of the game. Link can perform a spin attack and carries a shield, while Zelda uses an ethereal block and a fireball.

In &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;, which acts as a prequel to &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and exists within the same game world, Link is accompanied by a roster of characters to fight alongside on the battlefield. The game progresses in the form of various missions that level up Link and his allies.

=== Other game series ===
Among SNES games, Link makes a cameo in &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; where he is ranked against the player next to Mario and Yoshi. Alongside Samus Aran, he makes a cameo in &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, where they are seen sleeping in separate beds at an inn. Link can be also be found at the start of a challenge course in &quot;F1 Race&quot;.

He is a playable character in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series and has appeared in every title since the first &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; on the Nintendo 64. In 2008, Toon Link from &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; appeared in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; on the Wii. He was also introduced in 2014 in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;. Link later returned in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; for the Nintendo Switch in various incarnations, including green tunic Link, blue tunic Link from &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Toon Link and Young Link.

In the GameCube version of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;, Link is a guest character. Miyamoto did not see a problem with Link appearing in a violent game, as he had already been established as a fighter in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. As part of the styling of a &quot;Zelda&quot;-themed game mode, he is featured in the 2006 puzzle video game &quot;Tetris DS&quot;. In &quot;Scribblenauts Unlimited&quot;, many &quot;Zelda&quot; series characters are summonable in the Wii U version, including Link. He is referenced by an archer dressed in green in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest&quot;, a mini game in the 2012 party game &quot;Nintendo Land&quot;, which involves archery and sword fighting in a cloth style. His costume appears alongside that of Samus in &quot;Dynasty Warriors VS&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS. Link appears in &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot; as part of &quot;The Legend of Zelda Zone&quot;, where he rides his signature Crimson Loftwing and Sonic wears his green cap and tunic. In the 2013 compilation game &quot;NES Remix&quot;, players can play remixed portions of NES games, including playing as Link in a level of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

The &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; incarnation of Link was introduced as a playable character in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; riding a motorcycle. In &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, his &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; incarnation also appears. He is referenced in 2015 downloadable content for &quot;Monster Hunter 4&quot; with armor resembling his tunic, &quot;Monster Hunter Generations&quot; DLC and also &quot;Monster Hunter Stories&quot;. Incarnations of Link from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and &quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot; also appear as &quot;Mystery Mushroom&quot; costumes in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;. In 2016, Link appeared in a 3DS game titled &quot;My Nintendo Picross - The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, a picture-puzzle game made available through the My Nintendo rewards program. The Master Sword and Hylian Shield appear alongside Link&#x27;s Champion&#x27;s Tunic from &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; as Amiibo-unlocked content in the Nintendo Switch version of &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. In 2019, Link was added as a playable character in the 2.0.0 update to &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot;, which features the Master Sword power-up changing the Mario characters into Link.

=== Television series ===
From 1989 to 1990, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; animated series aired as a part of DIC&#x27;s &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;. Thirteen episodes were produced before the cancellation of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;. Based loosely on the first game, the series presents Link as a rude, lovesick teenager. The plot revolves around him living in Hyrule Castle and being recruited to protect the Triforce of Wisdom from Ganon while accompanied by a fairy princess named Spryte. He persistently attempts to kiss Zelda and repeatedly exclaims &quot;Well excuse me, Princess!&quot; when tired with her attitude, a catchphrase that has since become a common gamers&#x27; in-joke. With little input from Nintendo, the writers were given the freedom to develop the series. As Link&#x27;s first voice actor, Jonathan Potts pictured him as a, &quot;youthful, goofy teenage boy who acts before he thinks&quot;.

A similar version of Link and Zelda appear during the second season of &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. The storyline involves a character named Kevin being sucked into a TV and entering a game world. He helps Link and Zelda to stop Ganon from reviving to protect the Triforce.

Throughout 2013 and 2014, Link appeared in a series of comedic shorts titled &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Misadventures of Link&quot;. The series made its debut on &quot;Nintendo Video&quot;, a video on demand service for the Nintendo 3DS. The series was based on &quot;The Wind Waker HD&quot; and aimed to present Link &quot;in a new and hysterical light&quot;.

=== Comics and manga ===

Following the release of the original game, Wanpaku Comics released a manga book in Japan in September 1986 titled &quot;The Hyrule Fantasy&quot;. It follows the basic plot of the game with some additions, including Link and Zelda communicating telepathically. Link appeared in manga-style novels published by Futabasha, including &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Mirage Castle&quot;, which was published in Japanese in 1986. A similar book titled &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce of the Gods&quot; was released in 1992 with a storyline based on &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. In the early 1990s, Valiant Comics published a serial comic based on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. The comic series lasted for only five issues, with a sixth story published as part of the Nintendo Comics System. In this incarnation, Link&#x27;s appearance was based on the original video game, giving him red hair, instead of his typical blonde or brown hair. The storyline reflects &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; animated television series, which was being aired around the same time. Link and Zelda&#x27;s relationship is depicted as amorous, with Link attempting to get a kiss from Zelda and Zelda returning Link&#x27;s affections. A manga adaptation of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; was created by Ataru Cagiva in 1995 with the Japanese title &quot;Triforce of the Gods&quot;. A serial comic was created for &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori. It was published in 1992 and later collected in graphic novel form in 1993. The plot is an alternate version of the storyline from &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. Several other manga adaptations have been published by Viz Media based on the &quot;Zelda&quot; video games, including &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and &quot;The Minish Cap&quot;, which were illustrated by Akira Himekawa. The Japanese artist duo also wrote the long-running &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; manga, which began as a Japanese serialisation in 2016 followed by an English translation in 2017 and has been released as a series of volumes. Nintendo published &quot;Link&#x27;s Hijinks&quot;, a translated web comic by Saitaro Komatsu on its Play Nintendo website. The comic had originally appeared in the Japanese manga magazine &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot;.

=== Gamebooks ===
Nintendo published several gamebooks based on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. As part of the &quot;Nintendo Adventure Book&quot; series, which was similar to the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books, two books were published in 1992 titled &quot;The Crystal Trap&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Prince&quot;. In &quot;The Crystal Trap&quot;, the storyline involves Zelda saving Link from the trap, while in &quot;The Shadow Prince&quot;, Link must save Zelda with the help of a character named Charles. In 2001, two books based on &quot;Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages&quot; were published by Scholastic, which were written by Craig Wessel and feature Link in a storyline based on the video games.

== Merchandise ==
Since 2014, various amiibo of Link have been released in a variety of incarnations. Three amiibo for the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of Link, Toon Link and Young Link were released in 2014, 2015 and 2019. Various incarnations have been created as amiibo for the &quot;Zelda&quot; series, including Wolf Link and Midna, 8-bit Link, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; Link, Toon Link from &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, incarnations from &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, archer and rider figures from &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and the incarnation from &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; reported that as of 1 February 2018, Link is the most prolific Nintendo character released as an amiibo. In addition to appearing on branded merchandise, his image has been reproduced in the form of figurines, plush toys and action figures. In May 2024, several versions of Link were announced in Lego minifigure form for a two-in-one Lego set of The Great Deku Tree, including adult and young Link from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and Link from &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Link has been widely described by critics as one of the greatest or most iconic video game characters of all time. Gabriel Aikins of &quot;Polygon&quot; noted that he is one of the most recognisable and beloved characters in the gaming industry. &quot;Complex&quot; described him as one of the &quot;most badass&quot; comic book characters, and emphasised the fond memories that most gamers have of their first encounter with Link and the nostalgia that he creates within the video game community. &quot;UGO&quot; considered Link to be the top comic book character who needs their own movie: &quot;Get Peter Jackson or Guillermo del Toro to do it, dump a ton of money into it, and we&#x27;ll all die happy&quot;. Link has also proven to be a popular guest character in other video games series. In 2008, &quot;IGN&quot; chose him as the best bonus character in the &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; series, while &quot;GameDaily&quot; considered him the best &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; character. Link&#x27;s acquisition of the Master Sword has been described as an &quot;epic&quot; series-defining moment and the sequence in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was ranked as the most unforgettable moment in gaming by &quot;IGN&quot;. Matthew Byrd, writing for &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, said that it represents the transformative moment for both Link and the player when he finally achieves his destiny as hero. Link was chosen as the &quot;hottest video game character&quot; in June 2006 by &quot;Out&quot; magazine for appearing as &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s sexy farm-boy-turned-wolf&quot; in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. Critics have commented on his sex appeal, including Jeffrey Parkes of &quot;Polygon&quot; who likened his &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; incarnation to a himbo and Kirsten Carey of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; who described his official &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; artwork as &quot;a dangerous thirst trap&quot;. Brian Feldman for &quot;New York&quot; magazine highlighted that Nintendo had finally acknowledged Link&#x27;s sex appeal through the dialogue of various side characters in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;.

Anthony John Agnello of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, described Link&#x27;s earliest iteration as lacking in height and expressiveness, but impressively fast and versatile for an RPG hero. He noted that his design was upgraded to a &quot;gloriously personable cartoon character&quot; by the release of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. The cartoon rendition in the 1989 television series was widely criticized, partially due to its obnoxious characterisation of the hero that Michael Mammano of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described as &quot;appalling&quot;. The child iteration in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was fondly remembered by Dominic Preston writing for &quot;NME&quot;, who noted the clever touches in his character that help players to see the game through a child&#x27;s eyes and motivate them to explore. Richard George and Audrey Drake of &quot;IGN&quot; commented that the game was the first to give Link more character depth and used its time shifts to illustrate his growth from youthful innocence to adulthood. Ryan Lambie of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described Link&#x27;s combat abilities in the game as &quot;revolutionary&quot;, particularly the Z-targeting system that allowed him to lock on and face his enemies in swordplay, which was afterwards adopted throughout the games industry. According to Lotte Reinbold, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, his transformations into various creatures in &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; were &quot;shocking and profound&quot;, as the pain he experiences when putting on a mask seems to strip away at his former identity as the Hero of Time. Kate Gray for &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; highlighted Link&#x27;s stoicism and altruism in the face of imminent death and opined that the game centres on his sacrifice and resulting loss of innocence and childhood.
When Miyamoto unveiled the cartoon design for Link at E3 2002 for &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, it diverged from a more realistic young adult model previously seen battling Ganondorf at the Nintendo Space World Demo in 2000. &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the crowd did not respond with the same enthusiasm that was seen at the unveiling of &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; in 2004. Toon Link was presented at a time when the games industry was pushing for grittier heroes. Many fans responded with outrage after seeing Link depicted in a childlike cartoonish style. Aonuma commented that this response was due to gamers fearing change, as the art style was so different from previous games in the series. The reception to Toon Link later improved, leading many players to express a fondness for the character. Jose Otero of &quot;IGN&quot; commented, &quot;Of all the incarnations of Link in the 3D era of this series, the young, cartoon iteration is the most capable fighter&quot;. In his review of &quot;The Wind Waker HD&quot;, Oli Welsh of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said this was his favourite Link, describing him and the game as &quot;energetic, spirited and soulful&quot;.

David Meikleham of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; noted that following the controversy around Toon Link, Nintendo had played it safe by unveiling the most graphically realistic version of Link created for &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and that this incarnation was warmly received by fans who wanted to see a handsome elfin hero. When a preview trailer depicting Link in the realistic art style was unveiled at E3 2004, the audience reacted with frenzied applause. Griffin McElfroy of &quot;Polygon&quot; felt that Link&#x27;s transition into Wolf Link did not provide satisfying combat when compared to the mastery of his sword manoeuvres. Oli Welsh thought that Link&#x27;s inseparable relationship with Zelda in &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot; was &quot;adorable&quot; and &quot;heartwarming&quot;, as it changed the convention of Link being a lone hero. The relationship between Link and Zelda in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; was praised by Susan Arendt of &quot;The Escapist&quot; for moving away from the traditional narrative of a prophecied hero to a more personal concern of saving his childhood friend. In his review of &quot;Skyward Sword HD&quot;, Josh West of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; felt that Link looks &quot;a little ridiculous&quot; holding up his sword as he traverses the game environment resulting from Nintendo&#x27;s decision to centre the game around motion controls, but considered it a small price for the precision of the gameplay. In an &quot;IGN&quot; review of &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, Keza Macdonald opined that the game world had less personality than others in the series due to Link being reduced to a blank character, but commented that the nostalgia for &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; was &quot;emotionally potent&quot;.

Jacob Krastenakes of &quot;The Verge&quot;, questioned Link&#x27;s role as the player character and opined that he and Zelda could be switched and &quot;he could simply be the &quot;other&quot; character, who is off doing their own thing&quot;. Ben Kuchera of &quot;Polygon&quot; noted that although Nintendo &quot;can bend the lore and mythology to justify every other goofy idea&quot; they draw the line at a female version of the character. Sara Gitkos for &quot;iMore&quot; questioned Link&#x27;s role as the protagonist, noting that the titular character of the series had been sidelined. She commented that Zelda served as Link&#x27;s prize, although in recent games she is more of a partner, but conceded that this would be difficult to change because Link &quot;doesn&#x27;t have any character to speak of, but rather is the place holder for us, and we become him&quot;.

Link&#x27;s abilities in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; were lauded, with Matthew Castle of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; calling his flexibility, particularly when climbing cliffs, a &quot;revelation&quot; compared to other game heroes. In his &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; review of the game, Thomas Whitehead praised his athleticism, particularly the ability to dash, climb and glide, for being essential components for problem solving. Matt Kamen of &quot;Wired&quot; felt that his vulnerability, caused by starting the game in rags and collecting highly degradable weapons, impacts the gameplay by making the player more cautious. Anticipation was high leading up to the release of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, partially driven by speculation over Link&#x27;s glowing right arm, which featured prominently in the trailers. This led to various theories about its role and implications in the story. Isaiah Colbert of &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted the similarities of this scenario to Prince Ashitaka whose right arm is cursed in the 1997 Japanese animated film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. Link&#x27;s new abilities granted by his arm were praised by critics. Steve Watts of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that his abilities are the engine driving the game and are a &quot;beautifully implemented evolution&quot; providing opportunities for inventiveness and creativity. Ash Parrish of &quot;The Verge&quot; said that his combined powers &quot;create infinite possibilities&quot; but noted that he is &quot;tasked with the same old quest: find Zelda&quot;.

=== Analysis ===
Jonathan Holmes, writing for &quot;Destructoid&quot;, questioned whether Link should be viewed as an individual or a blank slate avatar. He said that Nintendo had successfully created Link as both a specific character and an abstract concept, illustrated by the player choosing the character&#x27;s name at the start of various games. Describing Link as a &quot;non-character only purpose is to act as doorway for the player into the game world&quot;, he opined that through the reincarnation myth and use of multiple timelines, Nintendo had successfully shaped Link into a series of individuals. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Aaron Greenbaum asserted that even though Link does not have voice lines, he is a different character in every incarnation and each game makes it clear that he communicates: &quot;This paradoxical characterization helps players insert themselves into Link&#x27;s shoes but also gives him a personality, despite not being designed with one&quot;. Ryan Lambie of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised him as &quot;the videogame equivalent of Tintin&quot; because he is, &quot;the archetypal young hero, embodying all the optimism, generosity and spirit of adventure a broad fantasy action game requires&quot;. He also praised Link as &quot;the ultimate videogame underdog&quot; and &quot;an ordinary yet brave little guy who wants to save the world, in spite of insurmountable odds&quot;. Riley McAtee, writing for &quot;The Ringer&quot;, opined that the spirit of Link is the combination of courage as a defining characteristic and the absence of dialogue, which help to immerse players in the game, making him &quot;the quintessential video game hero&quot;. Nick Thorpe of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; considered that the success of Link&#x27;s character as an archetypal hero is that players identify and grow with him during each game and that his accomplishments are a &quot;shared victory&quot; where the player can achieve great feats that could never be accomplished in reality.

=== Influence and legacy ===

As the mascot of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, Link has become a widely recognisable character in pop culture. Damien McFerran of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; remarked that the enigmatic nature of his character leaves him open to interpretation and makes him &quot;one of the most drawn and imitated video game icons&quot;. In 2011, readers of the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; voted Link as the second best video game character of all time, behind Mario. Since the release of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; in December 2018, he holds the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; as the most ubiquitous action-adventure video game character, having appeared in 40 unique video games, not including rereleases and HD remasters. On 26 October 2018, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named Link as the most critically acclaimed videogame playable character, as he has appeared in six unique entries in GameRankings.com&#x27;s list of the top 100 all-time best reviewed videogames, with Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario and Konami&#x27;s Solid Snake being his closest competitors.

Critics widely consider Link&#x27;s adventures to be influential on the video game industry. The original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game influenced the evolution of the action role-playing video game genre, being an early example of open world design and nonlinear gameplay. The series has inspired numerous other game titles to adopt a similar action-adventure gameplay and open world exploration, with these games being commonly referred to as &quot;&quot;Zelda&quot; clones&quot;. In 2005, Link was awarded a star on the Walk of Game along with his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, noting that &quot;the series has produced the most popular role-playing game titles in history&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; said that &quot;Link has grown into one of the world&#x27;s most celebrated console heroes, and helped establish RPGs as an international gaming standard&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Time&quot; named Link as one of the most influential video game characters of all time commenting: &quot;Link embodies the selfless hero on a transformative journey, a storytelling trope we&#x27;ve seen in countless titles from &quot;Mass Effect&quot;″s Commander Shepard to &quot;Halo&quot;″s Master Chief&quot;. In 2024, a poll conducted by BAFTA with around 4,000 respondents named Link as the seventh most iconic video-game character of all time.

<doc id="488715" wikidata="Q1500303" url="?curid=488715" title="Lockheed Model 10 Electra">
<text>The Lockheed Model 10 Electra is an American twin-engined, all-metal monoplane airliner developed by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which was produced primarily in the 1930s to compete with the Boeing 247 and Douglas DC-2. The type gained considerable fame after being flown by Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan on their ill-fated around-the-world expedition in 1937.

==Design and development==
Some of Lockheed&#x27;s wooden designs, such as the Orion, had been built by Detroit Aircraft Corporation with metal fuselages. However, the Electra was Lockheed&#x27;s first all-metal and twin-engined design by Lloyd Stearman and Hall Hibbard. The name Electra came from a star in the Pleiades. The prototype made its first flight on February 23, 1934, with Marshall Headle at the controls.

Wind-tunnel work on the Electra was undertaken at the University of Michigan. Much of the work was performed by a student assistant, Kelly Johnson. He suggested two changes be made to the design: changing the single tail to double tails (later a Lockheed trademark), and deleting oversized wing fillets. Both of these suggestions were incorporated into production aircraft. Upon receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Johnson joined Lockheed as a regular employee, ultimately leading the Skunk Works in developing advanced aircraft such as the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.

The Lockheed Electra was one of the first commercial passenger aircraft with retractable landing gear to come equipped with mudguards as standard equipment, although aircraft with fixed landing gear commonly had mudguards much earlier than this.

==Operational history==
After October 1934, when the US government banned single-engined aircraft for use in carrying passengers or in night flying, Lockheed was perfectly placed in the market with its new Model 10 Electra. In addition to deliveries to US-based airlines, several European operators added Electras to their prewar fleets. In Latin America, the first airline to use Electras was Cubana de Aviación, starting in 1935, for its domestic routes.

Besides airline orders, a number of non-commercial civil operators also purchased the new Model 10. In May 1937, H. T. &quot;Dick&quot; Merrill and J. S. Lambie accomplished a round-trip crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. The feat was declared the first round-trip commercial crossing of that ocean by any aircraft. It won them the Harmon Trophy. On the eastbound trip, they carried newsreels of the crash of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, and on the return trip from the United Kingdom, they brought photographs of the coronation of King George VI. Bata Shoes operated the Model 10 to ferry its executives between their European factories.
Probably the most famous use of the Electra was the highly modified Model 10E flown by Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan. In July 1937, they disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean during an attempted round-the-world flight.

Many Electras and their design descendants (the Model 12 Electra Junior and Model 14 Super Electra) were pressed into military service during World War II, for instance the USAAF&#x27;s C-36. By the end of the war, the Electra design was obsolete, although many smaller airlines and charter services continued to operate Electras into the 1970s.

Electras were popular as private planes for royalty in Asia and Europe. In India, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Maharaja of Jodhpur both purchased them for their personal use in 1937.

==Variants==

The Electra was produced in several variants, for both civilian and military customers. Lockheed built a total of 149 Electras.

* 1015 – Electra 10E on static display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.
* 1026 – Electra 10A on display at the Oakland Aviation Museum in Oakland, California.
* 1037 – Electra 10A on static display at the Science Museum in London.
* 1042 &quot;Muriel&quot; – Electra 10E on static display at the Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum at Amelia Earhart Airport in Atchison, Kansas. Delivered to Atchison in August 2016, it was previously owned by Grace McGuire, who had planned on using it to recreate Amelia Earhart&#x27;s around-the-world flight.
* 1052 – Electra 10A on static display at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Originally an XR2O-1 used for transporting high ranking staff by the U.S. Navy, it is now painted in Northwest Airlines colors. At one point it was intended to use this machine for a recreation of the Earhart flight but it was not carried out.
* 1091 – Electra 10A airworthy with Ivo Lukačovič at Točná Airport in Točná, Prague. Registered previously as OK-CTB (now N241M), it was one of two owned by Bata Shoe Co. in Prague, Czechoslovakia before WWII. At the outbreak of WWII it was evacuated to England, and onward to Canada where it served with the RCAF. After a succession of US owners, it was eventually reacquired by Bata Shoe, and fully restored by Wichita Air Services in Newton, Kansas. Wearing its original colors and registration marks, it was ferried back to Prague in May 2015.
* 1112 – Electra 10A on static display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. Originally purchased by Trans-Canada Air Lines as their first new aircraft, it was transferred to the RCAF in 1939, with whom it served for most of World War II. After the war it was operated by a number of private owners. It survived into the 1960s when Ann Pellegreno between June 7 and July 10, 1967, flew the aircraft on a round-the-world flight to commemorate Amelia Earhart&#x27;s last flight in 1937. After being acquired by Air Canada, it was restored in 1968 and donated to the museum.
* 1116 – Electra 10A airworthy at the Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was one of a second batch of three Electras delivered to Trans-Canada Airlines. Found in Florida in the early 1980s by a vacationing Air Canada employee, it was returned to Winnipeg for restoration. In 1987 it flew across Canada in honor of the 50th anniversary of Air Canada – who owns and operates the aircraft.
* 1130 – Electra 10A on static display at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida.

<text>Average Joe is an American reality television show broadcast on the NBC beginning in 2003. There were a total of four seasons, the first two following the original show premise, and the last two bringing back contestants from prior seasons.

==Premise==

Instead of attempting to make a &quot;dream couple&quot; between two extremely attractive people, &quot;Average Joe&quot; tried to get 16 to 18 ordinary men to win the heart of a beauty queen. The men were what the producers considered to be average in appearance, with many being overweight or underweight and nerdy, or awkward in their behavior and personalities.

Prior to the show&#x27;s start, the beauty queen was not aware she was to be dating &quot;average&quot; men. She was instead led to believe her show was going to feature only handsome suitors. (The second series, taped before the first one aired, also contained this element, thus avoiding the problem associated with the second season of &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;.) Halfway through the show, several handsome suitors appear and compete against the average Joes.

Throughout the show the beauty went on various dates with the men, both in groups and individually (at her choice). When the attractive suitors show up, there were also competitions between the rival groups of men. At the end of every episode the beauty votes to send a certain number (usually four) of the men home. In the end, she must pick only one to go on an intimate vacation with.

==Seasons==
===&quot;Average Joe&quot;===

The first two &quot;Average Joe&quot; series were intended to be somewhat of a mockery of traditional set-up shows such as &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;. The show was marketed to have an implied moral subtext, namely that beauty was only skin deep, and that personality could ultimately triumph over looks. However, the first two seasons ended in a way that seemed to prove the opposite. In &quot;Average Joe&quot;, Melana Scantlin chose Jason Peoples, one of the attractive suitors, over Adam Mesh, the last remaining Average Joe. Kathy Griffin was the host.

===&quot;Average Joe: Hawaii&quot;===

In the second season, &quot;Average Joe: Hawaii&quot;, Larissa Meek chose attractive Gil Hyatt over Average Joe Brian Worth. A few days later, on a &quot;honeymoon&quot; between Hyatt and Meek, Larissa revealed she had once dated Fabio, which caused Gil to leave her in disgust. Meek now owns a website design and art company registered and situated in Fort Lauderdale, which is Hyatt&#x27;s hometown. They are not a couple any longer, according to Meek&#x27;s blog. She said &quot;we gave it our best but decided to part ways.&quot;

===&quot;Average Joe: Adam Returns&quot;===

The third season, &quot;Average Joe: Adam Returns&quot;, featured the return of rejected contestant Adam Mesh, this time as the object of the affections of 19 female contestants. The women in this situation were a mixture of fairly attractive and average, with the busload of &quot;babes&quot; arriving later sent home immediately by Adam. In the final episode, Adam chose saleswoman Samantha Trenk over schoolteacher Rachel Goetz. 

===&quot;Average Joe: The Joes Strike Back&quot;===

The fourth season entitled &quot;Average Joe: The Joes Strike Back&quot; started airing on June 28, 2005. The name references &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. In this season, one rejected Joe from each week received a complete makeover and the opportunity at another chance with the show&#x27;s beauty Anna Chudoba. In the end, Anna chose Average Joe Nathan Griffin over model/bartender Rocky Fain, breaking the &quot;Joes&quot; losing streak. A contestant on &quot;Average Joe: Hawaii&quot;, Alfred &quot;Fredo&quot; LaPonza, along with two other men, sued NBC claiming the network used ideas of theirs on the show. Matt Hoffman, who later appeared on &quot;Big Brother 12 (U.S.)&quot;, was a contestant on &quot;Average Joe: The Joes Strike Back&quot;, and was eliminated on the first episode of the season.

==Syndication and other spinoffs==

GSN had acquired the first two seasons in 2004. Episodes were also aired on the Fox Reality Channel.

A role-reversal version of the show, with a series of ordinary women who were to compete for the love of a very handsome man, to be entitled &quot;Plain Jane&quot;, was announced as being in the works, but such a show never materialized. The title was eventually used for another reality series with a different concept.

==International adaptations==
A local version of Average Joe has been made in France based on the original US format. Licensing of the format is handled by NBCUniversal.

<doc id="488719" wikidata="Q852646" url="?curid=488719" title="Lockheed L-188 Electra">
<text>The Lockheed L-188 Electra is an American turboprop airliner built by Lockheed. First flown in 1957, it was the first large turboprop airliner built in the United States. With its fairly high power-to-weight ratio, huge propellers and very short wings (resulting in the majority of the wingspan being enveloped in propwash), large Fowler flaps which significantly increased effective wing area when extended, and four-engined design, the airplane had airfield performance capabilities unmatched by many jet transport aircraft even today—particularly on short runways and high altitude airfields. Initial sales were good, but after two fatal crashes that led to expensive modifications to fix a design defect, no more were ordered. Jet airliners soon supplanted turboprops for many purposes, and many Electras were modified as freighters. Some Electras are still being used in various roles into the 21st century. The airframe was also used as the basis for the Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft.

==Development==
By mid-20th century, Lockheed had established a strong position in commercial airliner production with its piston-engined Constellation series. Further development brought turboprop engines to the Constellation airframe with the Lockheed L-1249 Super Constellation.

In 1951, Lockheed was approached by Capital Airlines to develop a new turboprop airliner, which was designated the YC-130, but no other carriers had any interest, so the design was dropped. Subsequently, Capital Airlines went on to order 60 British Vickers Viscounts. In 1954, as a result of American Airlines&#x27; interest in developing a twin-engined aircraft, the idea resurfaced and the company offered a twin-engined design now designated the CL-303. This newer design was a high-wing type and would allow for 60 to 70 passengers. This design was also shelved for lack of interest from other carriers.

The following year, American Airlines revised its requirement to a four-engine design for 75 passengers with range. Lockheed proposed a new design, the CL-310 with a low wing and four Rolls-Royce Darts or Napier Elands. The CL-310 design met the American Airlines requirements, but failed to meet those of another interested carrier, Eastern Air Lines. Its requirements were for a longer range, a minimum cruising speed of , and increased seating capacity to the 85-to-90-passenger level. Lockheed redesigned the CL-310 to use the Allison 501-D13 turboprop engine, a civilian version of the T56 developed for the Lockheed C-130 Hercules military transport. The airframe was stretched to allow for more seats and handle the increased performance. This design was launched as the Model 188 with an order for 35 by American Airlines on June 8, 1955. This was followed by Eastern Air Lines with an order for 40 on September 27, 1955. The first aircraft took 26 months to complete, and by that time Lockheed had orders for 129. The prototype, a Model 188A, first flew on December 6, 1957, two months ahead of schedule. Lockheed was awarded a type certificate by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) on 22 August 1958. The first delivery – to Eastern Air Lines – was on October 8, 1958, but it did not enter service until January 12, 1959.

In 1957, the United States Navy issued a requirement for an advanced maritime patrol aircraft. Lockheed proposed a development of the Electra that was later placed into production as the P-3 Orion, which had much greater success – the Orion has been in continual front-line service for more than 50 years.

==Design==
The Model 188 Electra is a low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by four wing-mounted Allison 501-D13 turboprops. It has a retractable tricycle landing gear and a conventional tail. It has a cockpit crew of three and can carry 66 to 80 passengers in a mixed-class arrangement, although 98 could be carried in a high-density layout. The first variant was the Model 188A, followed by the longer-range 188C with room for more fuel and maximum take-off weight 15000 KG / 33069 lbs.

==Operational history==

===Civilian operations===
American Airlines was the launch customer. Eastern Air Lines, Braniff Airways, and Northwest Airlines followed. The Electra suffered a troubled start. Passengers of early aircraft complained of noise in the cabin forward of the wings, caused by propeller resonance. Lockheed redesigned the engine nacelles, tilting the engines upwards 3°. The changes were incorporated on the production line by mid-1959 or as modification kits for the aircraft already built, and resulted in improved performance and a better ride for passengers.

Three aircraft were lost in fatal accidents between February 1959 and March 1960. After the third crash, the FAA limited the Electra&#x27;s speed until the cause could be determined. After an extensive investigation, two of the crashes (in September 1959 and March 1960) were found to be caused by an engine-mount problem. The mounting of the gearbox cracked, and the reduced rigidity enabled a phenomenon called &quot;whirl mode flutter&quot; (analogous to the precession of a child&#x27;s spinning top as it slows down, an interaction of propellers with airflow) that affected the outboard engine nacelles. When the oscillation was transmitted to the wings and the flutter frequency decreased to a point where it was resonant with the outer wing panels (at the same frequency, or harmonically related ones), violent up-and-down oscillation increased until the wings would tear off.

The company implemented an expensive modification program (the Lockheed Electra Achievement Program, LEAP) in which the engine mounts and the wing structures supporting the mounts were strengthened, and some of the wing skins were replaced with thicker material. All Electras were modified by the factory at Lockheed&#x27;s expense, with the modifications taking 20 days for each aircraft. The changes were incorporated in later aircraft as they were built. However, the damage had been done, and the public lost confidence in the type. This and the smaller jets that were being introduced eventually relegated Electras to the smallest airlines. Production ended in 1961 after 170 had been built. Losses to Lockheed have been estimated as high as $57 million, not counting an additional $55 million in lawsuits. Electras continued to carry passengers into the 1990s, but most now in use are freighters.

Several airlines in the US flew Electras, but the only European airline to order the type from Lockheed was KLM, which used 12 between September 1959 and January 1969 in Europe and east to Saigon and Kuala Lumpur.

In the South Pacific, Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) and its successor Air New Zealand flew the Electra on trans-Tasman flights. In Australia Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) and Ansett each operated three Electras on trunk routes between the Australian mainland state capital cities, and later to Port Moresby, from 1959 until 1971. Ansett had its three Electras converted to freighters in 1970–71 and continued to fly them until 1984. Qantas also operated four Electras on its routes to Hong Kong and Japan, to New Caledonia, and to New Guinea (until the New Guinea route was handed to Ansett and TAA); then later across the Indian Ocean to South Africa, and across the Tasman in competition with TEAL after that airline became 100% New Zealand-owned. The divestiture of TEAL&#x27;s 50%-Australian shareholding was itself prompted by the Electra order, as TEAL wanted jet aircraft, but was forced by the Australian government to order Electras in order to standardise with Qantas. Three Qantas Electras were retired in the mid-1960s and the fourth in 1971.

Some Electras were sold to South American airlines, where the Electra had highly successful operations, such as those of Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano and Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas; in both cases, the Electra ensured the airlines&#x27; international operations before they started using jets. Most notably, Brazilian flag carrier airline Varig operated flawlessly a fleet of 14 Electras on the extremely busy Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo shuttle service (the so-called &quot;Ponte Aérea&quot; – or &quot;Air Bridge&quot; in Portuguese) for 30 years, completing over half a million flights on the route before the type was replaced by Boeing 737-300 and Fokker 100 jets in 1992. The Electra became so iconic on that route that its retirement caused a commotion in Brazil, with extensive press coverage and many special tributes.

During the mid-1970s, several secondhand Electras were bought by travel clubs, including Nomads, Adventurers and Shillelaghs. Others were retired from passenger service into air-cargo use, 40 being modified by a subsidiary of Lockheed from 1968 with one or two large doors in the left side of the fuselage and a reinforced cabin floor. Air California and Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) were still operating Electras for scheduled passenger service during the late 1970s primarily into the Lake Tahoe Airport located in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, as this airfield had banned scheduled jet aircraft flights at the time.

===Military use===
In 1973, the Argentine Navy bought three Electras equipped with cargo doors. These were used during the &quot;Dirty War&quot; to toss political prisoners into the Rio de La Plata in the infamous death flights. The Electras were also used for transport duties during the Falklands War in 1982.

In 1983, after the retirement of its last SP-2H Neptune, the Argentine Navy bought further civilian Electra airframes, modified several for maritime patrol, and widely used them until their replacement by P-3s in 1994. One of the Argentine Navy&#x27;s Electras, known locally as L-188E &quot;Electron&quot;, is preserved at the Argentine Naval Aviation Museum (&quot;Museo de la Aviación Naval&quot;) at Bahía Blanca.

==Accidents and incidents==
Of the total of 170 Electras built, as of June 2011, 58 have been written off because of crashes and other accidents.

* February 3, 1959: American Airlines Flight 320 en route from Chicago to New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport crashed on approach, 65 of 73 on board died.
* September 29, 1959: Braniff International Airways Flight 542 crashed near Buffalo, Texas, en route to Dallas, Texas from Houston, Texas. All 29 passengers and five crew members died in the crash. The Civil Aeronautics Board blamed the crash on the &quot;whirl-mode&quot; prop theory and in-flight separation of a wing from the aircraft.
* March 17, 1960: Northwest Orient Flight 710, en route from Chicago to Miami, Florida, broke apart in flight over Perry County, Indiana, in the second &quot;whirl-mode&quot; crash. All 63 people on board died (57 passengers and six crew members).
* September 14, 1960: An Electra operated as American Airlines Flight 361 caught its landing gear on a dike while landing at LaGuardia Airport. The aircraft came to rest upside down. There were no fatalities among the 76 occupants (70 passengers, six crew).
* October 4, 1960: Eastern Air Lines Flight 375 crashed on takeoff from Boston, Massachusetts&#x27;s Logan International Airport; 62 of 72 on board died. The crash was eventually determined to be the result of bird ingestion into three of the four engines.
* June 12, 1961: KLM Flight 823 crashed short of the runway on approach to Cairo; 20 of the 36 on board died.
* September 17, 1961: Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 706 crashed on takeoff from Chicago-O&#x27;Hare International Airport; all 37 on board died. The crash was eventually determined to be the result of mechanical failure in the aileron primary control system due to the improper replacement of the aileron boost assembly.
* March 27, 1965: While on a training flight, a Tasman Empire Airways L-188 crashed while landing at Whenuapai airport in Auckland, New Zealand. Although the aircraft was completely destroyed, all occupants escaped with only one minor injury.
* April 22, 1966: American Flyers Airline Flight 280/D crashed into a hill on approach to Ardmore Municipal Airport in Oklahoma; all five crew and 78 of the 93 passengers on board died.
* February 16, 1967: Garuda Indonesian Airways Flight 708 crashed while attempting to land at Manado-Sam Ratulangi Airport. A total of 22 of 92 passengers and crew on board died. The crash was eventually determined to be the result of an awkward landing technique resulting in an excessive rate of sink on touchdown. Marginal weather at the time of landing was a contributing factor.
* May 3, 1968: Braniff International Airways Flight 352, en route from Houston to Dallas, disintegrated over Dawson, Texas. All 80 passengers and five crew members died. This was the deadliest aviation disaster in Texas at the time. The National Transportation Safety Board found the probable cause to be overstressing of the structure beyond its ultimate strength during attempted recovery from unusual aircraft attitude produced by turbulence of a thunderstorm.
* August 9, 1970: LANSA Flight 502 crashed shortly after takeoff from Quispiquilla Airport near Cusco, Peru; 99 of the 100 people on board, plus two people on the ground, died. The co-pilot was the only survivor.
* August 24, 1970 Universal Airlines L-188C N855U departed Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah on an Air Force Logair flight to Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. The aircraft departed without all its hydraulic systems in operation, leaving insufficient elevator authority, resulting in the aircraft nosing over into the ground. The aircraft was destroyed but the crew escaped with injuries. The investigation found fault with the captain and flight engineer for not following approved procedures and directives.
* December 24, 1971: LANSA Flight 508, en route from Lima to Pucallpa, Peru, entered an area of strong turbulence and lightning and disintegrated in midair due to structural failure following a lightning strike and fire. Of the 92 people on board, 91 died. One passenger, Juliane Koepcke, survived when trees cushioned her fall into the rainforest.
* March 19, 1972 Universal Airlines L-188C N851U was on a ferry flight from Tucson, Arizona to Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah when it developed an engine overspeed issue, complicated by an inability to feather. The aircraft landed at Hill just after midnight, whereupon the engine exploded, destroying a large portion of the left wing and causing a substantial fire. The crew had minor injuries but the aircraft was a writeoff. The crew was cited in the investigation for improper procedures.
* August 27, 1973: A Lockheed L-188A Electra passenger plane (HK-777) operated by Aerocondor was destroyed when it flew into the side of the Cerro el Cable mountain shortly after takeoff from Bogotá-Eldorado Airport (BOG), Colombia. All 36 passengers and six crew members died.
* October 30, 1974: On approach to Rea Point Airfield on Melville Island, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), Canada, Panarctic Oils Flight 416 crashed into the ice-covered sea some 3 km south of its destination after the pilot-in-command abruptly increased the rate of descent in apparent disorientation. All 30 passengers and two of the four crew members, including the pilot-in-command, died.
* June 4, 1976: Air Manila Flight 702, an L-188A (RP-C1061), crashed just after takeoff from the Guam Naval Air Station; the 45 occupants and one person on the ground died. 
* On November 18, 1979, L-188 (N859U), operating a flight for the US military (Logair 3N18) from Hill Air Force Base, crashed near Salt Lake City airport, Utah. While climbing between 12,000 and 13,000 ft, all electrical power was lost; the crew requested an immediate descent. The aircraft attained a high airspeed and a high rate of descent and the aircraft disintegrated in flight; all three crew members died. The NTSB investigation stated the probable cause was a progressive failure of the aircraft electrical system leading to the disabling or erratic performance of flight critical flight instruments and lighting. As a result, the crew became disoriented and lost control of the aircraft. The crew&#x27;s efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed loads which exceeded the design limits and caused it to break up in flight. This was the third Universal Airlines Electra to be destroyed in connection with Hill Air Force Base (inherited by Trans International from Saturn Airways). See August 24, 1970 and March 19, 1972.
* January 8, 1981, a SAHSA L-188A in Guatemala City, killing all six crew members on board. 
*On 8 June 1983, Reeve Aleutian Airways Flight 8&#x27;s number-four propeller separated from the aircraft and tore a hole in the fuselage over the Pacific Ocean causing a rapid decompression and loss of control. The pilots managed to land the aircraft safely at Anchorage, Alaska and all 15 passengers and crew survived. Since the propeller fell into the sea and was never recovered, the cause of the separation is unknown.
* May 30, 1984, Zantop International Airlines Flight 931, a Lockheed L-188AF Electra (N5523) flying regularly scheduled cargo service from Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI) to Detroit-Willow Run Airport (YIP), crashed at Chalkhill, Pennsylvania; all three crew members and the sole passenger died. While cruising at FL220, at approximately 01:44 AM, the aircraft entered an unusual attitude shortly after a course change. During efforts to recover the aircraft the pilots imposed loads on the airframe that exceeded the aircraft&#x27;s design limits and it broke apart at altitude. NTSB reported that in-flight problems with the aircraft&#x27;s gyros likely provided conflicting attitude data to the flight crew at the time of the upset and this, combined with a lack of visual cues, were contributing causes of the accident. 
* January 21, 1985: Chartered Galaxy Airlines Flight 203 crashed after takeoff from Reno-Cannon International Airport en route to Minneapolis–St Paul Minnesota; 70 of the 71 people on board died.
* September 12, 1988: A Tame Ecuador L-188A Electra, registration HC-AZY, crashed near Lago Agrio Airport shortly after takeoff; six crew and one passenger died.
* September 4, 1989: A Tame Ecuador L-188C Electra, registration HC-AZJ, crash-landed at Taura AFB with no fatalities.
* December 18, 1995: An overloaded 188C of Trans Service Airlift crashed near Cahungula, Angola, with the loss of 141 of the 144 occupants. This is the deadliest aviation disaster involving the Lockheed L-188 Electra.
* February 8, 1999: An Air Karibu L-188 (9Q-CDI) after takeoff from N&#x27;djili Airport killing all seven crew members. The aircraft had been overloaded, and the flight engineer was serving as a co-pilot because no other co-pilots were present. A ground mechanic took the flight engineer&#x27;s place.
* October 16, 2000: An Air Spray Lockheed L-188 Electra (Tanker #88 C-FQYB) was destroyed in a fire at Air Spray’s maintenance facility in Red Deer, Alberta. Many other WW2 era planes were also consumed amidst the blaze.
* July 16, 2003: An Air Spray Lockheed L-188 Electra (Tanker #86 C-GFQA) crashed and was destroyed near Cranbrook, British Columbia shortly after delivering the retardant load. Tanker 86 was seen to turn right initially, then entered a turn to the left. At 1221 MST, the Electra struck the terrain on the side of a steep ridge at about 3900 feet above sea level. The aircraft exploded on impact and the two pilots died. An intense post-crash fire consumed much of the wreckage and started a forest fire at the crash site and the surrounding area.

<text>Henley Royal Regatta (or Henley Regatta, its original name pre-dating Royal patronage) is a rowing event held annually on the River Thames by the town of Henley-on-Thames, England. It was established on 26 March 1839. It differs from the three other regattas rowed over approximately the same course, Henley Women&#x27;s Regatta, Henley Masters Regatta, and Henley Town and Visitors&#x27; Regatta, each of which is an entirely separate event.

The regatta lasts for six days (Tuesday to Sunday) ending on the first weekend in July. Races are head-to-head knock out competitions, raced over a course of . The regatta regularly attracts international crews to race. The most prestigious event at the regatta is the Grand Challenge Cup for men&#x27;s Eights, which has been awarded since the regatta was first staged.

As the regatta pre-dates any national or international rowing organisation, it has its own rules and organisation, although it is recognised by both British Rowing (the governing body of rowing in England and Wales) and FISA (the International Federation of Rowing Associations). The regatta is organised by a self-perpetuating body of Stewards, who are largely former rowers themselves. One exception to this rule is that the Mayor of Henley-on Thames Council is an ex-officio Steward. Pierre de Coubertin modelled elements of the organisation of the International Olympic Committee on the Henley Stewards.

The regatta is regarded as part of the English social season. As with other events in the season, certain enclosures at the regatta have strict dress codes.

== Format of competition ==

===Qualifying===

Entries for the regatta close at 6 pm sixteen days before the Regatta. In order to encourage a high quality of racing, create a manageable race timetable and to ensure that most crews race only once a day, each event has a limited number of places. Qualifying races are held on the Friday before the regatta. The regatta&#x27;s Committee of Management decides at its absolute discretion which crews are obliged to qualify; the Committee will examine the form and calibre of the entrants and may choose to pre-qualify some of them.

The qualifying races take the form of a timed processional race up the regatta course, with the fastest crews qualifying. Times are released for non-qualifying crews only. This does not stop an enthusiastic band of unofficial timers with synchronised watches working out how fast their first round opposition might be.

If it is apparent that there are a number of outstanding crews in an event, they may be &#x27;selected&#x27; by the Stewards, to prevent them from meeting too early in the competition. The regatta insists that selection is not the same as seeding, the main difference being that there is no &#x27;rank order&#x27; as is usually the case in, for example, a tennis tournament.

=== The draw ===

The draw is a public event that takes place in the Henley Town Hall, normally at 3 pm on the Saturday before the regatta. For each event the names of all selected crews are placed on pieces of paper which are then drawn at random from the Grand Challenge Cup. These crews are then placed on pre-determined positions on the draw chart, as far apart as possible. The remaining qualifying crews are then drawn from the cup, filling in from the top of the draw chart downwards, until all places have been filled.

=== Racing ===
Each event in the regatta takes the form of a knockout competition, with each race consisting of two crews racing side by side up the Henley course. The course is marked out by two lines of booms (wooden bars which float on the water, secured between vertical poles), which are placed along the river to form a straight course 2,112 metres long. The course is wide enough to allow two crews to race down with a few metres between them. As such it is not uncommon for inexperienced steersmen or coxswains to crash into the booms, possibly costing their crew the race.

The race begins at the downstream end of Temple Island, where the crews attach to a pair of pontoons. The race umpire will then call out the names of the two crews and start them when they are both straight and ready. Each crew is assigned to row on either the &#x27;Bucks&#x27; (Buckinghamshire) or &#x27;Berks&#x27; (Berkshire) side of the race course. The coxswains or steersmen are expected to keep their crew on the allocated side of the course at all times during the race, else they risk disqualification. The only exception is when a crew leads by a sizeable margin and is not deemed by the umpire to be impeding the trailing crew.

There are several progress markers along the course. Intermediate times are recorded at two of them – &quot;the Barrier&quot; and &quot;Fawley&quot;, in addition to the time to the finish. The regatta has official commentary, which is announced at these points along the course. The commentary is renowned for being unemotional and factual, with the commentator only allowed to announce the rate of striking, which crew is leading, the distance between the crews, and the progress marker which the crews are passing.

=== The course ===

Henley Royal Regatta has always been raced over a distance of &#x27;about one mile and 550 yards&#x27; from Temple Island upstream towards Henley Bridge. However, four distinct courses have been used over the regatta&#x27;s history, with smaller changes also being made incrementally. Changes to the course have all been aimed at improving the prospects for fair and safe racing.

==== The Old Course (1839–1885) ====
This ran from a point just upstream of Temple Island. At the first regatta in 1839, the finish line was Henley Bridge itself, but it was presumably quickly realised that this had inherent problems. From 1840 onward the finish was moved downstream slightly; eventually a point opposite the lawn of the Red Lion Hotel became the standard finish line. A grandstand was erected for the Stewards and their guests outside the Red Lion. Other spectators could watch from the adjacent roadway (in front of the Little White Hart Hotel) while those with carriages surveyed the scene from a vantage point on Henley Bridge. There were three racing stations (Berkshire, Centre and Buckinghamshire). When only two crews raced, the Centre Station was not used.

The Old Course had a large lefthand bend in the last quarter-mile. This benefited the crew on the Berkshire side of the course not only because they raced a shorter distance but also because they avoided the worst of the river&#x27;s current. Between 1866 and 1885, 57.7% all races were won by the crew on the Berkshire station, with the Buckinghamshire and Centre crews sharing 42.3%. The course was not boomed or piled, although between 1871 and 1873, poles were roped across the bay on the Berkshire side upstream of Poplar Point, in an attempt to minimise the advantage given to the crew on the Berkshire station.

==== The New Course (1886–1922) ====

In 1884, a sub-committee of the regatta&#x27;s Committee of Management discussed options for reducing the unfairness of the course. Their recommendation was to move the finish line downstream to Poplar Point (thus avoiding the bend) and the start to the bottom of Temple Island. This was not popular with spectators as it made previous viewing points obsolete. The sub-committee also recommending reducing the racing lanes from three to two and extending racing from two days to three. The Committee gained support from the Captains of competing Clubs and the changes were introduced for the 1886 Regatta.

The New Course started just downstream of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire side and finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, very close to the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the unfairness of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a &#x27;Bushes Wind&#x27; was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.

To attempt to reduce the effect of the Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river. The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then progressively until by 1914 it was down to 100 feet at the start tapering to 80 feet at the finish. In 1899, floating booms secured between the pilings which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.

==== The Experimental Course (1923) and the Straight Course (1924 onwards) ====

In around 1920, the Stewards carried out a survey canvassing the idea of a moving the start of the course to the Berkshire side of Temple Island. At the time this channel was a winding, shallow backwater and it would clearly not be possible to lay a course of the full Henley distance without significant alteration to the bank, the island and the riverbed.

For the 1923 regatta, the Stewards therefore decided to try a shorter experimental straight course which started at the top of the island. This produced 53.2% wins on Bucks and 46.8% on Berks, deemed enough of an improvement on the New Course to justify a permanent change. The consent of the landowners of the Berkshire bank and Temple island (Lord Hambleden and W.D. Mackenzie respectively) was obtained to widen and deepen the Berkshire channel; of material were excavated. The Straight Course was now ready for use.

The Straight Course runs from the upstream end of Temple Island to a point opposite the upstream end of the Phyllis Court. It is wide. The Straight Course has generally addressed the problems of unfairness: for example, between 1975 and 1984, 50.52% of races were won on Bucks and 49.31% on Berks (with the remainder dead heats). However, when a strong stream is flowing, the Berks station enjoys considerable shelter from the stream, particularly in the last ¼ mile. Conversely, when there is a strong south-westerly wind it is better to be on the Bucks station because it is more sheltered from the wind. The course is now piled and boomed along its entire length, except for crossing points. The booms can present a hazard for the inexperienced coxswain or steersman.

==== Precise length of the course ====
When the start and finish positions of the Old Course had become established, the distance between them was found to be 1 mile 570 yds (2,131 metres). However, boats were aligned by their sterns at the start and judged by their bows at the finish. This meant that the course was slightly longer for shorter boats (such as single sculls) than for longer boats (such as eights). The length of an eight was assumed to be twenty yards and as such the course came to be described as &quot;about 1 mile and 550 yards (2,112 metres)&quot;, which was the distance covered by an eight.

In 1967 the start of the Straight Course was relocated exactly 1 mile 550 yd from the finish. In the same year, moving pontoons were introduced at the start which allowed all boats, from singles to eights, to be aligned with their bows precisely on the start line. Since then all crews have raced a course of exactly one mile and 550 yards (2,112 metres).

=== Safety ===

During the whole regatta, during racing hours there are numerous safety boats provided by the Colwick Park Lifeguards to keep competitors safe. The regatta organisers arrange for a first aid provider to be present, who have an on site hospital-style area.

At a public meeting in Henley town hall on 26 March 1839, Captain Edmund Gardiner proposed &quot;that from the lively interest which had been manifested at the various boat races which have taken place on the Henley reach during the last few years, and the great influx of visitors on such occasions, this meeting is of the opinion that the establishing of an annual regatta, under judicious and respectable management, would not only be productive of the most beneficial results to the town of Henley, but from its peculiar attractions would also be a source of amusement and gratification to the neighbourhood, and the public in general.&quot;

The regatta was first staged in 1839, and proved so successful that it was expanded the next year from one day to two. As the regatta&#x27;s popularity has grown it has further expanded: to three days in 1886, four days in 1906 and five days in 1986. The regatta has been known as &quot;Henley Royal Regatta&quot; since 1851, when Prince Albert became the first royal patron. Since his death, every reigning monarch has agreed to be the patron.

===Amateurism and Controversial Exclusions===

At the regatta&#x27;s inception it was intended for amateur oarsmen rather than those who rowed professionally. In 1879 Henley produced its first formal definition of an amateur:

In 1884, amateur status for overseas oarsmen was put on the same basis as for home oarsmen, thus ending the concession on racing for money prizes. By 1886 a phrase had also been added debarring any person &quot;engaged in any menial activity&quot;.

These rules would become the cause of growing controversy as international entries to Henley increased; most foreign countries having a different definition of amateur. The adoption of Henley&#x27;s definition of amateur by the Amateur Rowing Association of Great Britain would also cause a 66-year schism in British rowing, when in 1890 a rival National Amateur Rowing Association was set up, with a less restrictive definition of amateurism under which persons who worked in manual labour as their occupation could still be considered amateur rowers.

One well-known incident was the exclusion of future Olympic champion John B. Kelly Sr., who had served an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, from the 1920 regatta. According to the minutes of the regatta&#x27;s Committee of Management, Kelly was excluded both because he was not eligible under the manual labour rules and because he was a member of Vesper Boat Club, which was banned in 1906 because members of its 1905 Henley crew had raised money to pay for their trip through public donations – making them professionals in the eyes of the Henley Stewards.

Kelly&#x27;s exclusion was widely reported in newspapers in both the UK and USA, with many seeing it as an attempt to prevent an American from winning the Diamonds. Kelly&#x27;s son John B. Kelly Jr. would dramatically win the 1947 Diamond Sculls, and his daughter would become the famous Academy Award-winning actress and Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly, keeping the incident in the public eye for decades afterwards.

In 1936, there was a further controversy when the Australian national eight, preparing for the Berlin Olympics, was excluded from the Grand Challenge Cup because the crew was composed of policemen, deemed to be &#x27;manual workers&#x27;. The resulting embarrassment persuaded the Amateur Rowing Association and the Stewards of Henley Royal Regatta of the need for change. On 9 June 1937, the offending references to manual labourers, mechanics, artisans and menial duties were deleted from the ARA rules; Henley&#x27;s rules were changed the following day, coming into effect from the 1938 regatta.

In September 1997, FISA removed all references to amateurism in its rules and in December 1998 Henley followed suit. The regatta is therefore now entirely open.

=== International participation ===
The first &#x27;overseas&#x27; entry to the regatta was in 1870 when Trinity College, Dublin entered the Grand, Ladies&#x27;, Visitors&#x27; and Wyfold. As Dublin was at that time within the United Kingdom, this was not a foreign entry. TCD won the Visitors&#x27; and reached the final of the Ladies&#x27;.

The first international competitors came in 1878 when G.W. Lee of New Jersey and G. Lee of Boston entered the Diamonds, Shoe-wae-cae-mette BC of Monroe, Michigan, a crew of French Canadian watermen, entered the Stewards&#x27; and Columbia College entered the Stewards&#x27; and Visitors&#x27;.

Lee of Boston made little progress but Lee of New Jersey lost his heat in a very close race against Tom Edwards-Moss, the eventual winner. Shoe-wae-cae-mette, rowing with then-unusual swivel rowlocks, reached the final of the Stewards&#x27; but lost to London Rowing Club.

Columbia won the Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup, becoming the first foreign winners of a Henley trophy.

Accusations that both G.W. Lee and the Shoe-wae-cae-mette crew were not amateurs, led to a new, tighter, definition of amateurism in 1879. Any entries from outside the United Kingdom had to be made on or before 1 March and had to be &#x27;accompanied by a declaration made before Notary Public with regard to the profession of each member of the crew&#x27;, which then had to be certified by the British Consul, the mayor, or the chief authority of the locality.

Under these new rules, Shoe-wae-cae-mette were refused entry in 1879 as were Hillsdale Boat Club of Michigan in 1882.

The Germania Ruder Club of Frankfurt became the first entry from continental Europe in 1880, losing in a heat of the Grand to London Rowing Club.

Foreign entries grew over the next twenty years, to the consternation of some who felt that the regatta should be restricted to domestic entries only. There were also a number of disputes over amateurism and the two issues were often bound up together, as in this letter to &quot;The Times&quot; from Edmond Warre, headmaster of Eton College in 1901:

W.H. Grenfell MP proposed a motion for a special meeting of the Stewards that:

He proposed amendments to the rules restricting entries to the United Kingdom, and for the Goblets and Diamonds to British subjects domiciled in the UK. Warre seconded his proposals. The Amateur Rowing Association canvassed its member clubs on the proposal and the results were decisive: all clubs opposed the proposals save for Oxford University Boat Club which supported them with the caveat &#x27;Committee decide against foreign entries provided they can row other than Henley&#x27;.

At a special general meeting of the Stewards late in 1901, a motion moved by Colonel Makins &#x27;that in the opinion of this meeting it is inexpedient that any alteration in the rules of the regatta be made at present&#x27; was carried by 19 votes to 5.

In 1906, Royal Club Nautique de Gand of Belgium became the first foreign crew to win the Grand Challenge Cup. A different Ghent Club, Sport Nautique de Gand took the Grand in 1907.

In advance of 1908, with the Olympic Regatta to be held on the Henley course in mid-July, the Stewards announced a temporary rule change excluding overseas entries from the 1908 regatta (which would take place two weeks before the Olympics). This led to criticism of the Stewards in the British and American press, particularly since it would not permit the Belgians to defend the Grand. The Stewards pointed out in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that the decision had been taken before the 1907 regatta and after consultation with the Belgians. A letter from Oscar Gregoire, President of the Belgian Rowing Federation was quoted:

Overseas entries and wins at the regatta have continued to multiply. Since the 1960s, the open events in particular have almost exclusively become the province of national squad crews. Up to 2007, the Grand Challenge Cup had been won by overseas crews 46 times: 12 times by crews from Germany, 11 from the US, 9 from the USSR, 4 from Canada, 3 each from Belgium and Australia, 2 from the Netherlands, and 1 each from Switzerland, France, Bulgaria and Croatia.

Crews from the United States have also become frequent winners of the Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate, Temple Challenge Cup and Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup. In 1927, the Kent School Boat Club of Kent School in Connecticut was the first American secondary school to race at the Henley Royal Regatta.

===Women===

Women coxswains of male crews were permitted from 1975 and Christine Paul, cox of Furnivall Sculling Club in the Thames Challenge Cup, became the first female competitor in the regatta in that year.

There was much discussion about the introduction of events for women. The Stewards felt that they faced a dilemma: on the one hand it was argued that women&#x27;s rowing would never flourish while there were no women&#x27;s events at Britain&#x27;s premier regatta; on the other it was clear that open women&#x27;s events would be dominated by foreign competitors, while events closed to foreign competitors would not serve the desired purpose. Another difficulty was the length of the course. The standard distance for international women&#x27;s races was at that time 1000 m. It was clear that races over the full Henley course (2112 m) would not be appealing to women&#x27;s crews preparing for international championships.

Peter Coni, who was elected as Chairman of the regatta&#x27;s Committee of Management in 1978, was the first to allow women to race in exhibition races in 1983. However he deemed the experiment a failure and women were excluded until 1996 from the regatta. His ban caused a furore but he asserted that what he called the &quot;women&#x27;s squealing&quot; was &quot;more noisy, stupid and harmful to their cause than anything I can think of.&quot;

In 1978 Kingston Rowing Club sent in an entry for the Double Sculls Challenge Cup in the names of A.Hohl and P.Bird. The crew was in fact Great Britain internationals Astrid Ayling and Pauline Hart, who had made the entry under their maiden names. The regatta realised the subterfuge and Coni made a statement to the press in which he said that it was &quot;sad that a long-established club should think it reasonable behaviour to make a deliberately false declaration&quot;. He added that the stewards had no fear of the Sex Discrimination Act.

====Exhibition races====
In 1979, the Committee announced that there would be exhibition events for women in 1981, with entries by invitation only:

The entries were limited to four in each event (Coxed Fours and Double Sculls); two from abroad and two from the UK. The standard was good, but it was reckoned that the course from the Barrier start (over 600 m longer than the international standard 1000 m) contributed to there being no close verdicts.

In 1982, a Single Sculls Event was added and the start was moved to Fawley so that the course was closer to 1000 m. As the intermediate start installations were required for the shorter distance, the races had to take place during intervals in the normal racing programme (the lunch or tea breaks) which meant that only the dedicated stayed to watch. This was a pity, since the final of the Women&#x27;s Invitation Single was a highlight of the regatta, with Beryl Mitchell of Thames Tradesmen&#x27;s Rowing Club (World Silver medallist in 1981) beating Stephanie Foster of Waiariki Rowing Club, New Zealand (World Bronze medallist in 1982) by one length. Astrid Ayling was also able to race legitimately, winning the Invitation Double Sculls event with Rosie Clugston. The time taken to install the start equipment at Fawley combined with the relative lack of crowd interest meant that the Stewards took the decision not to repeat the experiment in 1983.

====Introduction of current events====
The change of the international distance to 2000 m and the addition of a fifth day to the regatta in 1986 allowed the Committee of Management to revisit the decision. In 1993 the regatta introduced an open Women&#x27;s Single Sculls event and from 1993 to 1996 this counted as a round of the FISA World Cup. The first winner was Maria Brandin of Sweden and she subsequently won a further four times. Fittingly, the prizegiver in 1993 was Peter Coni. In 1996, the Stewards purchased a silver cup as a challenge trophy and named it the Princess Royal Challenge Cup; it was presented for the first time in 1997.

An invitation event for women&#x27;s eights was added in 1998. In 2000, this was replaced by an open women&#x27;s eights event under the same rules as the Grand Challenge Cup. In 2002, the Remenham Challenge Cup was donated by Remenham Club as the trophy for this event. At the 2001 Regatta, an open event for Women&#x27;s Quadruple Sculls was introduced. In 2003, this event became known as the Princess Grace Challenge Cup in memory of Princess Grace of Monaco. Her father, John B. Kelly Sr., had been controversially excluded from the Diamond Sculls in 1920 because of the regattas rules on amateurism; her brother, John B. Kelly Jr. had won the Diamonds Sculls in 1947 and in 1949. Princess Grace was the Regatta prizegiver in 1981.

At the Stewards&#x27; meeting in December 2016, it was agreed to equalise the number of events for Men and Women in the Open category, leading to the creation of three new events: the Women&#x27;s Fours (Town Challenge Cup), the Women&#x27;s Pairs (Hambleden Pairs Challenge Cup) and the Women&#x27;s Double Sculls (Stonor Challenge Trophy). These were raced for the first time at the 2017 Regatta. In December 2019 the stewards announced the Island Challenge Cup (Student Womens Eight&#x27;s). With a further two events for junior women&#x27;s and club women&#x27;s eights announced to run in the 2021 regatta.

===Other regattas===

====1908 Olympic Regatta====

Henley hosted the rowing events of the London Olympic Games in mid-July 1908, two weeks after the Royal Regatta. The course was extended downstream and upstream, making it and . Events for single sculls, coxless pairs, coxless fours and eights were offered but only the eights produced an international final.

====1919 Peace Regatta====
A meeting arranged by Leander Club in January 1919 concluded that it was too soon to revive the regatta but asked the Stewards to arrange a &quot;Peace Regatta&quot; and a four-day regatta was duly staged. Competition was not for the usual Henley trophies but for different cups and some events were restricted to &#x27;armed services&#x27; crews. King George V presented a Cup to the victors of eight-oared event for servicemen crews. The Australian first AIF crew won the final against a crew of Oxford university alumni servicemen. In time, and in spite of dogged resistance from the Australian War Memorial, the Victorian Rowing Association petitioned the King to express his intention for the Cup, and at his command the King&#x27;s Cup became the perennial trophy to be presented to the Australian winning state representative men&#x27;s eight at the annual Australian Rowing Championships.

====1945 Royal Henley Regatta====
A two-day &#x27;Royal Henley Regatta&#x27; (as opposed to Henley Royal Regatta) was staged between VE Day and VJ Day. Crews rowed three-abreast over a shortened course beginning at the Remenham Barrier. As in 1919, different trophies to the usual regatta prizes were on offer.

====1948 Olympic Regatta====
The canoeing and rowing events for the 1948 London Olympic Games were contested in early August, a month after the Royal Regatta. The course was widened to accommodate three lanes and shortened to start at the top of Temple Island: the distance was approximately 1980 metres – 20 metres short of the standard international distance. Twenty seven nations competed and events for single sculls, double sculls, coxless pairs, coxed pairs, coxless fours, coxed fours and eights were offered.

The Olympic races in 2012 were held at Dorney Lake.

==Spectators==
The racing can be viewed from a number of locations along both banks of the Thames. Areas open to the general public are generally on the Berkshire (towpath) side of the river. Viewing opportunities on the other side of the river (Buckinghamshire) side are limited to the Phyllis Court club, private residences and areas for corporate entertainment. A channel of the river remains open throughout the regatta, hence racing can also be viewed from boats although mooring is tightly restricted.

===Stewards&#x27; Enclosure===
The enclosure situated on the Berkshire side, adjacent to the last part of the course and the finish line. It comprises two covered grandstands, a restaurant marquee, several bars, a bandstand and so on – all set in immaculately prepared lawns. It is only open to the Stewards of the Regatta, members of the Stewards&#x27; Enclosure and their guests. Overseas competitors are also given the opportunity to purchase tickets.

The Stewards&#x27; Enclosure as understood today, an enclosure open to members (elected by the Committee of Management of the Regatta) and their guests, came into being in 1919 with a membership of 300. This grew to 704 in 1939 and 1,500 in 1956. In 1980 the Stewards set a ceiling of 5,000. The waiting list for membership of the Stewards Enclosure is now several years long, although preference is given to people who have previously competed at the regatta. The waiting list has grown rapidly since the 1970s, when membership could be applied for and granted on the same day.

The Stewards&#x27; Enclosure is also known for a strict enforcement of its dress code. Men are required to wear a &quot;lounge suit, blazer and flannels, or evening dress, and a tie&quot;. In the past, women were required to wear a dress or skirt that covers their knees, and are &quot;encouraged to wear a hat&quot; (although women wearing hats is often frowned upon in higher rowing circles). Anyone not suitably dressed can be refused entry, no matter their prestige in rowing or elsewhere. Talking on mobile phones is also prohibited, though their use for emails, texts, and photography is allowed. In 2021, following a petition by University of Oxford rower Georgia Grant that gained over 1500 signatures, Henley Royal Regatta changed the dress code in the Stewards&#x27; Enclosure, which was begun in the late 1970s, to allow women to wear jackets or blazers with trousers, or trouser suits.

The regatta prizegiving takes place in the Stewards&#x27; Enclosure after the conclusion of racing on Sunday.

===Regatta Enclosure===
The Regatta Enclosure is situated immediately downstream of the Stewards Enclosure and further away from the finish. This enclosure is open to all on payment of the admission fee. Competitors gain free access to this area. There is no dress code.

===Remenham Club===

Remenham Club is situated a little over halfway along the course on the Berkshire side of the river. It is a social club run by and for members of seven rowing clubs on the Thames (the &quot;Founding Clubs&quot;): Kingston Rowing Club, London Rowing Club, Molesey Boat Club, Staines Boat Club, Thames Rowing Club, Twickenham Rowing Club and Vesta Rowing Club. Remenham Club is open only to its members and guests. It has a similar dresscode to the Stewards Enclosure, though the rules on women&#x27;s outfits are less restrictive.

===Upper Thames Rowing Club===
The clubhouse and frontage of the Upper Thames Rowing Club is on the Berkshire side of the river, immediately downstream of Remenham Club. It has historically had an informal atmosphere and no dresscode. It is only open to its members and their guests. In 2011, UTRC initiated the Upper Thames Enclosure to include a fairly relaxed dress code. UTRC lease the land downstream of their clubhouse to retailers, food vendors and bars.

===Remenham Farm===
Remenham Farm spans the riverside on the Berkshire side of the Thames from opposite the Fawley box to a point just upstream of the Barrier (approximately the 1100 m – 700 m points on the regatta course). It is owned by The Copas Partnership.

During the Regatta it runs hospitality enclosures at The Temple Island Enclosure and The Courtyard Enclosure, and bars including the &quot;Barn Bar&quot;. Remenham Farm is open to the public and entrance fees apply for certain enclosures, boat moorings are also available.

===Leander Club===

The clubhouse and grounds of Leander Club is situated on the Berkshire side of the river beyond the finish line of the regatta course, between the boat tents and Henley Bridge. Leander Club has a large marquee constructed for the regatta week and holds a large function on the Saturday night of the Regatta. It is open only to its members and their guests and has a formal dress code.

===Phyllis Court===
The Phyllis Court Club is situated on the Buckinghamshire side of the river, opposite the finish line. It is open only to its members and their guests. Although it has an excellent view of the finish line, it is not generally frequented by rowers, being principally a lawn sports club.

<text>A Yaranga (Chukchi: Яраӈы, &quot;Yarangy&quot;) is a tent-like traditional mobile home of some nomadic Northern indigenous peoples of Russia, such as Chukchi and Siberian Yupik.

A Yaranga is a cone-shaped or rounded reindeer-hide tent. It is built of a light wooden frame covered with reindeer skins or canvas sewn together.

The word &quot;yaranga&quot; comes from the Chukchi word for house: &quot;jaraŋə&quot; (Cyrillic: яраӈы). In Russian use, the terms chum, yurt and yaranga may be used interchangeably.

== Chauchu Chukchi ==

It is built of a light wooden frame covered with reindeer skins sewn together. A medium-size yaranga requires about 50 skins.

A large yaranga is hard to completely heat up. There is a smaller cabin called a polog built inside it, that can be kept warm and cozy.

== Siberian Yupik and Anqallyt Chukchi ==
The most numerous of the Siberian Yupik peoples, the Chaplino Eskimos (Ungazigmit) had a round, dome-shaped building for winter. Literature refers to it as a &quot;yaranga&quot;, the same term which the Chukchi people use, but the term used in the Chaplino Eskimos&#x27; language is mengteghaq (, extended Cyrillic: мыӈтыӷаӄ). Its framework was made of posts. Tarpaulins were used for covering the framework. The yaranga was surrounded by sod or planking around the base. There was a smaller cabin within the yaranga at the rear, used for sleeping and living. It was separated from the outer, cooler parts of the yaranga with haired reindeer skins and grass, supported by a cage-like framework. In the language of Chaplino Eskimos, it was called , a word borrowed from the Chukchi language. Household duties were done in the larger outer room of the yaranga in front of this inner building. In winter storms, and also at night, the dogs were there. This room for economical purposes was called .

There were also other types of buildings among Chaplino Eskimos: was a modernized type, and was used for summer.

<doc id="488726" wikidata="Q208486" url="?curid=488726" title="Golden lion tamarin">
<text>The golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia; ), also known as the golden marmoset, is a small New World monkey of the family Callitrichidae. Endemic to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil, the golden lion tamarin is an endangered species. The range for wild individuals is spread across four places along southeastern Brazil, with a recent census estimating 3,200 individuals left in the wild and a captive population maintaining about 490 individuals among 150 zoos.

== Physical characteristics ==

The golden lion tamarin gets its name from its bright reddish orange pelage and the extra long hairs around the face and ears which give it a distinctive mane. Its face is dark and hairless. The bright orange fur of this species does not contain carotenoids, which commonly produce bright orange colors in nature. The golden lion tamarin is the largest of the callitrichines. It is typically around and weighs around . There is almost no size difference between males and females. As with all callitrichines, the golden lion tamarin has claw-like nails, instead of the flat nails found in other monkeys and apes, although callitrichines do have a flat nail on the big toe. Tegulae enable tamarins to cling to the sides of tree trunks. It may also move quadrupedally along the small branches, whether through walking, running, leaping or bounding. This gives it a locomotion more similar to squirrels than primates.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The golden lion tamarin has a very limited distribution range, as over time they have lost all but 2%–5% of their original habitat in Brazil rain forest. Today, this tamarin is confined to three small areas of the tropical rain forest in southeastern Brazil: Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, Fazenda União Biological Reserve, and private land through the Reintroduction Program. The first population estimate made in 1972 approximated the count at between 400 and 500. By 1981 the population was reduced to less than 200. Surveys from as recently as 1995 suggested that there may have been at most only 400 golden lion tamarins left in the wild; but the population has since recovered to some 3200 in the wild. Tamarins live along the far southeast border of the country in the municipalities of Silva Jardim, Cabo Frio, Saquarema, and Araruama. However, they have been successfully reintroduced to the municipalities of Rio das Ostras, Rio Bonito, and Casimiro de Abreu. Tamarins live in coastal lowland forests less than above sea level. They can be found in hilltop forests and swamp forests.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The golden lion tamarin is active for a maximum of 12 hours daily. It uses different sleeping dens each day. By frequently moving their sleeping nests around, groups minimize the scent left behind, reducing the likelihood of predators finding them. The first activities of the day are traveling and feeding on fruits. As the afternoon nears, tamarins focus more on insects. By late afternoon, they move to their night dens. Tamarin groups use hollow tree cavities, dense vines or epiphytes as sleeping sites. Sites that are between off the ground are preferred. The golden lion tamarin tends to be active earlier and retire later in the warmer, wetter times of the year as the days are longer. During drier times, it forages for insects longer as they become scarcer.

Golden lion tamarins are characterized by using manipulative foraging under tree barks and epiphytic bromeliads. Their sites of foraging are usually distributed around their home ranges, which are large territories (averaging in which multiple foraging sites are located, to find sufficient resources over long periods of time. These areas are sufficient in size that even if there is overlap between the home range of two different groups, the interactions are minimal due to the distribution of the foraging sites (they spend 50% of their time in approximately 11% of their home range).
The golden lion tamarin has a diverse, omnivorous diet consisting of fruits, flowers, nectar, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates. They rely on microhabitats for foraging and other daily activities and tamarins will use bromeliads, palm crowns, palm leaf sheaths, woody crevices, lianas, vine tangles, tree bark, rotten logs, and leaf litters. The golden lion tamarin uses its fingers to extract prey from crevices, under leaves, and in dense growth; a behavior known as &quot;micromanipulation&quot;. It is made possible by elongated hands and fingers. Insects make up to 10–15% of its diet. Much of the rest is made of small, sweet, pulpy fruits. During the rainy season, the golden lion tamarin mainly eats fruit; however, during drier times, it must eat more of other foods like nectar and gums. Small vertebrates are also consumed more at these times as insects become less abundant.

=== Social structure ===

Golden lion tamarins are social and groups typically consist of 2-8 members. These groups usually consist of one breeding adult male and female but may also have 2–3 males and one female or the reverse. Other members include subadults, juveniles and infants of either sex. These individuals are typically the offspring of the adults. When there is more than one breeding adult in a group, one is usually dominant over the other and this is maintained through aggressive behavior. The dominance relationship between males and females depends on longevity in the group. A newly immigrated male is subordinate to the resident adult female who inherited her rank from her mother. Both males and females may leave their natal group at the age of four, however females may replace their mothers as the breeding adult, if they die, which will lead to the dispersal of the breeding male who is likely her father. This does not happen with males and their fathers. Dispersing males join groups with other males and remain in them until they find an opportunity to immigrate to a new group. The vast majority of recruits to groups are males. A male may find an opportunity to enter into a group when the resident male dies or disappears. Males may also aggressively displace resident males from their group; this is usually done by two immigrant males who are likely brothers. When this happens, only one of the new males will be able to breed and will suppress the reproduction of the other. A resident male may also leave a vacancy when his daughter becomes the breeding female and he must disperse to avoid inbreeding. Golden lion tamarins are highly territorial and groups will defend their home range boundaries and resources from other groups.

Tamarins emit &quot;whine&quot; and &quot;peep&quot; calls, which are associated with alarm and alliances respectively. &quot;Clucks&quot; are made during foraging trips or during aggressive encounters, whether directed at conspecifics or predators. &quot;Trills&quot; are used to communicate over long distances to give away an individual&#x27;s position. &quot;Rasps&quot; or &quot;screeches&quot; are usually associated with playful behavior. Tamarins communicate through chemicals marked throughout their territories. Reproductive males and females scent mark the most and their non-reproductive counterparts rarely do so. Dominant males use scent marking to show their social status and may suppress the reproductive abilities of the other males.

=== Reproduction ===

The mating system of the golden lion tamarin is largely monogamous. When there are two adult males in a group only one of them will mate with the female. There are cases of a male mating with two females, usually a mother and daughter. Reproduction is seasonal and depends on rainfall. Mating is at its highest at the end of the rainy season between late March to mid-June and births peak during the September–February rains. Females are sexually mature between the ages of 15–20 months but it is not until they are 30 months old that they can reproduce. Only dominant females can reproduce and will suppress the reproduction of the other females in the group. Males may reach puberty by 28 months. Tamarins have a four-month gestation period. Golden lion tamarin groups exhibit cooperative rearing of the infants. This is due to the fact that tamarins commonly give birth to twins and, to a lesser extent, triplets and quadruplets. A mother is not able to provide for her litter and needs the help of the other members of the group. The younger members of the groups may lose breeding opportunities but they gain parental experience in helping to rear their younger siblings. In their first 4 weeks, the infants are completely dependent on their mother for nursing and carrying. By week five, the infants spend less time on their mother&#x27;s back and begin to explore their surroundings. Young reach their juvenile stage at 17 weeks and will socialize other group members. The sub-adult phase is reached at 14 months, when a tamarin first displays adult behaviors.

=== Ecosystem roles ===

The golden lion tamarin has a mutualistic interaction with 96 species of plants found in the Atlantic Forest. This interaction is based on seed dispersal and food sources for the tamarins. The tamarins show repeat visits to those plants with abundant resources. They tend to move around their territories, and therefore, seeds are dispersed to areas far from the parent shadow, which is ideal for germination. Their seed distribution is important to forest regeneration, and genetic variability and survival of endangered plant species.

=== Predation ===
A study has shown that increased predation has caused significant decreases in the population numbers. A survey conducted in 1992 found the number of wild population of golden lion tamarins to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. Currently, the average group size includes 3.6 to 5.7 individuals and densities from 0.39 groups/km to 2.35 groups/km. These predatory attacks occur at the golden lion tamarin sleeping sites. The predators make those sleeping sites, which are mainly tree holes (about 63.6%), larger in order to attack the golden lion tamarins, sometimes wiping out the entire family. The preferred sleeping sites of most golden lion tamarins are tree holes in living trees next to other larger trees with a small percentage of canopy cover. These sleeping sites not only provide a place for sleep, but also offer protection and easy access to foraging sites. Most of the tree holes are lower to the ground, so they are easier to enter. Tree holes that are located in living trees are drier, warmer, and have a lower number of insects and therefore a decreased percentage of transmitted diseases. A smaller percentage of canopy coverage allows the golden lion tamarins to detect the predators faster, and being surrounded by other large trees allows them access to escape routes. Due to degradation of their habitats, there are fewer trees that can support entire social groups and some have to resort to using bamboo (17.5%), vine tangles (9.6%), and bromeliads (4.7%) as a sleeping site, making them more susceptible to predators. Golden lion tamarins are known to use different den sites, but do not change sites often. They are more likely to reuse secure sites that will offer protection. However, the disadvantage of doing so is that predators are able to learn where these sites are located. Golden lion tamarins also scent mark their den holes, so they can quickly return to them in the afternoon time when predators are most active. While excessive scent makes it easier for golden lion tamarins to find their sleeping sites, it also helps predators locate their prey. Moreover, increased deforestation has decreased habitat space, providing predators easy access to their prey, causing a decline in the golden lion tamarin population.

== Conservation ==

Threats to the golden lion tamarin population include illegal logging, poaching, mining, urbanization, deforestation, pet trading, infrastructure development and the introduction of alien species. In 1969, the number of individuals in the Atlantic Forest was found to have dropped to a low of 150 individuals. In 1975 the golden lion tamarin was listed under Appendix I of CITES, given to animals threatened with extinction that may be or are being affected by trade. The species was listed as Endangered by the IUCN in 1982, and by 1984 the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. and the World Wide Fund for Nature, through the Golden Lion Tamarin Association, began a reintroduction programme from 140 zoos worldwide. Despite the success of the project, the IUCN classification rose to Critically Endangered in 1996. By 2003 the successful establishment of a new population at União Biological Reserve enabled downgrading the species to endangered, but the IUCN warns that extreme habitat fragmentation from deforestation means the wild population has little potential for any further expansion. In an attempt to curb the golden lion tamarin&#x27;s precipitous decline, several conservation programs have been undertaken. The intent is to strengthen the wild population and maintain a secure captive population in zoos worldwide. The survival rate of re-introduced animals has been encouraging, but destruction of unprotected habitat continues.

=== Reintroduction ===
Because of the extensive habitat loss of the golden lion tamarin, the wild population reached endangered status in the early 1980s. Beginning in 1983, there has been a huge effort on behalf of scientists and conservationists to introduce captive-born golden lion tamarins back into the wild. With the help of the Brazilian government, conservationists established the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve and the União Biological Reserve as sites for reintroduction. The goals of the reintroduction process include increasing the size as well as the genetic diversity of the wild population, increasing the available range to better encompass the historic range of the tamarins in Brazil, and widening the scope of public awareness and education programs.

The first step of reintroduction begins with zoo free ranging programs, where tamarins have access to explore the entire zoo. However, they are kept on zoo grounds by the presence of a nest box, an ice box like container where their food is kept. When the tamarins are reintroduced in Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, they require a large amount of post-release training and veterinary care. For the first 6–18 months the reintroduced groups are monitored. Additionally, 1-2 tamarins from each group are radio collared to allow careful monitoring, and all reintroduced tamarins are tattooed and dye marked for easy identification.
=== Translocation ===
Secondly, in an effort to save the golden lion tamarins from extinction, some of the golden lion tamarins have been removed from small, isolated unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the golden lion tamarins into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The golden lion tamarins faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.

Despite the challenge of illness, the forty-two translocated golden lion tamarins&#x27; population grew to over 200 in União Biological Reserve. The number of wild golden lion tamarins is now up in the thousands in all reserves and ranches combined in Brazil. These numbers were once down in the 200s in 1991. By 2025, the number of golden lion tamarins that are protected is projected to be greater than 2000.

=== Effects of habitat loss ===
Golden lion tamarins are native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Their original habitat was located from the southern part of the state of Rio de Janeiro to the southern part of the state of Espirito Santo. However, deforestation of Atlantic Forest for commercial purposes, predation, and capture of the golden lion tamarins for animal trade and sale as pets has limited their population to about five municipalities across Rio de Janeiro. Most of the population is now found in the Poco des Antas Biological Reserve in Rio de Janeiro.

However, due to the deforestation and fragmentation of the Atlantic forest, their home ranges have decreased in size. The decrease in size has been reported in terms of fragmentation, and today the forest consists of thousands of fragments equaling only 8% of its former size. This directly affects their areas of foraging and subsequently, the amount of resources available.

==== Effect on juvenile behavior ====
The habitat of the tamarins also affects their behavior and social interactions. For example, the type of trees present has a significant effect on the behavior of juvenile golden lion tamarins. Their juvenile behavior is characterized by social play between individuals of different ages and species. This is a key aspect of their social, cognitive and motor skill development, and it influences their behavior when facing competition and predators; how they play mirrors the way they act when facing predatory or competitive interactions. Social play is observed more in large branches (&gt;10 cm) and vine tangles (4m above ground), which is considered safe for them, as they are less vulnerable to predators, compared to play in the dangerous areas including canopy branches and the forest floor. Therefore, deforestation affects the diversity in the forest and decreases the &quot;safe&quot; areas for play for the juvenile tamarins. As a result, play decreases and therefore the development of learned survivorship behaviors does as well. Also, if play is observed in the dangerous areas, the individuals are more exposed to predators, leading to a population decline; which resembles the effect of predation on their sleeping sites. The exposure to predation not only affects the juvenile tamarins but the adults as well, since it has been observed that play happens in the center of the group for protection of the young.

==== Increase in inbreeding ====
Additionally, this deforestation and fragmentation also leads to demographic instabilities, and an increased probability of inbreeding, consequently leading to inbreeding depression and a population decline. In the case of inbreeding, the problem lies in the increase of the isolated fragments where golden lion tamarins live. Inbreeding leads to low levels of genetic diversity and has a negative effect on survivorship; inbred offspring have a lower survivorship than non-inbred offspring. Fragmentation leads to a decline in dispersal and as a result, a decline in breeding with individuals of other groups. Consequently, inbreeding depression is observed in these populations. With delay breeding, the decrease and shortage of territory puts pressure on golden lion tamarins to disperse in order to find necessary resources and areas suitable for their survival. However, dispersal is risky and requires a lot of energy that could have been used for reproduction instead.

=== Yellow fever epidemic ===
A 2016-2018 yellow fever epidemic in southeastern Brazil had a significant impact on the golden lion tamarin population, reducing it by 32% to approximately 2,516 individuals. The tamarin population faced increased losses in forest areas that were of a larger size, with fewer edge zones and greater connectivity, all of which could create conditions conducive to the presence and spread of mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever. The impact of the outbreak was particularly devastating within the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, with the population of around 400 tamarins dropping to only 32. The cause of this decline was attributed to human activities, such as the expansion of the BR-101 highway, which brings a constant flow of traffic into the area. Researchers noted that the rapid spread of the disease across Brazil, from north to south, was due to human mobility, as infected people carried the virus with them.

In response to the epidemic, Brazilian scientists created a customized yellow fever vaccine specifically for golden lion tamarins. The vaccine campaign started in 2021 and had vaccinated over 300 tamarins by February 2023, with no reported adverse effects. The efficacy of the vaccine is similar to human vaccines, with 90-95% of retested monkeys showing immunity. By February 2023, the yellow fever outbreak had subsided, and the tamarin population had stabilized.

<text>Lemkos (; ; ; ) are an ethnic group inhabiting the Lemko Region (; ) of Carpathian Rus&#x27;, an ethnographic region in the Carpathian Mountains and foothills spanning Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland.

Lemkos are often considered to be a sub-group of Rusyns. In Ukraine, they are often identified as being a sub-group of Ukrainians. Members of these groups have historically also been given other designations such as &quot;Verkhovyntsi&quot; (Highlanders). Among people of the Carpathian highlands, communities speaking the same dialect will identify with a different ethnic label when crossing borders due to the influence of state-sponsored education and media. As well the same community may switch its preferred identification over time. In Slovakia between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, the number of people identifying as &quot;Ukrainian&quot; declined by 2,467 people (an 18.6% decrease) while those reporting Rusyn as their national identity increased by 7,004 people (a 40.6% increase). It is not clear however, if this refers to the same individuals switching their identification, more young first-time respondents choosing Rusyn, or migration.

The spoken language of the Lemkos, which has a code of &quot;rue&quot; under ISO 639-3, has been variously described as a language in its own right, a dialect of Ukrainian, or a dialect of Rusyn. In Ukraine, almost all Lemkos speak both Lemko and standard Ukrainian (according to the 2001 Ukrainian Census). Ukraine itself categorizes Lemkos as an ethnic subgroup of Ukrainians and not as a separate ethnicity. In the Polish Census of 2011, 11,000 people declared Lemko nationality, of whom 6,000 declared only Lemko nationality, 4,000 declared double national identity – Lemko-Polish, and 1,000 declared Lemko identity together with a non-Polish identity. I.D. Liubchyk (І.Д.Любчик) cites the number of around 700 thousand people with Lemko ancestry in the world, out of which 350 thousand are in Ukraine, 150 thousand in North America, 100 thousand in Poland, 100 thousand in Slovakia and 50 thousand in Post-Yugoslavia states. During the 2001 Ukrainian census, the majority of Lemkos identified themselves as Ukrainians.

==Etymology==

The ethnonym Lemko derives from the word (). The term is thought to have first originated as a nickname for users of the word &quot;lem&quot; in the borderlands between the Lemko and Boyko regions: the easternmost extent of usage of the word on the north side of the Carpathians. (On the south side of the Carpathians, the analogous nickname, &quot;lemak&quot;, was used in the &quot;lem-lyš&quot; isogloss area.) The ethnonym eventually entered use in academia and was first recorded in print with the 1834 publication of &quot;Grammatik der ruthenischen oder klein russischen Sprache in Galizien&quot; ( &#x27;Grammar of Ruthenian or Little Russian Language in Galicia&#x27;) by Yosyp Levytsky.

As an endonym, &quot;Lemko&quot; only entered wider use in the early 20th century. Prior to adopting the name, Lemkos would refer to themselves as &quot;Rusyns&quot; () or &quot;Rusnaks&quot; (). By the interwar period the popularity of &quot;Lemko&quot; as an endonym had grown, and appeared in periodicals such as &quot;Lemko&quot; and &quot;Naš Lemko&quot;.

Polish authorities also played a hand in popular adoption of the term leading up to World War II. Concerned by the potential for Ukrainian nationalism in the region, authorities sought to encourage Rusyn identity to counter it. This led to promotion of the exaggerated historicity of Lemkos as a distinctive ethnographic group and of their corresponding ethnonym.

In the aftermath of WWII, &quot;Lemko&quot; finally supplanted &quot;Rusyn&quot; and &quot;Rusnak&quot; as the term of choice for the Rusyns on the north face of the Carpathians in Poland.

==History==

Several hypotheses account for the origin of the Lemkos, however, like all Rusyns, they most probably have a diverse ethnogenetic origin. The Lemkos (and other Carpatho-Rusyns) are considered to be descendants of the medieval White Croats, affected by the migration of Rusyn-influenced Slovaks, and the Vlach/Romanian migrations in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The Lemko Region became part of Poland in the time of the medieval Piast dynasty but was frequently disputed with the neighbouring Rus&#x27;, as can be seen by taking the town of Sanok as an example: In 981CE Vladimir I of Kiev invaded the area and took it over from Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, in 1031 it went back to Rus&#x27;, and in 1340 Casimir III of Poland recovered it for Poland. The &quot;gord&quot; of Sanok is mentioned for the first time in Hypatian Codex in 1150.

Lemkos (or their progenitors) became an ethnic minority as part of the Austrian province of Galicia in 1772. Mass emigration from this territory to the Western hemisphere for economic reasons began in the late 19th century. 

Prior to World War I, Lemkos begun to develop conflicting national identities. While some adopted the Ukrainian nationality, others favored the concept of the All-Russian nation (the so-called &quot;Old Ruthenian&quot; identity). As the Greek Catholic Church was keen on promoting the Ukrainian identity, some of the pro-Russian Lemkos begun converting to the Orthodoxy. One of the most notable Orthodoxy converts was Saint Maxim Sandovich, a Lemko peasant who, after a brief experience as a Greek Catholic monk, converted to Orthodoxy, became a priest and begun spreading Orthodoxy in the region.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire was highly suspicious of the pro-Russian Lemkos, as well of Sandovich himself. This led to a series of imprisonments before the breakout of World War I, including one of Sandovich himself. After the war broke out, Sandovich was imprisoned again, and executed without trial.
In 1914, the Austro-Hungarian authorities created the Thalerhof internment camp, where they imprisoned Lemkos suspected of spying for the Russian Empire. During the war, 1767 people died in the Thalerhof camp.

In the immediate aftermath World War I, Lemkos founded two short-lived republics, the Lemko-Rusyn Republic in the west of Galicia, which had a russophile orientation, as well as attempted to merge with Czechoslovakia and the Komancza Republic, with a Ukrainophilic orientation, which attempted to merge with West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

During the time of the Second Polish Republic, the identity conflict between the Lemkos intensified. In 1926, following a conflict with their local Greek Catholic priest, the Lemko people of the village Tylawa underwent a massive conversion to Orthodoxy. This event, known as the Tylawa schism begun a wave of mass conversions in the region, during which many villages completely converted to Orthodoxy, while some remained either loyal to Eastern Catholicism or divided between the two religions. As the Catholic Church was unwilling to hand over their temples to the Orthodox Church, in many convertite villages new churches had to be built.

It is estimated that about 130,000 to 140,000 Lemkos were living in the Polish part of the Lemko Region in 1939. Depopulation of these lands occurred during the forced resettlement, initially to the Soviet Union (about 90,000 people) and later to Poland&#x27;s newly acquired western lands (about 35,000) in the Operation Vistula campaign of the late 1940s. This action was a state ordered removal of the civilian population, in a counter-insurgency operation to remove potential support for guerrilla war being waged by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in south-eastern Poland.

Some 5,000 Lemko families returned to their home regions in Poland between 1957 and 1958, (they were officially granted the right to return in 1956), the Lemko population in the Polish section of Lemkivschyna only numbers around 10,000–15,000 today. Some 50,000 Lemkos live in the western and northern parts of Poland, where they were sent to populate former German villages in areas ceded to Poland. Among those, 5,863 people identified themselves as Lemko in the 2002 census. However, 60,000 ethnic Lemkos may reside in Poland today. Within the Lemko Region, Lemkos live in the villages of Łosie, Krynica-Zdrój, Nowica, Zdynia, Gładyszów, Hańczowa, Zyndranowa, Uście Gorlickie, Bartne, Binczarowa and Bielanka. Additional populations can be found in Mokre, Szczawne, Kulaszne, Rzepedź, Turzańsk, Komańcza, Sanok, Nowy Sącz, and Gorlice.

In 1968 an open-air museum dedicated to Lemko culture was opened in Zyndranowa. Additionally, a Lemko festival is held annually in Zdynia.

==Religion==

An important aspect of Lemko culture is their deep commitment to Byzantine Christianity which was introduced to the Eastern Slavs from Byzantium via Moravia through the efforts of Saints Cyril and Methodius in the 9th century. Originally the Lemkos adhered to Orthodoxy, but in order to avoid latinization, directly entered into Union of Brest with the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century.

Most Lemkos today are Eastern rite or Byzantine-rite Catholics. In Poland they belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church with a Roman Catholic minority, or to the Ruthenian Catholic Church (see also Slovak Greek Catholic Church) in Slovakia. A substantial number belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Through the efforts of the martyred priest Father Maxim Sandovich (canonized by the Polish Orthodox Church in the 1990s), in the early 20th century, Eastern Orthodoxy was reintroduced to many Lemko areas which had accepted the Union of Brest centuries before.

The distinctive wooden architectural style of the Lemko churches is to place the highest cupola of the church building at the entrance to the church, with the roof sloping downward toward the sanctuary as opposed to their neighbouring sub-ethnic groups such as the Boykos who place the highest cupola in the middle. Both groups styles have three cupola with numerous eaves.

==Language/dialect==


The Slavic dialects of Central Europe form (or formed, prior to standardization) a dialect continuum with few distinct boundaries between neighbouring varieties. However the question of language boundaries has become a controversial political issue since the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later the Soviet Union into &quot;nation states&quot;, each having only one official language. The Lemko dialects share many features with other Carpathian ones, which are often grouped together as the Rusyn language by outside linguists.

The Lemko dialect has been influenced greatly by the languages spoken by geographically neighboring peoples and ruling elites, so much so that some consider it a separate entity.Lemko speech includes some patterns matching those of the surrounding Polish and Slovak languages.

Metodyj Trochanovskij developed a Lemko Primer (&quot;Bukvar: Perša knyžečka dlja narodnŷch škol&quot;, 1935) and a First Reader (&quot;Druha knyžečka dlja narodnŷch škol&quot;, 1936) for use in schools in the Lemko-speaking area of Poland. In 1934, Lemko was introduced as the language of instruction in schools in the Lemko region. The pupils were taught from textbooks prepared by Trochanovskij and published by the State Publishing House. However, shortly before the outbreak of World War II Polish authorities replaced them with Ukrainian texts. Important fieldwork on the Lemko dialect was carried out by the Polish linguist Zdzisław Stieber before their dispersal.

According to the Central Statistical Office of Poland, in the school year 2010–2011, Lemko was taught as a first language in twenty primary schools and interschool groups, and ten schools and interschool groups at junior high level, with 188 students attending classes.

In the late 20th century, some Lemkos/Rusyns, mainly emigres from the region of the southern slopes of the Carpathians in modern-day Slovakia, began codifying a standard grammar for the Lemko dialect, which was presented on the 27 January 1995 in Prešov, Slovakia. In 2013 the famous novel &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was translated into Lemko by Petro Krynyckij.

==Lemkos in fiction==
Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s short story &quot;The Terrible Vengeance&quot; ends at Kriváň, now in Slovakia and pictured on the Slovakian euro, in the heart of the Lemko Region in the Prešov Region. Avram Davidson makes several references to the Lemko people in his stories. Anna Bibko, mother-in-law of the protagonist of &quot;All Shall Be Well; and All Shall Be Well; and All Manner of Things Shall Be Well&quot;, is a Lemko &quot;guided by her senses of traditionalism and grievance, not necessarily in that order&quot;.

In the critically acclaimed movie &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; the wedding reception scene was filmed in Lemko Hall in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, which had a significant immigrant population of Lemkos at one time. The three main characters’ surnames, however, appear to be Russian, possibly Polish and Ukrainian (Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Vronsky, from Polish &quot;Wroński&quot;, Steven Pushkov, and Nikonar &quot;Nick&quot; Chevotarevich) and the wedding was filmed inside St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral, which is also located in Tremont.

==Location==
The Lemkos&#x27; homeland is commonly referred to as the Lemko Region (; ; ). Up until 1945, this included the area from the Poprad River in the west to the valley of Oslawa River in the east, areas situated primarily in present-day Poland, in the Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian Voivodeships (provinces). This part of the Carpathian mountains is mostly deforested, which allowed for an agrarian economy, alongside such traditional occupations as ox grazing and sheep herding.

The Lemko region became part of Poland in medieval Piast times. Lemkos were made part of the Austrian province of Galicia in 1772. This area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its dissolution in 1918, at which point the Lemko-Rusyn Republic (&quot;Ruska Lemkivska&quot;) declared its independence. Independence did not last long however, and the republic was incorporated into Poland in 1920.

As a result of the forcible deportation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union after World War II, the majority of Lemkos in Poland were either resettled from their historic homeland to the prеviously German territories in the North-Western region of Poland or to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Only those Lemkos living the Prešov Region in present-day Slovakia continue to live on their ancestral lands, with the exception of some Lemkos who resettled in their homeland in the late 1950s and afterward. Lemkos are/were neighbours with Slovaks, Carpathian Germans and &quot;Lachy sądeckie&quot; (Poles) to the west, Pogorzans (Poles) and &quot;Dolinians&quot; (a Rusyn subgroup) to the north, Boykos (a Ukrainians subgroup) to the east, and Slovaks to the south.

<text>Odile of Alsace, also known as Odilia and Ottilia, born - at Mont Sainte-Odile), is a saint venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. She is a patroness saint of good eyesight and of the region of Alsace.

Saint Odile is commemorated with a feast day on 13 December and on 14 December in Alsace. Most calendars mark the feast day as 14 December.

==Biography==
Odile was the daughter of Etichon (also known as Athich, Adalrich or Aldaric), Duke of Alsace and founder of the Etichonid noble family. According to the 9th century &quot;Life of Odilia&quot;, she was born blind. Her father did not want her because she was a girl and handicapped, so her mother Bethswinda had her brought to Palma (perhaps present day Baume-les-Dames in Burgundy), where she was raised by peasants there.

A tenth-century legend relates that when she was twelve, Odile was taken into a nearby monastery. Whilst there, the itinerant bishop Erhard of Regensburg was led, by an angel it was said, to Palma where he baptised her Odile (Sol Dei), whereupon she miraculously recovered her sight. Her younger brother Hughes had her brought home again, which enraged Etichon so much that he accidentally killed his son. Odile miraculously revived him, and left home again.

She fled across the Rhine to a cave or cavern in one of two places (depending on the source: the Musbach valley near Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, or Arlesheim near Basel, Switzerland.) Supposedly, the cliff face opened up in order to rescue her from her plight. In the cave, she hid from her father. When he tried to follow her, he was injured by falling rocks and gave up.

When Etichon fell ill, Odile returned to nurse him. He finally gave up resisting his headstrong daughter and founded the Augustine monastic community of Mont Sainte-Odile Abbey (also known as Hohenburg Abbey) for her. in the Hochwald (Hohwald), Bas-Rhin, where Odile became abbess and where Etichon was later buried. Some years later Odile was shown the site of Niedermünster at the foot of the mountain by St. John the Baptist in a vision. There she founded a second monastery, including a hospital. Here, the head and an arm of St. Lazarus of Marseille were displayed but later transferred to Andlau. The buildings of the Niedermünster burned down in 1542, but the local well is still said to cure eye diseases.

St. Odile died around 720 at the convent of Niedermünster. At the insistent prayers of her sisters she was returned to life, but after describing the beauties of the afterlife to them, she took communion by herself and died again. She was buried at Ste. Odile. She was succeeded as abbess of Mont Sainte-Odile Abbey by her niece, Saint Eugenia of Alsace.

==Veneration==

The cult of St. Odile spread rapidly, and spread outside France to Germany. She was mentioned in the litanies of Freising, Utrecht and Ratisbon at least from the 9th century. Amongst the common people, pilgrimages to her shrine were popular, and were by no means limited to the masses; from Charlemagne onwards, emperors also conducted pilgrimages in her honour. Indeed, Charlemagne granted immunity to the convent at Hohenberg, which was later officially ratified by Louis the Pious on 9 March 837.

By the 14th century, Odile&#x27;s cult had grown so strong that her relics were split and removed to Corbie, Prague and Einsiedeln. She enjoyed especial popularity in Strasbourg. The strength of her cult is supposed to have been a result of her patronage of the blind and partially sighted, which was especially pertinent in a time before the invention of spectacles.

St. Odile was long considered the patron of Alsace and eye patients, at least since before the 16th century; however, this was made official in 1807 by pope Pius VII. Her feast day is 13 December.

==Cultural representations==

As the patroness of ocular afflictions and ear diseases, St. Odile is often depicted with a pair of eyes on a book - particularly fine examples of such images can be found from the 14th-16th centuries. A notable sculpture of her exists at the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, which portrays the event of her baptism. The larkspur is connected to St. Odile as well and is believed to cure eye diseases in popular medicine and superstition.

A &quot;Life of St. Odilia&quot; was written about the 10th century, mostly dedicated to the retelling of her legend, the antagonism of her father, and the death of her brother Hughes. From internal evidence, it seems that it was based upon an earlier, 8th century &quot;Life&quot;; however, as an account of her life, it cannot be considered to have much historical validity.

==Legacy==
Mont Sainte-Odile and Sint Odiliënberg, is named for her.

=== Places dedicated to Saint Odile ===

==== St. Odile pilgrim&#x27;s chapel, near Freiburg ====
In the valley of the Musbach, a small river that runs near Freiburg im Breisgau, pilgrims have venerated St. Odile for centuries. In ca. 1300 a chapel was built; the present church was started in 1503 and finished in the 18th century. The church is built adjacent to a spring whose water contains radon, which was wrongly thought to be beneficial to eyesight. In the 18th century the spring became part of the church building: in 1714 the source was included by enlarging the building, in 1780 the cave with the source in it was renovated and decorated in the fanciful style of the time.

<text>Abbott Laboratories is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, in the United States. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off its research-based pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie in 2013.

Abbott&#x27;s products include Pedialyte, Similac, BinaxNOW, Ensure, Glucerna, ZonePerfect, FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip.

==History==


=== Foundation and early history ===

In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practising physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was formulating the active part of alkaloid medicinal plants—morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine—as tiny &quot;dosimetric granules&quot;, producing more consistent and effective dosages for patients than the liquid preparations previously used, which deteriorated over time. In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.

=== International expansion ===
Abbott&#x27;s first international affiliate was in London in 1907; the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada. Abbott India Ltd was originally incorporated on August 22, 1944, as Boots Pure Drug Company (India) Ltd. The company name was changed to The Boots Company (India) Ltd on November 1, 1971, and to Boots Pharmaceuticals Ltd on January 1, 1991. On October 31, 1995, the name was changed to Knoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd and on July 1, 2002, to their present name Abbott India Ltd. Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently, two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products. In 1962 Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it merged with Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, and Richard Ross gained a seat on Abbott&#x27;s board of directors until his retirement in 1983. The acquisition of Ross brought Similac under the Abbott umbrella. In the years following the acquisition, Pedialyte and Ensure were introduced as nutritional products by Ross Laboratories while under Abbott&#x27;s leadership.

In 1965, Abbott&#x27;s expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France.

According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, &quot;In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer&quot;.

In 1985, Abbott partnered with the Japanese company Taisho Pharmaceutical for the international rights to clarithromycin, a second-generation macrolide antibiotic, and gained FDA approval for the drug under the brand name Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005, and has been added to the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

=== 21st century ===
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF, for $6.9 billion. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, it sold Clear Eyes and Murine brands to Prestige Brands. In 2004, it acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation purchasing the vascular device division of Guidant.

In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash. At the time of acquisition Kos marketed Niaspan (extended release niacin), and Advicor (niacin/lovastatin).

In 2007 the company was to sell two diagnostics divisions to General Electric, but the parties did not agree on the terms of the acquisition.

On 8 September 2007, the company sold the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to UK manufacturer Aesica Pharmaceuticals.

Abbott&#x27;s Ross Products was renamed Abbott Nutrition in 2007.

In 2009 Abbott acquired Advanced Medical Optics of Santa Ana, California, selling it to Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2017. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In February 2010, Abbott acquired the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A. for US$6.2 billion (€4.5 billion), gaining many additional pharmaceutical products and an increased presence in emerging markets.

In 2010 the company acquired Hollywood, Florida-based laboratory information management system company STARLIMS for $123 million, $14 per share. That year Abbott said it would buy Piramal Healthcare of India&#x27;s large generic drugs unit for $3.72 billion.

=== Spin-offs ===
In 2004, Abbott spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company, Hospira, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2015.

In October 2011, Abbott planned to separate into two companies, one for research-based pharmaceuticals (AbbVie) and the other for medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and diagnostics, with the latter retaining the Abbott name. Abbott Nutrition, whose products include Similac, Pedialyte, Glucerna, and Ensure, also retained the Abbott name. In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012. The separation was effective as of 1 January 2013, and AbbVie was listed in the New York Stock Exchange.

=== Further developments ===
On 16 May 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.

In December 2014, the company acquired Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $410 million, which included three manufacturing facilities. Abbott, which already employed 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.

In September 2015, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of Tendyne Holdings, Inc., a private medical device company focused on developing minimally invasive mitral valve replacement therapies. Tendyne was acquired for a total transaction value of $250 million. In January 2020, the Tendyne Mitral Valve became the world&#x27;s first commercially available solution for Mitral Valve Replacement Technology. Abbott obtained CE Mark for the device which now makes it possible to implant it in Europe outside of a clinical setting. The US clinical study for federal approval is still ongoing.

In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion. In January 2017, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash &amp; 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85). On 3 October 2017, the company closed the Alere acquisition making the surviving entity the market leader player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover. With the acquisition of Alere, the company also obtained the subsidiary Arriva Medical, which is the largest mail-order diabetic supplier. Arriva Medical announced business closure after Abbott acquisition effective 31 December 2017.

In 2017, the FDA approved Abbott&#x27;s FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring system, which reads glucose levels through a self-applied sensor without finger pricks.

In August 2018, Reuters reported that Abbott Laboratories was among the top five companies for branded generic drugs in Russia.
In November 2018, Abbott received United States FDA clearance for FreeStyle LibreLink, a glucose reader smartphone app.

In January 2019 purchased Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. which is developing a less-invasive replacement heart valve for people with mitral valve disease.

In March 2020, Abbott received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US FDA for a SARS-CoV-2 test during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tester is small (comparable to a small toaster), and produces results within 13 minutes. Detroit received these tests on April 1, 2020. Also in March, the firm received EUA for a molecular COVID-19 test that runs on its m2000 RealTime lab-based platform. In April 2020, itt received EUA from the FDA for its third COVID-19 test, an antibody test that helps detect the IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using the company&#x27;s ARCHITECT laboratory instruments. In May 2020, it received EUA from the FDA for another lab-based COVID-19 antibody test that helps detect the IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using the company&#x27;s Alinity i system. Also in May, it received EUA from the FDA for a molecular COVID-19 test for use on the company&#x27;s Alinity molecular laboratory instrument.

In August 2020, Abbott received EUA from the FDA for its credit-card-sized $5, 15-minute, portable COVID-19 antigen test, BinaxNOW, compatible with the NAVICA mobile app.

In October 2020, Abbott received EUA from the FDA for its lab-based COVID-19 IgM antibody blood test. In December 2020, its rapid (20&#x27;) antigen BinaxNOW COVID-19 test received EUA from the FDA for home use. &quot;Forbes&quot; reported in January 2021 that the firm had delivered more than 400 million COVID-19 tests, 300 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

In September 2021, Abbott acquired Walk Vascular, LLC.

In January 2022, Abbott introduced Lingo, a line of consumer biowearable sensors that collects a range of biological readings to optimize exercise and nutrition regimens.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abbott Laboratories continued its business operations in Russia while suspending non-essential activities such as new investments and advertising. Research from Yale School of Management evaluating corporate responses to the invasion placed Abbott in the &quot;Buying Time&quot; category with a &quot;Grade D&quot; rating, indicating that it postponed future investments and marketing while continuing substantive business in Russia.

In May 2022, Abbott received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for FreeStyle Libre 3, the latest version of its continuous glucose monitor.

In August 2022, Abbott received FDA approval for Proclaim Plus, a multi-use spinal cord stimulation system designed to target chronic pain. The Proclaim Plus system is capable of treating six independent pain sites and has a recharge-free battery life of up to 10 years.

In October 2022, Abbott received EUA from the FDA for its real-time PCR test Alinity m MPXV; this marks the first FDA emergency authorization for commercial monkeypox testing.

On July 5, 2023, Abbott received approval from the FDA for its leadless pacemaker system Aveir DR. In August, the company announced it would acquire Bigfoot Biomedical.

Today, Abbott operates in over 160 countries and sources from at least 62 suppliers worldwide.

===Accounts===
For the fiscal year 2021, Abbott Laboratories reported earnings of US$7.071 billion, with an annual revenue of US$43.075 billion, which grew 24.5% on an organic basis versus the year prior. Abbott&#x27;s year-end 2021 stock price was $140.74.
===Taxation===

On 19 March 2019, it was reported that Abbott was a long-term user of the Double Irish tax structure, a legal but controversial Irish taxation tool used by US multinationals to reduce US corporate taxes on non-U.S profits. Abbott&#x27;s Irish holding company, the Bermuda-resident Abbott Laboratories Vascular Enterprises (ALVE), employed no staff in 2017, but was responsible for distributing Abbot&#x27;s products and licensing its technology worldwide. Newly filed accounts showed that ALVE was incorporated in 2003 and had a pre-tax profit of €2 billion in 2016 and 2017 on revenues of €5.2 billion; no taxation was paid on these profits. ALVE had never filed accounts in Ireland since 2003 as it was structured as an unlimited liability company (ULC); however, new EU accounts directives required ALVE to file Irish accounts in 2018. These accounts listed ALVE&#x27;s registered office as the address of Ireland&#x27;s largest tax-law firm, Matheson, who have been identified with Double Irish tax structures for Microsoft and Google.

In September 2021, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; reported that Abbott was using the Single Malt tax tool to shield profits on its COVID-19 testing kits.

==Litigation and controversies==

=== Leuprorelin ===
In October 2001, the US Department of Justice, states attorneys general, and TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, settled criminal and civil charges against TAP related to federal and state Medicare fraud and illegal marketing of the drug leuprorelin. TAP paid a total of $875 million, a record high pharmaceutical settlement. This comprised $290 million for violating the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, $559.5 million to settle federal fraud charges for overcharging Medicare, and $25.5 million reimbursement to 50 states and Washington, D.C., for filing false claims with the states&#x27; Medicaid programs. The case arose under the False Claims Act with claims filed by Douglas Durand, a former TAP vice president of sales, and Joseph Gerstein, a doctor at Tufts University&#x27;s HMO practice. Durand, Gerstein, and Tufts shared $95 million of the settlement.

There have since been various suits concerning leuprorelin use, none successful. These lawsuits have focused on either the over-prescription of the drug or the lack of warnings about its potential side effects. Between 2010 and 2013, the FDA updated the Lupron drug label to include new safety information on the risk of thromboembolism, loss of bone density and convulsions. The FDA then said that the benefits of leuprorelin outweighed its risks when used according to its approved labeling. From 2017 the FDA evaluated leuprorelin&#x27;s connection to pain and discomfort in musculoskeletal and connective tissue.

===Humira===
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to &quot;initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira&quot; (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.

Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million in lieu of royalties the MRC, the Scripps Research Institute and Stratagene would have received on sales of Humira after December 2004. Some of this sum was to be passed to its partners in development, including US$191 million for the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), plus a further $7.5 million over five years from 2006 providing that Humira remained on the market.

=== Operation Headwaters ===
In October 2003, Abbott Laboratories and two of its units agreed to pay a total of $600 million in the first combined civil settlement and criminal conviction for offering kickbacks to agents of &quot;Operations Headwaters&quot;, an undercover investigation by the FBI.

===Depakote===
On 2 October 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. The court also sentenced Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision. Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty. Following Abbott&#x27;s spinoff of its research-based pharmaceuticals business, it no longer owns the commercial rights and associated responsibilities for Humira and Depakote.

=== Glucose monitors ===
In 2021, two of Abbott Laboratories&#x27; subsidiaries, Arriva Medical LLC and Alere Inc, had to pay $160m to resolve claims that they had fraudulently billed Medicare for glucose monitors. The US Department of Justice said that Arriva used free glucose monitors to induce patients to order more consumable supplies, then took kickbacks on the increased sales. The company was also accused of charging Medicare for glucose monitors given to patients who were ineligible, or even dead.

In September 2024, it launched Lingo, an over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor in the United States. The sensor is manufactured for adults who do not take insulin.

=== Plant shutdown ===
In February 2022, Abbott recalled baby formulas from the market and shut down their Michigan plant after complaints of illness and death in infants caused by serious bacterial infections. Following Abbotts&#x27; meeting the initial requirement of the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, the facility reopened in June 2022.

=== Deep Brain Stimulation Device Recall ===
On July 18, 2023, Abbott recalled its Proclaim and Infinity IPGs due to complaints from patients who are unable to exit MRI mode. The use of the affected IPGs may require surgery to remove the device and replace it with a new device.

There have been 186 reported incidents and 73 reported injuries. There have been no reports of death. Noted by Gita Amar, a PR representative for Abbott Laboratories on this issue. &quot;The company has communicated this action to physicians and regulatory bodies. No products need to be returned to the company or replaced.&quot;

==Sponsorship==
In 2015 Abbott became the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.

<doc id="488734" wikidata="Q625748" url="?curid=488734" title="Holofernes">
<text>Holofernes (; ) was an invading Assyrian general in the Book of Judith, who was beheaded by Judith who entered his camp and decapitated him while he was intoxicated.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Holofernes&#x27; is derived from the Old Persian name , meaning &quot;with wide-reaching glory,&quot; and is composed of the terms , meaning &quot;wide,&quot; and , meaning &quot;glory.&quot;

==Biblical account==
According to the Book of Judith, Holofernes had been dispatched by Nebuchadnezzar to take vengeance on Israel, which had withheld assistance in his most recent war. Having occupied every land along the coastline, Holofernes outlawed the worship of any god other than Nebuchadnezzar. Despite being warned against attacking the People of Israel by Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, Holofernes laid siege to the city of Bethulia. The city almost fell to the invading army because Holofernes&#x27; advance stopped the water supply to Bethulia, which led to its people encouraging their rulers to capitulate. The leaders vowed to surrender if no help arrived within five days. Bethulia was saved by Judith, a Judean widow, who entered the camp of Holofernes, seduced him, and got him drunk before beheading him. She returned to Bethulia with the severed head. The assassination of Holofernes led to the defeat of his army.

==Identification==
The Roman Catholic Church has traditionally maintained the historicity of the Book of Judith, setting it to the reign of Manasseh of Judah. As a result, this Holofernes would be the commander-in-chief of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s armies. Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin has speculated that the book of Judith could be a roman à clef, a historical record with different names for people and places, which would explain the different names.

There are historical references to a &quot;Holofernes&quot; in the Persian king Artaxerxes III Ochus&#x27;s army, which led some to speculate that this is the Holofernes described in this book. However, this idea is generally rejected as implausible.

Because the Hebrew manuscripts from the Middle Ages refer to the Maccabean Revolt, Hebrew versions of the tale in the Megillat Antiochus and the Chronicles of Jerahmeel identify &quot;Holofernes&quot; as Nicanor; the Greek version used &quot;Holofernes&quot; as deliberately cryptic substitute, similarly using &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; for Antiochus.

==In popular culture==
Holofernes is depicted in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&#x27;s Tale&quot; in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, and in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, in which Holofernes is to be found on the Terrace of Pride as an example of &quot;pride cast down&quot;, XII.58–60. As a painter&#x27;s subject he offers the chance to contrast the flesh and jewels of a beautiful, festively attired woman with the grisly head of the victim, a deuterocanonical parallel to the Yael sequence in the Hebrew Bible, as well as the New Testament vignette of Salome with the head of John the Baptist.

There is also a mention to Holofernes in the song That Unwanted Animal by The Amazing Devil.

German pop rock band Wir sind Helden&#x27;s singer Judith Holfelder-Roy chose the stage name Judith Holofernes in reference to both Holofernes and his assassin.

Welsh Death Metal band Venom Prison’s 2020 album, Primeval, features a song titled “Slayer of Holofernes”.

<doc id="488737" wikidata="Q732034" url="?curid=488737" title="Stole (vestment)">
<text>The stole is a liturgical vestment of various Christian denominations, which symbolizes priestly authority; in Protestant denominations which do not have priests but use stoles as a liturgical vestment, however, it symbolizes being a member of the ordained. It consists of a band of colored cloth, usually of silk, about seven and a half to nine feet long and three to four inches wide, whose ends may be straight or may broaden out in the shape of a spade or bell. The center of the stole is worn around the back of the neck and the two ends hang down parallel to each other in front, either attached to each other or hanging loose. The stole is almost always decorated in some way, usually with two crosses, or sometimes another significant religious design. It is often decorated with contrasting galloons (ornamental trim) and fringe is usually applied to the ends of the stole following . A piece of white linen or lace may be stitched onto the back of the collar as a sweat guard, which can be replaced more cheaply than the stole itself.

== Etymology and history ==
The word &quot;stole&quot; derives via the Latin &quot;stola&quot;, from the Greek στολή (&quot;stolē&quot;), &quot;garment&quot;, originally &quot;array&quot; or &quot;equipment&quot;.

The stole was originally a kind of shawl that covered the shoulders and fell down in front of the body; on women they were often very large. After being adopted by the Church of Rome around the seventh century (the stole having also been adopted in other locales prior to this), the stole gradually became narrower and started to feature more ornate designs, developing into a mark of dignity. Nowadays, the stole is usually wider and can be made from a wide variety of material.

There are many theories as to the &quot;ancestry&quot; of the stole. Some say it came from the tallit (Jewish prayer mantle), because it is very similar to the present usage (as in the minister puts it on when he or she leads in prayer) but this theory is no longer regarded much today. More popular is the theory that the stole originated from a kind of liturgical napkin called an &quot;orarium&quot; (cf. orarion) very similar to the sudarium. In fact, in many places the stole is called the orarium. Therefore, it is linked to the napkin used by Christ in washing the feet of his disciples, and is a fitting symbol of the yoke of Christ, the yoke of service.

The most likely origin for the stole, however, is to be connected with the scarf of office among Imperial officials in the Roman Empire. As members of the clergy became members of the Roman administration (see Constantine I and Christianity) they were granted certain honors, one specifically being a designator of rank within the imperial (and ecclesiastical) hierarchy. The various configurations of the stole (including the pallium or the omophorion) grew out of this usage. The original intent, then was to designate a person as belonging to a particular organization and to denote their rank within their group, a function which the stole continues to perform today. Thus, unlike other liturgical garments which were originally worn by every cleric or layman, the stole was a garment which was specifically restricted to particular classes of people based on occupation.

Stoles were already used in pre-Roman Italic religion. In the Umbrian Iguvine Tablets, a stole was used by an officiating priest during offering rituals. It was worn on the shoulder during a sacrifice, and then placed on an offering cake:

&quot;While you are slaying it, wear a stole on your right shoulder. When you have slain it, place (the stole) upon the mefa cake. While you are presenting it, wear the stole on your right shoulder. Present grain-offerings and sacrifice with mead.&quot; (ibid, pg. 164)

== Symbolism and color ==
Together with the cincture and the now mostly defunct maniple, the stole symbolizes the bonds and fetters with which Jesus was bound during his Passion; it is usually ornamented with a cross. Another version is that the stole denotes the duty to spread the Word of God. In the Catholic Church&#x27;s Latin liturgical rites, the priests&#x27; stole represents priestly authority, while the diaconal stole (which is diagonally and conjoined at the side) represents service. In the Eastern Orthodox Church the symbolism is the same, though it also symbolizes particularly the anointing with oil which accompanies ordination, and which flows down the body as the stole does.

The stole worn for the celebration of the Holy Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours matches the liturgical color of the day.

== Use ==

=== Western Christianity ===
==== Roman Catholic ====
In the Latin Catholic tradition the stole is the vestment that marks recipients of Holy Orders. It is conferred at the ordination of a deacon, by which one becomes a member of the clergy after the suppression of the tonsure and minor orders after the Second Vatican Council.

A bishop or other priest wears the stole around his neck with the ends hanging down in front, while the deacon places it over his left shoulder and ties it cross-wise at his right side, similar to a sash.

Before the reform of the liturgy after the Second Vatican Council, priests who were not bishops were required to cross the stole over the breast (as pictured below), but only at Mass or at other functions at which a chasuble or cope was worn. It is now often worn hanging straight down without being crossed across the breast. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, which is the liturgical law for the Roman Catholic Church concerning the Mass, no longer makes explicit that a Priest must cross his stole. It states, &quot;the stole is worn by the Priest around his neck and hanging down in front of his chest...&quot; (GIRM §340). Unless there is a law promulgated by a particular diocese or other ordinary, it is left to the priest to interpret what this means. On solemn occasions, the Pope wears, as part of his choir dress, a special stole of state highly decorated and bearing his personal coat of arms.

For the celebration of the Mass, the principal celebrant as well as concelebrants wear the stole over the alb but under the chasuble. Likewise, the deacon wears the stole over the alb but under the dalmatic. The stole is also worn over the surplice or alb for the distribution and reception of Holy Communion.

The priest or deacon who presides in paraliturgical celebrations, such as the Stations of the Cross, usually wears the stole over the surplice (or alb), and always under the cope.

In Catholic practice, the vesting prayer for the stole is: 

==== Protestant ====
In Protestant churches, the stole is most often seen as the symbol of ordination and the office of the ministry of Word and Sacrament. Stoles are often given by the congregation (sometimes hand-made or decorated) as a love gift at ordination or at other life milestones. Generally, Protestant clergy wear the stole in the same manner as Catholic priests—around the back of the neck with the ends hanging down the front (though not crossed). Stoles are commonly worn by ordained ministers in Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist denominations. In less liturgical Protestant denominations, such as the Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and Unitarian Universalist, clergy traditionally wore either a pulpit robe (with a preaching scarf) or simply a suit during church services, but the wearing of stoles by clergy has increased since the mid-1970s.

===== Anglican =====


During the English Reformation, the stole, along with most other sacramental vestments, were removed from the Church of England. The Oxford Movement began an interest in pre-Reformation worship, and eventually the stole (along with other vestments) were revived among Anglo-Catholic clergy. Though today, it is not uncommon for a Low Church priest to wear a stole with choir dress, stricter ones may still object to its use, and wear the tippet instead. This re-introduction of the stole continued to cause concern even in the 20th century. During the 1950s, the Bishop of London, William Wand, and the Bishop of Oxford, Kenneth Kirk, refused to ordain any candidate to the priesthood who would not wear a stole. Many candidates objected to wearing it because of their theological and traditional allegiances. Finally, Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, had to resolve the matter, and instructed that all bishops must not refuse ordination simply because the candidate was unwilling to wear the stole. Today, there is less controversy. When a stole is used in a deacon&#x27;s ordination, it may be conferred on him or her and worn over the shoulder. At ordination to the priesthood, the newly ordained priest then wears the stole around his or her neck, hanging down in front, either straight down or less commonly crossed across the front of the body and secured with the cincture.

===== Lutheran =====

In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), both Ministers of Word and Sacrament (pastors) and Ministers of Word and Service (deacons) are entitled to wear the stole as both orders are ordained, though many deacons choose not to do so. ELCA pastors generally wear the stole hanging straight down while deacons wear them over one shoulder as in the Anglican and Roman traditions.

In the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church (Germany), only pastors wear the stole, as there is only the one order of ordination, that of pastor, in these Lutheran traditions. (The office of bishop for Episcopal polity and president for Congregational Polity is not a separate order of ordination.)

However, certain Lutheran churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Church of Sweden, practice the three-fold ministry of holy orders (in that the orders of deacon, priest, and bishop are separate ordinations). In such churches, wearing a deacon&#x27;s stole when assisting in a liturgy is an official rule, and different rubrics exist for the use of the stole by priests and bishops. Ordained clergy of the Church of Sweden follow the use described for Anglican deacons and priests in this article, except the practice of wearing the stole hanging straight down is reserved for bishops (priests wear it crossed over the chest except over a surplice, when no cincture is worn).

===== Methodist =====
In the United Methodist Church, ordained deacons wear a stole around the shoulder as in the Anglican and Roman traditions. An ordained elder wears the stole in the same fashion as an Anglican or Roman Catholic priest, with the role of elder being the Methodist equivalent, among other Protestant denominations, to that office. The English word &quot;priest&quot; is in fact derived from the Greek word &quot;presbyter&quot;, which means &quot;elder&quot;.

=== Eastern Christianity ===

==== Byzantine practice ====
In The Byzantine Rite practice of the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches, the stole worn by a deacon is called an orarion, while that worn by a priest or bishop is called an epitrachelion (a bishop additionally wears an omophorion), all similar in meaning and use to the Western stole. In Greek Orthodox practice, the deacon wears a double orarion, meaning it comes over the left arm and under the right. Minor clerics (and in Greek and Melkite traditions the altar servers as well) wear an orarion wrapped around their waist, crossed in back, and then either crossed again in front and tucked under the belted section or not crossed and tucked in (see explanation of subdeacon below).

The priest&#x27;s epitrachelion consists of a long strip of cloth, hung around the neck with the two strips fastened together in front, either by buttons or by stitching. The epitrachelion comes down in front almost to the hem of his robes, and is symbolic of the priest&#x27;s &quot;anointing&quot; (Septuagint: Psalm 132:2; KJV: Psalm 133:2). Traditionally—though not necessarily—the epitrachelion will have seven crosses on it: six in the front (three on each side) and one on the back of the collar. The priest traditionally blesses the cross on the collar and kisses it before he puts it on, and kisses it again when he takes it off. When he is vesting for the Divine Liturgy, he says the following prayer before putting on the epitrachelion:

&quot;Blessed is God, Who poureth out His grace upon His priests, like the oil of myrrh upon the head, which runneth down upon the beard, upon the beard of Aaron: which runneth down to the fringe of his raiment.&quot; (Cf. Psalm 132:2, LXX)

In the Russian Orthodox tradition, the priest may say a special blessing and sprinkle the epitrachelion with holy water before it is worn for the first time. A priest is not permitted to celebrate even the simplest service, even the Daily Office, unless he is wearing the epitrachelion (and in some traditions the epimanikia, or &quot;cuffs&quot;, as well). When a member of the faithful goes to Confession, the priest places the edge of his epitrachelion over the head of the penitent as he confesses his sins. After the absolution, the penitent will often kiss the priest&#x27;s hand and then one of the crosses on the edge of the epitrachelion. At an Orthodox wedding, the priest will have the bridal couple hold the edge of his epitrachelion as he leads them in a procession three times around the Gospel Book, symbolizing the pilgrimage of life.

The protodeacon or archdeacon wears the orarion &quot;doubled&quot;, i.e., over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and passing again over the left shoulder. The two ends hang down, one in the front and one in the back, coming down almost to the hem of his sticharion (dalmatic).

A deacon wears an orarion which simply passes over the left shoulder, the two ends of which hang straight down, one in the front and one in the back, coming down almost to the hem of his sticharion. This is only common in the most traditional Orthodox churches. In many Eastern traditions, the stole is always worn &quot;doubled&quot; unless the deacon in question is wearing only his exorasson (outer cassock) and then it is essentially folded and worn over the left shoulder.

The subdeacon wears his orarion over both shoulders, crossed in the back and the front. Those acting as subdeacons (i.e., vested and serving as subdeacons but without having been ordained) wear their orarion crossed only in the back, to show that they do not bear holy orders.

==== Oriental Orthodox ====
In the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the priestly stole is very similar to the epitrachelion described above; however, instead of a long narrow strip of fabric that is wrapped around the neck and fastened together, it is often cut out of a single broad piece of cloth that has a hole cut in it for the head to pass through. Sometimes, depending upon the liturgical Rite, it also extends farther down the back.

===British monarch===
The British monarch, although not in holy orders, is anointed with the oil of chrism and invested with a stole during the coronation rite. This stole, made of gold silk, is officially named the &quot;Stole Royal&quot; or &quot;Armilla&quot;, and is one of several coronation robes kept overnight in the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster Abbey before the day of the coronation. The coronation (which is always in the context of a Eucharist) is an official liturgy of the Church of England; the Archbishop of Canterbury has responsibility for the ceremony and is almost always its presider.

=== Mandaean ===
A stole is used in the Mandaean religion by the priests during rituals.

===Unitarian Universalist===
Historically, Unitarian and Universalist ministers wore street clothes, formal morning coats, or academic gowns while leading worship; stoles were rare. 

A key moment in the acceptance of stoles by Unitarian Universalist clergy was the formation in the late 1960s of the Congregation of Abraxas, a short-lived effort to &quot;draw upon the world&#x27;s traditions of awe, repentance, thanksgiving, and service, and to renew those forms for the liberal religious communities.&quot; Vern Barnet, an Abraxas founder, states that &quot;our success has been mainly in modeling for our colleagues the wearing of stoles or other vestments&quot; and notes the wearing by Eugene Pickett, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association, of a stole given him by the Congregation of Abraxas at a General Assembly in the mid-1970s. 

At about the same time, the increased number of women entered Unitarian Universalist ministry may have been a factor in the rising popularity of stoles. So may the increase in the number of former Catholic and Orthodox people who became UUs in the course of the 20th century.

Today, a stole/scarf/tippet is worn by many Unitarian Universalist ministers during weekly worship services as a symbol of ordained ministry. Other participants in the service may also wear stoles. Unitarian Universalist stoles often are adorned with the Unitarian Universalist Flaming Chalice and come in a wide range of colors.

<text>A pass is permission to be away from one&#x27;s military unit for a limited period of time. Time away on a pass is not counted against leave, the annual allotment of days off from duty.

==Types of passes==
*&quot;Normal off-duty hours&quot; — granted to personnel to allow them to go off their military installation whenever they are not required to be on duty, subject to recall at any time as needed, and revocable at the unit&#x27;s discretion.
*&quot;Regular pass&quot; — granted to allow personnel to be away for a designated period of time only. May be granted to those, such as trainees, not eligible for a &quot;normal off-duty hours&quot; pass.
*&quot;Three-day pass&quot; — the longest continuous pass granted allows a serviceman or servicewoman to be away for 72 consecutive hours. Often granted in recognition of special achievement or as a reward, especially as a way of granting a three-day weekend.

==By country variations==

In the RAF, a &quot;Permanent Pass&quot; known as Form 557 would be issued to servicemen of good standing and six-months service allowing them to leave the quarters after duty until midnight and no further than eight miles (or as otherwise restricted on the form). It could be endorsed with permission to wear plain clothes.

<doc id="488743" wikidata="Q125367" url="?curid=488743" title="Carbon monoxide poisoning">
<text>Carbon monoxide poisoning typically occurs from breathing in carbon monoxide (CO) at excessive levels. Symptoms are often described as &quot;flu-like&quot; and commonly include headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Large exposures can result in loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, seizures, or death. The classically described &quot;cherry red skin&quot; rarely occurs. Long-term complications may include chronic fatigue, trouble with memory, and movement problems.
CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (symbol COHb or HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide as carbaminohemoglobin. Additionally, many other hemoproteins such as myoglobin, Cytochrome P450, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected, along with other metallic and non-metallic cellular targets.

Diagnosis is typically based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers. The biological threshold for carboxyhemoglobin tolerance is typically accepted to be 15% COHb, meaning toxicity is consistently observed at levels in excess of this concentration. The FDA has previously set a threshold of 14% COHb in certain clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of carbon monoxide. In general, 30% COHb is considered severe carbon monoxide poisoning. The highest reported non-fatal carboxyhemoglobin level was 73% COHb.
Efforts to prevent poisoning include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This procedure is often carried out until symptoms are absent and the HbCO level is less than 3%/10%.
Carbon monoxide poisoning is relatively common, resulting in more than 20,000 emergency room visits a year in the United States. It is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States, non-fire related cases result in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The discovery that hemoglobin is affected by CO emerged with an investigation by James Watt and Thomas Beddoes into the therapeutic potential of hydrocarbonate in 1793, and later confirmed by Claude Bernard between 1846 and 1857.

== Background ==
Carbon monoxide is not toxic to all forms of life, and the toxicity is a classical dose-dependent example of hormesis. Small amounts of carbon monoxide are naturally produced through many enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions across phylogenetic kingdoms where it can serve as an important neurotransmitter (subcategorized as a gasotransmitter) and a potential therapeutic agent. In the case of prokaryotes, some bacteria produce, consume and respond to carbon monoxide whereas certain other microbes are susceptible to its toxicity. Currently, there are no known adverse effects on photosynthesizing plants.

The harmful effects of carbon monoxide are generally considered to be due to tightly binding with the prosthetic heme moiety of hemoproteins that results in interference with cellular operations, for example: carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin which affects gas exchange and cellular respiration. Inhaling excessive concentrations of the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death.

As pioneered by Esther Killick, different species and different people across diverse demographics may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including genetics (hemoglobin mutations), behavior such as activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, geography and barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.

===Physiology===
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by many physiologically relevant enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions best exemplified by heme oxygenase catalyzing the biotransformation of heme (an iron protoporphyrin) into biliverdin and eventually bilirubin. Aside from physiological signaling, most carbon monoxide is stored as carboxyhemoglobin at non-toxic levels below 3% HbCO.

==== Therapeutics ====
Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. A variety of drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO, these drugs are commonly called carbon monoxide-releasing molecules. Historically, the therapeutic potential of factitious airs, notably carbon monoxide as hydrocarbonate, was investigated by Thomas Beddoes, James Watt, Tiberius Cavallo, James Lind, Humphry Davy, and others in many labs such as the Pneumatic Institution.

== Signs and symptoms ==
On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. The WHO recommended levels of indoor CO exposure in 24 hours is 4 mg/m3. Acute exposure should not exceed 10 mg/m3 in 8 hours, 35 mg/m3 in one hour and 100 mg/m3 in 15 minutes.
=== Acute poisoning ===
The main manifestations of carbon monoxide poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, the central nervous system and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage.

One of the major concerns following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson&#x27;s disease-like syndromes, cortical blindness, and a depressed mood. Depression may occur in those who did not have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.

=== Chronic poisoning ===
Chronic exposure to relatively low levels of carbon monoxide may cause persistent headaches, lightheadedness, depression, confusion, memory loss, nausea, hearing disorders and vomiting. It is unknown whether low-level chronic exposure may cause permanent neurological damage. Typically, upon removal from exposure to carbon monoxide, symptoms usually resolve themselves, unless there has been an episode of severe acute poisoning. However, one case noted permanent memory loss and learning problems after a three-year exposure to relatively low levels of carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace.

Chronic exposure may worsen cardiovascular symptoms in some people. Chronic carbon monoxide exposure might increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. Long-term exposures to carbon monoxide present the greatest risk to persons with coronary heart disease and in females who are pregnant.

In experimental animals, carbon monoxide appears to worsen noise-induced hearing loss at noise exposure conditions that would have limited effects on hearing otherwise. In humans, hearing loss has been reported following carbon monoxide poisoning. Unlike the findings in animal studies, noise exposure was not a necessary factor for the auditory problems to occur.

=== Fatal poisoning ===
One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living – people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy. However, since this &quot;cherry-red&quot; appearance is more common in the dead, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In autopsy examinations, the appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned people may appear unusually lifelike in coloration. The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

== Epidemiology ==
The true number of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common cause of injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).

It has been estimated that more than 40,000 people per year seek medical attention for carbon monoxide poisoning in the United States. 95% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in Australia are due to gas space heaters. In many industrialized countries, carbon monoxide is the cause of more than 50% of fatal poisonings. In the United States, approximately 200 people die each year from carbon monoxide poisoning associated with home fuel-burning heating equipment. Carbon monoxide poisoning contributes to the approximately 5,613 smoke inhalation deaths each year in the United States. The CDC reports, &quot;Each year, more than 500 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning, and more than 2,000 commit suicide by intentionally poisoning themselves.&quot; For the 10-year period from 1979 to 1988, 56,133 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning occurred in the United States, with 25,889 of those being suicides, leaving 30,244 unintentional deaths. A report from New Zealand showed that 206 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the years of 2001 and 2002. In total carbon monoxide poisoning was responsible for 43.9% of deaths by poisoning in that country. In South Korea, 1,950 people had been poisoned by carbon monoxide with 254 deaths from 2001 through 2003. A report from Jerusalem showed 3.53 per 100,000 people were poisoned annually from 2001 through 2006. In Hubei, China, 218 deaths from poisoning were reported over a 10-year period with 16.5% being from carbon monoxide exposure.

=== Causes ===
Carbon monoxide is a product of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.

Riding in the back of pickup trucks has led to poisoning in children. Idling automobiles with the exhaust pipe blocked by snow has led to the poisoning of car occupants. Any perforation between the exhaust manifold and shroud can result in exhaust gases reaching the cabin. Generators and propulsion engines on boats, notably houseboats, have resulted in fatal carbon monoxide exposures.

Poisoning may also occur following the use of a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) due to faulty diving air compressors.

In caves carbon monoxide can build up in enclosed chambers due to the presence of decomposing organic matter. In coal mines incomplete combustion may occur during explosions resulting in the production of afterdamp. The gas is up to 3% CO and may be fatal after just a single breath. Following an explosion in a colliery, adjacent interconnected mines may become dangerous due to the afterdamp leaking from mine to mine. Such an incident followed the Trimdon Grange explosion which killed men in the Kelloe mine.

Another source of poisoning is exposure to the organic solvent dichloromethane, also known as methylene chloride, found in some paint strippers, as the metabolism of dichloromethane produces carbon monoxide. In November 2019, an EPA ban on dichloromethane in paint strippers for consumer use took effect in the United States.

=== Prevention ===
==== Detectors ====

Prevention remains a vital public health issue, requiring public education on the safe operation of appliances, heaters, fireplaces, and internal-combustion engines, as well as increased emphasis on the installation of carbon monoxide detectors. Carbon monoxide is tasteless, odourless, and colourless, and therefore can not be detected by visual cues or smell.

The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has stated, &quot;carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are,&quot; and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building. These devices, which are relatively inexpensive and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup. In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building. Unlike smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the US, NFPA 720–2009, the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the National Fire Protection Association, mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels. NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes, and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every HVAC zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend getting gas appliances serviced at least once a year.

==== Legal requirements ====

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law. As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented. This is enforced by municipal inspectors and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent. Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

====World Health Organization recommendations====
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100 mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60 mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30 mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10 mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h
* 7 mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (for indoor air quality, so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

== Diagnosis ==

As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared to the amount of hemoglobin in the blood.

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%. In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.

===Measuring===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using spectrophotometric methods or chromatographic techniques in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.

A CO-oximeter can be used to determine carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as these devices may be unable to distinguish carboxyhemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin.
Breath CO monitoring offers an alternative to pulse CO-oximetry. Carboxyhemoglobin levels have been shown to have a strong correlation with breath CO concentration. However, many of these devices require the user to inhale deeply and hold their breath to allow the CO in the blood to escape into the lung before the measurement can be made. As this is not possible in people who are unresponsive, these devices may not appropriate for use in on-scene emergency care detection of CO poisoning.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

There are many conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. The earliest symptoms, especially from low level exposures, are often non-specific and readily confused with other illnesses, typically flu-like viral syndromes, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, chest pain, and migraine or other headaches. Carbon monoxide has been called a &quot;great mimicker&quot; due to the presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific. Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis include acute respiratory distress syndrome, altitude sickness, lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, meningitis, methemoglobinemia, or opioid or toxic alcohol poisoning.

== Treatment ==

Initial treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is to immediately remove the person from the exposure without endangering further people. Those who are unconscious may require CPR on site. Administering oxygen via non-rebreather mask shortens the half-life of carbon monoxide from 320 minutes, when breathing normal air, to only 80 minutes. Oxygen hastens the dissociation of carbon monoxide from carboxyhemoglobin, thus turning it back into hemoglobin. Due to the possible severe effects in the baby, pregnant women are treated with oxygen for longer periods of time than non-pregnant people.

=== Hyperbaric oxygen ===

Hyperbaric oxygen is also used in the treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase to a greater extent than normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear.

=== Other ===
Further treatment for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors may be required to treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment is one of the most serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. A device that also provides some carbon dioxide to stimulate faster breathing (sold under the brand name ClearMate) may also be used.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems are complex and not yet fully understood. Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to hemoglobin, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing brain lipid peroxidation.

=== Hemoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the main enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is heme oxygenase, which is located in nearly all cells and platelets. Most endogenously produced CO is stored bound to hemoglobin as carboxyhemoglobin. The simplistic understanding for the mechanism of carbon monoxide toxicity is based on excess carboxyhemoglobin decreasing the oxygen-delivery capacity of the blood to tissues throughout the body. In humans, the affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 240 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen. However, certain mutations such as the Hb-Kirklareli mutation has a relative 80,000 times greater affinity for carbon monoxide than oxygen resulting in systemic carboxyhemoglobin reaching a sustained level of 16% COHb.

Hemoglobin is a tetramer with four prosthetic heme groups to serve as oxygen binding sites. The average red blood cell contains 250 million hemoglobin molecules, therefore 1 billion heme sites capable of binding gas. The binding of carbon monoxide at any one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue; therefore carbon monoxide binding at any site may be as dangerous as carbon monoxide binding to all sites. Delivery of oxygen is largely driven by the Bohr effect and Haldane effect. To provide a simplified synopsis of the molecular mechanism of systemic gas exchange in layman&#x27;s terms, upon inhalation of air it was widely thought oxygen binding to any of the heme sites triggers a conformational change in the globin/protein unit of hemoglobin which then enables the binding of additional oxygen to each of the other vacant heme sites. Upon arrival to the cell/tissues, oxygen release into the tissue is driven by &quot;acidification&quot; of the local pH (meaning a relatively higher concentration of &#x27;acidic&#x27; protons/hydrogen ions) caused by an increase in the biotransformation of carbon dioxide waste into carbonic acid via carbonic anhydrase. In other words, oxygenated arterial blood arrives at cells in the &quot;hemoglobin R-state&quot; which has deprotonated/unionized amino acid residues (regarding nitrogen/amines) due to the less-acidic arterial pH environment (arterial blood averages pH 7.407 whereas venous blood is slightly more acidic at pH 7.371). The &quot;T-state&quot; of hemoglobin is deoxygenated in venous blood partially due to protonation/ionization caused by the acidic environment hence causing a conformation unsuited for oxygen-binding (in other words, oxygen is &#x27;ejected&#x27; upon arrival to the cell because acid &quot;attacks&quot; the amines of hemoglobin causing ionization/protonation of the amine residues resulting in a conformation change unsuited for retaining oxygen). Furthermore, the mechanism for formation of carbaminohemoglobin generates additional &#x27;acidic&#x27; hydrogen ions that may further stabilize the protonated/ionized deoxygenated hemoglobin. Upon return of venous blood into the lung and subsequent exhalation of carbon dioxide, the blood is &quot;de-acidified&quot; (see also: hyperventilation) allowing for the deprotonation/unionization of hemoglobin to then re-enable oxygen-binding as part of the transition to arterial blood (note this process is complex due to involvement of chemoreceptors and other physiological functionalities). Carbon monoxide is not &#x27;ejected&#x27; due to acid, therefore carbon monoxide poisoning disturbs this physiological process hence the venous blood of poisoning patients is bright red akin to arterial blood since the carbonyl/carbon monoxide is retained. Hemoglobin is dark in deoxygenated venous blood, but it has a bright red color when carrying blood in oxygenated arterial blood and when converted into carboxyhemoglobin in both arterial and venous blood, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural lively reddish hue.

At toxic concentrations, carbon monoxide as carboxyhemoglobin significantly interferes with respiration and gas exchange by simultaneously inhibiting acquisition and delivery of oxygen to cells and preventing formation of carbaminohemoglobin which accounts for approximately 30% of carbon dioxide exportation. Therefore, a patient with carbon monoxide poisoning may experience severe hypoxia and acidosis (potentially both respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis) in addition to the toxicities of excess carbon monoxide inhibiting numerous hemoproteins, metallic and non-metallic targets which affect cellular machinery.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelination of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.

== History ==
Humans have maintained a complex relationship with carbon monoxide since first learning to control fire circa 800,000 BC. Primitive cavemen probably discovered the toxicity of carbon monoxide upon introducing fire into their dwellings. The early development of metallurgy and smelting technologies emerging circa 6,000 BC through the Bronze Age likewise plagued humankind with carbon monoxide exposure. Apart from the toxicity of carbon monoxide, indigenous Native Americans may have experienced the neuroactive properties of carbon monoxide through shamanistic fireside rituals.

Early civilizations developed mythological tales to explain the origin of fire, such as Vulcan, Pkharmat, and Prometheus from Greek mythology who shared fire with humans. Aristotle (384–322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. Greek physician Galen (129–199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled, and symptoms of CO poisoning appeared in Cassius Iatrosophista&#x27;s &quot;Quaestiones Medicae et Problemata Naturalia&quot; circa 130 AD. Julian the Apostate, Caelius Aurelianus, and several others similarly documented early knowledge of the toxicity symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning as caused by coal fumes in the ancient era.

Documented cases by Livy and Cicero allude to carbon monoxide being used as a method of suicide in ancient Rome. Emperor Lucius Verus used smoke to execute prisoners. Many deaths have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning including Emperor Jovian, Empress Fausta, and Seneca. The most high-profile death by carbon monoxide poisoning may possibly have been Cleopatra or Edgar Allan Poe.

In the fifteenth century, coal miners believed sudden death was caused by evil spirits; carbon monoxide poisoning has been linked to supernatural and paranormal experiences, witchcraft, etc. throughout the following centuries including in the modern present day exemplified by Carrie Poppy&#x27;s investigations.

Georg Ernst Stahl mentioned &quot;carbonarii halitus&quot; in 1697 in reference to toxic vapors thought to be carbon monoxide. Friedrich Hoffmann conducted the first modern scientific investigation into carbon monoxide poisoning from coal in 1716, notably rejecting villagers attributing death to demonic superstition. Herman Boerhaave conducted the first scientific experiments on the effect of carbon monoxide (coal fumes) on animals in the 1730s. Joseph Priestley is credited with first synthesizing carbon monoxide in 1772 which he had called heavy inflammable air, and Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated carbon monoxide from coal in 1773 suggesting it to be the toxic entity.

The dose-dependent risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as hydrocarbonate was investigated in the late 1790s by Thomas Beddoes, James Watt, Tiberius Cavallo, James Lind, Humphry Davy, and many others in the context of inhalation of factitious airs, much of which occurred at the Pneumatic Institution.

William Cruickshank discovered carbon monoxide as a molecule containing one carbon and one oxygen atom in 1800, thereby initiating the modern era of research exclusively focused on carbon monoxide. The mechanism for toxicity was first suggested by James Watt in 1793, followed by Adrien Chenot in 1854 and finally demonstrated by Claude Bernard after 1846 as published in 1857 and also independently published by Felix Hoppe-Seyler in the same year.

The first controlled clinical trial studying the toxicity of carbon monoxide occurred in 1973.

=== Historical detection ===
Carbon monoxide poisoning has plagued coal miners for many centuries. In the context of mining, carbon monoxide is widely known as whitedamp. John Scott Haldane identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of afterdamp, the gas created by combustion, after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. By 1911, Haldane introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries which have little tolerance for carbon monoxide thereby offering an early warning, i.e. canary in a coal mine. The canary in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

The first qualitative analytical method to detect carboxyhemoglobin emerged in 1858 with a colorimetric method developed by Felix Hoppe-Seyler, and the first quantitative analysis method emerged in 1880 with Josef von Fodor.

=== Historical treatment ===
The use of oxygen emerged with anecdotal reports such as Humphry Davy having been treated with oxygen in 1799 upon inhaling three quarts of hydrocarbonate (water gas). Samuel Witter developed an oxygen inhalation protocol in response to carbon monoxide poisoning in 1814. Similarly, an oxygen inhalation protocol was recommend for malaria (literally translated to &quot;bad air&quot;) in 1830 based on malaria symptoms aligning with carbon monoxide poisoning. Other oxygen protocols emerged in the late 1800s. The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.

=== Incidents ===
The worst accidental mass poisoning from carbon monoxide was the Balvano train disaster which occurred on 3 March 1944 in Italy, when a freight train with many illegal passengers stalled in a tunnel, leading to the death of over 500 people.

Over 50 people are suspected to have died from smoke inhalation as a result of the Branch Davidian Massacre during the Waco siege in 1993.

On 14 December 2024 12 individuals died by carbon monoxide poisoning in Gudauri (Georgia) as electric generators using fuel oil were placed in a closed area near their rooms.

=== Weaponization ===
In ancient history, Hannibal executed Roman prisoners with coal fumes during the Second Punic War.

The extermination of stray dogs by a carbon monoxide gas chamber was described in 1874. In 1884, an article appeared in Scientific American describing the use of a carbon monoxide gas chamber for slaughterhouse operations as well as euthanizing a variety of animals.

As part of the Holocaust during World War II, the Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno extermination camp and elsewhere to murder an estimated 700,000 or more people by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in Action T4. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Exhaust fumes from tank engines, for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.

<text>Gook ( or ) is a derogatory term for people of East and Southeast Asian descent. Its origin is unclear, but it may have originated among U.S. Marines during the Philippine–American War (1899–1913). Historically, U.S. military personnel used the word &quot;to refer to any dark-skinned foreigner, especially a non-European or non-American.&quot; The earliest published example is dated 1920 and notes that U.S. Marines then in Haiti used the term to refer to Haitians. It was widely used in Asia in both the Korean and Vietnamese Wars.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the origin of the word is unknown. An earlier usage of &quot;gook&quot;, recorded in a slang dictionary published in 1893, defined &quot;gook&quot; as &quot;a low prostitute&quot;.

The earliest use of the word in the English language comes from the name of a traditional Cornish Bonnet.

The usage for Koreans possibly comes from the Korean word &quot;국&quot; (&quot;guk&quot;), meaning &quot;country&quot;, &quot;한국&quot; (&quot;hanguk&quot;), meaning &quot;Korea&quot;, or &quot;미국&quot; (&quot;miguk&quot;), meaning &quot;America&quot;. U.S. soldiers in the Korean War might have heard locals saying &quot;miguk&quot; (미국), referring to Americans, and misinterpreted this as &quot;Me gook.&quot;

==Historical use==
The origin of gook is unclear, but it may have originated among U.S. Marines during the Philippine–American War (1899–1913), where the similar term &quot;goo-goo&quot; was also used to refer to Filipinos. The Marines who occupied Nicaragua in 1912 took to calling the natives gooks. In 1920, it was reported that U.S. Marines in Haiti used the term to refer to Haitians. Historically, U.S. military personnel used the word to refer to non-Americans of various races.

During World War II, U.S. troops fighting on the Pacific Front occasionally referred to the natives of Pacific Islands as gooks. The term appears in the 1943 film &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot;, when one of the characters of the film refers to the titular setting as &quot;gook island&quot;.

When U.S. troops were stationed on the Korean Peninsula at the outbreak of the Korean War, so prevalent was the use of the word gook during the first few months of the war that U.S. General Douglas MacArthur banned its use, for fear that Asians would become alienated to the United Nations Command because of the insult. In spite of MacArthur’s early prohibition, the term was nonetheless used by U.S. troops during the conflict, and U.S. postwar occupation troops in South Korea continued to call the Koreans &quot;gooks&quot;. 

The term was also used by non-American troops during the Korean War as well. The posthumous Victoria Cross citation for British Army major Kenneth Muir, who was killed in action at the Battle of Hill 282, stated that his last words were &quot;The Gooks will never drive the Argylls off this hill.&quot; 

In modern U.S. usage, &quot;gook&quot; refers particularly to communist soldiers during the Vietnam War and has also been used towards all Vietnamese and at other times to all Southeast Asians in general. It is considered to be highly offensive. In a highly publicized incident, Senator John McCain used the word during the 2000 presidential campaign to refer to his North Vietnamese captors when he was a prisoner of war: &quot;I hate the gooks. I will hate them as long as I live… I was referring to my prison guards and I will continue to refer to them in language that might offend.&quot; A few days later, however, he apologized to the Vietnamese community at large.

<doc id="488748" wikidata="Q1670901" url="?curid=488748" title="Reionization">
<text>In the fields of Big Bang theory and cosmology, reionization is the process that caused electrically neutral atoms in the universe to reionize after the lapse of the &quot;dark ages&quot;. 
Detecting and studying the reionization process is challenging but multiple avenues have been pursued. 
This reionization was driven by the formation of the first stars and galaxies.

== Concept ==
Reionization refers to a change in the intergalactic medium from neutral hydrogen to ions. The neutral hydrogen had been ions at an earlier stage in the history of the universe, thus the conversion back into ions is termed a &quot;re&quot;ionization. The reionization was driven by energetic photons emitted by the first stars and galaxies. 

In the timeline of the universe, neutral hydrogen gas was originally formed when primordial hydrogen nuclei (protons) combined with electrons. Light with sufficient energy will ionize neutral hydrogen gas. At early times, light was so dense and energetic that hydrogen gas was immediately ionized. As the universe expanded and cooled, the rate of recombination of electrons and protons to form neutral hydrogen was higher than the ionization rate. At around 379,000 years after the Big Bang (redshift &quot;z&quot; = 1089), this recombination left most normal matter in the form of neutral hydrogen. 

The universe was opaque before the recombination, due to the scattering of photons of all wavelengths off free electrons (and free protons, to a significantly lesser extent), but it became increasingly transparent as more electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. While the electrons of neutral hydrogen can absorb photons of some wavelengths by rising to an excited state, a universe full of neutral hydrogen will be relatively opaque only at those few wavelengths. The remaining light could travel freely and become the cosmic microwave background radiation. The only other light at this point would be provided by those excited hydrogen atoms, marking the beginning of an era called the Dark Ages of the universe. 

The second phase change occurred once gas clouds started to condense in the early universe that were energetic enough to re-ionize neutral hydrogen. As these objects formed and radiated energy, the universe reverted from being composed of neutral atoms, to once again being an ionized plasma. This occurred between 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (at a redshift 20 &gt; &quot;z&quot; &gt; 6) At that time, however, matter had been diffused by the expansion of the universe, and the scattering interactions of photons and electrons were much less frequent than before electron-proton recombination. Thus, the universe was full of low density ionized hydrogen and remained transparent, as is the case today.

It is believed that the primordial helium also experienced a similar reionization phase change, but at a later epoch in the history of the universe.
== Stages ==
Theoretical models give a timeline of the reionization process.
In the first stage of reionization, each new star is surrounded by neutral hydrogen. Light emitted by the star ionizes gas immediately around the star. Then light can reach further out to ionize gas. The ions can recombine, competing with the ionization process. The ionized gas will be hot and it will expand, clearing out the region around the star. The sphere of ionized gas expands until the amount of light from the star that can cause ionizations balances the recombination, a process that takes hundreds of millions of years. (The time is so long that stars die before the full extent of the reionization completes for that star.) At some point the shell of ionization from each star in a galaxy begin to overlap and the ionization frontier pushes out into the intergalatic medium.

== Detection methods ==
Looking back so far in the history of the universe presents some observational challenges. There are, however, a few observational methods for studying reionization.

===Quasars and the Gunn-Peterson trough===
One means of studying reionization uses the spectra of distant quasars. Quasars release an extraordinary amount of energy, being among the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from as long ago as the epoch of reionization. Quasars also happen to have relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the Earth. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with atoms along the line of sight. For wavelengths of light at the energies of one of the Lyman transitions of hydrogen, the scattering cross-section is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM), absorption at those wavelengths is highly likely.

For nearby objects in the universe, spectral absorption lines are very sharp, as only photons with energies just sufficient to cause an atomic transition can cause that transition. However, the distances between quasars and the telescopes which detect them are large, which means that the expansion of the universe causes light to undergo noticeable redshifting. This means that as light from the quasar travels through the IGM and is redshifted, wavelengths which had been below the Lyman Alpha limit are stretched, and will in effect begin to fill in the Lyman absorption band. This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar&#x27;s light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a Gunn-Peterson trough.

The redshifting for a particular quasar provides temporal information about reionization. Since an object&#x27;s redshift corresponds to the time at which it emitted the light, it is possible to determine when reionization ended. Quasars below a certain redshift (closer in space and time) do not show the Gunn-Peterson trough (though they may show the Lyman-alpha forest), while quasars emitting light prior to reionization will feature a Gunn-Peterson trough. In 2001, four quasars were detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with redshifts ranging from &quot;z&quot; = 5.82 to &quot;z&quot; = 6.28. While the quasars above &quot;z&quot; = 6 showed a Gunn-Peterson trough, indicating that the IGM was still at least partly neutral, the ones below did not, meaning the hydrogen was ionized. As reionization is expected to occur over relatively short timescales, the results suggest that the universe was approaching the end of reionization at &quot;z&quot; = 6. This, in turn, suggests that the universe must still have been almost entirely neutral at &quot;z&quot; &gt; 10. On the other hand, long absorption troughs persisting down to z &lt; 5.5 in the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta forests suggest that reionization potentially extends later than &quot;z&quot; = 6.

===CMB anisotropy and polarization===
The anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background on different angular scales can also be used to study reionization. Photons undergo scattering when there are free electrons present, in a process known as Thomson scattering. However, as the universe expands, the density of free electrons will decrease, and scattering will occur less frequently. In the period during and after reionization, but before significant expansion had occurred to sufficiently lower the electron density, the light that composes the CMB will experience observable Thomson scattering. This scattering will leave its mark on the CMB anisotropy map, introducing secondary anisotropies (anisotropies introduced after recombination). The overall effect is to erase anisotropies that occur on smaller scales. While anisotropies on small scales are erased, polarization anisotropies are actually introduced because of reionization. By looking at the CMB anisotropies observed, and comparing with what they would look like had reionization not taken place, the electron column density at the time of reionization can be determined. With this, the age of the universe when reionization occurred can then be calculated.

The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe allowed that comparison to be made. The initial observations, released in 2003, suggested that reionization took place from 30 &gt; &quot;z&quot; &gt; 11. This redshift range was in clear disagreement with the results from studying quasar spectra. However, the three year WMAP data returned a different result, with reionization beginning at &quot;z&quot; = 11 and the universe ionized by &quot;z&quot; = 7. This is in much better agreement with the quasar data.

Results in 2018 from Planck mission, yield an instantaneous reionization redshift of z = 7.68 ± 0.79.

The parameter usually quoted here is τ, the &quot;optical depth to reionization,&quot; or alternatively, zre, the redshift of reionization, assuming it was an instantaneous event. While this is unlikely to be physical, since reionization was very likely not instantaneous, zre provides an estimate of the mean redshift of reionization.

=== Lyman alpha emission ===
Lyman alpha light from galaxies offers a complementary tool set to study reionization.  The Lyman alpha line is the n=2 to n=1 transition of neutral hydrogen, and can be produced copiously by galaxies with young stars. Moreover, Lyman alpha photons interact strongly with neutral hydrogen in intergalactic gas through resonant scattering, wherein neutral atoms in the ground (n=1) state absorb Lyman alpha photons and almost immediately re-emit them in a random direction. This obscures Lyman alpha emission from galaxies that are embedded in neutral gas. Thus, experiments to find galaxies by their Lyman alpha light can indicate the ionization state of the surrounding gas.  An average density of galaxies with detectable Lyman alpha emission means the surrounding gas must be ionized; while an absence of detectable Lyman alpha sources may indicate neutral regions.  A closely related class of experiments measures the Lyman alpha line strength in samples of galaxies identified by other methods (primarily Lyman break galaxy searches).

The earliest application of this method was in 2004, when the tension between late neutral gas indicated by quasar spectra and early reionization suggested by CMB results was strong.  The detection of Lyman alpha galaxies at redshift z=6.5 demonstrated that the intergalactic gas was already predominantly ionized at an earlier time than the quasar spectra suggested.  Subsequent applications of the method suggested some residual neutral gas as recently as z=6.5, but still indicate that a majority of intergalactic gas was ionized prior to z=7.

Lyman alpha emission can be used in other ways to further probe reionization. Theory suggests that reionization was patchy, meaning that the clustering of Lyman alpha selected samples should be strongly enhanced during the middle phases of reionization. Moreover, specific ionized regions can be pinpointed by identifying groups of Lyman alpha emitters.

===21-cm line===
Even with the quasar data roughly in agreement with the CMB anisotropy data, there are still a number of questions, especially concerning the energy sources of reionization and the effects on, and role of, structure formation during reionization. The 21-cm line in hydrogen is potentially a means of studying this period, as well as the &quot;dark ages&quot; that preceded reionization. The 21-cm line occurs in neutral hydrogen, due to differences in energy between the spin triplet and spin singlet states of the electron and proton. This transition is forbidden, meaning it occurs extremely rarely. The transition is also highly temperature dependent, meaning that as objects form in the &quot;dark ages&quot; and emit Lyman-alpha photons that are absorbed and re-emitted by surrounding neutral hydrogen, it will produce a 21-cm line signal in that hydrogen through Wouthuysen-Field coupling. By studying 21-cm line emission, it will be possible to learn more about the early structures that formed. Observations from the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) points to a signal from this era, although follow-up observations will be needed to confirm it. Several other projects hope to make headway in this area in the near future, such as the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST), the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission, and the Large-Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA).

==Energy sources==

While observations have come in which narrow the window during which the epoch of reionization could have taken place, it is still uncertain which objects provided the photons that reionized the IGM. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 eV is required, which corresponds to photons with a wavelength of 91.2 nm or shorter. This is in the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which means that the primary candidates are all sources which produce a significant amount of energy in the ultraviolet and above. How numerous the source is must also be considered, as well as the longevity, as protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart. Altogether, the critical parameter for any source considered can be summarized as its &quot;emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit cosmological volume.&quot; With these constraints, it is expected that quasars and first generation stars and galaxies were the main sources of energy.

=== Dwarf galaxies ===
Dwarf galaxies are currently considered to be the primary source of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization. For most scenarios, this would require the log-slope of the UV galaxy luminosity function, often denoted α, to be steeper than it is today, approaching α = -2. With the advent of the &quot;James Webb Space Telescope&quot; (JWST), constraints on the UV luminosity function at the Epoch of Reionization have become commonplace, allowing for better constraints on the faint, low-mass population of galaxies.

In 2014, two separate studies identified two Green Pea galaxies (GPs) to be likely Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting candidates. Compact dwarf star-forming galaxies like the GPs are considered excellent low-redshift analogs of high-redshift Lyman-alpha and LyC emitters (LAEs and LCEs, respectively). At that time, only two other LCEs were known: Haro 11 and Tololo-1247-232. Finding local LyC emitters has thus become crucial to the theories about the early universe and the epoch of reionization.

Subsequently, motivated, a series of surveys have been conducted using &quot;Hubble Space Telescope&quot;&#x27;s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (&quot;HST&quot;/COS) to measure the LyC directly. These efforts culminated in the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey, a large &quot;HST&quot;/COS program which nearly tripled the number of direct measurements of the LyC from dwarf galaxies. To date, at least 50 LCEs have been confirmed using &quot;HST&quot;/COS with LyC escape fractions anywhere from ≈ 0 to 88%. The results from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey have provided the empirical foundation necessary to identify and understand LCEs at the Epoch of Reionization. With new observations from &quot;JWST&quot;, populations of LCEs are now being studied at cosmological redshifts greater than 6, allowing for the first time a detailed and direct assessment of the origins of cosmic Reionization. Combining these large samples of galaxies with new constraints on the UV luminosity function indicates that dwarf galaxies overwhelmingly contribute to Reionization.

===Quasars===
Quasars, a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), were considered a good candidate source because they are highly efficient at converting mass to energy, and emit a great deal of light above the threshold for ionizing hydrogen. It is unknown, however, how many quasars existed prior to reionization. Only the brightest of quasars present during reionization can be detected, which means there is no direct information about dimmer quasars that existed. However, by looking at the more easily observed quasars in the nearby universe, and assuming that the luminosity function (number of quasars as a function of luminosity) during reionization will be approximately the same as it is today, it is possible to make estimates of the quasar populations at earlier times. Such studies have found that quasars do not exist in high enough numbers to reionize the IGM alone, saying that &quot;only if the ionizing background is dominated by low-luminosity AGNs can the quasar luminosity function provide enough ionizing photons.&quot;

===Population III stars===
 Population III stars were the earliest stars, which had no elements more massive than hydrogen or helium. During Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the only elements that formed aside from hydrogen and helium were trace amounts of lithium. Yet quasar spectra have revealed the presence of heavy elements in the intergalactic medium at an early era. Supernova explosions produce such heavy elements, so hot, large, Population III stars which will form supernovae are a possible mechanism for reionization. While they have not been directly observed, they are consistent according to models using numerical simulation and current observations. A gravitationally lensed galaxy also provides indirect evidence of Population III stars. Even without direct observations of Population III stars, they are a compelling source. They are more efficient and effective ionizers than Population II stars, as they emit more ionizing photons, and are capable of reionizing hydrogen on their own in some reionization models with reasonable initial mass functions. As a consequence, Population III stars are currently considered the most likely energy source to initiate the reionization of the universe, though other sources are likely to have taken over and driven reionization to completion.

In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at . Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.

<doc id="488749" wikidata="Q520484" url="?curid=488749" title="York, Ontario">
<text>York is a district and former city within Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located northwest of Old Toronto, southwest of North York and east of the Humber River.

Originally formed as York Township, it encompassed the southern section of York County. It was split several times, creating East York and North York. In 1953, it became part of the Metropolitan Toronto federation. It absorbed several municipalities, including Lambton Mills and Weston and was eventually known as the City of York. In 1998, it was dissolved along with Metro Toronto and its constituent municipalities, amalgamated to form the current City of Toronto.

Today, the area is integrated into the multicultural mosaic of Toronto. The area is home today to several ethnic enclaves such as Portuguese, Jamaican and Latin American neighbourhoods.

==History==
Teiaiagon, settled by the Iroquois on the eastern bank of the Humber River, where Baby Point is now, was the oldest known settlement on the land that would later become York Township.

York Township was first organized in 1793. Its initial boundaries were the Humber River to the west, in the east by what would become Victoria Park Avenue, and in the north by what would become Steeles Avenue. Etobicoke Township and Scarborough Township were located west and east, respectively, while the townships of Vaughan and Markham bordered on the north, and Lake Ontario on the south, minus the small Town of York. It was incorporated by Canada West in 1850 (Canada West later became Ontario in 1867, due to Confederation) within the new County of York.

York Township was home to one of the original Black communities in the Toronto area, which was populated by many African American fugitive slaves. By 1861, the township had the second-largest Black population in the Toronto area, after St. John&#x27;s Ward, most of whom lived in York Township West (located west of Yonge Street and north of Bloor Street). The legacy of York&#x27;s original Black community continues today; as of the 2016 Census, 17 percent of York&#x27;s population is Black, the largest percentage of Toronto&#x27;s six former municipalities.

From the period of 1850 onwards, individual villages developed such as Parkdale (1879) and Brockton (1881), which were later annexed into Toronto. The village of Weston was incorporated in 1882. Toronto Junction and East Toronto were incorporated in 1887, both later annexed by Toronto. The village of North Toronto was incorporated in 1889, annexed by Toronto in 1912. Other parts of York were directly annexed by Toronto, such as &quot;The Annex&quot;, Riverdale, Rosedale, Seaton and Sunnyside in the 1880s and Bracondale, Deer Park, Wychwood, The Midway and Balmy Beach after 1905.

This pattern of absorption by Toronto ended as the City no longer wanted to take on the servicing costs of new suburbs. The Humewood–Cedarvale neighbourhood was developed in the 1910s to attract development in the growing township. Oakwood Village was also developed during this time. In the 1920s, the character of the township changed, with its southern reaches abutting the city of Toronto taking on a more urban character, compared with the very rural character of the north. The voters of the northern, rural part of York voted to secede, creating the new Township of North York in 1922. This was followed in 1923 by the incorporation of the village of Forest Hill, while the residents of Mount Dennis and Silverthorn voted to remain in York. The remaining two pockets of unincorporated urban development at the north end of the city, were split by the village of North Toronto, which was by then a part of the City of Toronto. Within years, the Province of Ontario saw that this arrangement of having an exclave was impractical, and further subdivided York, creating in 1924 the township of East York out of the eastern pocket.

The Township of York contracted streetcar and bus services from the Toronto Transportation Commission (later became Toronto Transit Commission in 1954), but remained independent from Toronto. During this time, American novelist and journalist Ernest Hemingway resided in the Humewood–Cedarvale community, writing for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

In 1954, York, along with other municipalities south of Steeles Avenue were severed from York County, forming the new upper-tier government of Metropolitan Toronto. In 1967, it absorbed the town of Weston, and became the Borough of York, later known as the City of York. (The map shows this area in red). York was dissolved on 1 January 1998 and its functions amalgamated into the new City of Toronto. Its former council and administrative building, York Civic Centre, is located at 2700 Eglinton Avenue West, between Black Creek Drive and Keele Street, used for courts and other functions. The Etobicoke-York Community Council of Toronto administers minor responsibilities within the limits of York and Etobicoke.

==Neighbourhoods==
There are several distinct neighbourhoods in the former city, including the former municipality of Weston, which retains its own main street, Weston Road, and several street names duplicated in other districts of Toronto, especially downtown Toronto.

North and west of Oakwood Village is the Fairbank community. Silverthorn is west of Fairbank. Silverthorn (and Fairbank) is described as &quot;Toronto&#x27;s hidden San Francisco&quot; in reference to its &quot;steep streets, staircases, and unusual views of houses built in what must be the hilliest part of the city.&quot; This is due to Toronto&#x27;s topography being shaped by its deep ravines being similar to the hills of San Francisco, especially in Fairbank and Silverthorn.

The Mount Dennis area of Weston was the base for the former campus of Kodak&#x27;s Canadian operations from 1912 to 2006. While most of the buildings were demolished, the branch head office has been repurposed for Line 5 Eglinton&#x27;s Eglinton Maintenance and Storage Facility.

Baby Point, between Jane Street and the Humber River, north of Bloor Street, is situated where the former Iroquoian village of Teiaiagon was located. It was formerly part of the Lambton Mills village within York Township.

==Education==
Before York was dissolved, the York Board of Education oversaw public secular schools in the former city. Since 1998, the district has been administered by the four Toronto boards:

* Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM)
* Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV)
* Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB)
* Toronto District School Board (TDSB)

CSV and TDSB operate as secular public school boards, the former operating French first-language institution, whereas the latter operates English first-language institutions (although it does offer French immersion). The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, operate as public Roman Catholic separate school boards, the former operating French first-language separate schools, the latter operating English first-language separate schools.

TDSB operates several institutions that offer primary and secondary education. Secondary schools in York that are operated by TDSB include:
* Forest Hill Collegiate Institute
* Frank Oke Secondary School
* George Harvey Collegiate Institute (merged with York Memorial Collegiate Institute)
* Oakwood Collegiate Institute
* Runnymede Collegiate Institute
* Weston Collegiate Institute
* York Memorial Collegiate Institute
TDSB formerly operated another secondary school in York, Vaughan Road Academy. Opened in 1927, the secondary school was York&#x27;s first but was closed on its 90th anniversary in 2017 due to its lack of student population resulting from students in the local catchment area attending other nearby secondary schools. Vaughan Road Academy is repurposed as a temporary elementary school for students in the Yonge and Davisville area in Midtown Toronto since the 2018–19 school year to accommodate the construction of a new school building.

TCDSB operates one secondary school in York, St. Oscar Romero Catholic Secondary School. Neither CSCM nor CSV operate a secondary school in York.

St. Michael&#x27;s College School, an independent young men&#x27;s Roman Catholic school, is located in the Tichester neighbourhood with its sports field being directly over St. Clair West station.

==Infrastructure==
===Public library system===

Before 1998, the city operated its own library system, the York Public Library. York Public Library was merged with the other library systems of Metro Toronto to form the new Toronto Public Library (TPL). TPL operates several branches within the district.

York&#x27;s first public library was the Mount Dennis branch, which operated out of rented premises from 1923. In 1945, the Township of York Public Library Board was established, and proceeded to build three new library buildings that opened in 1951, including the Jane/Dundas library, Main Library (Eglinton Avenue one block east of Dufferin Street), and the Mount Dennis Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;TPL Jane/Dundas&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Main Library was later renamed after York Public Library head librarian Maria Shchuka and was later fully rebuilt in 2003. The Oakwood Village branch was York&#x27;s newest library, which opened in 1996.

==Public transit==
York operated its own bus and streetcar service, until it was absorbed by the Toronto Transit Commission. Today, the area is served by the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s buses, streetcar, and subway system. Of the Toronto subway system, only the Heath Street exit of St. Clair West station on Line 1 Yonge–University is in the former city of York as Eglinton West station is completely within Old Toronto. The Rogers Road streetcar line served the namesake street as well.

===Line 5 Eglinton===

The TTC once had plans to construct the Eglinton West subway line along Eglinton Avenue. It began construction in 1994. However, it was cancelled in 1995 under Ontario premier Mike Harris and there had been no serious discussion about reviving the line until 2007, when Line 5 Eglinton (then known as the Eglinton Crosstown LRT) was proposed as part of David Miller&#x27;s Transit City.

When Rob Ford became mayor in 2010, he immediately announced the cancellation of Transit City. However, city council spared a few lines, including the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, from cancellation, despite Ford&#x27;s objections.

Since 2013, the new LRT has been under construction and the first phase is expected to be opened in 2025.

===GO Transit===
The Weston GO Station along the Kitchener line is the only GO Transit train station and Union Pearson Express (UP Express) train station in the district. There are also plans to construct the Caledonia GO Station along the Barrie line, which would connect with Line 5&#x27;s Caledonia station and the York Beltline Trail, along with the Mount Dennis GO Station along the Kitchener line and UP Express to connect with Line 5&#x27;s Mount Dennis station.

==Politics==
The community was first organized as a township in 1793, but not incorporated until 1850. The township was initially a township under the County of York until 1954. In 1954, York was formally severed from the county, along with other municipalities situated south of Steeles Avenue to form the upper-tier government of Metropolitan Toronto. In 1967, the township was formally made into a borough of Metropolitan Toronto, and later a city in 1983. In 1997, York, along with the remaining municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were formally amalgamated to form the new City of Toronto. Today, residents now vote for the Mayor of Toronto, as well as councillors of Toronto City Council. Federally and provincially, eligible residents of York are also able to vote for members of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

===Reeves===
Prior to York&#x27;s amalgamation with Toronto, York operated its own municipal council, with a mayor heading York&#x27;s council. Prior to the municipality&#x27;s incorporation as a borough, the chief magistrate of the council was referred to as a reeve. The following individuals served as the reeves of the Township of York:

<text>A clochán (plural clocháin) or beehive hut is a dry-stone hut with a corbelled roof, commonly associated with the south-western Irish seaboard. The precise construction date of most of these structures is unknown with the buildings belonging to a long-established Celtic tradition, though there is at present no direct evidence to date the surviving examples before . Some associated with religious sites may be pre-Romanesque, some consider that the most fully intact structures date after the 12th century or later. It is where monks lived.

==Form==
They are most commonly round beehive huts, but rectangular plans are known as well. It has been suggested that the rectangular footprints date to a later era. Some clochán are not completely built of stone and may have possessed a thatched roof. The walls are very thick, up to . Sometimes several clochans are joined by their walls.

==Locations==
Clochán are mainly found in the Southwest of Ireland, for example at Skellig Michael, Church Island off Beginish Island, Glanfahan, Fahan and Reask in the Dingle Peninsula of County Kerry. Many occur in religious contexts such as used by the monks following Saint Patrick; moreover, his successors carried on the architectural tradition in the Scottish island of Iona and eventually via Aidan to the eastern English islands of Farne and Holy Island. There are others in ringforts (such as Leacanabuaile, County Kerry) that are commonly interpreted as secular dwellings. Elaborate dry walled stone churches like the Gallarus Oratory may derive from the clochán. The clochán has been described in the 7th to 8th-century law Críth Gablach. Beehive huts are also found in West Penwith, Cornwall.

==Popular culture==
Parts of the 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed using the beehive huts on the island of Skellig Michael. Because of the restrictions regarding filming on the island, a set of replica beehive huts were also built in 2016 at Ceann Sibéal, near Ballyferriter, on the Dingle Peninsula.

<text>Ringforts or ring forts are small circular fortified settlements built during the Bronze Age, Iron Age and early Middle Ages up to about the year 1000 AD. They are found in Northern Europe, especially in Ireland. There are also many in South Wales and in Cornwall, where they are called rounds. Ringforts come in many sizes and may be made of stone or earth. Earthen ringforts would have been marked by a circular rampart (a bank and ditch), often with a stakewall. Both stone and earthen ringforts would generally have had at least one building inside.

== Distribution ==
=== Ireland ===

In Irish language sources they are known by a number of names: (anglicised &quot;rath&quot;, also Welsh ), (anglicised &quot;lis&quot;; cognate with Cornish &#x27;), (anglicised &quot;cashel&quot;), (anglicised &quot;caher&quot; or &quot;cahir&quot;; cognate with Welsh &#x27;, Cornish and Breton &#x27;) and (anglicised &quot;dun&quot; or &quot;doon&quot;; cognate with Welsh and Cornish &#x27;). The &#x27; and &#x27; was an earthen ringfort; the &#x27; being the enclosing bank and the &#x27; being the open space within. The &#x27; and &#x27; was a stone ringfort. The term &quot;&quot; was usually used for any stronghold of importance, which may or may not be ring-shaped.

In Ireland, over 40,000 sites have been identified as ringforts and it is thought that at least 50,000 ringforts existed on the island. They are common throughout the country, with a mean density of just over one ringfort within any area of . It is likely that many have been destroyed by farming and urbanisation. However, many hitherto unknown ringforts have been found thanks to early Ordnance Survey maps, aerial photography, and the archaeological work that has accompanied road-building.

=== England and Wales ===
In Cornwall, parts of Devon, and south Wales, enclosed settlements share many characteristics with their Irish counterparts, including the circular shape and (), and their continuing occupation from the Iron Age into the early medieval period; the form later influencing the distinctive circular shell-keeps found across the medieval Severnside region. Few Cornish examples have been archaeologically excavated, with the exception of Trethurgy Rounds.

=== Scandinavia ===
Hillforts are also known from Scandinavia, of which nineteen can be found on the Swedish island of Öland alone.

These hillforts are not to be confused with Viking ring fortresses, of which seven are known from Denmark and southern Sweden, all from around 980 in the Viking Age. The Viking forts all share a strikingly similar design and are collectively referred to as Trelleborgs, after the first excavated fortress of that type in 1936. All the Viking ring fortresses are believed to have been built within a very short timeframe, during the reign of Harald Bluetooth, but for yet unknown military purposes. They might have served as boot camps for Sweyn Forkbeard&#x27;s men before his invasion of England in 1013.

==Chronology==
The debate on chronology is primarily a result of the huge number of ringforts and the failure of any other form of settlement site to survive to modern times in any great quantity from the period before the Early Christian period or from Gaelic Ireland after the Anglo-Norman arrival. Three general theories mark the debate on the chronology of Irish ringforts; firstly the theory that wishes to date ringforts back into the Iron Age period; secondly, the theory that seeks to see the continuation of ringfort habitation into the later medieval and even the Modern Period; finally, the more common and generally accepted theory that ringforts were a product of the second half of the first millennium, a theory which has been given greater definition by Matthew Stout in recent years. According to the authoritative &quot;New History of Ireland&quot; (2005), &quot;archaeologists are agreed that the vast bulk of them are the farm enclosures of the well-to-do of early medieval Ireland&quot;.

===Theories===
The theories that the ringfort either pre- or post-dates the Early Middle Ages in Ireland, are both based on essentially the same premise, as is highlighted here by Tadhg O&#x27;Keefe in relation to the latter argument:

====Dating from the Iron Age====
The conjecture that ringforts can be seen to have evolved from and be part of an Iron Age tradition has been expanded by Darren Limbert. This hypothesis is based on a number of re-interpretations of the available evidence, as well as concern over the available evidence. As only a small portion of ringforts have undergone total excavation, and the fact that these excavations have not taken place on anything like a national level, the evidence is insufficient to place all ringforts and the origins of them within the Early Christian period.
Limbert argues instead, that the ringfort should be seen in the context of a variety of similar developments in Britain and the European Continent, particularly in Iberia and Gaul. While conceding that most ringforts were built in the Early Christian period, he suggests a link between the arrival of Eóganachta dynasty in Munster , and the introduction of ringforts. In support of this he notes that: &quot;The other major Eoganachta ringforts [other than Cashel] of Ballycatten, Garranes and possibly Garryduff, despite limited stratigraphic discernment, have produced artefacts of ambiguously early origins. Also, their defensive nature... supports an intrusion of a Celtic warrior caste...&quot; The similarity with South Welsh &#x27;raths&#x27; and Cornish &#x27;rounds&#x27; suggests a degree of cultural interaction between Western British and Irish populations, however differences in dates of occupation mean this cannot be confirmed.

On the island of Öland, Sweden, nineteen ringforts have been identified, including Eketorp, a site that has been completely excavated and that one may visit. Currently, excavations are ongoing at Sandby borg, which was the site of a massacre in the 5th century AD.

It is also possible that the Hill of Tara is an early type of ringfort.

====Use continuing into the later medieval period====
At the opposite end of the spectrum to this, the argument has been put forward to suggest that ringforts were in use, if not being built in the later medieval and possibly Early Modern period in Gaelic Ireland. This argument is primarily two-fold, ringforts were gradually converted into what would more generally be considered as mottes today, and there is some slight and contentious archaeological evidence that points to the habitation and construction of obvious ringforts in this later medieval period.

From a morphological viewpoint, and probably also from the view of the contemporary person, there is little to distinguish a ringfort from a small earthwork castle or motte. Indeed, in a number of cases it would appear that either the Normans converted existing ringforts into the basis of the future construction of mottes and earthworks, or that the Gaelic Irish, through the use of raised raths, sought to emulate the Norman example. Some L Plan Castles, such as Balingarry Castle in Ireland originated as ringforts.

This theory is supported by a number of excavations, most notably the results of the Castleskreen II excavation, and the raised raths at Piper&#x27;s Fort, and Ballyfounder, County Limerick, which seem to have been converted into mottes in the case of Castleskreen II or in the later cases, built in imitation of such constructions. If one were to accept a defensive function for ringforts, it would seem that after the introduction of more complex forms of defensive structures into Ireland this would naturally lead to the use of ringforts and raised raths in a manner analogous to the contemporary Norman buildings.

====7th to 10th centuries====
While it would seem probable that some ringforts may have seen continuation in the later medieval period as adapted or imitation mottes it seems doubtful if the continuation that ringforts were still being built on a more general scale throughout the country, and the evidence put forward for such a theory would appear quite slim. The excavations which support such a theory, most notably Rynne&#x27;s excavation at Shannon Airport of Garrynamona which is suggestive of a 15th-century ringfort being constructed, have failed to win any form of widespread popular acceptance.

The most common theory however is that ringforts are the product of the later half of the first millennium, a theory that has generally been supported by the excavated evidence of the period, and one that has seen remarkable if slightly ambitious definition from Matthew Stout. In his work &quot;The Irish Ringfort&quot;, Stout has sought to use the radiocarbon and dendrochronological dates from 114 ringforts and associated sites to find an overall date pattern for the use of ringforts; and through this has placed over half of all ringforts in the period 540 AD to 884 AD with two-thirds falling within the 600 AD to 900 AD period. While this method has brought the dating of the ringfort phase of Irish history to an ever more accurate level, certain problems do exist with his analysis. Firstly, as he notes himself, the research is overly biased towards Ulster (64% of dated sites were from Ulster), and the dates come from a very small sample of sites relative to the total number of ringforts. Finally, Stout&#x27;s use of radiocarbon dating is to one standard deviation, which means that there is an approximately one third chance that the data offered is inaccurate by up to 100 years on either side. Yet despite these difficulties, Stout&#x27;s analysis has to a large extent brought a degree of finality to the debate of the dating and use of ringforts, with it being more or less certain that the vast majority were probably occupied and constructed in the second half of the first millennium. His analysis is further supported by Gerald of Wales who commented that ringforts in Ireland, were known as Daneforts, and that they had been abandoned by the late 12th century when he was in Ireland.

==Functions==

===Agriculture===
It has traditionally been understood that the ringfort was a dispersed farmstead, the home of a free man and his family and the centre of a mixed agricultural economy to a large extent dominated by cattle. A medieval Irish law text describes a prosperous farmer – in Old Irish – as having a dwelling house, a sheep-pen, a calf-pen and a pig-sty – it would seem that these were all within the ring-fort. 

Evidence suggests that not all ringforts were farmsteads, but rather that ringforts appeared to have fulfilled a variety of other functions as well. The most celebrated example of this is Garryduff II in County Cork. This ringfort which is overlooked and in close proximity to another larger ringfort, Garryduff I, has provided archaeologists with no evidence of habitation or settlement, and the pre-eminent theory at the moment is that this ringfort was possibly used as an enclosure for livestock.

However, this interpretation is still the most commonly held in academic, archaeological and popular debate, although pollen studies and other evidence have greatly modified the traditional view of the dominance of livestock as opposed to arable farming in early medieval Ireland, making it clear that cereal production was much more important than once thought in the early medieval period.

===Industry===
Other sites have provided evidence that ringforts may not have principally been farmsteads, but rather had a more diverse and significant role in the economy. A good example of this is provided by the large, tri-vallate ringfort in Garannes, County Cork, which offers no evidence for habitation or settlement but provides a great deal of evidence to suggest that the site had an industrial nature. Furthermore, the finds of continental pottery at the site, suggests that the site was trading with the continent and/or may have been acting as a gateway centre for similar high status goods into the local economy. Both Garannes, and especially Garryduff II, highlight the other roles that ringforts may have had in early Christian Ireland. While it would seem that most ringforts fitted the traditional explanation as farmsteads, that should not be used as a blanket explanation. A number of other functions for many of the surviving ringforts, such as those outlined above and possibly other settlement functions, still need to be considered.

===Defence===
A ringfort is a defensive feature that would appear to be obvious both from the name with the defensive implications that fort implies, and also from the generally understood morphological definition of the ringfort, with the banks and fosse been commonly seen as defensive. Indeed, in S. Ó Ríordáin&#x27;s common morphological definition, he refers to the banks and fosses of the ringfort as defences.

One presumes that the ringfort had a defensive aspect, and in a cattle-dominated society it is generally argued that the purpose of the ringfort was to provide protection to a small community and their livestock during a &#x27;hit and run&#x27; raid for cattle, the idea being that the ringfort would provide adequate defence for a small period of time. This theory is strengthened by the idea of &#x27;visual territories&#x27; which operates from the assumption that all ringfort in a region were probably occupied contemporarily, and that in a particular area one ringfort would be in the sight of at least one other neighbouring ringfort so that if one ringfort were attacked, relief would possibly come from a neighbouring one. Furthermore, a number of aspects of the generally circular nature of the ringfort highlight the defensive advantages, most notably that a circle as a shape &quot;offered broad perspectives of approaching attackers and allowed the maximum area to be enclosed relative to the length of the bank constructed.&quot;

===Status===
While defence may be expanded as the modern day explanation for the surrounding banks of a ringfort, this was not the contemporary explanation, rather the explanations forthcoming from the Early Christian texts stress the importance and role of the banks in signifying nobility, kingship and authority. This relationship can be quite clearly seen in the following extract from the Críth Gablach:

As can be seen from the above text, the relationship between the banks of a ringfort and vassalage is quite clear. With the argument being that the more elaborate the ringfort, usually in the forms of multiple outlying banks, the higher the status of the occupant. This emphasis on status in the function of the ringfort over that of defence would explain a number of defensive weaknesses of the ringfort. Banks, or multiples of them, would not appear to offer the best return to their builders for their defensive value in comparison to a fence or a hedge. Also, few of the ringforts where buildings have been found inside, would be able to survive a night with a herd of cattle brought inside the ringfort. Furthermore, little effort would appear to have been expended on the upkeep of ditches and fosses to prevent decay and silting. Another key difficulty with viewing the ringfort primarily as a defensive unit is the general lack of ability to fight out from the ringforts, from the top of the banks.

==Legends and folklore concerning ringforts and rounds ==

The materials used to construct ringforts frequently disintegrated over time. Tradition associated their circular remains with fairies and leprechauns, and they were called &quot;“fairy forts&quot;&quot;. Castle Pencaire on Tregonning Hill was regarded as the abode of giants. Chun Castle in Morvah is related as the home of the giant &quot;Denbras&quot; who is buried by the character Tom at Chun Quoit from oral folklore recorded by William Bottrell published 1870.
Kelly Rounds (Castle Kilibury) in Triggshire is often proposed as the location of King Arthur&#x27;s Celliwig, known from the Welsh poem &quot;Pa Gwr yw y Porthawr?&quot; and described in the 11th century Culhwch and Olwen.
Castle Dore is often proposed as the court of King Mark (Mergh Cunomor / Marcus Cunomorus) in the romance Drustan hac Yseult, the doomed hero sailing the seas from Brittany to Ireland to seek his love.

<doc id="488758" wikidata="Q742311" url="?curid=488758" title="Chad of Mercia">
<text>Chad (died 2 March 672) was a prominent 7th-century Anglo-Saxon monk. He was an abbot, Bishop of the Northumbrians and then Bishop of the Mercians and Lindsey People. After his death he was known as a saint.

He was the brother of Bishop Cedd, also a saint. He features strongly in the work of the Venerable Bede and is credited, together with Bishop Wilfrid of Ripon, with introducing Christianity to the Mercian kingdom.

==Sources ==

Most of what is known of Chad comes from the writings of the Venerable Bede and the biography of Bishop Wilfrid written by Stephen of Ripon. Bede tells us that he obtained his information about Chad and his brother, Cedd, from the monks of Lastingham, where both were abbots. Bede also refers to information he received from Trumbert, &quot;who tutored me in the Scriptures and who had been educated in the monastery by that master [Chad]&quot;. In other words, Bede considered himself to stand in the spiritual lineage of Chad and had gathered information from at least one who knew him personally.

==Early life and education==

===Family links===
Chad was one of four brothers, all active in the Catholic church. The others were Cedd, Cynibil and Caelin. Chad seems to have been Cedd&#x27;s junior, arriving on the political scene about ten years after Cedd. It is reasonable to suppose that Chad and his brothers were drawn from the Northumbrian nobility. They certainly had close connections throughout the Northumbrian ruling class. However, the name &quot;Chad&quot; is actually of British Celtic, rather than Anglo-Saxon origin. It is an element found in the personal names of many Welsh princes and nobles of the period and signifies &quot;battle&quot;.

===Education===
The only major fact that Bede gives about Chad&#x27;s early life is that he was a student of Aidan at the Celtic monastery at Lindisfarne. In fact, Bede attributes the general pattern of Chad&#x27;s ministry to the example of Aidan and his own brother, Cedd, who was also a student of St Aidan.

Aidan was a disciple of Columba and was invited by King Oswald of Northumbria to come from Iona to establish a monastery. Aidan arrived in Northumbria in 635 and died in 651. Chad must have studied at Lindisfarne some time between these years.

===Travels in Ireland and dating of Chad&#x27;s life===
A number of ecclesiastical settlements were established in 7th century Ireland to accommodate European monks, particularly Anglo-Saxon monks. Around 668, Bishop Colman resigned his see at Lindisfarne and returned to Ireland. Less than three years later he erected an abbey in County Mayo exclusively for the English monks in the village of Mayo, subsequently known as &quot;Maigh Eo na Saxain&quot; (&quot;Mayo of the Saxons&quot;).

Chad is thought to have completed his education in Ireland as a monk before he was ordained a priest, but Bede does not explicitly mention this. One of his companions in Ireland would have been Egbert of Ripon. Egbert was of the Anglian nobility, probably from Northumbria. Bede places them among English scholars who arrived in Ireland while Finan and Colmán were bishops at Lindisfarne. This suggests that they left for Ireland some time after Aidan&#x27;s death in 651. They went to Rath Melsigi, an Anglo-Saxon monastery in County Carlow, for further study. In the controversy over the keeping of Easter, Rath Melsigi accepted the Roman computation.

In 664, the twenty-five year old Egbert barely survived a plague that had killed all his other companions. Chad had by then already left Ireland to help his brother Cedd establish the monastery of Lastingham or Laestingaeu in Yorkshire.

The Benedictine rule was slowly spreading across Western Europe. Chad was trained in an entirely distinct monastic tradition that tended to look back to Martin of Tours as an exemplar. The Irish and early Anglo-Saxon monasticism experienced by Chad was peripatetic, stressed ascetic practices and had a strong focus on Biblical exegesis, which generated a profound eschatological consciousness. Egbert recalled later that he and Chad &quot;followed the monastic life together very strictly – in prayers and continence, and in meditation on Holy Scripture&quot;. Some of the scholars quickly settled in Irish monasteries, while others wandered from one master to another in search of knowledge. Bede says that the Irish monks gladly taught them and fed them, and even let them use their valuable books, without charge. Since books were all produced by hand, with painstaking attention to detail, this was astonishingly generous.

==Founding of Lastingham==
King Oswiu of Northumbria appointed his nephew, Œthelwald, to administer the coastal area of Deira. Chad&#x27;s brother Cælin was chaplain at Œthelwald&#x27;s court. It was on the initiative of Cælin that Ethelwald donated land for the building of a monastery at Lastingham near Pickering in the North York Moors, close to one of the still-usable Roman roads. Caelin introduced Ethelwold to Cedd. The monastery became a base for Cedd, who was serving as a missionary bishop in Essex.

Bede says that Cedd &quot;fasted strictly in order to cleanse it from the filth of wickedness previously committed there&quot;. On the thirtieth day of his forty-day fast, he was called away on urgent business. Cynibil, another of his brothers, took over the fast for the remaining ten days. The incident indicates the brothers ties with Northumbria&#x27;s ruling dynasty. Laestingaeu was clearly conceived as a base for the family and destined to be under their control for the foreseeable future – not an unusual arrangement in this period. Cedd was stricken by the plague, and upon his death in 664, Chad succeeded him as abbot.

===Abbot of Lastingham===
Chad&#x27;s first appearance as an ecclesiastical prelate occurs in 664, shortly after the Synod of Whitby, when many Church leaders had been wiped out by the plague – among them Cedd, who died that year at Lastingham. On the death of his elder brother, Chad succeeded to the position of abbot.

Bede tells us of a man called Owin (Owen), who appeared at the door of Lastingham. Owin was a household official of Æthelthryth, an East Anglian princess who had come to marry Ecgfrith, Oswiu&#x27;s younger son. He decided to renounce the world, and as a sign of this appeared at Lastingham in ragged clothes and carrying an axe. He had come primarily to work manually. He became one of Chad&#x27;s closest associates.

Chad&#x27;s eschatological consciousness and its effect on others is brought to life in a reminiscence attributed to Trumbert, who was one of his students at Lastingham. Chad used to break off reading whenever a gale sprang up and call on God to have pity on humanity. If the storm intensified, he would shut his book altogether and prostrate himself in prayer. During prolonged storms or thunderstorms he would go into the church itself to pray and sing psalms until calm returned. His monks obviously regarded this as an extreme reaction even to English weather and asked him to explain. Chad explained that storms are sent by God to remind humans of the day of judgement and to humble their pride. The typically Celtic Christian involvement with nature was not like the modern romantic preoccupation but a determination to read in it the mind of God, particularly in relation to the last things.

==Rise of a dynasty==
It is possible that he had only recently returned from Ireland when prominence was thrust upon him. However, the growing importance of his family within the Northumbrian state is clear from Bede&#x27;s account of Cedd&#x27;s career of the founding of their monastery at Lastingham in North Yorkshire. This concentration of ecclesiastical power and influence within the network of a noble family was probably common in Anglo-Saxon England: an obvious parallel would be the children of King Merewalh in Mercia in the following generation.

Cedd, probably the elder brother, had become a very prominent figure in the Church while Chad was in Ireland. Probably as a newly ordained priest, he was sent in 653 by Oswiu on a difficult mission to the Middle Angles, at the request of their sub-king Peada, part of a developing pattern of Northumbrian intervention in Mercian affairs. After perhaps a year, he was recalled and sent on a similar mission to the East Saxons, being ordained bishop shortly afterwards. Cedd&#x27;s position as both a Christian missionary and a royal emissary compelled him to travel often between Essex and Northumbria.

==Bishop of the Northumbrians==

===Need for a bishop===
Bede gives great prominence to the Synod of Whitby in 663/4, which he shows resolving the main issues of practice in the Northumbrian Church in favour of Roman practice. Cedd is shown acting as the main go-between in the synod because of his facility with all of the relevant languages. Cedd was not the only prominent churchman to die of plague shortly after the synod. This was one of several outbreaks of the plague; they badly hit the ranks of the Church leadership, with most of the bishops in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms dead, including the archbishop of Canterbury. Bede tells us that Colmán, the bishop of the Northumbrians at the time of the Synod, had left for Scotland after the Synod went against him. He was succeeded by Tuda, who lived only a short time after his accession. The tortuous process of replacing him is covered by Bede briefly, but in some respects puzzlingly.

===Mission of Wilfrid===

The first choice to replace Tuda was Wilfrid, a particularly zealous partisan of the Roman cause. Because of the plague, there were not the requisite three bishops available to ordain him, so he had gone to the Frankish Kingdom of Neustria to seek ordination. This was on the initiative of Alfrid, sub-king of Deira, although presumably Oswiu knew and approved this action at the time. Bede tells us that Alfrid sought a bishop for himself and his own people. This probably means the people of Deira. According to Bede, Tuda had been succeeded as abbot of Lindisfarne by Eata, who had been elevated to the rank of bishop.

Wilfrid met with his own teacher and patron, Agilbert, a spokesman for the Roman side at Whitby, who had been made bishop of Paris. Agilbert set in motion the process of ordaining Wilfrid canonically, summoning several bishops to Compiègne for the ceremony. Bede tells us that he then lingered abroad for some time after his ordination.

===Elevation===
Bede implies that Oswiu decided to take further action because Wilfrid was away for longer than expected. It is unclear whether Oswiu changed his mind about Wilfrid, or whether he despaired of his return, or whether he never really intended him to become bishop but used this opportunity to get him out of the country.

Chad was invited then to become bishop of the Northumbrians by King Oswiu. Chad is often listed as a Bishop of York, but was more likely made Bishop of Northumbria. Bede generally uses ethnic, not geographical, designations for Chad and other early Anglo-Saxon bishops. However at this point, he does also refer to Oswiu&#x27;s desire that Chad become bishop of the church in York. York later became the diocesan city partly because it had already been designated as such in the earlier Roman-sponsored mission of Paulinus to Deira, so it is not clear whether Bede is simply echoing the practice of his own day, or whether Oswiu and Chad were considering a territorial basis and a see for his episcopate. It is quite clear that Oswiu intended Chad to be bishop over the entire Northumbrian people, over-riding the claims of both Wilfrid and Eata.

Chad faced the same problem over ordination as Wilfrid, and so set off to seek ordination amid the chaos caused by the plague. Bede tells us that he travelled first to Canterbury, where he found that Archbishop Deusdedit was dead and his replacement was still awaited. Bede does not tell us why Chad diverted to Canterbury. The journey seems pointless, since the archbishop had died three years previously, which must have been well known in Northumbria, and was the very reason Wilfrid had to go abroad. The most obvious reason for Chad&#x27;s tortuous travels would be that he was also on a diplomatic mission from Oswiu, seeking to build an encircling alliance around Mercia, which was rapidly recovering from its position of weakness. From Canterbury he travelled to Wessex, where he was ordained by bishop Wini of the West Saxons and two British, i.e. Welsh, bishops. None of these bishops was recognised by Rome. Bede points out that &quot;at that time there was no other bishop in all Britain canonically ordained except Wini&quot; and the latter had been installed irregularly by the king of the West Saxons.

Bede describes Chad at this point as &quot;a diligent performer in deed of what he had learnt in the Scriptures should be done.&quot; Bede also tells us that Chad was teaching the values of Aidan and Cedd. His life was one of constant travel. Bede says that Chad visited continually the towns, countryside, cottages, villages and houses to preach the Gospel. Clearly, the model he followed was one of the bishop as prophet or missionary. Basic Christian rites of passage, baptism and confirmation, were almost always performed by a bishop, and for decades to come they were generally carried out in mass ceremonies, probably with little systematic instruction or counselling.

===Removal===
In c. 666, Wilfrid returned from Neustria, &quot;bringing many rules of Catholic observance&quot;, as Bede says. He found Chad already occupying the same position. It seems that he did not in fact challenge Chad&#x27;s pre-eminence in his own area. Rather, he would have worked assiduously to build up his own support in sympathetic monasteries, like Gilling and Ripon. He did, however, assert his episcopal rank by going into Mercia and even Kent to ordain priests. Bede tells us that the net effect of his efforts on the Church was that the Irish monks who still lived in Northumbria either came fully into line with Catholic practices or left for home. Nevertheless, Bede cannot conceal that Oswiu and Chad had broken significantly with Roman practice in many ways and that the Church in Northumbria had been divided by the ordination of rival bishops.

In 669, a new Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore of Tarsus, sent by Pope Vitalian arrived in England. He immediately set off on a tour of the country, tackling abuses of which he had been forewarned. He instructed Chad to step down and Wilfrid to take over. According to Bede, Theodore was so impressed by Chad&#x27;s show of humility that he confirmed his ordination as bishop, while insisting he step down from his position. Chad retired gracefully and returned to his post as abbot of Lastingham, leaving Wilfrid as bishop of the Northumbrians at York.

==Bishop of the Mercians==

===Recall===
Later that same year, King Wulfhere of Mercia requested a bishop. Wulfhere and the other sons of Penda had converted to Christianity, although Penda himself had remained a pagan until his death (655). Penda had allowed bishops to operate in Mercia, although none had succeeded in establishing the Church securely without active royal support.

Archbishop Theodore refused to consecrate a new bishop. Instead he recalled Chad out of his retirement at Lastingham. According to Bede, Theodore was greatly impressed by Chad&#x27;s humility and holiness. This was displayed particularly in his refusal to use a horse: he insisted on walking everywhere. Despite his regard for Chad, Theodore ordered him to ride on long journeys and went so far as to lift him into the saddle on one occasion.

Chad was consecrated bishop of the Mercians (literally, frontier people) and of the Lindsey people (Lindisfaras). Bede tells us that Chad was actually the third bishop agreed by Wulfhere, making him the fifth bishop of the Mercians. The Kingdom of Lindsey, covering the north-eastern area of modern Lincolnshire, was under Mercian control, although it had in the past sometimes fallen under Northumbrian control. Later Anglo-Saxon episcopal lists sometimes add the Middle Angles to his responsibilities. They were a distinct part of the Mercian kingdom, centred on the middle Trent and lower Tame – the area around Tamworth, Lichfield and Repton that formed the core of the wider Mercian polity. It was their sub-king, Peada, who had secured the services of Chad&#x27;s brother Cedd in 653, and they were frequently considered separately from the Mercians proper, a people who lived further to the west and north.

===Monastic foundations===
Under the patronage of Wulfhere, many monasteries were founded by Wilfrid and the site at Lichfield was selected as the centre for the new Mercian diocese. Archbishop Theodore made Chad Bishop of Mercia in 669. The Lichfield minster was similar to that at Lastingham, and Bede made clear that it was partly staffed by monks from Lastingham, including Chad&#x27;s faithful retainer, Owin. Lichfield was very close to the old Roman road of Watling Street, the main route across Mercia, and Icknield Street to the north. 

Wulfhere also gave Chad land for a monastery at Barrow upon Humber in North Lincolnshire. He travelled about on foot until the Archbishop of Canterbury gave him a horse and ordered him to ride it, at least on long journeys. Chad&#x27;s shrine at Lichfield, sponsored by Bishop Walter de Langton, was destroyed in 1538.

Wulfhere also donated land sufficient for fifty families at a place in Lindsey, referred to by Bede as &quot;Ad Barwae&quot;. This is probably Barrow upon Humber: where an Anglo-Saxon monastery of a later date has been excavated. This was easily reached by river from the Midlands and close to an easy crossing of the River Humber, allowing rapid communication along surviving Roman roads with Lastingham. Chad remained abbot of Lastingham throughout his life, as well as heading the communities at both Lichfield and Barrow.

===Ministry among the Mercians===
Chad then proceeded to carry out much missionary and pastoral work within the kingdom. Bede tells us that Chad governed the bishopric of the Mercians and of the people of Lindsey &#x27;in the manner of the ancient fathers and in great perfection of life&#x27;. However, Bede gives little concrete information about the work of Chad in Mercia, implying that in style and substance it was a continuation of what he had done in Northumbria. The area he covered was very large, stretching across England from coast to coast. It was also, in many places, difficult terrain, with woodland, heath and mountain over much of the centre and large areas of marshland to the east. Bede does tell us that Chad built for himself a small house at Lichfield, a short distance from the church, sufficient to hold his core of seven or eight brothers, who gathered to pray and study with him there when he was not out on business.

Chad worked in Mercia and Lindsey for only two and a half years before he too died during a plague. Yet St. Bede could write in a letter that Mercia came to the faith and Essex was recovered for it by the two brothers Cedd and Chad. In other words, Bede considered that Chad&#x27;s two years as bishop were decisive in Christianising Mercia.

===Death===
Chad died on 2 March 672, and was buried near the Church of Saint Mary which later became part of the cathedral at Lichfield. Bede relates the death story as that of a man who was already regarded as a saint. Bede has stressed throughout his narrative that Chad&#x27;s holiness communicated across boundaries of culture and politics, to Theodore, for example, in his own lifetime. The death story is clearly of supreme importance to Bede, confirming Chad&#x27;s holiness and vindicating his life. The account occupies considerably more space in Bede&#x27;s account than all the rest of Chad&#x27;s ministry in Northumbria and Mercia together.

Bede noted that Owin was working outside the oratory at Lichfield. Inside, Chad studied alone because the other monks were at worship in the church. Suddenly Owin heard the sound of joyful singing, coming from heaven, at first to the south-east, but gradually coming closer until it filled the roof of the oratory itself. Then there was silence for half an hour, followed by the same singing going back the way it had come. Owin at first did nothing, but about an hour later Chad called him in and told him to fetch the seven brothers from the church. Chad gave his final address to the brothers, urging them to keep the monastic discipline they had learnt. Only after this did he tell them that he knew his own death was near, speaking of death as &quot;that friendly guest who is used to visiting the brethren&quot;. He asked them to pray, then blessed and dismissed them. The brothers left, sad and downcast.

Owin returned a little later and saw Chad privately. He asked about the singing. Chad told him that he must keep it to himself for the time being: angels had come to call him to his heavenly reward, and in seven days they would return to fetch him. So it was that Chad weakened and died after seven days on 2 March, which remains his feast day. Bede wrote that: &quot;he had always looked forward to this day, or rather his mind had always been on the Day of the Lord&quot;. Many years later, his old friend Egbert told a visitor that someone in Ireland had seen the heavenly company coming for Chad&#x27;s soul and returning with it to heaven. Significantly, with the heavenly host was Cedd. Bede was not sure whether or not the vision was actually Egbert&#x27;s own.

Bede&#x27;s account of Chad&#x27;s death strongly confirms the main themes of his life. Primarily he was a monastic leader, deeply involved in the fairly small communities of loyal brothers who formed his mission team. His consciousness was strongly eschatological: focussed on the last things and their significance. Finally, he was inextricably linked with Cedd and his other brothers.

==Cult and relics==

Chad is considered a saint in the Roman Catholic, the Anglican churches, the Celtic Orthodox Church and is also noted as a saint in a new edition of the Eastern Orthodox Synaxarion (Book of Saints). His feast day is celebrated on 2 March.

According to St. Bede, Chad was venerated as a saint immediately after his death, and his relics were translated to a new shrine. He remained the centre of an important cult, focused on healing, throughout the Middle Ages. The cult had twin foci: his tomb in the nave and more particularly his skull, kept in a special Head Chapel, alongside the south choir aisle.

The transmission of the relics after the Reformation was tortuous. At the dissolution of the Shrine on the instructions of King Henry VIII in 1538, Prebendary Arthur Dudley of Lichfield Cathedral removed and passed them to his nieces, Bridget and Katherine Dudley, of Russells Hall. In 1651, they reappeared when a farmer Henry Hodgetts of Sedgley was on his death-bed and kept praying to St Chad. When the priest hearing his last confession, Fr Peter Turner SJ, asked him why he called upon Chad. Henry replied, &quot;because his bones are in the head of my bed&quot;. He instructed his wife to give the relics to the priest, whence some of the relics found their way to the Seminary at St Omer, in France. In the early 19th century, they found their way into the hands of Sir Thomas Fitzherbert-Brockholes of Aston Hall, near Stone, Staffordshire. When his chapel was cleared after his death, his chaplain, Fr Benjamin Hulme, discovered the box containing the relics, which were examined and presented to Bishop Thomas Walsh, the Roman Catholic Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District in 1837 and were enshrined in the new St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham, opened in 1841, in a new ark designed by Augustus Pugin.

The relics, six bones, were enshrined on the Altar of St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral. They were examined by the Oxford Archaeological Laboratory by carbon-dating techniques in 1985, and all but one of the bones (which was a third femur, and therefore could not have come from Bishop Chad) were dated to the seventh century, and were authenticated as &#x27;true relics&#x27; by the Vatican authorities. In 1919, an Annual Mass and Solemn Outdoor Procession of the Relics was held at St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral in Birmingham. This observance continues to the present, on the Saturday nearest to his Feast Day, 2 March.

In November 2022, one bone relic was returned to Lichfield Cathedral and is housed in a new shrine in the retrochoir and close to where they were located in medieval times. Lichfield Cathedral is a significant pilgrimage church-cathedral and the new shrine is a focus for all pilgrims ending their journey.

Chad is remembered in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church on 2 March.

==Portrayals of St Chad==

There are no portraits or descriptions of St Chad from his own time. The only hint comes in the legend of Theodore lifting him bodily into the saddle, possibly suggesting that he was remembered as small in stature.
==Notable dedications==

===Churches===
Chad gives his name to Birmingham&#x27;s Roman Catholic cathedral, where there are some relics of the saint: about eight long bones. It is the only cathedral in England that has the relics of its patron saint enshrined upon its high altar. The Anglican Lichfield Cathedral, at the site of his burial, is dedicated to Chad, and St Mary, and still has a head chapel, where the skull of the saint was kept until it was lost during the Reformation. The site of the medieval shrine is also marked.

Chad also gives his name to a parish church in Lichfield (with Chad&#x27;s Well, where traditionally Chad baptised converts: now a listed building).

Dedications are densely concentrated in the West Midlands. The city of Wolverhampton, for example, has two Anglican churches and an Academy dedicated to Chad, while the nearby village of Pattingham has both an Anglican church and primary school. Shrewsbury had a large medieval church of St Chad which fell down in 1788: it was quickly replaced by a circular church in Classical style by George Steuart, on a different site but with the same dedication. Parish Church in Montford, built in 1735–38, site of the graves of the parents of Charles Darwin. Parish Church in Coseley built in 1882. In Rugby, Warwickshire, an Orthodox Church is named for him. Further afield, there is a considerable number of dedications in areas associated with Chad&#x27;s career, like the churches in Church Wilne in Derbyshire, Far Headingley in Leeds, the Parish Church of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and the Church of St Chad, Haggerston in London, as well as some in the Commonwealth, like Chelsea in Australia. There is also a St Chad&#x27;s College within the University of Durham, founded in 1904 as an Anglican hall.

In Canada, St Chad&#x27;s Chapel and College was built in 1918 in Regina. Originally, it was a Catholic church and boys&#x27; school. In 1964, it became an Anglican school for girls, called St Chad&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. Today, it is a protected historic building in Regina.

The Principal Parish of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross is named the Church of St Ninian and St Chad.

The chapel of Brasenose College, Oxford is named the Chapel of St Hugh and St Chad.

===Toponyms===

Chadkirk Chapel in Romiley, Greater Manchester, may have been dedicated to St Chad; as Kenneth Cameron points out, -&quot;kirk&quot; (&quot;church&quot;) toponyms incorporate the name of the dedicatee more often than that of the patron. The chapel dates back to the 14th century, but the site is much older, possibly dating back to the 7th century when it is believed St Chad visited to bless the well there. 

St Chad&#x27;s Well near Battle Bridge on the River Fleet in London was a medicinal well dedicated to St Chad. It was destroyed by the Midland Railway company in 1860, and is remembered in the street name of St Chad&#x27;s Place.

The Worcestershire town of Kidderminster was thought by one 19th-century author to be named for a minster dedicated to Chad or Cedd, but modern scholars give the etymology of the name as &quot;Cydela&#x27;s monastery&quot;.

===Schools===

Denstone College in the Village of Denstone, Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire was founded by Nathaniel Woodard as the Flagship Woodard School of the Midlands. The school was founded as St Chad&#x27;s College, Denstone. The School&#x27;s Chapel is named as the Chapel of St Chad with depictions of him around the chapel&#x27;s Narthex. The students of the school wear the famous cross of St Chad which is the school&#x27;s logo. The motto of the School is ‘Lignum Crucis Arbor Scientae’ which is Latin for ‘The Wood of the Cross is the Tree of Knowledge’. There are also depictions of him in the School&#x27;s Quadrangle.

===Chad as a personal name===
Chad remains a fairly popular given name, one of the few personal names current among 7th century Anglo-Saxons to do so. However, it was very little used for many centuries before a modest revival in the mid-20th century.

==Patronage==
Due to the somewhat confused nature of Chad&#x27;s appointment and the continued references to &#x27;chads&#x27;, small pieces of ballot papers punched out by voters using voting machines in the 2000 US Presidential Election, it has been jocularly suggested that Chad is the patron saint of botched elections. There is no official patron saint of elections, although the Church has designated a later English official, Thomas More, the patron of politicians.

The &quot;Spa Research Fellowship&quot; states that Chad is the patron saint of medicinal springs, although other listings do not mention this patronage.

St. Chad&#x27;s Day (2 March) is traditionally considered the most propitious day to sow broad beans in England.

==Legacy==
St. Chad&#x27;s College is a college of Durham University.

<doc id="488761" wikidata="Q92086" url="?curid=488761" title="Promontory fort">
<text>A [[promontory]] fort is a defensive structure located above a steep cliff, often only connected to the mainland by a small neck of land, thus using the topography to reduce the ramparts needed.

The oldest known promontory fort is Amnya I in Siberia which was established as a fortified site in the late 7th millennium BC. Although their dating is problematic, most seem to date to the Iron Age. They are mainly found in Ireland, Brittany, the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, Devon, the Channel Islands and Cornwall.

==Ireland==

Only a few Irish promontory forts have been excavated and most date to the Iron Age, though some, like Dunbeg Fort (County Kerry) might have originated in the Bronze Age. Others, like Dalkey Island (County Dublin) contain imported Eastern Mediterranean pottery and have been reoccupied and changed in the early medieval period. Some, like Doonmore (near Dingle, County Kerry) are associated with the Middle Ages. Dunbeg contains an early medieval corbelled stone hut (clochán).

==Isle of Man==
On the Isle of Man, promontory forts are found particularly on the rocky slate headlands of the south. Four out of more than twenty have been excavated and several, especially in Santon, can be visited using the Raad ny Foillan coastal footpath. All have a rampart on their vulnerable landward side, and excavations at Cronk ny Merriu have shown that access to the fort was via a strongly built gate.

The Scandinavians who arrived in Mann in the eighth and ninth centuries AD sometimes re-used these Iron Age promontory forts, often obliterating the old domestic quarters with their characteristic rectangular houses; the fine example at Cronk ny Merriu has been used as the basis of the reconstruction in the House of Manannan museum in Peel.

==Devon and Cornwall==

Cornish promontory forts can be found all along the coast of Penwith. Maen Castle, near to Land&#x27;s End is one of the oldest, having been dated to around 500 BC. They are also found in other districts, e.g. The Rumps near Padstow and Dodman Point on the southern Cornish coast as well as Rame Head close to Plymouth. In Devon, Burgh Island and Bolt Tail are located on the south coast and Embury Beacon and Hillsborough on the north coast.
The famous site at Tintagel may be a rare example of promontory fort whose occupation continued into the post Roman and from there into later periods.

==Brittany==
Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de bello Gallico&quot; describes the Veneti in southern Armorica – a powerful sea-faring people allied with the southern British during the war of 56 BC – as living in clifftop oppida. Their capital was Darioritum, on the Gulf of Morbihan, now modern Vannes/Gwened. The Veneti had close trade ties with southwestern Britain. When they were attacked by the Romans in Brittany, Julius Caesar reports that Cornwall sent them military aid.

==Channel Islands==
There are a few examples of promontory forts on the Island of Jersey, which includes Le Pinacle, Le Câtel de Rozel, and Le Câtel de Lecq. All of these were located on headlands on the north and north-east of the Island, given the strong natural defences that exist on those parts of the Island. Remains of an Iron Age fort were located on the site of Mont Orgueil Castle to the east of the island as well as materials from the Neolithic and Bronze Age.

<text>Beneficence is a 1937 bronze statue on the campus of Ball State University, located in Muncie, Indiana. The statue, by sculptor Daniel Chester French, is referred to as Benny by students.

==History==
In 1927, the Muncie Chamber of Commerce proposed building a memorial to express gratitude on behalf of Muncie and Ball State University for the Ball Brothers&#x27; extensive generosity to the community. The monetary value of the Balls&#x27; philanthropies in Muncie totaled $7 million by the monument&#x27;s completion in 1937.

The Chamber commissioned renowned sculptor Daniel Chester French, who sculpted the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. &quot;Beneficence&quot; was chosen for the statue because it aptly described the feelings of the community and the actions of the Ball Brothers. French entrusted architect Richard Henry Dana to choose a location for the statue and to design the surrounding promenade.

The price tag for &quot;Beneficence&quot;, completed in 1930, was approximately $50,000. The progress toward installation crawled during the Great Depression as funds for the project became scarce. More than 11,000 individuals, including children, donated money to assist in completing the memorial, and &quot;Beneficence&quot; was dedicated on September 26, 1937. Sealed inside the Beneficence is a book containing all donors who contributed to the memorial&#x27;s completion. Although the project was the last for French, neither he nor Dana lived to see its dedication. The statue, affectionately known as &quot;Benny&quot;, symbolizes the selflessness of the five brothers in their service to the community. It is so entwined in the university&#x27;s culture that its image is part of the school seal.

&quot;Beneficence&quot;&#x27;s hand stretches to welcome new students to campus. The treasure box she holds in her other arm represents the treasure education can offer. Her wings represent the flight into the world when students graduate. The five Corinthian columns behind the statue represent the Ball Brothers, for whom the university is named.
&quot;Beneficence&quot; resembles earlier examples of French&#x27;s work, such as &quot;Angel of the Waters&quot;, part of a memorial to businessman and philanthropist George Robert White in the Boston Public Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, and &quot;The Spirit of Life&quot; in Saratoga Springs, New York. The model for The Spirit of Life statue was Audrey Munson, so it is said that Munson was referenced for Beneficence.

In the same year Beneficence was dedicated, 1937, Daniel Chester French&#x27;s protege, Edith Barretto Stevens Parsons, cast another famous statue on campus, the Frog Baby Fountain.

==Campus lore==
Some students believe one way to find true love is to sit under &quot;Benny&quot; and kiss them with closed eyes. If &quot;Benny&quot;&#x27;s wings flap, then the love is true; if no flapping occurs, then the love is not meant to be. Another myth suggests that the severed heads of each of the five Ball Brothers rest in individual urns on the top of the respective pillar; however, all five brothers are buried at Beech Grove Cemetery in Muncie. Another legend states that a female student is not officially a coed until she is kissed by a male student beneath the statue. Another campus myth states if a virgin were ever to cross Benny&#x27;s path, she would come to life and fly away.

<text>Winfield Scott Schley (9 October 1839 – 2 October 1911) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy and the hero of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born at &quot;Richfields&quot; (his father&#x27;s farm), near Frederick, Maryland, Schley graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1860, and went as midshipman on board the frigate to China and Japan.

===Civil War===
On his return in 1861, the American Civil War was in progress. He was made master, and was assigned to the frigate of the Western Gulf Squadron until 1862. He then served on the sidewheel gunboat of that squadron, and later on the sloops and , and participated in all the engagements that led to the capture of Port Hudson, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River in 1863, (part of the campaign to split the Confederacy at Vicksburg), having been promoted to lieutenant on 16 July 1862.

===Chincha Island War and San Salvador Revolution===
He was ordered from the waters of the South in 1864 to the Pacific Squadron, where he served on the sidewheel gunboat as executive officer until 1866. He suppressed an insurrection of Chinese workers on the Chincha Islands in 1865, and later in the same year landed at La Unión, El Salvador, to protect American interests during a revolution. He was promoted lieutenant commander in 1866.

===Korean Expedition===

From 1866 to 1869, he was an instructor in the United States Naval Academy. He was then assigned to the Asiatic Station, and served there on the screw sloop until 1872 and was adjutant of the land forces during the attack by Rear Admiral John Rodgers&#x27;s expedition on the Korean forts on Ganghwa Island on 10 June and 11 June 1871. He then participated in the following Battle of Gangwha which caused the destruction of the Korean fortifications.

===Between conflicts, 1870s–1890s===

From 1872 to 1875, he was head of the department of modern languages in the Naval Academy. He was promoted commander in June 1874.

After serving in Europe and on the west coast of Africa, he commanded the sloop of war from 1876 to 1879, most of the time in the South Atlantic on the Brazil Station. During the cruise he sailed &quot;Essex&quot; to the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands in search of a missing sealer, and rescued a shipwrecked crew on the islands of Tristan da Cunha. From 1879 until October 1883, he was inspector of the Second Lighthouse District.

After re-supply and relief missions repeatedly failed to reach Lieutenant Adolphus Greely&#x27;s Lady Franklin Bay Expedition in the Arctic, Schley was appointed in February 1884 to command the next relief expedition. His flagship was the recently purchased Canadian sailing bark , which would go on to have a long and distinguished career in Federal service. On 22 June, near Cape Sabine in Grinnell Land, Schley rescued Greely and six (of his twenty-four) companions, after passing through of ice during the voyage.

Schley was commissioned chief of the bureau of equipment and recruiting at the United States Department of the Navy in 1885, and promoted captain in March 1888.

He commanded one of the earliest protected cruisers, , in Rear Admiral George Brown&#x27;s squadron off the coast of Chile in 1891, going to the port of Valparaiso, when a number of American sailors there were stoned by a mob. In August 1891, &quot;Baltimore&quot;, still under his command, was detailed to convey the remains of John Ericsson, designer of the famed first Civil War ironclad ship to Sweden.

Early in 1892 he was again transferred to the Lighthouse Bureau, and until February 1895 was inspector of the Third Lighthouse District. In 1895, he was placed in command of the armored cruiser . From 1897 to 1898, he was a member (and chairman) of the Lighthouse Board.

===Spanish–American War===

Schley was commissioned commodore on 6 February 1898, and on 24 March, although lowest on the list of commodores, he was put in command of the Flying Squadron, with the armored cruiser as his flagship, for service in the Spanish–American War.

On 18 May 1898, &quot;Schley&#x27;s Flying Squadron&quot; was sent by Acting Rear Admiral William T. Sampson to Cienfuegos to pursue the Spanish Squadron under the command of Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. When Sampson received news that Cervera was in Santiago de Cuba, not Cienfuegos, he initially vacillated, at first informing Schley of the rumor, yet requesting him to stay at Cienfuegos, then later changing his orders to have Schley investigate the situation at Santiago.

Although Schley was subordinate to Sampson, he was accustomed to exercising independent command of his ship. Schley decided to stay at Cienfuegos, feeling that all signs indicated that Cervera was there in the harbor. After hearing from Cuban insurgents that Cervera was definitely not at Cienfuegos, Schley decided to obey Sampson&#x27;s orders three days after receiving them and go to Santiago. When the crew of three American cruisers he encountered denied knowledge of Cervera&#x27;s whereabouts, Schley decided to return to Key West, Florida, to get coal for his ship. The Navy Department sent a dispatch to Schley asking him to stay at Santiago, but he replied that he was unable to obey these orders. Inexplicably, Schley decided mid-voyage to return to Santiago on 28 May, where the following day it was confirmed that the Spanish Squadron was there. Sampson arrived on 1 June and assumed command. The American ships formed a reverse crescent from west to south to east to blockade the narrow south facing harbor entrance channel to trap the Spanish ships. Generally, the crescent would be made up of the faster cruiser &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and battleship to the west and south and the heavier battleships , , and to the south and east. The concept was that the bigger but slower warships would shield the Daiquiri beachhead and supply ships to supporting the land invasion to the east and the faster ships to the west would be able to converge on the Spanish fleet as it came out. Clearly the greatest concern to the Navy was protecting the Army beachhead from a Spanish sortie. Of less concern was the Spanish ships running to the west to escape. There was one other ship, the armored cruiser &quot;New York&quot;, as fast as &quot;Brooklyn&quot; but less heavily armed, which Sampson used as his own flagship.

===Battle of Santiago===
On 3 July, while Sampson in &quot;New York&quot; was en route to meet General William Shafter onshore in Cuba and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was off coaling at Guantanamo, Admiral Cervera attempted to force his squadron through the blockade by coming out of the channel to Santiago harbor with guns blazing and then turning west. Schley had assumed control in Sampson&#x27;s absence. &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, his flagship, was placed on the extreme western side of the American crescent. As part of his plan, Cervera intentionally steered , his flagship and lead ship of the Spanish Squadron, and already significantly damaged as it passed by &quot;Iowa&quot;, which caught it with two shells, directly at &quot;Brooklyn&quot; with the intent to ram and/or launch bow torpedoes (which had very short range). Cervera&#x27;s intent was to sacrifice &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; to make a hole to the west for the rest of the Spanish ships, which had followed &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; out of the narrow channel in single file and through the gauntlet of &quot;Indiana&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot; to the east and &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;Oregon&quot; to the south, and take out &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, the fastest ship in the American fleet. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; rushed forward initially at the Spanish (this was the general plan, to close with the enemy as quickly as possible), but, as &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; turned west, &quot;Texas&quot; matched its direction to offer its broadside and run with the Spanish fleet, as did &quot;Oregon&quot; behind it. The firing was continuous from all ships, with the Americans somewhat blinded by the smoke, more so than the Spaniards.

Schley, in &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, moving east, suddenly realizing that &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; was not going to veer off but was going to ram or launch torpedoes, ordered &quot;Brooklyn&quot; to steer away from the surprisingly aggressive &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; back towards the path of the rest of the squadron. This action caused &quot;Texas&quot;, which was just getting up to full speed, to suddenly reverse its engines for three minutes, bringing it to a near stop. &quot;Texas&quot; stopped because it could no longer see &quot;Brooklyn&quot; after it had noted the start of the latter&#x27;s turn in its general direction. This action by &quot;Texas&quot; was precautionary but clearly prudent, as a collision would have been a disaster. It is not documented how close &quot;Brooklyn&quot; crossed the bow of &quot;Texas&quot;. A newspaper artist later put it very close, and Captain John Woodward Philip, commander of &quot;Texas&quot;, stated later that &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was quite large in appearance as it crossed in front of &quot;Texas&quot; as the massive armored cruiser appeared out of the smoke. Subsequently, the now stationary &quot;Texas&quot; was also forced to cease firing, as &quot;Oregon&quot;, now moving at a surprising speed for a pre-dreadnought battleship, ran up aft of &quot;Texas&quot; and properly, due to its greater firepower, passed to the inside towards the Spanish fleet, effectively masking the fire of &quot;Texas&quot; for a few minutes. This was not particularly grave as &quot;Texas&quot;, an obsolescent design (one of the first heavily armored U.S. Navy battleships), could not put out near the rate of fire of the other newer battleships. When &quot;Oregon&quot; passed, &quot;Texas&quot; found itself engaged by , the fourth ship in the Spanish line, and received four hits, the Spaniard firing the last of its &quot;good&quot; ammunition (the Spanish vessels were handicapped because their otherwise rapid-firing guns only had a limited supply of properly made ammunition, which they expended very quickly). Ironically, because &quot;Texas&quot; had already to some extent engaged &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot;, , and , and now &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; more closely and even the trailing Spanish torpedo boats, and and had been involved with the excitement of the maneuvers by &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Oregon&quot;, it received excellent press, far more than it actually deserved, and this to some extent may have exacerbated the negative impression arising from it having to first stop to avoid potential collision and then having its fire masked. &quot;Texas&quot; had also already earned laurels during the taking of the Spaniards&#x27; &quot;Guantanamo&quot;, and would gain more in its engagement with after the battle, and this may have increased its perceived importance.

There is no doubt that Schley&#x27;s turn gave the Spanish ships added time to get out of the mouth of Santiago harbor, but the American fleet, including Schley&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, which had completed its turn and was still ahead of &quot;Oregon&quot;, closed and at only about engaged &quot;Vizcaya&quot; in a running fight. It was fortunate for Schley that &quot;Vizcaya&quot;, ordinarily a fast ship, was very slow due to having an extremely fouled hull and could not match the speed of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, which was now clear of the fight. Had the hull of &quot;Vizcaya&quot; been clean, Schley would have found himself chasing two ships and not fighting one. &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; was now on fire and was so damaged that it had to turn north and beach itself. The battle between &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Vizcaya&quot; was ferocious for a time as the ships steamed west, but the quality weaponry of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; overwhelmed it, not to mention &quot;Oregon&quot;, which was astern and firing. &quot;Vizcaya&quot;, terribly damaged after a torpedo exploded internally and on fire, was forced to also beach itself. By this time &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; and the Spanish destroyers had also been overwhelmed by American fire.

Now Schley steamed after &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; with &quot;Oregon&quot; trailing and &quot;Texas&quot; following further behind, while &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Indiana&quot; and auxiliary vessels saw to the aftermath of the rest of the disabled Spanish fleet. The race with &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; was dramatic, but &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; eventually slowed as its small supply of English coal ran out and it had to rely on lower-quality fuel; eventually it was forced to try to turn south and make a break. However, the long-range guns of &quot;Oregon&quot; dissuaded it and, with &quot;Brooklyn&quot; immediately behind the captain of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, decided to beach and scuttle his ship. The capture of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; was an exciting end to the battle. Captain Philip of &quot;Texas&quot;, who expressed no present or later ill will at the temporary discomfiture of &quot;Texas&quot; during the battle due to &quot;Brooklyn&quot;″s turn, stated that when he was going to &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in a small boat to report to Schley, the commodore happily shouted down to him from the bridge, &quot;Some fight, eh, Jack?&quot;

All the while, Sampson in &quot;New York&quot;, too far to the east at his meeting, tried mightily to catch up to the battle. By the time &quot;New York&quot; reached the bulk of the Spanish fleet, the battle was over, and &quot;New York&quot; also could not catch the beaching of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; had not been able to fire a single shot, depriving Sampson of any participation in the battle.

When the victory message from Sampson, who was of course in overall command of the naval campaign, was reported, it contained no reference to any officer other than himself, even though he was not involved in the actual fighting. Sampson was loath to praise Schley&#x27;s role in the battle, a fact which derived from professional jealousy, as was evidenced later by Sampson&#x27;s own conduct at the subsequent court of inquiry. Sampson was of the opinion that had it not been for the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, Schley would have been court-martialed. The public, however, regarded Schley as the hero not only of the battle, but also of the war, while Sampson was seen (accurately) as indecorous for not acknowledging Schley&#x27;s role.

===Late career===
On 14 April 1899, Schley was promoted to rear admiral. In November 1899, he was put in command of the South Atlantic Squadron, and, on 9 October 1901, he retired from active service upon reaching the age limit.

==Controversy relating to the Battle of Santiago==
A controversy arose between partisans of Schley and those of Sampson over their respective claims to the credit of the victory over Cervera&#x27;s fleet during the recent war. Of that discussion neither officer personally took public notice until after the appearance of a work by Edgar Stanton Maclay entitled &quot;History of the United States Navy&quot;. In that book, the author referred to Commodore Schley as a &quot;caitiff, poltroon and coward.&quot; The proofs of the book had been read and approved by various naval officers, among them Rear Admiral Sampson.

At Schley&#x27;s request, because of the charges made against him in the book, a court of inquiry was opened on September 12, 1901, composed of Admiral George Dewey, Rear Admiral Andrew E. K. Benham and Rear Admiral Francis Munroe Ramsay, which investigated Schley&#x27;s conduct before and during the Battle of Santiago. On December 13, 1901, the court reported its proceedings and the testimony taken, with a full and detailed statement of all the pertinent facts which it deemed to be established, together with its opinion and recommendations. Various officers gave conflicting testimony as to Schley&#x27;s conduct, with one, Captain Templin Potts, directly accusing Schley of cowardice.

The majority report of the court found that Commodore Schley failed to proceed to Santiago with due despatch, that the squadron should not have been delayed by the yacht , that he should not have turned westward, that he should have obeyed the Navy Department&#x27;s order of May 25, 1898, that he did not do his utmost to capture &quot;Cristóbal Colón,&quot; that the turn of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; caused &quot;Texas&quot; to stop, for carelessness in endangering &quot;Texas&quot;, for blanketing the fire of other American vessels, that he did injustice to Lieutenant Commander Hodgson (Navigation officer of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; at the time of the incident), that his conduct in the Santiago campaign was characterized by vacillation, dilatoriness, and &quot;lack of enterprise,&quot; and that his coal reports were inaccurate and misleading. Admiral George Dewey, however, presented a minority report, in which he praised Schley for promptness and efficient service, and gave him the credit for the destruction of Cervera&#x27;s fleet.

The court recommended that no action be taken in view of the length of time which had elapsed. Rear Admiral Schley filed a protest against the court&#x27;s findings, which, however, were approved by the Secretary of the Navy Long, who supported Sampson on grounds of rank and seniority. Nonetheless, the public press, and particularly the Hearst newspapers, saw the outcome as vindicating Schley, whose status as a war hero was enhanced by the exposure. In January 1902, Rear Admiral Schley appealed from the verdict to President Theodore Roosevelt, who, however, confirmed Secretary Long&#x27;s approval.

==Other interests==
Schley belonged to several military societies, including the Naval Order of the United States, the Military Order of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (insignia number 9233). In 1905 he became a member of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and was assigned national membership number 17,070.

Schley wrote, with James Russell Soley, &quot;The Rescue of Greely&quot; (New York, 1885). He also wrote and published his autobiography, &quot;Forty-five Years under the Flag&quot; (New York, 1904).

==Death and burial==
Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley died on October 2, 1911, nine years after Rear Admiral Sampson, who barely survived his retirement in 1902. At the time of his death, Schley was a noted resident of the famous Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan. 

After his collapse and death along 5th Avenue near the hotel, Schley&#x27;s body lay unrecognized and unclaimed in the back yard of the local police precinct for several hours. It was only after he was discovered missing that he was properly identified and retrieved by the indignant concierge of the Algonquin. 

On October 5, 1911, Rear Admiral Schley was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, in Virginia.

<text>A mousepad or mousemat is a surface for placing and moving a computer mouse. A mousepad enhances the usability of the mouse compared to using a mouse directly on a table by providing a surface to allow it to measure movement accurately and without jitter. Some mousepads increase ergonomics by providing a padded wrist rest.

==History==

During a 1967 presentation by Douglas Engelbart marking the public debut of a mouse, 
Engelbart used a control console designed by Matt P. Brown of Herman Miller that included a keyboard and an inset portion used as a support area for the mouse.
According to Kelley 
and also stated by Alex Pang, Kelley designed the first mousepad a year later, in 1969.

Details of a mousepad designed by Armando M. Fernandez were published in the Xerox Disclosure Journal in 1979 with the description:
By 1982, most users of the Xerox ball mouse were using special pads to increase the friction of the ball in the mouse.

The first commercial manufacturer of mousepads was Moustrak, founded by Bob McDermand. The company began gaining traction when Apple decided to distribute its mousepads, featuring the Apple logo, to computer stores in the United States. Moustrak signed licensing deals with Disney, Paramount, and LucasFilm, and advertised in magazines including &quot;MacWorld&quot;. However, by the end of the 1980s, lower cost mousepads turned the product into a commodity.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; tracks the term &quot;mouse pad&quot; to the August 24, 1983, publication of &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, and the predominantly British term &quot;mousemat&quot; to October 17, 1989, in the publication &quot;3D&quot;.

==Benefits==

The three most important benefits of the introduction of the mousepad were higher speed, more precision, and comfort for the user. A secondary benefit was keeping the desk or table surface from being scratched and worn by continuous hand and mouse rubbing motion. Another benefit was reduction of the collection of debris under the mouse, which resulted in reduced jitter of the pointer on the display. Also, it is important to clean mousepads.

The mousepads can be cleaned by special detergents, liquid soap, hand wash or dry cleaning. Not all mousepads are machine washable.

When optical mice, which use image sensors to detect movement, were first introduced into the market, they required special mousepads with optical patterns printed on them. Modern optical mice can function to an acceptable degree of accuracy on plain paper and other surfaces. However, some optical mouse users (especially gamers, designers, and other heavy users) may prefer a mousepad for comfort, speed and accuracy, and to prevent wear to the desk or table surface.

==Types==
A variety of mousepads exist with many different textured surfaces to fit various types of mouse technologies.

After the steel mouse ball was given a silicone rubber surface, the popular fabric-surface mousepad was found to be the most appropriate. It helped keep the rubberized roller-ball surface cleaner and gave better tracking, speed, and accuracy than just a desk surface. Such surfaces collected dirt which was then deposited onto the internal rollers that picked off ball movement. Dirty rollers caused erratic pointer movement on the screen.

Early types of optical mice have the problem of not working well on transparent or reflective surfaces such as glass or highly polished wood. These surfaces, which often include desk and table surfaces, cause jitter and loss of tracking on the display pointer as the mouse moves over these reflective spots. The use of mousepads with precision surfaces eliminates the spot-jitter effects of older and/or low-quality optical mice.

Newer generations of mouse pads incorporate a wireless charging system into the pad, allowing a wireless mouse to be used without the need to replace or recharge batteries.

==Materials==
Modern mousepads are typically made of lesser density rucomposites (open cell styrene, butadiene rubber or open cell SBR) with fabric bonded to the upper surface. However, many other types of material have been used, including fabric, plastics, recycled rubber tires, neoprene, silicone rubber, leather, glass, cork, wood, aluminum, stone and stainless steel.

<text>Anthony Goicolea (born 1971) is a New York-based fine art photographer, drafter, and installation artist, born in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Work==

Goicolea&#x27;s photographs frequently deal with issues of androgyny, homosexuality, and child sexuality. Goicolea was educated at the University of Georgia and studied painting, photography, and sculpture at that institution. He holds an MFA in fine arts from the Pratt Institute. He made his debut in 1999, and now shows work with Postmasters gallery in New York, Aurel Scheibler in Berlin, Germany, and Gow Langsford Gallery in Auckland, New Zealand.

Some of his work features photographs of &quot;pre- to barely pubescent boys&quot; in elaborately staged tableau settings, commonly showing multiple boys wearing traditional private school uniforms either engaged in school-life or recreation after school—but with often transgressive and erotic twists in their activities. Of great interest in these compositions is the fact that Goicolea &quot;himself&quot; portrays all of the boys in his photographs through the astute use of costumes, wigs, makeup, and post-production editing using Adobe Photoshop; &quot;always looking uncannily like a boy on the edge of puberty&quot;. Therefore, despite having numerous figures in them, Goicolea&#x27;s photographs are actually very complex large-scale self-portraits, and are always done in a flawlessly realist manner.

The pioneering fine art photographer Cindy Sherman is an apparent influence on Goicolea&#x27;s work, given her own extensive use of self-portraits and emphasis on sexually charged narrative topics. Sherman and Goicolea have also had several joint exhibitions. His work can be strongly compared to similar manipulated and/or staged art photography featuring children and adolescents, such as that of Bernard Faucon, Loretta Lux, and Justine Kurland. Critic Guy Davenport was an early admirer of Goicolea&#x27;s work, which he compared in 2002 to that of Faucon.

Goicolea has also been producing and exhibiting his drawings, which follow much of the same subject matter as his photographs. He has also published several books. 
On June 25, 2017, the day of 2017 New York City Pride March festivities, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that Anthony Goicolea had been chosen to design the first official monument to LGBT individuals commissioned by the State of New York. The monument is planned to be built in Hudson River Park in Manhattan, near the waterfront Hudson River piers which have served as historically significant symbols of New York&#x27;s role as a meeting place and a safe haven for LGBT communities.

==Personal life==

Goicolea is Cuban-American and openly gay. He lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York with his partner, Paul Kelterborn.

On the death of his son, the fourth baron, the line of the eldest son of the first baron failed. The late baron was succeeded by his second cousin, the fifth baron. He was the grandson of Peter Campbell Scarlett, third son of the first baron. When he died the title passed to his younger brother, the sixth baron, and then to another brother, the seventh baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the ninth baron, who succeeded his father in 2002.

Sir James Yorke Scarlett, second son of the first baron, was a general in the army and fought in the Crimean War. Mary Elizabeth, daughter of the first baron, was created Baroness Stratheden in 1836. She was the wife of John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell.

<doc id="488783" wikidata="Q7205529" url="?curid=488783" title="Plural form of words ending in -us">
<text>In English, the plural form of words ending in &quot;-us&quot;, especially those derived from Latin, often replaces &quot;-us&quot; with &quot;-i&quot;. There are many exceptions, some because the word does not derive from Latin, and others due to custom (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;campus&quot;, plural &quot;campuses&quot;). Conversely, some non-Latin words ending in &quot;-us&quot; and Latin words that did not have their Latin plurals with &quot;-i&quot; form their English plurals with &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;octopi&quot; is sometimes used as a plural for octopus (the standard English plural is octopuses). Most Prescriptivists consider these forms incorrect, but descriptivists may simply describe them as a natural evolution of language; some prescriptivists do consider some such forms correct (e.g. &quot;octopi&quot; as the plural of &quot;octopus&quot; being analogous to &quot;polypi&quot; as the plural of &quot;polypus&quot;).

Some English words of Latin origin do not commonly take the Latin plural, but rather the regular English plurals in -(e)s: &quot;campus&quot;, &quot;bonus&quot;, and &quot;anus&quot;; while others regularly use the Latin forms: &quot;radius&quot; (&quot;radii&quot;) and &quot;alumnus&quot; (&quot;alumni&quot;). Still others may use either: &quot;corpus&quot; (&quot;corpora&quot; or &quot;corpuses&quot;), &quot;formula&quot; (&quot;formulae&quot; in technical contexts, &quot;formulas&quot; otherwise), &quot;index&quot; (&quot;indices&quot; mostly in technical contexts, &quot;indexes&quot; otherwise).

==History==

In Latin, most second declension masculine nouns ending in &quot;-us&quot; form their plural in &quot;-i&quot;. However, some Latin nouns ending in &quot;-us&quot; are not second declension (&quot;cf.&quot; Latin grammar). For example, third declension neuter nouns such as &quot;opus&quot; and &quot;corpus&quot; have plurals &quot;opera&quot; and &quot;corpora&quot;, and fourth declension masculine and feminine nouns such as &quot;sinus&quot; and &quot;tribus&quot; have plurals &#x27; and &#x27;.

Some English words derive from Latin idiosyncratically. For example, &quot;bus&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;omnibus&quot; &#x27;for everyone&#x27;, the ablative (and dative) plural of &quot;omnis&quot;, and &quot;ignoramus&quot; is a verb form, &#x27;we do not know&#x27;. &quot;Syllabus&quot; is a Late Latin (16th c.) word, derived from a misreading of the Greek &quot;sittybos&quot; &quot;table of contents&quot;; since it is not a classical word, some argue that it does not have a classical plural. However, the form &quot;syllabi&quot; is used and considered acceptable by some sources.

==&quot;Virus&quot;==
The English plural of &quot;virus&quot; is &quot;viruses&quot;. In most speaking communities, this is non-controversial and speakers would not attempt to use the non-standard plural in -&quot;i&quot;. However, in computer enthusiast circles in the late 20th century and early 21st, the non-standard &quot;viri&quot; form (sometimes even &quot;virii&quot;) was well attested, generally in the context of computer viruses. &quot;Viri&quot; is also found in some nineteenth-century sources.

While the number of users employing these non-standard plural forms of &quot;virus&quot; was always a small percentage of the English-speaking population, the variation was notable because it coincided with the growth of the web, a medium on which users of &quot;viri&quot; were over-represented. As the distribution of Internet users shifted to be more representative of the population as a whole during the 2000s, the non-standard forms saw decline in usage. A tendency towards prescriptivism in the computer enthusiast community, combined with the growing awareness that &quot;viri&quot; and &quot;virii&quot; are not etymologically supported plural forms, also played a part.

&quot;Vīrus&quot; in Classical Latin was a mass noun, denoting something uncountable. These pluralize only under special circumstances, and no plural form of the word can be found in contemporary texts.

The Latin word &quot;vīrus&quot; was a neuter noun of the second declension, but neuter second declension nouns ending in &quot;-us&quot; (rather than &quot;-um&quot;) are rare enough that inferring rules is difficult. (One rare attested plural, &quot;pelage&quot; as a plural of &quot;pelagus&quot;, is borrowed from Greek, so does not give guidance for &quot;virus&quot;.) Plural neuter nouns of other declensions always end in &quot;-a&quot; (in the nominative, accusative and vocative).

In Neo-Latin, a plural form is necessary in order to express the modern concept of &#x27;viruses&#x27;, leading to the following declension:

Usage of &quot;virii&quot; within Internet communities has met with some resistance, most notably by Tom Christiansen, a figure in the Perl community, who researched the issue and wrote what eventually became referred to in various online discussions as the authoritative essay on the subject, favoring &quot;viruses&quot; instead of &quot;virii&quot;. The impetus of this discussion was the potential irony that the use of &quot;virii&quot; could be construed as a claim of superior knowledge of language when in fact more detailed research finds the native &quot;viruses&quot; is actually more appropriate. In other words, &quot;virii&quot; is a hypercorrection.

The form &quot;viruses&quot; appears in the official Scrabble words list, but neither &quot;viri&quot; nor &quot;virii&quot; does.

In life sciences, &quot;viruses&quot; generally refers to several distinct strains or species of virus. &quot;Virus&quot; is used in the original way as an uncountable mass noun, e.g. &quot;a vial of virus&quot;. Individual, physical particles are called &quot;virions&quot; or &quot;virus particles&quot;.

==&quot;Octopus&quot;==
There are three plural forms of &quot;octopus&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. A fourth form &quot;octopods&quot; is occasionally used by scientists for taxonomic purposes.

Currently, &quot;octopuses&quot; is the most common form in the UK as well as the US; &quot;octopodes&quot; is rare, and &quot;octopi&quot; is often objected to as incorrect.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists &quot;octopi&quot;, &quot;octopuses&quot; and &quot;octopodes&quot; (in that order); it labels &quot;octopodes&quot; &quot;rare&quot;, and notes that &quot;octopi&quot; derives from the mistaken assumption that &#x27; is a second declension Latin noun. (The long &quot;ū&quot; is not used in the 2nd declension.) Rather, it is (Latinized) Ancient Greek, from &#x27; (, gender masculine), whose plural is &quot;&quot; ().

&quot;Chambers 21st Century Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Compact Oxford Dictionary&quot; list only &quot;octopuses&quot;, although the latter notes that &quot;octopodes&quot; is &quot;still occasionally used&quot;; the British National Corpus has 29 instances of &quot;octopuses&quot;, 11 of &quot;octopi&quot; and 4 of &quot;octopodes&quot;. &quot;Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary&quot; lists &quot;octopuses&quot; and &quot;octopi&quot;, in that order; &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary&quot; lists &quot;octopuses&quot;, &quot;octopi&quot; and &quot;octopodes&quot; (in that order).

&quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; states that &quot;the only acceptable plural in English is &quot;octopuses,&quot;&quot; and that &quot;octopi&quot; is misconceived and &quot;octopodes&quot; pedantic.

The term &quot;octopod&quot; (plural &quot;octopods&quot;) is taken from the taxonomic order Octopoda but has no classical equivalent. The collective form &quot;octopus&quot; is usually reserved for animals consumed as food.

== &quot;Platypus&quot; ==
The situation with the word &quot;platypus&quot; is similar to that of &quot;octopus&quot;; the word is etymologically Greek despite its Latinized ending, and so pluralizing it as if it were Latin (i.e. as &quot;platypi&quot;) is sometimes ill-considered. As with &quot;octopus&quot;, importing Greek morphology into English would have &quot;platypodes&quot; as the plural, but in practice this form is hardly attested outside of discussions about pluralization. In scientific contexts, biologists often use &quot;platypus&quot; as both the singular and plural form of the word, in the tradition of &quot;sheep&quot; or &quot;fish&quot;, but laypersons and scientists alike often use the simple English plural &quot;platypuses&quot;. Different dictionaries make different recommendations.

==Botanical Latin==
As a word in Botanical Latin (as distinct from Classical Latin), &quot;cactus&quot; follows standard Latin rules for pluralization and becomes &quot;cacti&quot;, which has become the prevalent usage in English. Regardless, &quot;cactus&quot; is popularly used as both singular and plural, and is cited as both singular and plural. &quot;Cactuses&quot; is also an acceptable plural in English.

==Facetious formations==

Facetious mock-erudite plurals in &quot;-i&quot; or even &quot;-ii&quot; are sometimes found for words ending with a sound (vaguely) similar to &quot;-us&quot;. Examples are &quot;stewardi&quot; (supposed plural of &quot;stewardess&quot;) and &quot;Elvi&quot; (as a plural for &quot;Elvis&quot; imitators). The Toyota corporation has determined that their &quot;Prius&quot; model should have the plural form &quot;Prii&quot;, even though the Latin word &quot;prius&quot; has a plural &quot;priora&quot;, the &quot;Lada Priora&quot; having prior claim to that name—though the common plural is &quot;Priuses&quot;. Conversely, Toyota has also said that the plural of their &quot;Lexus&quot; line is &quot;Lexus&quot;. The Winklevoss twins were famously referred to as &quot;the Winklevi&quot; in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Social Network&quot;.

<doc id="488784" wikidata="Q1127558" url="?curid=488784" title="Dingle Peninsula">
<text>The Dingle Peninsula (; anglicised as Corkaguiny or Corcaguiny, the name of the corresponding barony) is the northernmost of the major peninsulas in County Kerry. It ends beyond the town of Dingle at Dunmore Head, the westernmost point of Ireland. It is separated from the Iveragh Peninsula to the south by the Dingle Bay.

==Name==
The Dingle Peninsula is named after the town of Dingle. The peninsula is also commonly called &quot;Corca Dhuibhne&quot; (Corcu Duibne) even when those referring to it are speaking in English. &quot;Corca Dhuibhne&quot;, which means &quot;seed or tribe of Duibhne&quot; (a Goddess from Irish mythology and an Irish clan name), refers to the &quot;túath&quot; (people, nation) of &quot;Corco Dhuibhne&quot; who occupied the peninsula in the Middle Ages and who also held a number of territories in the south and east of County Kerry.

==Geography==
The peninsula exists because of the band of sandstone rock that forms the Slieve Mish mountain range at the neck of the peninsula, in the east, and the Brandon Group of mountains, and the Mountains of the Central Dingle Peninsula further to the west. Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain outside MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, Mount Brandon at 951 m, forms part of a high ridge with views over the peninsula and North Kerry.

Conor Pass, which runs from Dingle on the south-western end of the peninsula towards Brandon Bay and Castlegregory in the north-east, is the highest mountain pass in Ireland, a narrow, twisting road; it weaves its way around the sharp cliff faces and past the high corrie lakes.

The Blasket Islands lie off the west coast. They are known for the literary and linguistic heritage of the former inhabitants. However, these remote islands have been uninhabited since the 1950s following an evacuation.

==Culture, literature, and language==
The western end of the peninsula is a Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area) that has produced and heavily influenced a number of storytellers, poets, and writers highly important to Modern literature in Irish; Piaras Feiritéar, Máire Mhac an tSaoi, Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha, Cáit Feiritéar, and Peig Sayers among others. This is the westernmost part of Ireland, and the village of &quot;Dún Chaoin&quot; is often jokingly referred to as &quot;the next parish to America.&quot;

Although he greatly admired the post-Irish War of Independence Gaeltacht memoirs from Corca Dhuibhne and the surrounding islands, and particularly the memoirs of Great Blasket Island seanchaithe Tomás Ó Criomhthain, novelist Flann O&#x27;Brien also chose to satirize their cliches quite mercilessly in his modernist novel &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot; (&quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;), which is set in the fictional, desperately poor, and constantly raining Gaeltacht of (); a parody of ().

Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh, award-winning seán-nos singer and performer of Irish traditional music, was born in the Aran Islands, but grew up in Dún Chaoin. Nic Amhlaoibh has both performed and recorded Irish language songs from Corca Dhuibhne, including at least one song composed upon the nearby Great Blasket Island.

==Archaeology==
The peninsula is the location of numerous prehistoric and early medieval remains including:
* Glanfahan, site of ancient dry-stone huts (clocháns)
* Caherdorgan North, with medieval stone buildings
* Ballywiheen, containing an ancient stone fort and monastic settlement
* Kilmalkedar, monastic settlement with Ogham stone
* Ferriter&#x27;s Cove, at the western tip of the peninsula; and
* Gallarus Oratory in the very west of the peninsula near the village of &quot;Baile an Fheirtéaraigh&quot; in &quot;Ard na Caithne&quot;.
Músaem Chorca Dhuibhne, situated in the village of Baile an Fheirtéaraigh (Ballyferriter) has exhibitions detailing the archaeology and history of the peninsula. Some of the exhibitions include Ogham stones, artefacts from the excavations at the nearby monastic site of Riasc (Reask) and objects on loan from the National Museum of Ireland.

In April 2021, Irish archaeologists from the National Monuments Service and Ireland&#x27;s National Museum announced the discovery of an untouched Bronze Age grave, skeletal remains, fragments of human bone and a large semicircular slab in the underground passageway. Archaeologist Mr Ó Coileáin reported: &quot;We think this may have been a ritual site with an element of burial in it and this could be one of those. This looks like it is a chambered tomb from the prehistoric period which might have been a significant marker on the landscape&quot;.

==Places of interest==

The peninsula is known for the MV &quot;Ranga&quot;, a Spanish cargo vessel that wrecked on the coast in 1982.

Gallaunmore is a standing stone and National Monument.

Rahinnane Castle is a 15th-century castle built on a medieval ringfort.

Slieveglass, an area of high ground near the village of Brandon, was the site of Ireland&#x27;s first fatal airliner accident. On 28 July 1943, a BOAC Short S.25 Sunderland III, G-AGES, crashed at 2,000 feet while descending into Foynes in fog, killing 10 of the 25 onboard.

==In film==
David Lean&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; takes place at a village on the Dingle Peninsula in the immediate aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising, and was partly shot on location near Dún Chaoin, Coumeenole Beach, Slea Head and Inch Strand. &quot;Far and Away&quot;, a 1992 film directed by Ron Howard, was partly filmed on the peninsula.

The film &quot;Leap Year&quot; is partly set in the Dingle Peninsula, but none of the filming took place in the area.

Several local areas were used for filming of &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; including Dunmore Head and Slea Head where a replica of the clochán huts of Skellig Michael were built.

== In music ==

Dingle is mentioned in Phil Colclough and June Colclough&#x27;s &quot;Song for Ireland.&quot;

<text>Baron Ashburton, of Ashburton in the County of Devon, is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Since 1835, the title has been held by members of the Baring family.

==History==
The first creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain 1782 in favour of the barrister and Whig politician Sir John Dunning. This creation became extinct in 1823 on the death of his son Richard, the second Baron.

The title was revived in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1835 for the financier and Tory politician Alexander Baring. He was the first cousin of the last holder of the 1782 creation. A member of the distinguished Baring family, Lord Ashburton was the second son of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, the uncle of Francis Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook, Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, and Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, and the great-uncle of Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, and Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale.

Lord Ashburton was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He held office in the second Tory administration of Sir Robert Peel. His younger brother, the third Baron, represented Thetford in the House of Commons. The town of Ashburton, New Zealand, is named after him. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron, who also sat as Member of Parliament for Thetford. His son, Francis Baring, succeeded as the fifth Baron in 1889. The fifth Baron was married twice; his second wife, Frances Donnelley, having been one of Broadway&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Florodora&quot; sextet in New York. His only son, Alexander Baring, the sixth Baron, was a member of the Hampshire County Council and Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire.

, the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the eighth Baron. His father, the seventh Baron, was a prominent businessman. As a descendant of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, the eighth Baron is also in remainder to that title, which is now held by his kinsman, the Lord Northbrook.

Both the 6th and the 7th Barons were appointed Knights of the Garter.

The Hon. Guy Baring, younger son of the fourth Baron, was a soldier and Conservative politician. His son Giles Baring was a successful cricketer.

The family seat is The Grange, near Northington, Hampshire.

<text>CIDC-FM (103.5 FM, &quot;Z103.5&quot;) is a radio station licensed to Orangeville, Ontario, Canada. Owned by Evanov Communications, the station broadcasts a rhythmic contemporary format targeting the Greater Toronto Area. Its studios are located on Dundas Street West in the Eatonville neighbourhood in the Etobicoke district of Toronto.

CIDC has historically been known for having a dance and electronic music-leaning format, and has sponsored electronic music events and co-branded dance music compilations. CIDC held a 2.0 share of the market in Numeris&#x27;s Spring 2018 ratings.

Due to its signal location near Orangeville, the station covers Barrie and Kitchener in addition to rimshotting Downtown Toronto. The station has often marketed itself as a Toronto station, while Evanov made repeated attempts to move or otherwise modify CIDC&#x27;s signal to better serve the GTA, almost all of which were denied by the CRTC for neglecting its formal city of licence. The CRTC also reprimanded CIDC for not specifically devoting enough on-air community interest programming, news, sports and information specific to Orangeville or Dufferin County, as specified in its original approval.

The Orangeville area was struck by a massive F4 tornado as part of the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak on May 31, 1985, and the community felt it did not receive adequate warning from stations in Toronto. As such, an application was made to the CRTC for a radio station to serve Orangeville. CRTC approval was given for the station on September 10, 1986, under a guideline not to solicit advertising from Toronto, Barrie or Brampton. The station&#x27;s frequency allocation was originally specified for Guelph, and was moved to Orangeville to allow for the service.

CIDC was launched on May 1, 1987, on 103.5 FM with an ERP of 50,000 watts from a site located northwest of Orangeville. Its transmitter&#x27;s terrain, which measured height above average terrain, and tower height of meant it was higher than the top of CN Tower. CIDC&#x27;s launch format as &quot;DC 103.5&quot; was 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s hits.

On September 28, 1994, the CRTC approved the ownership transfer of Dufferin Communications from its shareholders to CKMW Radio Ltd., operator of Brampton multicultural station CIAO. The station was branded &quot;Hot 103.5&quot; in February 1995 (later calling it &quot;Hot 103 dot 5&quot;), playing only dance music. The station then began adding more R&amp;B and pop tracks to its Top 40/dance playlist in February 1998, and was renamed &quot;Hits 103.5&quot;.

On July 28, 2000, approval was given to relocate the transmitter site from 6 km west of Orangeville town hall to 11 km east of Orangeville town hall and decrease the station&#x27;s power from 50,000 watts to 30,700 watts.

In late December 2000, the station was re-branded as &quot;Z103.5&quot; (with the decimal point heard as &quot;dot&quot;), with the slogan &quot;The Hit Music Channel&quot;, though the CIDC call letters were retained. The slogan was later changed to simply &quot;Today&#x27;s Hit Music&quot;.

Until the summer of 2006, CIDC was the only radio station in Canada that played dance music since CING-FM changed formats in 2001. It was the only Top 40 station left in Toronto after CISS-FM became &quot;Jack FM&quot; in 2003. For a brief period in 2001, CKDX-FM also played dance music but poor ratings led it to switch to an oldies format.

In the summer of 2006, Evanov launched a new station in Halifax, Nova Scotia, also on 103.5, patterned after CIDC, though with a different logo and slogan. In 2011, Evanov began to brand all it stations only by whole numbers. In January 2012, the Halifax station relaunched their Top 40/Dance format and began patterning their direction after its sister station in Winnipeg, CHWE, who uses the moniker &quot;Energy 106&quot;. However, while the Winnipeg station continues to do well, the Halifax outlet would see their fortunes take a downturn in ratings and format changes that resulted in their flip to Country in September 2015.

Rival CKFM-FM switched from adult top 40 to CHR due to high airplay on top-played singles, while CIDC-FM tweaked its format by adding some adult top 40 singles, such as Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;What Do You Got?&quot;. Rival CKIS-FM dropped their rhythmic lean and went more mainstream in February 2011. At that same time, CIDC did the reverse: from mainstream to a rhythmic-lean, although it still plays a small percentage of dance music, which was slightly increased by 2015. Most non-top 40 dance hits remain at the station, although they are classics. It continues to report on Mediabase &amp; Nielsen BDS as a contemporary hit radio. As of the summer of 2012, the station&#x27;s slogan is &quot;#1 For Hit Music&quot;, following the other top 40 stations in Toronto, CKIS-FM and CKFM-FM, which both claimed to be &quot;Toronto&#x27;s #1 Hit Music Station&quot;. As of 2016, CIDC reverted to the slogan &quot;All The Hits.&quot;
Despite the decrease in dance music, the station&#x27;s highest-rated program continues to be &quot;The Drive @ 5 Street Mix&quot; with DJ Danny D. The show is mixed live with vinyl records and Compact Discs. In 2000, the show started out as a 30-minute Friday afternoon mix, but soon expanded into a 1-hour set. By 2004–2005, the set was so popular that CIDC introduced the &quot;Drive @ 5&quot; five times a week. Recently, as of 2008, high-profile guest DJ&#x27;s have started to mix live for the Drive @ 5 on several occasions including David Guetta, Tiesto, and Armin van Buuren (his show A State of Trance can be heard Sunday nights on this station). The station also had a Saturday Night edition of the &quot;Drive @ 5 Street Mix&quot; for a time. A similar show, &quot;The Power Mix&quot; with DJ Spence Diamonds, used to air three nights a week (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights). The show, which featured urban music, was cut in the fall of 2007. In 2011, the station introduced a mix show during the lunch hour, dedicated to hits from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, called the &quot;Wayback Lunch.&quot;

The station aired some programming hosted by Canadian DJ Chris Sheppard in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, including &quot;Pirate Radio&quot; and &quot;Groove Station&quot;.

CIDC also had a weekly show on Sundays called the &quot;Freestyle Frenzy&quot;, hosted by veteran Tony Monaco. It was solely a show of freestyle music and mixes. It aired from June 4, 1995, to January 2004, and was replaced with Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot; countdown. As of the summer of 2008, that show was removed from the schedule. CKFM-FM later picked up the show after its relaunch as Virgin Radio.

MC Mario also previously held regular Sunday programming called &quot;The Mixdown&quot; which ran for a full hour in the afternoon until 2004

Dance music makes up approximately 20-30% of the CIDC playlist and programming.

Currently, the station competes with fellow top 40 stations CKFM-FM and CKIS-FM, and to a lesser extent, hot AC station CHUM-FM.

On September 21, 2020, CIDC-FM launched a digital signal in the HD Radio format.

== Attempts to relocate ==
On January 12, 2015, Evanov filed an application for permission to relocate CIDC&#x27;s transmitter to Georgetown, using the tower of its sister station CIAO-AM, and increase its average power from 37.5 kW to 51 kW. Evanov stated that the move would help to improve reception in Downtown Toronto (especially inside buildings) to add one million potential new listeners, and deploy HD Radio services simulcasting CIAO and CIRR-FM. The application was denied by the CRTC, citing that the proposed changes would reduce coverage in Orangeville and increase its strength in an out-of-market area, thus neglecting its city of licence. The CRTC ruled that Evanov did not &quot;[demonstrate] a financial need justifying the proposed technical changes&quot;. On September 15, 2017, Evanov submitted an application to increase the effective radiated power of CIDC-FM, with no change in frequency.

During CIDC&#x27;s licence renewal process, the CRTC also noted that the station had been neglecting its city of licence in its news and information content, relating specifically to the GTA as a whole rather than Orangeville; the station&#x27;s website and social presences contain no mention at all of Orangeville, or of any news and weather. As a condition of its licence renewal, the CRTC ordered the station to regularly broadcast content of direct and particular relevance to Orangeville (including news headlines and other local information), traffic and weather reports for markets within its signal contours, refrain from exclusively devoting this coverage to Toronto, and to identify as an Orangeville station.

In 2018, Evanov filed an application to swap CIDC and CIRR&#x27;s frequencies and change their ERP, with CIDC moving to 103.9 under reduced power to specifically serve the Orangeville market, and CIRR moving to a full-power signal on 103.5, which would inherit CIDC&#x27;s existing programming. Evanov proposed moving the previous LGBT community programming on CIRR to an HD Radio subchannel, committing to produce five original hours of programming per-day. Evanov also filed another application to change CIDC-FM&#x27;s frequency from 103.5 to 103.7. The application was denied by the CRTC on January 31, 2020, who ruled that it would undermine the commission&#x27;s competitive licensing process, and cited technical restrictions related to use of the frequencies in both markets.

== Compilations ==
Z103.5 has released various music compilation CDs, mixed by DJ Danny D and later The Hammer. The 3 series included Hitmix, Streetmix, and Summer Rush, named after the concert of the same name. They released from 2002 until 2018.

== Concerts and live-to-air programs ==
The station annually hosts a number of live concert events. Past and present concerts include the Hot Rush (created in 1993 as Energy Rush, now Summer Rush), Euro-Freestyle Invasion (now Euro Invasion), and Partymania. Most of the concerts are sold-out because they are mostly filled with performances by dance artists that usually don&#x27;t get much publicity. Its sister station in Halifax also started holding a similar Summer Rush concert in 2007, usually around the same time as its Toronto sibling.

The Summer Rush has been held at various venues over the years, including the Molson Amphitheatre at Ontario Place, Polson Pier (previously known as The Docks), and, more recently, the Kingswood Theatre at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. Typically, venues have changed every three to five years. There have been over a hundred artists featured from Europe, South America, USA, and Canada, including Real McCoy (twice – 1997 and 2009), Culture Beat (twice – 1993 and 2004) Cascada (three times – 2004, 2006, 2008), DHT, B4-4 (a crowd favourite), Joee, Sarina Paris, Len, The Boomtang Boys, Snap!, Waldo&#x27;s People, Do (singing DJ Sammy&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&quot;), Haiducci, DC Project, Jam &amp; Spoon, Elissa, Stevie B, Ian Van Dahl, Sash!, Rupee, Kevin Lyttle, Jesse McCartney, JoJo, Elise Estrada, Basshunter and Daddy Yankee.

The station also hosts live-to-airs from various Toronto-area nightclubs three to five nights per week. Wednesdays have been wayback playbacks from Club Menage since 2002 (hence the term Wayback Wednesdays), but they have recently moved to Gravity Soundbar, Bloke, and now Ristorante Buonanotte. Thursdays are live from Sugar Daddy&#x27;s in Mississauga, playing the best R&amp;B, Hip-Hop, Reggae, and Dancehall. Fridays they broadcast out of Gravity Soundbar. Saturday nights are live from My Apartment in Mississauga.

On November 11, 2015, Tony Monaco announced that after nearly 14 years, Wayback Wednesdays would end on November 25, 2015.

On March 23, 2016, Wayback Wednesdays returned to Z103.5, back by popular demand, broadcasting live from Ristorante Buonanotte. Low turnouts at the venue caused the show&#x27;s cancellation a few months later.

He played Jesus in &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), Tim Ballard in &quot;Sound of Freedom&quot; (2023), and starred as John Reese on the CBS series &quot;Person of Interest&quot; (2011–2016).

==Early life==
Caviezel was born in Mount Vernon, Washington, the son of Margaret (née Lavery), a homemaker and former stage actress, and James Caviezel, a chiropractor. He has a younger brother, Timothy, and three sisters, Ann, Amy, and Erin. He was raised in a tight-knit Catholic family in Conway, Washington. His surname is Romansh. His father is of Swiss and Slovak descent, while his mother is Irish.

==Career==
Caviezel began acting in plays in Seattle, Washington. He earned his Screen Actors Guild card with a minor role in the 1991 film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. He then moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. When he decided to move, &quot;people thought I was out of my mind,&quot; he said. He was offered a scholarship to study acting at New York&#x27;s Juilliard School in 1993, but he turned it down to portray Warren Earp in the 1994 film &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. He later appeared in episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. After appearing in &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; (1997), he had a breakthrough performance in the 1998 Terrence Malick-directed World War II film &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. He played Black John, a Missouri bushwhacker, in &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot; (1999), an American Civil War film.

Caviezel was originally cast to play Scott Summers / Cyclops in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000), but dropped out because of a scheduling conflict with the film &quot;Frequency&quot; (2000). He starred in the mainstream films &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; (2001), &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (2002), and &quot;Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius&quot; (2004). In 2000, he played the lead role in &quot;Madison&quot;, a film about hydroplane racing in Madison, Indiana. The film was completed in 2001, but did not appear in theaters until a limited release in 2005. In 2002, he played a pivotal role in the film &quot;I Am David&quot;.
Caviezel portrayed Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. During filming, he was struck by lightning, scourged by accident, dislocated his shoulder, and suffered from pneumonia and hypothermia. Prior to filming, Gibson reportedly warned Caviezel that playing Jesus in his film could hurt his career. In 2011, he stated that good roles had been hard to come by since, but this movie, in particular, the role of Jesus Christ was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; went on to take in a box office of $612.1 million.

Caviezel had leading roles in the 2006 films &quot;Unknown&quot; and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. He played Kainan in &quot;Outlander&quot; (2008) and provided the voice of Jesus on the 2007 New Testament audio dramatization &quot;The Word of Promise&quot;. In 2008, he starred in &quot;Long Weekend&quot;.

In 2009, Caviezel played French-Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam in &quot;The Stoning of Soraya M.&quot;, a drama set in 1986 Iran about the execution of a young mother. When asked about how his Catholic faith was affected by this story, he said, &quot;You don&#x27;t have to go any further than the gospels to figure out what the right thing to do is, whether you should be more concerned helping someone regardless of their religion or where they&#x27;re from&quot;. That same year, he reprised the role of Jesus in the latest installment of &quot;The Word of Promise&quot;. Caviezel starred in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, a remake of the British science fiction series with the same name, in November 2009.

From 2011 to 2016, Caviezel starred in the CBS drama series &quot;Person of Interest&quot; as John Reese, a former CIA agent who now works for a mysterious billionaire as a vigilante. The show received the highest ratings in 15 years for a series pilot and consistently garnered over 10 million weekly viewers. Caviezel was nominated for the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic TV Actor in 2014 and again in 2016 for his work on &quot;Person of Interest&quot;.

Caviezel starred in the 2014 football film &quot;When the Game Stands Tall&quot; as De La Salle High School coach Bob Ladouceur, whose Concord, California, Spartans prep team had a 151-game winning streak from 1992 to 2003, an American sporting record. He appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Escape Plan&quot;, playing a warden who maintains order in the world&#x27;s most secret and secure prison.

Caviezel narrated two documentaries in 2016 regarding Christianity. One was &quot;Liberating a Continent: John Paul II and the Fall of Communism&quot; and the other was &quot;The Face of Mercy&quot;. In an interview about the former film, he stated that John Paul II had crushed communism &quot;with love&quot;.

In 2017, Caviezel signed on as lead character of CBS&#x27;s &quot;SEAL Team&quot; series. However, Caviezel left the project due to creative differences before production began and was replaced by David Boreanaz.

Caviezel portrayed the Apostle Luke in the film &quot;Paul, Apostle of Christ&quot;, which opened in theaters on March 23, 2018, to mixed reviews.

In January 2018, Caviezel&#x27;s agent announced that Caviezel had signed on with Gibson to reprise his role as Jesus in &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; sequel, entitled &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection&quot;. In September 2020, Caviezel said, &quot;Mel Gibson just sent me the third picture, the third draft. It&#x27;s coming.&quot; He added, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be the biggest film in world history.&quot;

In 2018, Caviezel signed on to portray Tim Ballard, a DHS Agent and an anti-human-trafficking activist, in the film &quot;Sound of Freedom&quot;, about the organization Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) and its mission to save children from sex trafficking and slavery. Ballard had specifically requested that Caviezel play him. Caviezel stated, &quot;This is the second most important film I have ever done since &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. ... It&#x27;s going to affect the saving of a lot of children and the changing of lives. It will also bring a lot of light into the darkness.&quot; The film was theatrically released on July 3, 2023.

Caviezel starred in the 2020 political thriller film &quot;Infidel&quot;, produced by Dinesh D&#x27;Souza.

==Personal life==
In 1996, Caviezel married Kerri Browitt, a high school English teacher. They have adopted three children from China.

Out of respect for his wife, Caviezel requested that he wear a shirt and that Jennifer Lopez wear a top during a love scene in the film &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, and he refused to strip in a love scene with Ashley Judd in &quot;High Crimes&quot;. He said, &quot;I do love scenes—but not ones with gratuitous sex. I also don&#x27;t do gratuitous violence. And it&#x27;s not just about my wife, although that&#x27;s important. It&#x27;s sin, pure and simple. I mean, it&#x27;s wrong.&quot;

=== Religious beliefs ===
Caviezel is a devout Catholic. In a 2017 interview, Caviezel talked about the importance of his Catholic faith, the lasting impact that &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; has had on his life, and his special devotion to the Virgin Mary. During the filming of &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; in Italy, he received daily counsel, confession, and Holy Communion from a local Catholic priest, with an interpreter.

=== Political views ===
Caviezel is publicly against abortion. In 2006, Caviezel was featured with actress Patricia Heaton and Missouri athletes Kurt Warner and Mike Sweeney in an advertisement opposing Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2, which allowed any form of embryonic stem cell research and therapy in Missouri that is otherwise legal under federal law. He began the advertisement by saying, &quot;Le-bar nash be-neshak&quot; (Aramaic for &quot;You betray the Son of Man with a kiss&quot;), a reference to Judas&#x27;s betrayal of Jesus Christ and a phrase used in the Gospel According to Luke. (In the advertisement, the line did not include a translation into English.) Caviezel closed the commercial with the line, &quot;You know now. Don&#x27;t do it. Vote no on 2.&quot; The advertisement was a response to a commercial featuring Michael J. Fox, who favored embryonic stem cell research.

==== Support of QAnon ====
Beginning in 2021, Caviezel endorsed elements of the QAnon conspiracy theory, first doing so during a remote appearance at the &quot;Health and Freedom Conference&quot; at Rhema Bible Training College in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. The appearance was to promote the film &quot;Sound of Freedom&quot;, centering on anti-human trafficking activist Tim Ballard. Ballard&#x27;s activism has been alleged to correspond to the rise of QAnon, though he denies any connection to the movement. Caviezel mentioned that Ballard was supposed to be appearing at the conference but was &quot;saving victims of trafficking&quot; who were victims of &quot;adrenochroming&quot;, a fictional practice whose existence is suggested by QAnon adherents. Caviezel suggested he had seen evidence of children being subjected to the practice. The event included appearances by other QAnon promoters, such as L. Lin Wood and Michael Flynn. In October of the same year, Caviezel spoke in Las Vegas at the &quot;For God &amp; Country: Patriot Double Down&quot; conference, where he mentioned the need to fight child sex trafficking, Satan and liberal values. He claimed that &quot;the storm is upon us&quot;, a slogan associated with QAnon echoing the belief in a final battle against evil and repeated the battle cry of William Wallace in &quot;Braveheart&quot;, also urging the audience to &quot;[send] Lucifer and his henchmen straight back to hell where they belong&quot;.

After &quot;Sound of Freedom&quot; was released in 2023, Caviezel continued to promote QAnon during interviews and media appearances related to the film. During a July 2023 appearance on &quot;The Charlie Kirk Show&quot;, Kirk asked Caviezel to address claims of his belief in QAnon. He claimed he was unaware of QAnon when the movie was filmed in 2018, and subsequently defended followers of QAnon, claiming that they were being persecuted and comparing them to the Christians in the New Testament. Caviezel also made more remarks about adrenochrome and claimed that &quot;QAnon&quot; does not exist, only &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;anons&quot; - a common talking point used by QAnon followers to deflect from their support for the movement.

<text>Morihiro Saito (斉藤 守弘 &quot;Saitō Morihiro&quot;, March 31, 1928–May 13, 2002) was a teacher of the Japanese martial art of aikido, with many students around the world. Saito&#x27;s practice of aikido spanned 56 years, from the age of 18, when he first met aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba, until his death in 2002.

==Early life==
Morihiro Saito was born in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, on 31 March 1928. Growing up in a poor farming village in the 1930s and early 40s, he recounted having the same interest in historical heroes such as Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi and Goto Matabe as most other Japanese boys. In the Japanese schools at that time, the martial arts of kendo and judo were taught to students, and Saito chose to study kendo.

In the years immediately following the end of World War II, the carrying of weapons of any kind, as well the practice of martial arts, was prohibited by the GHQ. As a result, Saito felt he should study some kind of unarmed self-defense technique, and began training in Shinto-ryū karate at the Shudokan in Meguro. After a short time, his work with the Japanese National Railways transferred him to Iwama, and he was forced to find other martial arts training. Thinking judo would be a useful complement to his kendo and karate skills, he began training at a judo dojo in Ishioka. In the summer of 1946, however, Saito heard stories about an &quot;old man doing strange techniques up on the mountain near Iwama.&quot; It seemed that people were confused about what martial art, exactly, this old man was practicing, but one judo instructor said the man was teaching &quot;Ueshiba-ryū Judo.&quot;

===Meeting aikido&#x27;s founder===
By July 1946, the GHQ-imposed ban upon the practice of martial arts had forced Morihei Ueshiba into an official &quot;retirement&quot; from practice for several years. Ueshiba took this opportunity to seclude himself in the small town of Iwama, and was engaged in the practice of ascetic training (&quot;shugyō&quot;), and some believe that it was during this period that Ueshiba was perfecting the practice of aikido.

It was at this time, at the age of 18, that Saito joined Ueshiba for training, which already included then live-in students Kisshomaru Ueshiba, Koichi Tohei, and Tadashi Abe. This early training was quite brutal, but after persevering for several years, Saito became one of Ueshiba&#x27;s closest students. Much credit is given to the fortuitous work schedule Saito had with the Japanese National Railways, where Saito worked 24 hours on, 24 hours off. As a result, Saito had the unique opportunity to train with Ueshiba in the practice of the sword and short staff, which occurred early each morning before the other students arrived.

===Training===

Training at the Iwama dojo consisted of a great deal of farmwork. The life of the full-time live in students consisted of prayer each morning before sunrise, two meals of rice porridge each day, and training interspersed with copious amounts of work on the farm. As a result of Saito&#x27;s 24 hours on, 24 hours off, position with the National Railway meant that he would train and live as a live-in student only every other 24 hours. Eventually, the other live-in students moved away, and when Saito returned from work, he would train alone with Ueshiba.

Although other students such as Koichi Tohei trained with Ueshiba for more years than Saito did, Saito&#x27;s work allowed him to train almost as an uchideshi, for long periods as the only student.

From 1946 until Ueshiba’s passing in 1969, Saito served as Ueshiba&#x27;s assistant in a variety of ways at Iwama while his wife served Mrs. Ueshiba. During Saito’s period as a deshi he taught classes in the Iwama dojo.

===Ueshiba&#x27;s death===

Before his death Ueshiba gave Morihiro Saito the responsibility of carrying on the teaching at the Iwama dojo and also the position of caretaker of the Aiki Jinja located in Iwama.

==Training methodology and philosophy==

Saito&#x27;s instruction of aikido is particularly remembered for its emphasis upon the basics of aikido, and especially upon the relationship between the armed and unarmed aspects of the art.

Kazuo Chiba, a live-in student (&quot;uchideshi&quot;) of Ueshiba at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo in Tokyo, recalled in particular the intensity of the training that occurred at the Iwama dojo,

Chiba also emphasized Saito&#x27;s focus upon , or vigorous practice without holding back, which Ueshiba taught and Saito demonstrated in his methods of teaching and practice. Apparently, this rigorous training with Saito, which Ueshiba would often observe, also included intense conditioning exercises, as well as general farmwork that students at the Iwama dojo were expected to assist with.

Other students of Saito attest to his commitment to carry on Ueshiba&#x27;s legacy, and to follow and preserve Ueshiba&#x27;s teachings as Saito had learned them. Saito believed that striking techniques (&quot;atemi&quot;) are a &quot;vital element&quot; of aikido, and also that the principles of swordsmanship formed the basis of aikido techniques. He also advocated training to cope with the attacks of other martial arts, such as the kicks practiced in karate.

According to Saito&#x27;s son, Hitohiro Saito (now Hitohira), Saito believed that the basis of all empty-handed, sword, and staff techniques was the mastery of aikido&#x27;s basic posture (&quot;hanmi&quot;). Saito believed that once the correct posture was mastered, the next step was to develop a proper &quot;kiai&quot; (sometimes translated as &quot;spirit shout&quot;).

== Legacy ==
In the beginning of the 1970s, aikido students from outside Japan began traveling to Iwama to train under Saito. Later they would return to their native countries to teach what they had learned. There were also a small number of Japanese students of Saito who travelled abroad to teach Aikido, such as Takayasu-shihan.

The kind of aikido that Saito&#x27;s students do is often referred to as &quot;Iwama aikido&quot; or Iwama style. In Europe, Saito, along with many of his students, formed a dan-ranking network of dojos called Iwama Ryu, with ranks received directly from Saito rather than or in addition to those from the Aikikai although Saito never left that organization. Saito also awarded teaching certifications for Aiki-weapons (bokken and jo) internationally. Receipt of the full set of five weapons certifications is considered the menkyo-kaiden.

Saito Sensei also inspired many around the world to establish dojo that focus on Iwama Style Aikido. Some dojo, like Aikido in Fredericksburg, have full-time uchideshi programs based on what Saito Sensei developed at the Iwama Dojo. Uchideshi can do short-term intensive studies (short stay) or long-term apprenticeships for a year or more to fully immerse in the training.

=== Saito family line ===
After Saito&#x27;s death, his son Hitohiro formed the independent . Some of the Iwama Ryu network dojos joined Hitohiro while others including some of Saito&#x27;s longest students chose to remain affiliated with the Aikikai.

Hitohiro had already been the main instructor at Iwama dojo. Like the Aikikai Doshu, he does not claim a dan rank.

=== Senior (5th, 6th and 7th dan) Direct Students ===

This short list was chosen based on several criteria including: the rank of the instructor, how long they studied directly with Saito (total time in Iwama), how long they were a student of Saito (total time since becoming his student) and how senior they are in their given region. 
This list shows the ranks Morihiro Saito personally awarded in his life (under both the Iwama Ryu and Aikikai systems).

Note: Morihiro Saito never awarded any 8th dan rankings. The highest ranks he delivered were the two Iwama Ryu 7th dan Shihan ranks that he awarded to Paolo Corallini (Italy) and Ulf Evenås (Sweden).

For some instructors the current rank is also shown, since some of them continued teaching through other organizations (i.e. Aikikai Tokyo or Iwama Shin Shin Aiki Shuren Kai, founded by Hitohiro Saito, Morihiro&#x27;s son).

For example, the only 6th dan in a given country might be listed while one of many 6th/7th dans in another country is not even if the latter instructor is senior to the former.

<text>The Armilla patrol was the name of the Royal Navy&#x27;s permanent presence in the Persian Gulf during the 1980s and 1990s.

==Background==
The Royal Navy withdrew its forces from the Persian Gulf in 1971 (the former Flag Officer, Middle East, and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf) in line with the United Kingdom&#x27;s general retreat from &quot;East of Suez&quot;. However, tensions in the area remained high and Royal Navy ships were still a frequent sight in the area. In 1980, tensions in the Middle East led to the outbreak of war between Iraq and Iran. In response to the increased danger to British shipping and other British interests, in the Persian Gulf, Armilla Patrol was set up. and ; and later , were the first ships to patrol the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz. There has been at least one Royal Navy ship on patrol in the area ever since. In addition to the surface combatant, the Royal Navy has also maintained an auxiliary of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) in the Persian Gulf.

During the Falklands War, the Royal New Zealand Navy dispatched frigates to carry out the Armilla patrol duties, freeing the British ships on station for service with the Royal Navy task force tasked with freeing the Falkland Islands from the Argentine invasion.

The Armilla patrol was praised by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a call was made in parliament for an Armilla Patrol Medal to go to those serving in the Patrol at the time in 1989. Ships Companies were subsequently awarded the General Service Medal (Gulf) for patrol and escort duties between 17 November 1986 and 31 October 31 October 1988. Mine countermeasures ships were awarded the GSM for service between 1 November 1988 until 28 February 1989.

Typical Armilla patrol deployments lasted for six months or so, with the supporting RFA vessel sometimes spending an aggregate total of over a year in the area. The patrol was reinforced with an aircraft carrier or task group in times of high tension or British involvement in wartime operations or by frigates or destroyers transiting the area for other operations in the Far East or Pacific.

The largest British presence in the Persian Gulf during the Armilla patrol was during the two operations against Iraq. In 1991, eight Royal Navy ships supported by a number of RFA vessels were sent to the area.

==Post 1990s==
In 2003, over 30 British warships and auxiliaries were involved in the invasion of Iraq. A number of vessels, including minesweepers, survey vessels and submarines, are periodically rotated through the area to provide additional capability.

Beginning in 2006 the surface combatant deployed was tasked with patrol in the Persian Gulf and as part of Operation Oracle, the United Kingdom&#x27;s assistance to the United States in its operations in the Arabian Sea, along with flexibility in tasking for operations in the Far East and Pacific.

<text>Harold Loeffelmacher (March 14, 1905 – January 30, 1988) was an American musician and bandleader best known for forming the polka band known as the Six Fat Dutchmen. The band, based in New Ulm, Minnesota, traveled extensively and played as many as 335 dates per year, mostly in the Midwestern United States. Over a span of 14 years the Six Fat Dutchmen recorded 800 polkas, waltzes and schottisches on the RCA Victor label, and for ten years they were signed by Dot Records. Loeffelmacher was inducted into the International Polka Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1975.

==Biography==
Loeffelmacher was born in 1905 on a Minnesota farm near Fort Ridgely. After his family moved to New Ulm, he took violin lessons, then moved to wind instruments, including the tuba. Later he took up the trombone, which became his primary band instrument.

In 1932, he started &quot;Six Fat Dutchmen,&quot; which grew from the initial six to over a dozen musicians. They played the Nebraska State Fair for 26 straight years.

During Loeffelmacher&#x27;s long career of touring from show to show, it is claimed that he eventually wore out seven buses while accumulating as much as 90,000 miles of road travel annually. In winter while the other band members would break from their hectic schedules and take well-deserved vacations, Loeffelmacher would often continue to perform solo on the bass horn, but his true instrument was the trombone. He performed a dozen times on the long-running nationally televised TV series, &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

Loeffelmacher died in 1988 at Sioux Valley Hospital in New Ulm, Minnesota.

In 1990, three years after his death, Harold Loeffelmacher and his Six Fat Dutchmen were inducted into the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame. His son Harold and daughter-in-law Virginia accepted the award on his behalf. His family currently resides near St. Paul/Minneapolis, Minnesota.

In 2006, 74 years after the band&#x27;s founding, a compilation CD of the Six Fat Dutchmen&#x27;s original recordings was produced.

<text>The Porsche Carrera GT (Project Code 980) is a mid-engine sports car that was manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche from 2004 to 2006. &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the Carrera GT number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 2000s, and number eight on its Top Sports Cars of All Time list. For its advanced technology and development of its chassis, &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine awarded it the &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; award in 2003.

== History ==

The development of the Carrera GT can be traced back to the 911 GT1 and LMP1-98 racing cars. In part due to the FIA and ACO rule changes in 1998, both designs had ended. Porsche at the time had planned a new Le Mans prototype for the 1999 season. The car was initially intended to use a turbocharged flat-six engine, but was later redesigned to use a new V10 engine – based on a unit secretly built by Porsche for the Footwork Formula One team in 1992 – pushing the project back to planned completion in 2000. The LMP 2000 was cancelled in November 1999, with rumours that the car had been cancelled as part of a deal with the Volkswagen Group to collaborate on the Porsche Cayenne, while also allowing Audi to compete at Le Mans without competition from Porsche.

Porsche did keep part of the project alive by using the 5.5 L V10 from the prototype in a concept car called the Carrera GT shown at the 2000 Paris Motor Show, mainly in an attempt to draw attention to their display. Surprising interest in the vehicle and an influx of revenue provided from the Cayenne helped Porsche decide to produce the car, and development started on a road-legal version that would be produced in small numbers at Porsche&#x27;s new manufacturing facility in Leipzig. Porsche started a production run of the Carrera GT in 2004. The first Carrera GT went on sale in the United States on 31 January 2004.

Originally a production run of 1,500 cars was planned. However, Porsche announced in August 2005 that it would not continue production of the Carrera GT through to 2006, citing changing airbag regulations in the United States. By the end of production on 6 May 2006, more than 1,270 cars had been sold, with a total of 644 units sold in the United States and 31 units sold in Canada. In the United Kingdom, 49 units were sold.

== Design ==
The Carrera GT is powered by a V10 engine rated at , whereas the original concept car featured a 5.5-litre version rated at . A road test in June 2004 by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; showed that the car can accelerate from 0– in 3.5 seconds, 0– in 6.8 seconds and 0– in 10.8 seconds. The official top speed was .

The Carrera GT was initially offered with five basic colours: Guards Red, Fayence Yellow, Basalt Black, GT Silver metallic and Seal Grey. Custom colours were later available from the factory. A traditional six-speed manual transmission is the only available transmission.

The Carrera GT has large side inlets and air dams that help cool the large V10 engine framed by the carbon fibre rear bonnet. Fitted with Porsche&#x27;s latest Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite braking system, the SGL Carbon disc brakes are fitted inside the 19 inch front and 20 inch rear 5-spoke alloy wheels. Similar to other Porsche models, such as the 911, the GT includes an electronically operated rear wing which deploys at speeds above .

The interior is trimmed in soft leather. Bose audio system and a navigation system were standard. In typical Porsche fashion, the ignition is present to the left of the steering wheel. This placement dates back to the early days of Le Mans racing when drivers were required to make a running start, hop into their cars, start them and begin the race. The placement of the ignition enabled the driver to start the car with the left hand and put it in gear with the right.

== Technology ==

Notable technology includes a pure carbon fibre monocoque and subframe produced by ATR Composites Group of Italy, dry sump lubrication and inboard suspension. At speeds above , the electronically operated rear wing raises into the airstream to reduce lift. The radiator of the Carrera GT is about five times the size of that of a 911 Turbo of its time. The car&#x27;s front and rear suspension system consists of pushrod actuated shock absorbers and dampers with anti-roll bars.

== Zagato ==

In 2013, Zagato introduced the Porsche Carrera GTZ based on the Porsche Carrera GT. Commissioned by a Swiss Porsche collector and former racing driver, it has a modified carbon fiber body which is more aerodynamic. The car has the same technical specification as the Porsche Carrera GT. Six Carrera GTZs were built.

<text>The Six Fat Dutchmen was an American polka band, formed around 1932 by Harold Loeffelmacher in New Ulm, Minnesota, United States. The band was known mostly for playing the German-American (sometimes called &quot;oom-pah&quot;) style of polka music that originated from Germany and the German-speaking areas of Czechoslovakia. They were regular performers at the then-famous George&#x27;s Ballroom in New Ulm, and were voted Number One Polka Band for seven years in a row by the National Ballroom Operators Association. Compilations of their music continue to be produced and sold, more than 70 years after the band&#x27;s founding.

Like Bill Monroe&#x27;s Bluegrass Boys, the band provided the name to its musical genre, &quot;Dutchman Music&quot;. As might be surmised from the band&#x27;s name, there were initially six members, but over time it grew to include about a dozen musicians. The band appeared often on a local television station in Mankato, Minnesota, and their popularity grew to the point where they played the Nebraska State Fair for 26 straight years. The Six Fat Dutchmen played the Aragon and Trianon ballrooms in Chicago, broadcasting live on radio station WGN. 

They enjoyed a 14-year recording career with RCA Victor, during which they recorded 800 songs. After parting ways with RCA, the band recorded for Dot Records for ten years.

The 1995 compilation CD &quot;The Six Fat Dutchmen&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; earned a 3.5 star rating (out of 5) in AllMusic. Another compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 2&quot; was released in 2006.

Some of their vintage television appearances have been uploaded to YouTube. Singer and saxophone player Dick Dale was briefly a member of the Six Fat Dutchmen, before he became a regular on the long-running American television variety series, &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

In 1990, three years after the death of Harold Loeffelmacher, he and his Six Fat Dutchmen were inducted into the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame.

<doc id="488809" wikidata="Q5332932" url="?curid=488809" title="Eckmann–Hilton argument">
<text>In mathematics, the Eckmann–Hilton argument (or Eckmann–Hilton principle or Eckmann–Hilton theorem) is an argument about two unital magma structures on a set where one is a homomorphism for the other. Given this, the structures are the same, and the resulting magma is a commutative monoid. This can then be used to prove the commutativity of the higher homotopy groups. The principle is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton, who used it in a 1962 paper.

==The Eckmann–Hilton result==
Let formula_1 be a set equipped with two binary operations, which we will write formula_2 and formula_3, and suppose:

# formula_2 and formula_3 are both unital, meaning that there are identity elements formula_6 and formula_7 of formula_1 such that formula_9 and formula_10, for all formula_11.
# formula_12 for all formula_13.

Then formula_2 and formula_3 are the same and in fact commutative and associative.

===Remarks===
The operations formula_3 and formula_2 are often referred to as monoid structures or multiplications, but this suggests they are assumed to be associative, a property that is not required for the proof. In fact, associativity follows. Likewise, we do not have to require that the two operations have the same neutral element; this is a consequence.

==Proof==
First, observe that the units of the two operations coincide:
formula_18.
Now, let formula_19.
Then formula_20. This establishes that the two operations coincide and are commutative.

For associativity, formula_21.

==Two-dimensional proof==
The above proof also has a &quot;two-dimensional&quot; presentation that better illustrates the application to higher homotopy groups.
For this version of the proof, we write the two operations as vertical and horizontal juxtaposition, i.e., formula_22 and formula_23. The interchange property can then be expressed as follows:

For all formula_24, formula_25, so we can write
formula_26 without ambiguity.

Let formula_27 and formula_2 be the units for vertical and horizontal composition respectively. Then formula_29, so both units are equal.

Now, for all formula_30, formula_31, so horizontal composition is the same as vertical composition and both operations are commutative.

Finally, for all formula_32,
formula_33, so composition is associative.

== Remarks ==
If the operations are associative, each one defines the structure of a monoid on formula_1, and the conditions above are equivalent to the more abstract condition that formula_3 is a monoid homomorphism formula_36 (or vice versa). An even more abstract way of stating the theorem is: If formula_1 is a monoid object in the category of monoids, then formula_1 is in fact a commutative monoid.

It is important that a similar argument does NOT give such a trivial result in the case of monoid objects in the categories of small categories or of groupoids. Instead the notion of group object in the category of groupoids turns out to be equivalent to the notion of crossed module. This leads to the idea of using multiple groupoid objects in homotopy theory. 

More generally, the Eckmann–Hilton argument is a special case of the use of the interchange law in the theory of (strict) double and multiple categories. A (strict) double category is a set, or class, equipped with two category structures, each of which is a morphism for the other structure. If the compositions in the two category structures are written formula_39 then the interchange law reads 
:formula_40
whenever both sides are defined. For an example of its use, and some discussion, see the paper of Higgins referenced below. The interchange law implies that a double category contains a family of abelian monoids. 

The history in relation to homotopy groups is interesting. The workers in topology of the early 20th century were aware that the nonabelian fundamental group was of use in geometry and analysis; that abelian homology groups could be defined in all dimensions; and that for a connected space, the first homology group was the fundamental group made abelian. So there was a desire to generalise the nonabelian fundamental group to all dimensions. 

In 1932, Eduard Čech submitted a paper on higher homotopy groups to the International Congress of Mathematics at Zürich. However, Pavel Alexandroff and Heinz Hopf quickly proved these groups were abelian for formula_41, and on these grounds persuaded Čech to withdraw his paper, so that only a small paragraph appeared in the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. It is said that Witold Hurewicz attended this conference, and his first work on higher homotopy groups appeared in 1935. Thus the dreams of the early topologists have long been regarded as a mirage. 

Cubical higher homotopy groupoids are constructed for filtered spaces in the book &quot;Nonabelian algebraic topology&quot; cited below, which develops basic algebraic topology, including higher analogues to the Seifert–Van Kampen theorem, without using singular homology or simplicial approximation.

<text>Silver sulfide is an inorganic compound with the formula . A dense black solid, it is the only sulfide of silver. It is useful as a photosensitizer in photography. It constitutes the tarnish that forms over time on silverware and other silver objects. Silver sulfide is insoluble in most solvents, but is degraded by strong acids. Silver sulfide is a network solid made up of silver (electronegativity of 1.98) and sulfur (electronegativity of 2.58) where the bonds have low ionic character (approximately 10%).

== Formation ==
Silver sulfide naturally occurs as the tarnish on silverware. When combined with silver, hydrogen sulfide gas creates a layer of black silver sulfide patina on the silver, protecting the inner silver from further conversion to silver sulfide. Silver whiskers can form when silver sulfide forms on the surface of silver electrical contacts operating in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide and high humidity. Such atmospheres can exist in sewage treatment and paper mills.

==Structure and properties==
Three forms are known: monoclinic acanthite (α-form), stable below 179 °C, body centered cubic so-called argentite (β-form), stable above 180 °C, and a high temperature face-centred cubic (γ-form) stable above 586 °C. The higher temperature forms are electrical conductors. It is found in nature as relatively low temperature mineral acanthite. Acanthite is an important ore of silver. The acanthite, monoclinic, form features two kinds of silver centers, one with two and the other with three near neighbour sulfur atoms. Argentite refers to a cubic form, which, due to instability in &quot;normal&quot; temperatures, is found in form of the pseudomorphosis of acanthite after argentite.

== Exceptional ductility of α-Ag2S ==
Relative to most inorganic materials, α-Ag2S displays exceptional ductility at room temperature. This material can undergo extensive deformation, akin to metals, without fracturing. Such behavior is evident in various mechanical tests; for instance, α-Ag2S can be easily machined into cylindrical or bar shapes and can withstand substantial deformation under compression, three-point bending, and tensile stresses. The material sustains over 50% engineering strain in compression tests and up to 20% or more in bending tests.

The intrinsic ductility of alpha-phase silver sulfide (α-Ag2S) is underpinned by its unique structural and chemical bonding characteristics. At the atomic level, its monoclinic crystal structure, which remains stable up to 451 K, enables the movement of atoms and dislocations along well-defined crystallographic planes known as slip planes. Additionally, the dynamic bonding within the crystal structure supports both the sliding of atomic layers and the maintenance of material integrity during deformation. The interatomic forces within the slip planes are sufficiently strong to prevent the material from cleaving while still allowing for considerable flexibility. Further insights into α-Ag2S&#x27;s ductility come from density functional theory calculations, which reveal that the primary slip planes align with the [100] direction and slipping occurs along the [001] direction. This arrangement permits atoms to glide over each other under stress through minute adjustments in the interlayer distances, which are energetically favorable as indicated by low slipping energy barriers (ΔEB) and high cleavage energies (ΔEC). These properties ensure significant deformation capability without fracture. Silver and sulfur atoms in α-Ag2S form transient, yet robust interactions that enable the material to retain its integrity while deforming. This behavior is akin to that of metals, where dislocations move with relative ease, providing α-Ag2S with a unique combination of flexibility and strength, making it exceptionally resistant to cracking under mechanical stress.

== History ==
In 1833 Michael Faraday noticed that the resistance of silver sulfide decreased dramatically as temperature increased. This constituted the first report of a semiconducting material.

Silver sulfide is a component of classical qualitative inorganic analysis.
