<text>Douglas Stuart Moore (August 10, 1893 – July 25, 1969) was an American composer, songwriter, organist, pianist, conductor, educator, actor, and author. A composer who mainly wrote works with an American subject, his music is generally characterized by lyricism in a popular or conservative style which generally eschewed the more experimental progressive trends of musical modernism. Composer Virgil Thomson described Moore as a neoromantic composer who was influenced by American folk music. While several of his works enjoyed popularity during his lifetime, only his folk opera &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot; (1956) has remained well known into the 21st century.

==Overview==
Moore first created music while a student at Yale University from 1911 through 1917; writing usually humorous songs in a popular style for school events in addition to creating music for school plays and musical revues. His work composing music for the Yale Dramatic Association, Elizabethan Club, and Yale Glee Club drew the attention of Yale music department chair Horatio Parker, who persuaded Moore, then a philosophy major, to pursue a second degree in music composition. After completing that degree in 1917, he served as an officer in the United States Navy during World War I before pursuing graduate studies in music composition with Vincent d&#x27;Indy at the Schola Cantorum de Paris (1919–1921) and with Ernest Bloch at the Cleveland Institute of Music (1921–1922).

Moore began his professional life as the organist and music director for the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) from 1921 through 1925; during which time he also worked professionally as a leading actor with the Cleveland Play House. His first composition of note, &quot;Four Museum Pieces&quot;, was originally written for organ in 1922 with its four movements named for works of art in the collection of the CMA. Like many of Moore&#x27;s compositions, this piece was composed during a summer residency at the MacDowell Colony, an artistic summer residency program which Moore attended for many years; first as a fellow and later as a member of the governing board. Moore arranged the work for orchestra at the MacDowell Colony in 1923, and conducted its world premiere with the Cleveland Orchestra that year. The piece won him a competitive Joseph Pulitzer National Traveling Scholarship which funded further composition studies with Nadia Boulanger in Paris in 1926.

In the fall of 1926 Moore joined the music faculty of Barnard College at Columbia University; beginning a lengthy professional career at Columbia. He was rapidly promoted at Columbia from adjunct faculty to professor and head of the music department at Barnard College in 1927; thanks in large part to the success of his orchestral suite &quot;The Pageant of P.T. Barnum&quot; (composed 1924, premiered 1926) which won the Eastman School of Music composing competition in 1927 and became Moore&#x27;s first work to be widely programmed in the United States. Moore was director of the Columbia University orchestra from 1926 through 1935. In 1940 he succeeded Daniel Gregory Mason as chair of the music program at Columbia; a post he held until his retirement in 1962. His roles at Columbia and the MacDowell Colony as well as leadership roles on the governing boards of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and the American Academy of Arts and Letters made Moore one of the more influential music educators of the mid 20th century.

Moore composed music for the theater, film, ballet and orchestra. During his lifetime he was primarily known for his folk operas, beginning with the children&#x27;s opera &quot; The Headless Horseman&quot; (1936) which was widely performed at high schools and colleges throughout the United States during the mid 20th century. His next folk opera to achieve success was &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; which premiered on Broadway in 1939 and was based on the 1936 short story of the same name by Pulitizer Prize winning poet Stephen Vincent Benét. Benét was a close friend of Moore&#x27;s from Yale, and prior to this opera Moore had already composed several art songs to poems by Benét. Benét served as the opera&#x27;s librettist, and the work went on to enjoy many stagings by American and European opera companies and at universities and conservatories during the 20th century. Moore&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in A major (1945) was composed in memory of Stephen Vincent Benét who died in 1943 at the age of 44.

Moore was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music for the opera &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; in 1951. His best known work, &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot;, premiered at the Central City Opera in 1956 and received a critically lauded production at the New York City Opera (NYCO) in 1958. The NYCO recorded the opera with Beverly Sills in the title role. It has remained a part of the standard opera repertory. As an author he penned two books on music, &quot;Listening to Music&quot; (1932) and &quot;From Madrigal to Modern Music&quot; (1942).

==Life==
===Early life (1893–1911)===
Douglas Stuart Moore was born on August 10, 1893, in Cutchogue, Long Island, New York in the farmhouse of his grandfather, Joseph Hull Moore (1817–1904), where both his father and brothers were also born. He was the youngest child of Stuart Hull Moore (1854–1915) and Myra Drake (1856–1933); both of whom descended from the first colonial English settlers to America. He had two older brothers, Arthur and Eliot, and an older sister, Dorothy. His father&#x27;s ancestor Thomas Moore (1615–1691) originally settled in Connecticut but moved to Southold, New York on Long Island in 1640. His mother was a descendent of both Myles Standish and John Alden who traveled to America on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. His father built another nearby home for his family on the Moore family&#x27;s farm, named Quawksnest, in which Moore and his family spent their summers. As an adult Moore lived on the family&#x27;s Cutchogue property until his death in 1969. He resided in a cottage named Salt Meadow which was originally a garage and clubhouse before being converted into a home for Moore in 1933.

Moore&#x27;s father made a living as a publisher of among other things the literary magazine &quot;Ladies&#x27; World&quot;; a business which he sold to S. S. McClure upon his retirement in 1913. While not in Cutchogue, the Moore family resided in Brooklyn, New York, at a house located at 43 McDonough Street until 1914 when the family moved into a Brooklyn apartment building at the corner of Van Buren Street and Sumner Avenue. The family also owned a summer home in Pasadena, California which was purchased after Stuart Moore sold his business. While there were no professional musicians in Moore&#x27;s family, his mother was an amateur pianist who also sang in the women&#x27;s chorus of Brooklyn&#x27;s Chaminade Society (CS). At his mother&#x27;s insistence, Moore began his music education at the age of seven with the conductor of the CS chorus, Emma Richardson Kuster, who began giving him piano lessons in 1900. He later was a piano student of Beverly Day. His father enjoyed playing pianola rolls in the family home during his youth.

Moore attended elementary school at the Adelphi Academy (now Adelphi University) in Brooklyn which was operated at that time by Charles Herbert Levermore. At the age of 13 he matriculated to the Fessenden School, a boys boarding school in West Newton, Massachusetts which he attended for the 1906–1907 academic year. After this, he completed the last four years of his college preparatory education at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut from which he graduated in the spring of 1911. At Hotchkiss he made close friendships with several fellow students that would last through adulthood. These included friendships with Archibald MacLeish, who became a three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, writer, and the ninth Librarian of Congress; Donald Oenslager, who became a Tony Award winning scenic designer; Henry Luce, who founded the magazines &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Fortune&quot;; and Emily Bailey, whom Moore eventually married in 1920.

===Yale University (1911–1917)===
Moore entered Yale University as a college freshman in the fall of 1911 alongside his Hotchkiss friend Archibald MacLeish. At Yale he composed songs for school events which demonstrated a talent for writing music within a popular style. He quickly gained a reputation at Yale for writing humorous songs; one of which, &quot;Naomi: The Restaurant Queen&quot;, was performed by actress Ethel Green in her vaudeville act and was published by Charles F. Smith in 1912. Of the other songs he wrote while at Yale, the most well known is the Yale fight song &quot;Goodnight, Harvard&quot; which he composed in 1913. This song has been recorded by several artists, including Rudy Vallée. He also wrote another fight song, &quot;Parabalou&quot;, in 1912.

Moore was a member of the Yale Glee Club from 1913 through 1915; succeeding Cole Porter as the ensemble&#x27;s &quot;soloist and stunt man&quot;. With the glee club he often starred in comedy acts that contained music that he had composed. He was also a member of the banjo and mandolin club, and notably composed &quot;Concerto for Piano and mandolins&quot; which he premiered on campus as the pianist. In May 1914 he became a member of the Wolf&#x27;s Head secret society. He also performed in stage plays with the Yale Dramatic Association and the Elizabethan Club. Yale being an all-male school at that time, he often portrayed female characters on stage in drag, such as Mabel Chilters in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;. Moore developed close friendships with several fellow students in these performance groups, including Stephen Vincent Benét, Thornton Wilder, and Cole Porter.

Originally a philosophy major, Moore didn&#x27;t begin formal music studies at Yale until the fall 1913 semester when he became a pupil of David Stanley Smith who was one of his principal music teachers at Yale. His other principal teacher at Yale was Horatio Parker, who encouraged Moore to focus his music studies on composition after Parker heard works composed by Moore for the Yale Dramatic Club&#x27;s productions of Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Quentin Durward&quot; and William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1914. For those productions Moore served as conductor. He earned two degrees from Yale University, a B.A. in philosophy in 1915, and a B.M. in music composition in 1917. For his final graduate project he conducted his orchestral composition &quot;Fantaisie Polonaise&quot;. One of Moore&#x27;s composition classmates at Yale was Roger Sessions.

While a student at Yale, Moore&#x27;s father died in Pasadena on 18 April 1915. His father was a millionaire, and left Moore a considerable fortune which allowed him to freely pursue his music interests and live comfortably with the services of a butler and cook for the rest of his life. In the summer of 1916 he was a fellow at the MacDowell Colony, and he later returned to MacDowell multiple times during his career.

===War Service, Paris studies, and marriage (1917–1921)===
Moore further utilized his song writing skillset while serving in the United States Navy for two years during the Great War as a lieutenant from 1917 through 1919; writing songs to entertain his fellow servicemen in the Navy. One of these songs, &quot;Destroyer Life&quot;, appeared in the 1928 anthology &quot;Songs My Mother Never Taught Me&quot; which Moore co-authored with John Jacob Niles; bringing Moore his first recognition as a songwriter. Other songs penned by Moore from this era included &quot;Santy Anna&quot;, &quot;When I Lays Down&quot;, &quot;Ate My Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Hanging Johnnie&quot;, and &quot;Jail Song&quot;; many of them humorous accounts of life in the navy or about romantic liaisons with local women while on shore leave. He also wrote music to several poems by his friend MacLeish during this time. His songs demonstrated music influences from Tin Pan Alley, vaudeville, American folk tunes, and minstrel shows.

After leaving the Navy, Moore pursued graduate studies at the Schola Cantorum de Paris from 1919 through 1921, where his teachers included Vincent d&#x27;Indy (composition) and Charles Tournemire (organ). Tournemire left his teaching post in 1920; and Moore completed his organ studies with Nadia Boulanger. From D&#x27;Indy, Moore gained a compositional style similar to César Franck who had been D&#x27;Indy&#x27;s teacher. While his music later moved in other directions beyond this style, Moore credited D&#x27;Indy for giving him a grounding in musical form from which he composed during the rest of his career.

While a student in Paris, Moore returned to the United States to wed Emily Bailey, a close friend since his Hotchkiss days, on 16 September 1920 at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. They spent their honeymoon sailing the eastern coast of the United States before returning as a couple to Paris. In France, the couple were at the center of a social group of American artists all studying in Paris. These included his old Yale friend Stephen Vincent Benét, composer Quincy Porter, and pianist Bruce Simonds (who was later head of the music department at Yale) among others. Emily gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, Mary, in Paris on 7 July 1921.

===Cleveland and return to Paris (1921–1926)===
From 1921 through 1925 Moore worked as the curator of music at the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA), and concurrently served as organist at Adelbert College of Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) from 1923 through 1925. At the CMA he gave weekly organ concerts on the CMA&#x27;s McMyler Memorial Organ which was built by Ernest M. Skinner during his first year with the museum in 1921, and then installed in 1922. In addition to performing these concerts, his other CMA duties included directing a children&#x27;s music program of regular weekly classes, giving public lectures on music history and appreciation, and coordinating a chamber music concert series. He used his position at the CMA to champion American composers and their music through programming their works.

During his time at CMA, Moore continued his education through continued composition studies with Ernest Bloch in his masterclass at the Cleveland Institute of Music in 1921–1922. His classmates included composers Theodore Chandler, Quincy Porter, Bernard Rogers, and Roger Sessions. Moore thrived under Bloch more so than his earlier composition teachers. Bloch encouraged Moore and his classmates to compose music in their own aesthetic and style rather than conform to a specific aesthetic for their assignments.

Moore also worked as a leading actor at the Cleveland Play House (CPH) in the 1920s. Roles he portrayed at this theater included Reverend Cyril Smith in G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;Magic&quot; (1922–1923 season); Henry Higgins in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1923–1924 season); Geoffrey Wareham in Harry Wagstaff Gribble&#x27;s &quot;March Hares&quot; (1923; and later reprised in 1928); and the title role in Clare Kummer&#x27;s &quot;Rollo&#x27;s Wild Oat&quot;. His experiences performing at the CPH later informed his work creating pieces for the stage. Reviews of his performances were highly positive, and for a time Moore considered abandoning his career in music and pursuing an acting career.

Moore made his first significant professional contribution as a composer and conductor on November 15, 1923; conducting the premiere of his &quot;Four Museum Pieces&quot; with the Cleveland Orchestra. That work had originally been composed by Moore for organ while in attendance at the MacDowell Colony in the summer of 1922, and, after encouragement from Daniel Gregory Mason, was orchestrated by Moore at the MacDowell Colony in the summer of 1923. Moore titled each movement after a work of art in the collection of the CMA. During these summers at MacDowell, Moore also composed several art songs to poems by Stephen Vincent Benét (&quot;A Nonsense Song&quot; and &quot;A Sad Song&quot;), Archibald MacLeish (&quot;April Weather&quot;), and Elinor Wylie (&quot;The Apple Boughs Bend&quot;); all of which were performed at MacDowell with the poets in attendance. In 1926 Moore joined the board of directors of the Edward MacDowell Association which ran the MacDowell Colony among other things.

In 1923 Moore met and befriended the poet Vachel Lindsay; a relationship which had a significant impact on the future trajectory of Moore&#x27;s compositional focus. Lindsay persuaded Moore to write music using American culture and history as its inspiration, and from this point on Moore&#x27;s compositional output was mostly based on American subjects or themes for the rest of his life. His first American themed work was the symphonic piece &quot;Pageant of P.T. Barnum&quot; (composed 1924). Well received at its premiere by the Cleveland Orchestra under Nikolai Sokoloff on 28 March 1926, this work was the first piece by Moore to bring the composer recognition among the broader public. The piece enjoyed a great deal of popularity in America during the mid 20th century, but has since been programmed infrequently. He also composed the &quot;104th Cavalry Regiment March&quot; in 1924 in honor of the regiment of the same name of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard; a work later arranged for band by Joseph C. Painter. In 1925 he composed incidental music for a production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; on a commission from Richard Boleslawski&#x27;s American Laboratory Theatre (ALT). He continued to compose incidental music for the ALT in succeeding years for productions of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Rome&quot; in 1927.

From the autumn of 1925 through the spring of 1926 Moore studied composition with Boulanger in Paris after being awarded a Joseph Pulitzer National Traveling Scholarship in recognition of his &quot;Four Museum Pieces&quot;. While Moore had a positive experience as an organ pupil of Boulanger, his compositional studies were not happy ones under her tutelage. His interests in sentimental American subjects, opera, musical theatre, folk music, and a penchant for more conservative melodic writing clashed with Boulanger&#x27;s progressive aesthetic of musical modernism. Moore stated the following about Boulanger: &quot;We never got along in composition. She didn&#x27;t like what I could do and I didn&#x27;t like what she taught. She was a devotee of Fauré and Stravinsky. She didn&#x27;t want you to be yourself.&quot;

As a result, Moore&#x27;s time with Boulanger was not productive; with only a few small chamber pieces for woodwinds surviving. However, Moore did gain from Boulanger a stronger grounding in counterpoint and general musicianship skills, and he met several esteemed musicians in Boulanger&#x27;s circle which proved to be valuable professional contacts in his career. He also devoted time to some vocal works while in Paris; although it is not clear if Boulanger had any input into these works. The most important of these was the &quot;Ballad of William Sycmamore&quot; which used text by Stephen Vincent Benét, and was scored for baritone voice, flute, trombone, and piano. He also worked on his first stage work while in Paris, the musical &quot;Oh, Oh, Tennessee&quot;, but the work has never been published or performed.

===Columbia University (1926–1962)===
After Moore returned to New York from Paris, he joined the music faculty at Barnard College, Columbia University in the fall of 1926. The success of the &quot;Pageant of P.T. Barnum&quot; upon its New York career at Carnegie Hall on January 18, 1927, and the work&#x27;s win of the 1927 Eastman School of Music Orchestra Contest had a positive impact on Moore&#x27;s career at Columbia. He was rapidly promoted from adjunct faculty member to assistant professor at the wider Columbia University and head of the music department at Barnard College specifically on July 1, 1927.

From 1926 through 1935 Moore was the conductor of Columbia University&#x27;s orchestra. Under his leadership, Moore was instrumental in instituting several new policies in the music program at Columbia. These included giving students college credit for playing in the orchestra and taking music lessons for the first time, opening up the orchestra to women players for the first time, and instituting scholarships for instrumentalists in the orchestra that were difficult to obtain (such as oboists and bassoonists). In addition to his busy schedule administrating the music program and conducting orchestra rehearsals and concerts, Moore taught courses in music appreciation. This latter work led to the publication of his first book, &quot;Listening to Music&quot; (1932), which was written for a general audience without any music background. The book explained the basic elements of music: melody, harmony, polyphony, tonality, rhythm, and form with a suggested guide to recordings for listening and further reading. It was one of the earliest, if not the earliest, music textbooks to incorporate music recordings into the text.

In 1940 Moore succeeded Daniel Gregory Mason as head of the music faculty at Columbia; a post he held for the next 22 years. During his tenure he served as the administering secretary of the Alice M. Ditson Fund which was responsible for funding works by composers like Béla Bartók, Benjamin Britten, Gian Carlo Menotti, Walter Piston, and Virgil Thomson among others. He retired from Columbia in 1962 after having taught at that institution for 36 years.

Moore died July 25, 1969, in Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, New York; he was 75. After the funeral at Cutchogue Presbyterian Church, he was buried in Cutchogue Cemetery.

Moore was a member from 1941 of the National Institute and American Academy of Arts and Letters. He served as president from 1953 until 1956. In 1954 he was a co-founder, with Otto Luening and Oliver Daniel, of the CRI (Composers Recordings, Inc.) record label.

His second book was,&quot;From Madrigal to Modern Music&quot; (1942).

===Work as a composer (1926–1966)===
====1926–1929====
During his time at Columbia, Moore remained active as a composer; writing works with American themes. The first major work he composed during this time was the symphonic poem &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1928); which told the story of Melville&#x27;s 1851 novel of the same name through music. This is one of the few compositions by Moore which attempted to embrace elements of musical modernism with applications of quartal and quintal harmony, polytonality, frequent metre changes, increased dissonance, and atonality; all techniques not usually found in Moore&#x27;s works. The work was likely an attempt to utilize techniques learned by Moore from Boulanger, and an attempt to write in a style currently in vogue with his contemporaries. Premiered by the Rochester Philharmonic, the work was not well received, and Moore never again chose to create a piece in this modernist style.

In 1928 Moore co-authored a collection of songs from World War I with John Jacob Niles entitled &quot;Songs My Mother Never Taught Me&quot;. The anthology included mainly anonymous songs from the army and navy which were arranged by the two men; but also included some original music from Moore&#x27;s songwriting days while in the navy. Moore also contributed the children&#x27;s songs &quot;The Cupboard&quot; and &quot;Fingers and Toes&quot; to the 1928 anthology &quot;New Songs for New Voices&quot;. Moore also composed music for a planned play on American outlaw Jesse James for the ALT that year, but financial issues ultimately prevented that project from making it to the stage. His 1929 &quot;Violin sonata&quot; was written for violinist Hildegarde Donaldson.

====1930s====
In the summer of 1930 on the Moore family farm in Cutchogue, Moore began composing his first symphony: &quot;A Symphony of Autumn&quot; in three movements. Completed in 1931, the symphony was dedicated to composer and conductor Howard Hanson who conducted the Rochester Philharmonic in the work&#x27;s premiere on April 2, 1931. The symphony incorporates programmatic elements while maintaining a traditional symphonic form; although the work omits the scherzo movement.

Moore conducted the Manhattan Symphony Orchestra in the premiere of his &quot;Overture on an American Tune&quot; on December 11, 1932. The work was originally titled &quot;Babbitt&quot; after the 1922 novel of the same name by Sinclair Lewis. Program notes at the work&#x27;s premiere indicate that the piece was meant to express musical ideas inspired by the &quot;maligned&quot; title character of the novel. Utilizing a sonata form structure, the overture uses the tune &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; by Tin Pan Alley composer Henry W. Armstrong as a motif. Moore develops the melody to this tune using the techniques of augmentation, diminution, and retrograde.

Moore&#x27;s &quot;String quartet&quot; was premiered by the Arion String Quartet at Barnard College on November 16, 1933, just two weeks before the death of his mother in Pasadena on December 1, 1933. The string quartet was dedicated to the Roth Quartet and is written in Moore&#x27;s characteristic melodic style with effective use of countermelodies and modal harmony.

In 1934 Moore was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship which enabled him to spend time in Bermuda composing his first opera, &quot;White Wings&quot;, after the 1926 Broadway play by dramatist Philip Barry. Moore had seen the work on Broadway, and was one of several composers interested in adapting work with a music setting; among them Kurt Weil. Two of Moore&#x27;s old school friends, magazine magnate and Hotchkiss alumnus Henry Luce and poet and Yale alumnus Stephen Vincent Benét, were instrumental in convincing Barry to select Moore to adapt the play as an opera. The work was supposed to be mounted by the Federal Theatre Project in 1935, but a union strike by workers put an end to the planned staging. The overture for the opera was premiered by the Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra in June 1935; but a staging of the opera did not happen until fourteen years later when it was mounted by The Hartt School on February 10, 1949. Conflicts with Barry and his widow prevented the opera from being published.

In 1936 ethnomusicologist and music educator Willard Rhodes, then music director for the Bronxville Union Free School District, commissioned Moore to write an operetta based on Mayne Reid&#x27;s 1866 novel &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot;. Written in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan, the Bronxville High School presented the world premiere of the work on March 5, 1937. Stephen Vincent Benet wrote the libretto to the work. This opera was regularly performed at American high schools and universities during the 20th century.

Moore and Benet collaborated again on the folk opera &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1939) which was adapted from Benet&#x27;s 1936 novel of the same name. Composed in the years 1937 through 1939, the work premiered at Broadway &#x27;s Martin Beck Theatre on 18 May 1939 in a double bill with Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Filling Station&quot;.

===1940s===

===1950s===
Moore was also influenced by jazz and ragtime, developed by African Americans. This is most readily apparent in his operas. &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot; has several rag elements (a honky-tonk piano is used extensively in the first scene). In his &quot;soap opera&quot; &quot;Gallantry&quot; (1950), the commercials for Lochinvar soap and Billy Boy wax are sung in a blueslike fashion. The &quot;allegretto&quot; from his second symphony has been described as having an almost neoclassical style.

Douglas Moore&#x27;s music has been described as having a &quot;modesty, grace and tender lyricism&quot;, especially marking the slower passages of many works, especially his &quot;Symphony in A major&quot; and the clarinet quintet. The faster movements of these works have &quot;robust, jovial and a somewhat terpsichorean quality.&quot; Most of Moore&#x27;s energy was devoted to music for opera rather than to orchestral works.

The novel &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; was written by a Norwegian American and first published in Norwegian in 1921–1922. Moore composed music after the 1927 English translation of this work about Scandinavian settlers on the Great Plains was adapted as an opera. He won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for Music for this work.

<doc id="488815" wikidata="Q1361387" url="?curid=488815" title="Utility frequency">
<text>The utility frequency, (power) line frequency (American English) or mains frequency (British English) is the nominal frequency of the oscillations of alternating current (AC) in a wide area synchronous grid transmitted from a power station to the end-user. In large parts of the world this is 50 Hz, although in the Americas and parts of Asia it is typically 60 Hz. Current usage by country or region is given in the list of mains electricity by country.

During the development of commercial electric power systems in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, many different frequencies (and voltages) had been used. Large investment in equipment at one frequency made standardization a slow process. However, as of the turn of the 21st century, places that now use the 50 Hz frequency tend to use 220–240 V, and those that now use 60 Hz tend to use 100–127 V. Both frequencies coexist today (Japan uses both) with no great technical reason to prefer one over the other and no apparent desire for complete worldwide standardization.

==Electric clocks==

In practice, the exact frequency of the grid varies around the nominal frequency, reducing when the grid is heavily loaded, and speeding up when lightly loaded. However, most utilities will adjust generation onto the grid over the course of the day to ensure a constant number of cycles occur. This is used by some clocks to accurately maintain their time.

==Operating factors==
Several factors influence the choice of frequency in an AC system. Lighting, motors, transformers, generators, and transmission lines all have characteristics which depend on the power frequency. All of these factors make the selection of a power frequency a matter of considerable importance. The best frequency is a compromise among competing requirements.

In the late 19th century, designers would pick a relatively high frequency for systems featuring transformers and arc lights, so as to economize on transformer materials and to reduce visible flickering of the lamps, but would pick a lower frequency for systems with long transmission lines or feeding primarily motor loads or rotary converters for producing direct current. When large central generating stations became practical, the choice of frequency was made based on the nature of the intended load. Eventually improvements in machine design allowed a single frequency to be used both for lighting and motor loads. A unified system improved the economics of electricity production, since system load was more uniform during the course of a day.

===Lighting===
The first applications of commercial electric power were incandescent lighting and commutator-type electric motors. Both of them operate well on DC, but DC could not be easily changed in voltage, and was generally only produced at the required utilization voltage.

If an incandescent lamp is operated on a low-frequency current, the filament cools on each half-cycle of the alternating current, which led to a perceptible change in brightness and &quot;flicker&quot; of the lamps; the effect is more pronounced with arc lamps, and the later mercury-vapor lamps and fluorescent lamps. Open arc lamps made an audible buzz on alternating current, leading to experiments with high-frequency alternators to raise the sound above the range of human hearing.

===Rotating machines===
Commutator-type motors do not operate well on higher-frequency AC, because the rapid changes of current are opposed by the inductance of the motor field. Though commutator-type &quot;universal&quot; motors are common in AC household appliances and power tools, they are small motors, less than 1 kW. The induction motor was found to work well on frequencies around 50 to 60 Hz, but the materials available in the 1890s would not work well at a frequency of, say, 133 Hz. There is a fixed relationship between the number of magnetic poles in the induction motor field, the frequency of the alternating current, and the rotation speed; so, a given standard speed limits the choice of frequency (and the reverse). Once AC electric motors became common, it was important to standardize frequency for compatibility with the customer&#x27;s equipment.

Generators operated by low-speed reciprocating engines produce lower frequencies, for a given number of poles, than those operated by, for example, a high-speed steam turbine. For very low prime mover speeds, it would be costly to build a generator with enough poles to provide a high AC frequency. As well, synchronizing two generators to the same speed was found to be easier at lower speeds. While belt drives were common as a way to increase speed of slow engines, in very large ratings (thousands of kilowatts) these were expensive, inefficient, and unreliable. After about 1906, generators driven directly by steam turbines favored higher frequencies. The steadier rotation speed of high-speed machines allowed for satisfactory operation of commutators in rotary converters.
The synchronous speed N in RPM is calculated using the formula
: formula_1
where &quot;f&quot; is the frequency in hertz, and &quot;P&quot; is the number of poles.
Direct-current power was not entirely displaced by alternating current and was useful in railway and electrochemical processes. Prior to the development of mercury-arc valve rectifiers, rotary converters were used to produce DC power from AC. Like other commutator-type machines, these worked better with lower frequencies.

===Transmission and transformers===
With AC, transformers can be used to step down high transmission voltages to lower customer utilization voltage. The transformer is effectively a voltage converter with no moving parts and requiring little maintenance. The use of AC eliminated the need for spinning DC voltage-conversion motor–generators that require regular maintenance and monitoring.

Since, for a given power level, the dimensions of a transformer are roughly inversely proportional to frequency, a system with many transformers would be more economical at a higher frequency.

Electric power transmission over long lines favors lower frequencies. The effects of the distributed capacitance and inductance of the line are less at low frequency.

===System interconnection===

Generators can only be interconnected to operate in parallel if they are of the same frequency and wave-shape. By standardizing the frequency used, generators in a geographic area can be interconnected in a grid, providing reliability and cost savings.

==History==
Many different power frequencies were used in the 19th century.

Very early isolated AC generating schemes used arbitrary frequencies based on convenience for steam engine, water turbine, and electrical generator design. Frequencies between  Hz and  Hz were used on different systems. For example, the city of Coventry, England, in 1895 had a unique 87 Hz single-phase distribution system that was in use until 1906. The proliferation of frequencies grew out of the rapid development of electrical machines in the period 1880 through 1900.

In the early incandescent lighting period, single-phase AC was common and typical generators were 8-pole machines operated at 2,000 RPM, giving a frequency of 133 hertz.

Though many theories exist, and quite a few entertaining urban legends, there is little certitude in the details of the history of 60 Hz vs. 50 Hz.

The German company AEG (descended from a company founded by Edison in Germany) built the first German generating facility to run at 50 Hz. At the time, AEG had a virtual monopoly and their standard spread to the rest of Europe. After observing the flicker of lamps operated by the 40 Hz power transmitted by the Lauffen-Frankfurt link in 1891, AEG raised their standard frequency to 50 Hz in 1891.

Westinghouse Electric decided to standardize on a higher frequency to permit operation of both electric lighting and induction motors on the same generating system. Although 50 Hz was suitable for both, in 1890 Westinghouse considered that existing arc-lighting equipment operated slightly better on 60 Hz, and so that frequency was chosen. The operation of Tesla&#x27;s induction motor, licensed by Westinghouse in 1888, required a lower frequency than the 133 Hz common for lighting systems at that time. In 1893 General Electric Corporation, which was affiliated with AEG in Germany, built a generating project at Mill Creek to bring electricity to Redlands, California using 50 Hz, but changed to 60 Hz a year later to maintain market share with the Westinghouse standard.

===25 Hz origins===
The first generators at the Niagara Falls project, built by Westinghouse in 1895, were 25 Hz, because the turbine speed had already been set before alternating current power transmission had been definitively selected. Westinghouse would have selected a low frequency of 30 Hz to drive motor loads, but the turbines for the project had already been specified at 250 RPM. The machines could have been made to deliver  Hz power suitable for heavy commutator-type motors, but the Westinghouse company objected that this would be undesirable for lighting and suggested  Hz. Eventually a compromise of 25 Hz, with 12-pole 250 RPM generators, was chosen. Because the Niagara project was so influential on electric power systems design, 25 Hz prevailed as the North American standard for low-frequency AC.

===40 Hz origins===
A General Electric study concluded that 40 Hz would have been a good compromise between lighting, motor, and transmission needs, given the materials and equipment available in the first quarter of the 20th century. Several 40 Hz systems were built. The Lauffen-Frankfurt demonstration used 40 Hz to transmit power 175 km in 1891. A large interconnected 40 Hz network existed in north-east England (the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company, NESCO) until the advent of the National Grid (UK) in the late 1920s, and projects in Italy used 42 Hz. The oldest continuously operating commercial hydroelectric power station in the United States, Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant, still produces electric power at 40 Hz and supplies power to the local 60 Hz transmission system through frequency changers. Industrial plants and mines in North America and Australia sometimes were built with 40 Hz electrical systems which were maintained until too uneconomic to continue. Although frequencies near 40 Hz found much commercial use, these were bypassed by standardized frequencies of 25, 50 and 60 Hz preferred by higher volume equipment manufacturers.

The Ganz Company of Hungary had standardized on 5000 alternations per minute (41 Hz) for their products, so Ganz clients had 41 Hz systems that in some cases ran for many years.

===Standardization===
In the early days of electrification, so many frequencies were used that no single value prevailed (London in 1918 had ten different frequencies). As the 20th century continued, more power was produced at 60 Hz (North America) or 50 Hz (Europe and most of Asia). Standardization allowed international trade in electrical equipment. Much later, the use of standard frequencies allowed interconnection of power grids. It was not until after World War II – with the advent of affordable electrical consumer goods – that more uniform standards were enacted.

In the United Kingdom, a standard frequency of 50 Hz was declared as early as 1904, but significant development continued at other frequencies. The implementation of the National Grid starting in 1926 compelled the standardization of frequencies among the many interconnected electrical service providers. The 50 Hz standard was completely established only after World War II.

By about 1900, European manufacturers had mostly standardized on 50 Hz for new installations. The German Verband der Elektrotechnik (VDE), in the first standard for electrical machines and transformers in 1902, recommended 25 Hz and 50 Hz as standard frequencies. VDE did not see much application of 25 Hz, and dropped it from the 1914 edition of the standard. Remnant installations at other frequencies persisted until well after the Second World War.

Because of the cost of conversion, some parts of the distribution system may continue to operate on original frequencies even after a new frequency is chosen. 25 Hz power was used in Ontario, Quebec, the northern United States, and for railway electrification. In the 1950s, many 25 Hz systems, from the generators right through to household appliances, were converted and standardized. Until 2006, some 25 Hz generators were still in existence at the Sir Adam Beck 1 (these were retrofitted to 60 Hz) and the Rankine generating stations (until its 2006 closure) near Niagara Falls to provide power for large industrial customers who did not want to replace existing equipment; and some 25 Hz motors and a 25 Hz power station exist in New Orleans for floodwater pumps. The 15 kV AC rail networks, used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, still operate at  Hz or 16.7 Hz.

In some cases, where most load was to be railway or motor loads, it was considered economic to generate power at 25 Hz and install rotary converters for 60 Hz distribution. Converters for production of DC from alternating current were available in larger sizes and were more efficient at 25 Hz compared with 60 Hz. Remnant fragments of older systems may be tied to the standard frequency system via a rotary converter or static inverter frequency changer. These allow energy to be interchanged between two power networks at different frequencies, but the systems are large, costly, and waste some energy in operation.

Rotating-machine frequency changers used to convert between 25 Hz and 60 Hz systems were awkward to design; a 60 Hz machine with 24 poles would turn at the same speed as a 25 Hz machine with 10 poles, making the machines large, slow-speed, and expensive. A ratio of 60/30 would have simplified these designs, but the installed base at 25 Hz was too large to be economically opposed.

In the United States, Southern California Edison had standardized on 50 Hz. Much of Southern California operated on 50 Hz and did not completely change frequency of their generators and customer equipment to 60 Hz until around 1948. Some projects by the Au Sable Electric Company used 30 Hz at transmission voltages up to 110,000 volts in 1914.

Initially in Brazil, electric machinery were imported from Europe and United States, implying the country had both 50 Hz and 60 Hz standards according to each region. In 1938, the federal government made a law, &quot;Decreto-Lei 852&quot;, intended to bring the whole country under 50 Hz within eight years. The law did not work, and in the early 1960s it was decided that Brazil would be unified under 60 Hz standard, because most developed and industrialized areas used 60 Hz; and a new law &quot;Lei 4.454&quot; was declared in 1964. Brazil underwent a frequency conversion program to 60 Hz that was not completed until 1978.

In Mexico, areas operating on 50 Hz grid were converted during the 1970s, uniting the country under 60 Hz.

In Japan, the western part of the country (Nagoya and west) uses 60 Hz and the eastern part (Tokyo and east) uses 50 Hz. This originates in the first purchases of generators from AEG in 1895, installed for Tokyo, and General Electric in 1896, installed in Osaka. The boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back HVDC substations which convert the frequency; these are Shin Shinano, Sakuma Dam, Minami-Fukumitsu, and the Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter.

Utility frequencies in North America in 1897

Utility frequencies in Europe to 1900

Even by the middle of the 20th century, utility frequencies were still not entirely standardized at the now-common 50 Hz or 60 Hz. In 1946, a reference manual for designers of radio equipment listed the following now obsolete frequencies as in use. Many of these regions also had 50-cycle, 60-cycle, or direct current supplies.

Frequencies in use in 1946 (as well as 50 Hz and 60 Hz)
Where regions are marked (*), this is the only utility frequency shown for that region.

==Railways==

Other power frequencies are still used. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway use traction power networks for railways, distributing single-phase AC at  Hz or 16.7 Hz. A frequency of 25 Hz is used for the Austrian Mariazell Railway, as well as Amtrak and SEPTA&#x27;s traction power systems in the United States. Other AC railway systems are energized at the local commercial power frequency, 50 Hz or 60 Hz.

Traction power may be derived from commercial power supplies by frequency converters, or in some cases may be produced by dedicated traction powerstations. In the 19th century, frequencies as low as 8 Hz were contemplated for operation of electric railways with commutator motors.
Some outlets in trains carry the correct voltage, but using the original train network frequency like  Hz or 16.7 Hz.

==400 Hz==
Power frequencies as high as 400 Hz are used in aircraft, spacecraft, submarines, server rooms for computer power, military equipment, and hand-held machine tools. Such high frequencies cannot be economically transmitted long distances; the increased frequency greatly increases series impedance due to the inductance of transmission lines, making power transmission difficult. Consequently, 400 Hz power systems are usually confined to a building or vehicle.

Transformers, for example, can be made smaller because the magnetic core can be much smaller for the same power level. Induction motors turn at a speed proportional to frequency, so a high-frequency power supply allows more power to be obtained for the same motor volume and mass. Transformers and motors for 400 Hz are much smaller and lighter than at 50 or 60 Hz, which is an advantage in aircraft and ships. A United States military standard MIL-STD-704 exists for aircraft use of 400 Hz power.

==Stability==

===Time error correction (TEC)===
Regulation of power system frequency for timekeeping accuracy was not commonplace until after 1916 with Henry Warren&#x27;s invention of the Warren Power Station Master Clock and self-starting synchronous motor. Nikola Tesla demonstrated the concept of clocks synchronized by line frequency at the 1893 Chicago Worlds fair. The Hammond Organ also depends on a synchronous AC clock motor to maintain the correct speed of its internal &quot;tone wheel&quot; generator, thus keeping all notes pitch-perfect.

Today, AC power network operators regulate the daily average frequency so that clocks stay within a few seconds of the correct time. In practice the nominal frequency is raised or lowered by a specific percentage to maintain synchronization. Over the course of a day, the average frequency is maintained at a nominal value within a few hundred parts per million. In the synchronous grid of Continental Europe, the deviation between network phase time and UTC (based on International Atomic Time) is calculated at 08:00 each day in a control center in Switzerland. The target frequency is then adjusted by up to ±0.01 Hz (±0.02%) from 50 Hz as needed, to ensure a long-term frequency average of exactly 50 Hz × 60 s/min × 60 min/h × 24 h/d = cycles per day. In North America, whenever the error exceeds 10 seconds for the Eastern Interconnection, 3 seconds for the Texas Interconnection, or 2 seconds for the Western Interconnection, a correction of ±0.02 Hz (0.033%) is applied. Time error corrections start and end either on the hour or on the half-hour.

Real-time frequency meters for power generation in the United Kingdom are available online – an official one for the National Grid, and an unofficial one maintained by Dynamic Demand. Real-time frequency data of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe is available on websites such as . The Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET) at the University of Tennessee measures the frequency of the interconnections within the North American power grid, as well as in several other parts of the world. These measurements are displayed on the FNET website.

===US regulations===
In the United States, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission made time error correction mandatory in 2009. In 2011, The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) discussed a proposed experiment that would relax frequency regulation requirements for electrical grids which would reduce the long-term accuracy of clocks and other devices that use the 60 Hz grid frequency as a time base.

===Frequency and load===
Modern alternating-current grids use precise frequency control as an out-of-band signal to coordinate generators connected the network. The practice arose because the frequency of a mechanical generator varies with the input force and output load experienced. Excess load withdraws rotational energy from the generator shaft, reducing the frequency of the generated current; excess force deposits rotational energy, increasing frequency. Automatic generation control (AGC) maintains scheduled frequency and interchange power flows by adjusting the generator governor to counteract frequency changes, typically within several decaseconds. 

Flywheel physics does not apply to inverter-connected solar farms or other DC-linked power supplies. However, such power plants or storage systems can be programmed to follow the frequency signal. Indeed, a 2017 trial for CAISO discovered that solar plants could respond to the signal faster than traditional generators, because they did not need to accelerate a rotating mass.

Small, temporary frequency changes are an unavoidable consequence of changing demand, but dramatic, rapid frequency shifts often signal that a distribution network is near capacity limits. Exceptional examples have occurred before major outages. During a severe failure of generators or transmission lines, the ensuing load-generation imbalance will induce variation in local power system frequencies. Loss of an interconnection causes system frequency to increase (due to excess generation) upstream of the loss, but may cause a collapse in frequency or voltage (due to excess load) downstream of the loss. Consequently many power system protective relays automatically trigger on severe underfrequency (typically too low, depending on the system&#x27;s disturbance tolerance and the severity of protection measures). These initiate load shedding or trip interconnection lines to preserve the operation of at least part of the network.

Smaller power systems, not extensively interconnected with many generators and loads, will not maintain frequency with the same degree of accuracy. Where system frequency is not tightly regulated during heavy load periods, system operators may allow system frequency to rise during periods of light load to maintain a daily average frequency of acceptable accuracy. Portable generators, not connected to a utility system, need not tightly regulate their frequency because typical loads are insensitive to small frequency deviations.

===Load-frequency control===
Load-frequency control (LFC) is a type of integral control that restores the system frequency while respecting contracts for power provision or consumption to surrounding areas. The automatic generation scheme described in establishes a damping that minimizes the magnitude of average frequency error, , where is frequency, refers to the difference between measured and desired values, and overlines indicate time averages.

LFC incorporates power transfer between different areas, known as &quot;net tie-line power&quot;, into the minimized quantity. For a particular frequency bias constant , the area control error (ACE) associated with LFC at any moment in time is simply formula_2 where refers to tie-line power. This instantaneous error is then numerically integrated to give the time average, and governors adjusted to counteract its value. The coefficient traditionally has a negative value, so that when the frequency is lower than the target, area power production should increase; its magnitude is usually on the order of MW/dHz.

Tie-line bias LFC was known since 1930s, but was rarely used until the post-war period. In the 1950s, Nathan Cohn popularized the practice in a series of articles, arguing that load-frequency control minimized the adjustment necessary for changes in load. In particular, Cohn supposed that all regions of the grid shared a common linear regime, with location-invariant frequency change per additional loading (). If the utility selected formula_3 and one region experienced a temporary fault or other generation-load mismatch, then adjacent generators would observe a decrease in frequency but a counterbalancing increase in outward tieline power flow, giving no ACE. They would thus make no governor adjustments in the (presumed) brief period before the failed region recovered.

=== Rate of change of frequency ===
Rate of change of frequency (also RoCoF) is simply a time derivative of the utility frequency (formula_4), usually measured in Hz per second, Hz/s. The importance of this parameter increases when the traditional synchronous generators are replaced by the variable renewable energy (VRE) inverter-based resources (IBR). The design of a synchronous generator inherently provides the inertial response that limits the RoCoF. Since the IBRs are not electromechanically coupled into the power grid, a system with high VRE penetration might exhibit large RoCoF values that can cause problems with the operation of the system due to stress placed onto the remaining synchronous generators, triggering of the protection devices and load shedding.

As of 2017, regulations for some grids required the power plants to tolerate RoCoF of 1–4 Hz/s, the upper limit being a very high value, an order of magnitude higher than the design target of a typical older gas turbine generator. Testing high-power (multiple MW) equipment for RoCoF tolerance is hard, as a typical test setup is powered off the grid, and the frequency thus cannot be arbitrarily varied. In the US, the &quot;controllable grid interface&quot; at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory is the only facility that allows testing of multi-MW units (up to 7 MVA). Testing of large thermal units is not possible.

==Audible noise and interference==
AC-powered appliances can give off a characteristic hum, often called &quot;mains hum&quot;, at the multiples of the frequencies of AC power that they use (see Magnetostriction). It is usually produced by motor and transformer core laminations vibrating in time with the magnetic field. This hum can also appear in audio systems, where the power supply filter or signal shielding of an amplifier is not adequate.

Most countries chose their television vertical synchronization rate to be the same as the local mains supply frequency. This helped to prevent power line hum and magnetic interference from causing visible beat frequencies in the displayed picture of early analogue TV receivers particularly from the mains transformer. Although some distortion of the picture was present, it went mostly un-noticed because it was stationary. The elimination of transformers by the use of AC/DC receivers, and other changes to set design helped minimise the effect and some countries now use a vertical rate that is an approximation to the supply frequency (most notably 60 Hz areas).
Another use of this side effect is as a forensic tool. When a recording is made that captures audio near an AC appliance or socket, the hum is also incidentally recorded. The peaks of the hum repeat every AC cycle (every  ms for 50 Hz AC, or every  ms for 60 Hz AC). The exact frequency of the hum should match the frequency of a forensic recording of the hum at the exact date and time that the recording is alleged to have been made. Discontinuities in the frequency match or no match at all will betray the authenticity of the recording.

<text>The Sunday Night Sex Show was a live call-in Canadian television show hosted by Sue Johanson, which ran from 1996 to 2005. It aired on the W Network and was one of their most popular programs. Every week, callers would line up on the phone to talk to Johanson, about various topics from how to spice up one&#x27;s sex life, to advice on how to select the right sex toy, to how to deal with various relationship issues.

For many years, reruns of the television show ran on the Oxygen Network in the United States, but American viewers were frustrated that they couldn&#x27;t call in during the live airing in Canada. Eventually, a US version of the show, titled Talk Sex with Sue Johanson, was created.

Reasons for the Canadian cancellation were never given by either Johanson or the W Network. The US show ended with the May 11, 2008, episode. Johanson was very emotional at the conclusion of the show and joined on stage by her supporting cast.

Johanson hosted a similar phone-in show with the same name on Toronto radio station Q107 from 1984 to 1998, which was syndicated across Canada in later years, as well as a television phone-in show, &quot;Sex with Sue&quot;, on Rogers Cable&#x27;s community channel in Toronto from 1985 to 1995.

<text>Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Tenaglia (born March 7, 1961) is an Italian American DJ and record producer.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tenaglia left New York in 1985 and started DJing in Miami as a resident at Cheers nightclub, playing classic New York and Chicago house. He returned to New York five years later. At this time, he started to create some remixes, including Right Said Fred&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot; (1991), Jamiroquai&#x27;s &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot; (1993), and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Human Nature&quot; (1994).

===DJ career===
Tenaglia&#x27;s first mainstream success was with a remix of the Daou&#x27;s &quot;Surrender Yourself&quot; (1993).

Subsequent to this Tenaglia released three label compilations - &quot;Mix This Pussy&quot; (1994) and &quot;Can Your Pussy Do the Dog?&quot; (1995) for TRIBAL, and &quot;Gag Me with a Tune&quot; (1996) for Maxi.

===As a producer===
In 1996, after working for a short time at the New York nightclub Roxy, Tenaglia started a Saturday night residency at Twilo. In 1998, he moved his residency over to NY club Tunnel.

In 1998, Tenaglia released another album titled &quot;Tourism&quot;. The album featured the track &quot;Elements&quot;, which was #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart for two weeks in 1998. &quot;Music Is The Answer&quot; featuring Celeda (also on the LP Tourism) was on the top 40 charts in the UK.

In 1999, Tenaglia released his first installment in the UK-based Global Underground series of DJ mixes titled &quot;Athens&quot;.

In the two years that followed, Tenaglia released another Global Underground installment titled &quot;London&quot;, remixed Billy Nichols&#x27; &quot;Give Your Body Up To The Music&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy (for his remix of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Loved,&quot; also nominated for Best Dance Song), and won a Dancestar Lifetime Achievement award.

In 2003, Tenaglia released &quot;Choice: A Collection Of Classics&quot;, a two-CD mixed compilation. It featured artists such as Blaze, Adeva and Imagination, along with his own liner notes explaining the significance of each track. He also won another Dancestar award, this time &#x27;Best Party&#x27; for &quot;Be Yourself.&quot;

=== Later years ===
Tenaglia continues to play clubs and has played in NYC locations including Avalon, Crobar, Pacha NYC, Roxy and Webster Hall. In 2007, Tenaglia participated in the Dance parade. In 2008 he released a single on Tommy Boy Records, &quot;The Space Dance&quot;. The track reached number 1 on the Billboard Club Charts during November 2008.

Immediately following, Tenaglia released his first compilation album in five years, entitled &quot;Futurism&quot;, also on Tommy Boy Records. The compilation featured tracks from artists including Davide Squillace, The Wighnomy Brothers and Afefe Iku.

Tenaglia still continues to tour across the world.

==Awards and nominations ==
Tenaglia was nominated for Best Remixed Recording at the 44th Grammy Awards. He is also a three time International Dance Music Award winner, 3 time DJ Awards winner and 2 time Muzik Awards recipient.

<doc id="488823" wikidata="Q5638709" url="?curid=488823" title="Haggis hurling">
<text>Haggis hurling is a Scottish sport involving the hurling of a haggis as far as possible, for distance and accuracy.

==Background==
Although its proponents often claim an ancient origin, haggis hurling is actually a very recent invention. In 2004 Robin Dunseath, publicist for Scottish entrepreneur Tom Farmer and ex-president of the World Haggis Hurling Association, said he invented the sport as a practical joke for the 1977 Gathering of the Clans in Edinburgh, later using it to raise funds for charity at Highland games. It appeared on the BBC TV program &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; around that time, when many people would have realised it was basically a joke.

Two variations have developed: one enacted at festivals, the other a professional sport.

The present world record for haggis hurling was set at by Lorne Coltart at the Milngavie Highland Games on 11 June 2011, beating Allan Pettigrew&#x27;s record which had stood for over twenty years. However, the Australian cricket player Tom Moody was purported to have thrown a haggis in 1989 over .

Modern haggis hurling is judged on the basis of distance and accuracy of the hurl and a split or burst haggis is immediately disqualified, as the haggis must be fit to eat after landing. The sport requires subtle technique rather than brute force, as the hurl must result in a gentle landing to keep the haggis skin intact.

Plans to use a fake haggis in a hurling competition at a Highland festival in Melbourne split purists from those who are fearful of the mess a high-speed impacting may cause.

== Rules and regulations ==
The haggis must be of traditional construction, consisting of a tender boiled sheep&#x27;s heart, lung and liver with spices, onions, suet and oatmeal and stock stuffed in a sheep&#x27;s paunch, boiled for three hours.

At the time of hurling the haggis should be cooled and inspected to ensure no firming agents have been applied. Rules dictate that the haggis must be packed tight and secure, with no extra skin or flab.

The &quot;sporting&quot; haggis weighs 500 grams, with a maximum diameter of 18 cm and length of 22 cm. An allowance of ±30 grams is given and this weight is used in both junior and middle weight events.

The &quot;heavyweight&quot; event allows haggis up to 1 kg in weight, but the standard weight of 850 grams is more common, with an allowance of ±50 grams.

== Events ==
There is a World Haggis Hurling Championship.

Darren Laird from Bo&#x27;ness, Falkirk is the current world champion.

There is also a Canadian Haggis Hurling Championship in Perth, Ontario. The event is held in conjunction with the Perth World Record Kilt Run. The Canadian event in Perth is said to be the largest competition in the world, with over 140 measured competitors in 2013. The 2014 competition had 571 registered Hurlers. The competition in Perth uses M.P. Survey company and their precise laser equipment to measure the finals.

In 2004, a Highland festival in Melbourne made plans to use a fake haggis in a hurling competition there.

On 31 December 2021 the first Belgian competition was organised in the South of Deurne (Antwerp).

<doc id="488824" wikidata="Q633339" url="?curid=488824" title="Desertion">
<text>Desertion is the abandonment of a military duty or post without permission (a pass, liberty or leave) and is done with the intention of not returning. This contrasts with unauthorized absence (UA) or absence without leave (AWOL ), which are temporary forms of absence.
==Desertion versus absence without leave==

In the United States Army, United States Air Force, British Armed Forces, Australian Defence Force, New Zealand Defence Force, Singapore Armed Forces and Canadian Armed Forces, military personnel will become AWOL if absent from their post without a valid pass, liberty or leave. The United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, and United States Coast Guard generally refer to this as unauthorized absence. Personnel are dropped from their unit rolls after thirty days and then listed as &quot;deserters&quot;; however, as a matter of U.S. military law, desertion is not measured by time away from the unit, but rather:
* by leaving or remaining absent from their unit, organization, or place of duty, where there has been a determined intent to not return;
* if that intent is determined to be to avoid hazardous duty or shirk contractual obligation;
* if they enlist or accept an appointment in the same or another branch of service without disclosing the fact that they have not been properly separated from current service.

People who are away for more than thirty days but return voluntarily or indicate a credible intent to return may still be considered AWOL. Those who are away for fewer than thirty days but can credibly be shown to have no intent to return (for example, by joining the armed forces of another country) may nevertheless be tried for &quot;desertion&quot;. On rare occasions, they may be tried for treason if enough evidence is found.

There are similar concepts to desertion. Missing movement occurs when a member of the armed forces fails to arrive at the appointed time and place to deploy (or &quot;move out&quot;) with their assigned unit, ship, or aircraft. In the United States Armed Forces, this is a violation of the Article 87 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The offense is similar to absence without leave but may draw more severe punishment.

Failure to repair consists of missing a formation or failing to appear at an assigned place and time when so ordered. It is a lesser offense within Article 86 of the UCMJ.

An additional duty status code — absent-unknown, or &quot;AUN&quot; — was established by the U.S. military in 2020 to prompt unit actions and police investigations during the first 48 hours that a service member is missing.

==By country==

===Australia===
During the First World War, the Australian Government refused to allow members of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) to be executed for desertion, despite pressure from the British Government and military to do so. The AIF had the highest rate of soldiers going absent without leave of any of the national contingents in the British Expeditionary Force, and the proportion of soldiers who deserted was also higher than that of other forces on the Western Front in France.

===Austria===

In 2011, Vienna decided to honour Austrian Wehrmacht deserters. On 24 October 2014, a Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Military Justice was inaugurated on Vienna&#x27;s Ballhausplatz by Austria&#x27;s President Heinz Fischer. The monument was created by German artist Olaf Nicolai and is located opposite the President&#x27;s office and the Austrian Chancellery. The inscription on top of the three step sculpture features a poem by Scottish poet Ian Hamilton Finlay (1924–2006) with just two words: &quot;all alone&quot;.

===Afghanistan===
A quarter of ANA troops were reported to have deserted in 2009 with many troops hiding in the heat of battle rather than engaging the enemy. Following the fall of Kabul in August 2021, the remaining forces of the ANA either deserted their posts or surrendered to the Taliban.

===Canada===
During World War I, the Canadian Expeditionary Force passed over 200 death sentences on deserters. Only 25 men were actually executed. 

Per the National Defence Act, &quot;every person who deserts or attempts to desert is guilty of an offence and on conviction, if the person committed the offence on active service or under orders for active service, is liable to imprisonment for life or to less punishment and, in any other case, is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to less punishment&quot;.

===Colombia===
In Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Spanish: FARC) insurgency were highly affected by desertion during the armed conflict with the Military Forces of Colombia. The Colombian Ministry of Defense reported 19,504 deserters from the FARC between August 2002 and their collective demobilization in 2017, despite potentially severe punishment, including execution, for attempted desertion in the FARC. Organizational decline contributed to FARC&#x27;s high desertion rate which peaked in the year 2008. A later stalemate between the FARC and government forces gave rise to the Colombian peace process.

===France===

Many individuals who were conscripted by the French First Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars deserted. There were rough estimates to the number of individuals that deserted during the time of the &quot;Levée en masse&quot;, but due to many factors, like the inability to manage and keep track of all the armies or differentiating between men with similar names, the exact number is unclear. In 1800, the Minister of War (Carnot) reported that there were 175,000 deserters based on the number of individuals that sought the benefits following the amnesty put in place. 

From 1914 to 1918 between 600 and 650 French soldiers were executed for desertion. In 2013, a report for the French Ministry of Veteran Affairs recommended that they be pardoned.

Conversely, France considered as highly praiseworthy the act of citizens of Alsace-Lorraine who during WWI deserted from the German army. After the war it was decided to award all such deserters the &quot;Escapees&#x27; Medal&quot; ().

During the First Indochina War (1946–54), the French Foreign Legion was deployed to fight the Vietnamese insurgency. Some of the legionnaires, such as Stefan Kubiak, deserted and began fighting for the Việt Minh and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam upon witnessing torture of Vietnamese peasants at the hands of French troops.

===Germany===

During the First World War, only 18 Germans who deserted were executed. However, the Germans executed 15,000 men who deserted from the Wehrmacht during the Second World War. In June 1988 the Initiative for the Creation of a Memorial to Deserters who deserted the Wehrmacht came to life in Ulm.

===Ireland===

Ireland was neutral during the Second World War; the Irish Army expanded to 40,000 men, but they had little to do once it became clear in 1942 that invasion (either by Nazi Germany or by the British Empire) was unlikely. Soldiers were put to work cutting trees and peat; morale was low and pay was bad. Of the 60,000 men who passed through the army in 1940–45, about 7,000 men deserted, about half of them deciding to fight on the Allied side, most joining the British Army.

Once the war was over, the EPO 362 order meant deserters were allowed to return to Ireland; they were not imprisoned, but lost rights to an army pension and could not work for the state or claim unemployment benefits for seven years. They were also seen as traitors by some Irish people in their homes.

Decades after, the morality of their actions was debated; on the one hand, they had illegally abandoned their country&#x27;s armed forces at a time when it was threatened with invasion — indeed, it was argued that their acts were treasonous at a time when Britain may have been planning to seize control of Ireland&#x27;s ports (see Plan W); on the other hand, they chose to leave a safe if tedious posting in order to risk their lives fighting against fascism, and many were motivated by genuine idealism.

In 2012, the Minister for Justice and Equality Alan Shatter issued a pardon and amnesty to all World War II-era deserters from the Irish Defence Forces.

===Italy===
During World War I, 15,096 Italians served life sentences and around 750 were executed (391 by firing squad) for deserting from the military; the Roman punishment of decimation was claimed to have been used. In 1918, Italy agreed to pardon all deserters, who, after their conscription in their military, joined the United States Army, affecting thousands. In total, about 128,000 desertion cases took place due to the First World War in Italy. In Italy during the Napoleonic Wars, about 40,000 soldiers deserted from the military, with Alessandro Trivulzio [fr] [it], Italy&#x27;s Ministry of War of the Kingdom, describing desertion as a &quot;destructive worm&quot;. To halt desertion, in 1808, the Italian government created the &quot;consigli di guerra speciali&quot;, a group of military courts.

===New Zealand===

During the First World War, 28 New Zealand soldiers were sentenced to death for desertion; of these, five were executed. These soldiers were posthumously pardoned in 2000 through the &quot;Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act&quot;. Those who deserted before reaching the front were imprisoned in what were claimed to be harsh conditions.

===Russia===
During the 2022 Russian mobilization, the Putin-controlled State Duma of Russia adopted amendments to include the concepts of mobilization, martial law and wartime in the Criminal Code, and introduced several articles related to military operations. Desertion during a period of mobilization or wartime will be punished by up to 10 years in jail. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported back to Russia a Russian officer who was trying to avoid the Russo-Ukrainian war.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona reported that military courts have received thousands of AWOL cases since Russia&#x27;s 2022 mobilization. At least 250,000 Russian conscripts have fled to other countries since February 2022. As of 2024, France was the only EU country accepting Russian deserters without a passport and allowing them to apply for asylum.
===Soviet Union===

====Russian Civil War====
In 1919, 616 &quot;hardcore&quot; deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following People&#x27;s Commissar Leon Trotsky&#x27;s draconian measures. According to Figes, &quot;a majority of deserters (most registered as &quot;weak-willed&quot;) were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front&quot;. Even those registered as &quot;malicious&quot; deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate&quot;. Forges also noted that the Red Army instituted amnesty weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters to the army.

====World War II====
Order No. 270, dated 16 August 1941, was issued by Joseph Stalin. The order required superiors to shoot deserters on the spot. Their family members were subjected to arrest. Order No. 227, dated 28 July 1942, directed that each Army must create &quot;blocking detachments&quot; (barrier troops) which would shoot &quot;cowards&quot; and fleeing panicked troops at the rear. Over the course of the war, the Soviets executed 158,000 troops for desertion.

====Soviet–Afghan War====
Many Soviet soldier deserters of the Soviet–Afghan War explain their reasons for desertion as political and in response to internal disorganization and disillusionment regarding their position in the war. Analyses of desertion rates argue that motivations were far less ideological than individual accounts claim. Desertion rates increased prior to announcements of upcoming operations, and were highest during the summer and winter. Seasonal desertions were probably a response to the harsh weather conditions of the winter and immense field work required in the summer. A significant jump in desertion in 1989 when the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan may suggest a higher concern regarding returning home, rather than an overall opposition towards the war itself.

=====Inter-ethnic explanation for desertion=====
In the beginning of the Soviet invasion, the majority of Soviet forces were soldiers of Central Asian republics. The Soviets believed that shared ideologies between Muslim Central Asians and Afghan soldiers would build trust and morale within the army. However, Central Asians&#x27; longstanding historical frustrations with Moscow degraded soldiers&#x27; willingness to fight for the Red Army. As Afghan desertion grew and Soviet opposition was strengthened within Afghanistan, the Soviet plan overtly backfired.

The personal histories of Central Asian ethnic groups – especially between Pashtuns, Uzbeks, and Tajiks, caused tension within the Soviet military. Non-Russian ethnic groups easily related the situation in Afghanistan to Communist takeover of their own states&#x27; forced induction into the USSR. Ethnic Russians suspected Central Asians of opposition, and fighting within the army was prevalent.

Upon entering Afghanistan, many Central Asians were exposed to the Qur’an for the first time uninfluenced by Soviet propagandist versions, and felt a stronger connection towards the opposition than their own comrades. The highest rates of desertion were found among border troops, ranging from 60 to 80% during the first year of the Soviet invasion. In these areas, strong ethnic clashes and cultural factors influenced desertion.

As Afghan soldiers continued to desert the Soviet army, a united Islamic Alliance for the Liberation of Afghanistan began to form. Moderates and fundamentalists banded together to oppose Soviet intervention. The Islamic ideology solidified a strong base of opposition by January 1980, overriding ethnic, tribal, geographic and economic differences among Afghans willing to fight the Soviet invasion, which attracted Central Asian deserters. By March 1980, the Soviet army made an executive decision to replace Central Asian troops with the European sectors of the USSR to avoid further religious and ethnic complications, drastically reducing Soviet forces.

=====Soviet disillusionment upon entering the war=====
Soviet soldiers entered the war under the impression that their roles were primarily related to the organization of Afghan forces and society. Soviet media portrayed the Soviet intervention as a necessary means of protecting the Communist uprising from outside opposition. Propaganda declared that Soviets were providing aid to villagers and improving Afghanistan by planting trees, improving public buildings and &quot;generally acting as good neighbors&quot;. Upon entering Afghanistan, Soviet soldiers became immediately aware of the falsity of the reported situation.

In major cities, Afghan youth that originally supported the leftist movement soon turned to Soviet oppositional forces for patriotic and religious reasons. The opposition built resistance in cities, calling Soviet soldiers infidels that were forcing an imperialist Communist invasive government on Afghanistan&#x27;s people. As Afghan troops continued to abandon the Soviet army to support the mujahideen, they became anti-Russian and antigovernment. Opposition forces emphasized the Soviets&#x27; atheism, demanding support for the Muslim faith from civilians. The hostility shown towards soldiers, who entered the war believing their assistance was requested, grew defensive. The opposition circulated pamphlets within Soviet camps stationed in cities, calling for Afghan freedom from the aggressive Communist influence and a right to establish their own government.

The native Afghan army fell from 90,000 to 30,000 by mid-1980, forcing Soviets into more extreme combative positions. The mujahideen&#x27;s widespread presence among Afghan civilians in rural regions made it difficult for Soviet soldiers to distinguish between the civilians they believed they were fighting for and the official opposition. Soldiers who had entered the war with idealistic viewpoints of their roles were quickly disillusioned.

=====Problems in Soviet army structure and living standards=====
The structure of the Soviet army, in comparison to the mujahideen, set the Soviets at a serious fighting disadvantage. While the mujahideen structure was based on kinship and social cohesion, the Soviet army was bureaucratic. Because of this, mujahideen could significantly weaken the Soviet army by the elimination of a field commander or officer. Resistance forces were locally based, more ready to address and mobilize the Afghan population for support. The Soviet army was centrally organized; its regime structure emphasized rank and position, paying less attention to the well-being and effectiveness of its army.

The initial Soviet plan relied on Afghan troops&#x27; support in the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. The majority of the Afghan army support crumbled easily as forces lacked strong ideological support for Communism from the beginning.

The Afghan army, comprising 100,000 men before 1978, was reduced to 15,000 within the first year of the Soviet invasion. Of the Afghan troops that remained, many were considered untrustworthy to Soviet troops. Afghans that deserted often took artillery with them, supplying the mujahideen. Soviet troops, to fill Afghan soldiers&#x27; place, were pushed into mountainous tribal regions of the East. Soviet tanks and modern warfare were ineffective in the rural, mountainous regions of Afghanistan. Mujahideen tactics of ambush prevented Soviets from developing successful counterattacks.

In 1980, the Soviet army began to rely on smaller and more cohesive units, a response to mirror mujahideen tactics. A decrease in unit size, while solving organizational issues, promoted field leaders to head more violent and aggressive missions, promoting Soviet desertion. Often, small forces would engage in rapes, looting, and general violence beyond what higher ranks ordered, increasing negative sanctions in undesirable locations.

Within the Soviet army, serious drug and alcohol problems significantly reduced the effectiveness of soldiers. Resources became further depleted as soldiers pushed into the mountains; drugs were rampantly abused and available, often supplied by Afghans. Supplies of heating fuel, wood, and food ran low at bases. Soviet soldiers often resorted to trading weapons and ammunition in exchange for drugs or food. As morale decreased and infections of hepatitis and typhus spread, soldiers became further disheartened.

=====Soviet deserters to the mujahideen=====
Interviews with Soviet soldier deserters confirm that much of Soviet desertion was in response to widespread Afghan opposition rather than personal aggravation towards the Soviet army. Armed with modern artillery against ill-equipped villagers, Soviet soldiers developed a sense of guilt for the widespread killing of innocent civilians and their unfair artillery advantage. Soviet deserters found support and acceptance within Afghan villages. After entering the mujahideen, many deserters came to recognize the falsity of Soviet propaganda from the beginning. Unable to legitimize the unnecessary killing and mistreatment of the Afghan people, many deserters could not face returning home and justifying their own actions and the unnecessary deaths of comrades. Upon deserting to the mujahideen, soldiers immersed themselves into Afghan culture. Hoping to rectify their position as the enemy, deserters learned the Afghan language and converted to Islam.

The criminal code of Ukraine states that &quot;desertion in state of martial law or in a battle, shall be punishable by imprisonment for a term of 5 to 10 years&quot;. In early 2023, a new law was signed into the Ukrainian Parliament which stated that desertion or &quot;failure to appear for duty without a valid reason&quot; would result in up to 12 years in prison. Critics of the law argued that the law punishes soldiers more harshly rather than try to deal underlying causes of desertion. Per the Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor General, more than 60,000 criminal cases have been opened for desertion with almost half occurring between January 2024 and September 2024. This number rose to 80,000 by October 2024 and 100,000 by the end of November 2024. It is estimated that the number of deserters residing in the country could be as high as 200,000. Tens of thousands have also attempted to flee the country with 21,113 being caught by August 2023. According to The Wall Street Journal, over 44,000 male Ukrainian deserters have successfully fled since the beginning of the war to Romania, Moldova, and Slovakia. This figure does not include those who fled to any other countries, or those who left Ukraine with papers obtained through bribery. For Ukrainian penal battalions, if a soldier of a penal battalion attempts to desert or retreat without authorisation, an additional 5 to 10 years would be added to their sentence.

===United Kingdom===
Historically, one who was paid to enlist and then deserted could be arrested under a type of writ known as &quot;arrestando ipsum qui pecuniam recepit&quot;, or &quot;for arresting one who received money&quot;.

====Napoleonic Wars====
During the Napoleonic Wars desertion was a massive drain on British army resources, despite the threat of court martial and the possibility of capital punishment for the crime. Many deserters were harboured by citizens who were sympathetic to them.

====First World War====
&quot;306 British and Commonwealth soldiers were executed for...desertion during World War I,&quot; records the Shot at Dawn Memorial. Of these, 25 were Canadian, 22 Irishmen and five New Zealanders.

&quot;During the period between August 1914 and March 1920 more than 20,000 servicemen were convicted by courts-martial of offences which carried the death sentence. Only 3,000 of those men were ordered to be put to death and of those just over 10% were executed.&quot;

====Second World War====
Throughout the Second World War, almost 100,000 British and Commonwealth troops went absent without leave (AWOL) or deserted from the armed forces. Capital punishment for desertion was abolished in 1930 so most were imprisoned.

====Iraq War====
On 28 May 2006, the UK military reported over 1,000 absent without leave since the beginning of the Iraq War, with 566 missing from 2005 and that part of 2006. The Ministry of Defence said that levels of absence were fairly constant and &quot;only one person has been found guilty of deserting the Army since 1989&quot;.

===United States===

====Legal definition====

According to the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice, desertion is defined as: 
====War of 1812====
The desertion rate for American soldiers in the War of 1812 was 12.7%, according to available service records. Desertion was especially common in 1814, when enlistment bonuses were increased from $16 to $124, inducing many men to desert one unit and enlist in another to get two bonuses.

====Mexican–American War====
During the Mexican–American War, the desertion rate in the U.S. Army was 8.3% (9,200 out of 111,000), compared to 12.7% during the War of 1812 and usual peacetime rates of about 14.8% per year. Many men deserted in order to join another U.S. unit and get a second enlistment bonus. Others deserted because of the miserable conditions in camp, or in 1849–1850 were using the army to get free transportation to California, where they deserted to join the California Gold Rush. Several hundred deserters went over to the Mexican side; nearly all were recent immigrants from Europe with weak ties to the United States. The most famous group was the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, about half of whom were Catholics from Ireland, anti-Catholic prejudice reportedly being another reason for desertion. The Mexicans issued broadsides and leaflets enticing U.S. soldiers with promises of money, land grants, and officers&#x27; commissions. Mexican guerrillas shadowed the U.S. Army, and captured men who took unauthorized leave or fell out of the ranks. The guerrillas coerced these men to join the Mexican ranks—threatening to kill them if they failed to comply. The generous promises proved illusory for most deserters, who risked execution if captured by U.S. forces. About fifty of the San Patricios were tried and hanged following their capture at Churubusco in August 1847.

High desertion rates were a major problem for the Mexican army, depleting forces on the eve of battle. Most of the soldiers were peasants who had a loyalty to their village and family but not to the generals who conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, never well paid, under-equipped and only partially trained, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the Americans. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.

====American Civil War ====

During the American Civil War, both the Union and Confederacy had a desertion problem. From its 2.5 million or so men, the Union Army saw about 200,000 desertions. Over 100,000 deserted the Confederate army, which was less than a million men and possibly as little as a third the size of the Union Army.

New York suffered 44,913 desertions by the war&#x27;s end, and Pennsylvania recorded 24,050, with Ohio reporting desertions at 18,354. About 1 out of 3 deserters returned to their regiments, either voluntarily or after being arrested and being sent back. Many of the desertions were by &quot;professional&quot; bounty men, men who would enlist to collect the often large cash bonuses and then desert at the earliest opportunity to repeat another enlistment elsewhere. If caught they would face execution; otherwise it could prove a very lucrative criminal enterprise.

The total number of Confederate deserters was officially 103,400. Desertion was a major factor for the Confederacy in the last two years of the war. According to Mark A. Weitz, Confederate soldiers fought to defend their families, not a nation. He argues that a hegemonic &quot;planter class&quot; brought Georgia into the war with &quot;little support from non-slaveholders&quot; (p. 12), and the ambivalence of non-slaveholders toward secession, he maintains, was the key to understanding desertion. The privations of the home front and camp life, combined with the terror of battle, undermined the weak attachment of southern soldiers to the Confederacy. For Georgian troops, Sherman&#x27;s march through their home counties triggered the most desertions.
Adoption of a localist identity caused soldiers to desert as well. When soldiers implemented a local identity, they neglected to think of themselves as Southerners fighting a Southern cause. When they replaced their Southern identity with their previous local identity, they lost their motive to fight and, therefore, deserted the army.

A growing threat to the solidarity of the Confederacy was dissatisfaction in the Appalachian mountain districts caused by lingering unionism and a distrust of the slave power. Many of their soldiers deserted, returned home, and formed a military force that fought off regular army units trying to punish them. North Carolina lost 23% of its soldiers (24,122) to desertion. The state provided more soldiers per capita than any other Confederate state, and had more deserters as well.

====First World War====

Desertion still occurred among American armed forces after the U.S. joined the First World War on 6 April 1917. Between 6 April 1917, and 31 December 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) charged 5,584 servicemen and convicted 2,657 for desertion. 24 AEF troops were eventually sentenced to death, but all managed to avoid execution after President Woodrow Wilson commuted their death sentences to prison terms. Deserters were often publicly humiliated. One U.S. Navy deserter, Henry Holscher, later joined a UK regiment and won the Military Medal.

====Second World War====
Over 20,000 American soldiers were tried and sentenced for desertion. Forty-nine were sentenced to death, though forty-eight of these death sentences were subsequently commuted. Only one U.S. soldier, Private Eddie Slovik, was executed for desertion in World War II.

====Vietnam War====
According to the Department of Defense, 503,926 United States servicemen deserted during the Vietnam War between 1 July 1966 to 31 December 1973. Some of these migrated to Canada. Among those who deserted to Canada were Andy Barrie, host of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio&#x27;s Metro Morning, and Jack Todd, sports columnist for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;. Other countries also gave asylum to deserted U.S. soldiers. For example, Sweden allows asylum for foreign soldiers deserting from war, if the war does not align with the current goals of Swedish foreign policy.

====Iraq War====
According to the Pentagon, more than 5,500 military personnel deserted in 2003–2004, following the Iraq invasion and occupation. The number had reached about 8,000 by the first quarter of 2006. Almost all of these soldiers deserted within the United States. There has been only one reported case of a desertion in Iraq. The Army, Navy, and Air Force reported 7,978 desertions in 2001, compared with 3,456 in 2005. The Marine Corps showed 1,603 Marines in desertion status in 2001. That had declined to 148 by 2005.

====Penalties====
Before the Civil War, deserters from the Army were flogged; after 1861, tattoos or branding were also used. The maximum U.S. penalty for desertion in wartime remains death, but this punishment was last applied to Eddie Slovik in 1945. No U.S. serviceman has received more than 24 months imprisonment for desertion or missing movement after September 11, 2001.

A U.S. service member who is AWOL/UA may be punished with non-judicial punishment (NJP) or by court martial under Article 86 of the UCMJ for repeat or more severe offenses. Many AWOL/UA service members are also given a discharge in lieu of court-martial.

The 2012 edition of the United States Manual for Courts-Martial states that:

==Legal status of desertion in cases of war crime==
Under international law, ultimate &quot;duty&quot; or &quot;responsibility&quot; is not necessarily always to a &quot;government&quot; nor to &quot;a superior&quot;, as seen in the fourth of the Nuremberg Principles, which states:

Although a soldier under direct orders, in battle, is normally not subject to prosecution for war crimes, there is legal language supporting a soldier&#x27;s refusal to commit such crimes, in military contexts outside of immediate peril.

In 1998, UNCHR resolution 1998/77 recognized that &quot;persons [already] performing military service may &quot;develop&quot; conscientious objections&quot; while performing military service. This opens the possibility of desertion as a response to cases in which the soldier is required to perform crimes against humanity as part of his mandatory military duty.

The principle was tested unsuccessfully in the case of U.S. Army deserter Jeremy Hinzman, which resulted in a Canadian federal immigration board rejecting refugee status to a deserter invoking Nuremberg Article IV.

<text>Baron de Saumarez, on the Island of Guernsey, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 15 September 1831 for the prominent naval commander Admiral Sir James Saumarez, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a Baronet, of Guernsey, on 13 June 1801. Lord de Saumarez was succeeded by his eldest son James, the second Baron, a clergyman. James was succeeded by his younger brother, John, the third Baron, whose son, the fourth Baron, was a career diplomat who bought the family estate at Castel, Guernsey, from his father, the third Baron, who wished to sell it. However, by marrying an heiress, the fourth Baron also brought estates in Suffolk into the family.

The family seat was at Castel in Guernsey from the time of the first baron until the fourth Baron died there in 1937. After the German occupation of the Channel Islands during the Second World War, the later barons lived mostly at their Shrubland Park estate, near Ipswich, in Suffolk. the titles are held by the fourth Baron&#x27;s great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father the sixth Baron in 1991. Although born and brought up in Suffolk, in April 2006, after the death of his mother, the present Lord de Saumarez sold Shrubland Park and settled in Guernsey.

Not be confused with Saumarez Park at Castel, the Sausmarez Manor estate at Saint Martin in Guernsey belongs to the senior line of the Sausmarez family, from which the Barons de Saumarez are descended. Matthew de Sausmarez (1718–1778), father of the first baron, was a younger brother of John de Sausmarez (1706–1774), of Sausmarez Manor.

==Barons de Saumarez (1831)==

*James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez (1757–1836)

<text>Middlebury College is a private liberal arts college in Middlebury, Vermont, United States. Founded in 1800 by Congregationalists, Middlebury was the first operating college or university in Vermont. 

In the fall of 2024, the college enrolled 2,760 undergraduates from all 50 states and 74 countries and offers 45 majors in the arts and humanities as well as joint engineering programs. In addition to its undergraduate liberal arts program, the school also has graduate schools, the Middlebury College Language Schools, the Bread Loaf School of English, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, as well as its C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad international programs. Middlebury&#x27;s 31 varsity teams are the Middlebury Panthers and compete in the NCAA Division III&#x27;s NESCAC. 

==History==
===19th century===
Middlebury received its founding charter on November 1, 1800, as an outgrowth of the &quot;Addison County Grammar School&quot;, which had been founded three years earlier in 1797. The college&#x27;s first president—Jeremiah Atwater—began classes a few days later, making Middlebury the first operating college or university in Vermont. One student named Aaron Petty graduated at the first commencement held in August 1802. The college&#x27;s founding religious affiliation was loosely Congregationalist. Yet the idea for a college was that of town fathers rather than clergymen, and Middlebury was clearly &quot;the Town&#x27;s College&quot; rather than the Church&#x27;s. Chief among its founders were Seth Storrs and Gamaliel Painter, the former credited with the idea for a college and the latter as its greatest early benefactor. In addition to receiving a diploma upon graduation, Middlebury graduates also receive a replica of Gamaliel Painter&#x27;s cane. Painter bequeathed his original cane to the college and it is carried by the college President at official occasions including first-year convocation and graduation. Alexander Twilight, class of 1823, was the first black graduate of any college or university in the United States; he also became the first African American elected to public office, joining the Vermont House of Representatives in 1836. At its second commencement in 1804, Middlebury granted Lemuel Haynes an honorary master&#x27;s degree, the first advanced degree ever bestowed upon an African American.

In 1883, the trustees voted to accept women as students in the college, making Middlebury one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution. The first female graduate—May Belle Chellis—received her degree in 1886. As valedictorian of the class of 1899, Mary Annette Anderson became the first African-American woman elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

===20th century===
The college&#x27;s centennial in 1900 began a century of physical expansion beyond the three buildings of Old Stone Row. York and Sawyer designed the Egbert Starr Library (1900), a Beaux-Arts edifice later expanded and renamed the Axinn Center, and Warner Hall (1901). Growth in enrollment and the endowment led to continued expansion westward. McCullough Hall (1912) and Voter Hall (1913) featured gymnasium and laboratories, respectively, adopting Georgian Revival styling while confirming the campus standard of grey Vermont limestone, granite, and marble.
In 1914 and subsequent decades, Middlebury College offered courses in eugenics in fields such as pedagogy, biology, and sociology. The college had &quot;extensive involvement in the eugenics movement.&quot; The year-long, mandatory &quot;Orientating Course for Freshmen&quot; in 1925 included the subject &quot;Eugenics&quot; and explained that in the previous year this had been taught in this class as &quot;What Has Civilization to Expect from Eugenics.&quot; The 1930 &quot;Fourth Annual Report of the Eugenics Survey of Vermont&quot; noted that Middlebury College President Paul Moody was Chairman of the Committee that supervised the &quot;Survey&quot;. Middlebury biology supervisor, professor A.E. Lambert lectured outside the college on the &quot;Science of Modern Welfare,&quot; based on &quot;heredity and eugenics.&quot; Middlebury biology professor Owen Wesley Mills was a member of the Second International Congress of Eugenics.

The national fraternity Kappa Delta Rho was founded in Painter Hall on May 17, 1905. Middlebury College abolished fraternities in the early 1990s, but the organization continued on campus in the less ritualized form of a social house. Due to a policy at the school against single-sex organizations, the house was forced to coeducate during the same period as well. The German Language School, founded in 1915 under the supervision of then-President John Martin Thomas, began the tradition of the Middlebury College Language Schools. These Schools, which take place on campus during the summer, enroll about 1,350 students in the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish Language Schools.

Middlebury President Paul Dwight Moody began the American tradition of a National Christmas Tree in 1923 when the college donated a 48-foot balsam fir for use at the White House. The tree was illuminated when Vermont native Calvin Coolidge flipped an electric switch in the first year of his presidency. The Bread Loaf School of English, Middlebury&#x27;s graduate school of English, was established at the college&#x27;s Bread Loaf Mountain campus in 1920. The Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference was established in 1926. In 1978, the Bread Loaf School of English expanded to include a campus at Lincoln College, Oxford University. In 1991, the School expanded to include a campus at St. John&#x27;s College in New Mexico, and to the University of North Carolina, Asheville, in 2006. The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad began in 1949 with the school in Paris; they now host students at 38 sites in Argentina, Brazil, China, Cameroon, Chile, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Morocco, Russia, Spain, Uruguay, United Kingdom, and Puerto Rico. The Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies (CMRS) was founded as an educational charity in 1975 by Drs John and Sandy Feneley in Oxford, England, establishing a facility at St. Michael&#x27;s Hall in 1978, including the Feneley Library, and close links with Keble College, Oxford; in 2014, CMRS became part of Middlebury College Schools Abroad as Middlebury-CMRS, offering U.S. undergraduates an Oxford Humanities Research Program and Middlebury Museum Studies in Oxford. In 1965, Middlebury established its Environmental Studies program, creating the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program in the U.S. Nationally affiliated fraternities were abolished in 1990; some chose to become co-educational social houses which continue today.

=== 21st century ===

In May 2004, an anonymous benefactor made a $50 million donation to Middlebury. It is the largest cash gift the school has ever received. The donor asked only that Middlebury name its recently built science building, Bicentennial Hall, after outgoing President John McCardell Jr. As of July 2014, Middlebury&#x27;s endowment stood at approximately $1 billion. 

In 2005, Middlebury signed an affiliation agreement with the Monterey Institute of International Studies, a graduate school in Monterey, California. On June 30, 2010, the Monterey Institute was officially designated as a graduate school of Middlebury College.

In the summer of 2008, Middlebury and the Monterey Institute of International Studies launched a collaborative program to offer summer language immersion programs in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish to middle and high school students through the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy (MMLA). In January 2014, as part of a new brand identity system, Middlebury announced that the Monterey Institute of International Studies would be renamed the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.
On March 2, 2017, political scientist Charles Murray was shouted down by students at a campus event, and prevented from speaking at the McCullough Student Center. Murray had been named a white nationalist by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and has been criticized for a teenaged incident in 1960 where he burned a cross on a hill in his hometown of Newton, Iowa, an act which Murray himself later characterized as &quot;incredibly dumb&quot;. After the protest, Murray&#x27;s talk was moved to Wilson Hall and published online; however, after the talk there was a violent attack by protesters who attempted to obstruct and damage the vehicle of Bill Burger (the Vice President of communications at Middlebury College), Murray, and Middlebury professor Allison Stanger; Stanger was injured in the attack, requiring her hospitalization with a neck injury and concussion. Middlebury President Laurie L. Patton responded after the event, saying the school would respond to the clear violations of college policy by students that occurred. Some students (and faculty) felt that by refusing to allow Murray to speak, and by injuring Stanger, the Middlebury College student community &quot;trod all over the ideas of free speech this country was founded upon&quot;. The school took disciplinary action against 74 students for their involvement in the incident.

In the spring of 2017, the college also faced allegations of racial profiling, after a student was faced with disciplinary action despite evidence that they had not been present at the protest. Middlebury released a statement asserting that such allegations had been investigated that the college had determined that no such racial profiling had taken place. The statement also noted that an investigation had refuted the anonymous allegations against Burger.

==Academics==

Founded in 1800, the college enrolls approximately 2,500 undergraduates from all 50 states and 70 countries. The college offers 40 undergraduate departments and programs. Middlebury was the first institution of higher education in the United States to offer an environmental studies major, establishing the major in 1965. Middlebury College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

The most popular undergraduate majors at Middlebury by number of 2021 graduates were:
::Econometrics &amp; Qualitative Economics (81)
::Computer Science (47)
::Political Science &amp; Government (47)
::Environmental Studies (45)
::Neuroscience (37)

The academic year follows a 4–1–4 schedule of two four-course semesters in the autumn and spring plus what is known as a &quot;Winter Term&quot; session in January. The Winter Term, often called &quot;J-Term&quot; for January Term, allows students to enroll in one intensive course, pursue independent research, or complete an off-campus internship. Winter Term courses are taught by a mix of traditional faculty and special instructors.

===Language schools===
The Middlebury College Language Schools, which began with the establishment of the School of German in 1915, offer intensive instruction in 10 languages during six-, seven-, or eight-week summer sessions. The schools enroll about 1,350 students every summer. The Schools all use an immersion-based approach to language instruction and acquisition. All students in the Language Schools must sign and abide by Middlebury&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Language Pledge&quot;,&quot; a pledge to use their target language exclusively during the duration of their time at the school.

Undergraduate instruction, available to undergraduate students, government employees and individuals from professional backgrounds, is offered in Abenaki, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Korean, and Spanish.

=== Associated programs ===
The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, in Monterey, California became an affiliate of Middlebury following the signing of an affiliation agreement between the two in December 2005. The Institute currently enrolls 790 graduate students in the fields of international relations, international business, language teaching, and translation and interpretation.

The Middlebury College Language Schools offers a Doctor of Modern Languages. Unique to Middlebury, the D.M.L. prepares teacher-scholars in two modern foreign languages, helping them develop as teachers of second-language acquisition, literature, linguistics, and language pedagogy. Middlebury also offers summer language immersion programs in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish to middle and high school students through the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy.

The Bread Loaf School of English is based at the college&#x27;s Bread Loaf Mountain campus in Ripton, just outside Middlebury, in sight of the main ridge of the Green Mountains. The poet Robert Frost is credited as a major influence on the school. Frost &quot;first came to the School on the invitation of Dean Wilfred Davison in 1921. Friend and neighbor to Bread Loaf, (he) returned to the School every summer with but three exceptions for 42 years.&quot; Every summer since 1920, Bread Loaf has offered students from around the United States and the world intensive courses in literature, creative writing, the teaching of writing, and theater. Many prominent faculty and staff have been associated with the college. The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad, operated by Middlebury College in 17 countries across 5 continents, offer overseas academic programs for undergraduates from various U.S. institutions, as well as graduate-level programs for students from Middlebury College&#x27;s Language Schools and the Monterey Institute of International Studies.

The Rohatyn Center for Global Affairs, was founded by Felix Rohatyn &#x27;49, investment banker, former U.S. Ambassador to France, and founder of Rohatyn Associates. Located at the Robert A. Jones &#x27;59 House, the center combines Middlebury&#x27;s strengths in political, linguistic, and cultural studies to offer internationally focused symposia, lectures, and presentations.

The Center for the Comparative Study of Race and Ethnicity engages in interdisciplinary and comparative approaches for understanding formations of race and ethnicity and their effects on human relations. The Center for Social Entrepreneurship encourages students to develop innovative solutions to address society&#x27;s most pressing social problems. Programs on Creativity and Innovation (PCI) is a series of initiatives designed to encourage Middlebury students to explore ideas in nonacademic settings.

==== Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference ====
In addition to the six-week summer program, Middlebury College&#x27;s Bread Loaf campus is also the site of the Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference for established authors, founded in 1926. It was called by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; &quot;the oldest and most prestigious writers&#x27; conference in the country.&quot; The conference is administered by director Michael Collier and assistant director Jennifer Grotz. Many prominent members of society have been associated with the Writers&#x27; Conference.

===Sustainability===
Middlebury has incorporated environmental stewardship into its mission statement.
The college is a signatory to the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment and the Talloires Declaration. Additionally, the college has committed to be carbon neutral by 2016. Middlebury was one of six universities to receive a grade of &quot;A−&quot; from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008, the highest grade awarded.

In 2009, Middlebury opened a state-of-the-art biomass plant on campus that is estimated to cut the college&#x27;s carbon dioxide output by 40 percent and reduce its use of fuel oil by 50 percent.

In 2010, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Middlebury announced the creation of the Sustainable Investments Initiative, a co-mingled fiscal vehicle seeking investments that generate long-term social, environmental, and economic value. The Initiative will seek investments focused on sustainability issues such as clean energy, water, climate science, and green building projects, in an effort to identify businesses positioned to become a part of the worldwide shift to improve energy efficiency, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate climate change.

Also in 2010, Middlebury College and Integrated Energy Solutions, a Vermont developer of farm-based methane energy, agreed to explore a bio-methane gas collection and delivery system that could help Middlebury further reduce its use of fossil fuels. Middlebury has agreed to purchase bio-methane gas from IES over a 10-year period, with the agreement contingent on the college raising money to build storage facilities for the gas on campus and retrofit its current heating plant to burn the new fuel.

Middlebury&#x27;s Winter Carnival is the oldest student-run winter carnival in the country, started in 1923. The Winter Carnival is a weekend-long event and traditionally includes a bonfire and fireworks on the opening night, ski races at the Middlebury College Snow Bowl on Friday and Saturday, and the Winter Ball on Saturday night.

Notable guests include Swiss Olympian Alexia Paganini in 2016 and Jimmy Ma in 2015.

Middlebury offers a mid-year graduation for those students who complete coursework at the end of January. These students are usually &quot;Febs,&quot; students who began their Middlebury careers as February first-years. The mid-year graduation tradition is for all graduating seniors to ski down the Middlebury College Snow Bowl in their caps and gowns to receive their diplomas.

Middlebury Outdoor Programs organizes outdoor orientations for incoming students in September and February. These orientations involve several days of hiking, rock climbing, kayaking, snowshoeing, and other activities in the wilderness around Middlebury.

Following the New Traditions Contest initiated by President Laurie Patton in the spring of 2018, Middlebury held its first Panther Day on October 20, 2018. The new tradition was held during Homecoming Weekend and included a parade of student clubs and organizations, in an effort to build school spirit. A group of student protesters lined the side of the parade route to call attention to the lack of support by the college for survivors of sexual assault.

===&quot;New England Review&quot;===

<text>Baron Denman, of Dovedale in the County of Derby, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1834 for the prominent lawyer, judge and Whig politician Thomas Denman. He served as Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 1832 to 1850. His son, the second Baron, assumed in 1876 by royal licence the additional surname of Aitchison, which was that of his father-in-law. He was succeeded by his grandnephew, the third Baron. He was the grandson of the Hon. Richard Denman, younger son of the first Baron. Lord Denman notably served as Governor-General of Australia from 1911 to 1914. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron. On his death in 1971, the title passed to his first cousin, Sir Charles Denman, 2nd Baronet, of Staffield (see below), who became the fifth holder of the title.

The Denman baronetcy, of Staffield in the County Cumberland, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1945 for the Hon. Richard Denman, younger brother of the third Baron Denman. He had represented Carlisle in the House of Commons as a Liberal from January 1910 until 1918 and Leeds Central as Labour from 1929, and National Labour from 1931 to 1945. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned second Baronet, who succeeded as fifth Baron Denman in 1971. He had unsuccessfully contested Leeds Central in the 1945 general election for the Conservatives. He was succeeded by his son, who succeeded as sixth Baron Denman in 2012.

<doc id="488854" wikidata="Q4862944" url="?curid=488854" title="Baron de Mauley">
<text>Baron de Mauley, of Canford in the County of Dorset, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 23 June 1838 for the Whig politician the Hon. William Ponsonby, who had earlier represented Poole, Knaresborough and Dorset in the House of Commons.

==History==
The 1st Baron de Mauley was the third son of the 3rd Earl of Bessborough, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife Lady Henrietta Spencer, daughter of the 1st Earl Spencer. He married Lady Barbara Ashley-Cooper, the daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 5th Earl of Shaftesbury. She was one of the co-heirs to the ancient barony by writ of Mauley (or Maulay), which superseded the feudal barony the &quot;caput&quot; of which was at Mulgrave Castle, Yorkshire, which barony by writ had become extinct in 1415.

Their son, later the 2nd Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Poole and Dungarvon. He married his first cousin Lady Maria Ponsonby, daughter of the 4th Earl of Bessborough.

Their eldest son, the 3rd Baron, never married, so the barony was inherited by his brother, who became the 4th Baron. He married the Hon. Madeline Hanbury-Tracy, daughter of the 2nd Baron Sudeley. They had two sons, Capt. Gerald Ponsonby, an officer in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers who was killed in the First World War, and Hubert, who became the 5th Baron.

The 5th Baron married Elgiva Margaret Dundas, a great-granddaughter of the 1st Earl of Zetland. They had two sons. The eldest, the 6th Baron, married Helen Alice Douglas, a granddaughter of the 19th Earl of Morton; the marriage was childless. Their second son, Col. Hon. Thomas Ponsonby, an officer of the Wessex Yeomanry who held the offices of Deputy Lieutenant of Gloucestershire and High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, married Maxine Henrietta Thellusson, whose great-great-great-grandfather Charles Thellusson, Member of Parliament for Evesham, was the younger brother of the 1st Baron Rendlesham.

, the title is held by their eldest son, the 7th Baron, who succeeded his uncle in 2002. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a Conservative. He was elected in 2005 and thereby became the first hereditary peer having succeeded to his title after the House of Lords Act of 1999, to have obtained an elective hereditary peers seat in the House of Lords. In July 2018, the Queen appointed the 7th Baron to succeed the 3rd Baron Vestey as Master of the Horse. The appointment took effect on 1 January 2019.

==Baron de Mauley (1838)==

*Gerald John Ponsonby, 6th Baron de Mauley (1921–2002)

The title next falls to Sir Charles Ponsonby, 3rd Baronet (born 1951), a third cousin of the present holder and his brother. He is a great-grandson of the Hon. Edwin Ponsonby, fifth son of the 2nd Baron.

<doc id="488861" wikidata="Q1033978" url="?curid=488861" title="Canvey Island">
<text>Canvey Island is a town, civil parish and reclaimed island in the Thames Estuary, near Southend-on-Sea, in the Castle Point district, in the county of Essex, England. It has an area of and a population of 38,170. It is separated from the mainland of south Essex by a network of creeks. Lying only just above sea level, it is prone to flooding at exceptional tides and has been inhabited since the Roman conquest of Britain.

The island was mainly agricultural land until the 20th century, when it became the fastest-growing seaside resort in Britain between 1911 and 1951. The North Sea flood of 1953 devastated the island, killing 58 islanders and leading to the temporary evacuation of the 13,000 residents. Canvey is consequently protected by modern sea defences comprising of concrete sea walls.

Canvey Island is also notable for its relationship to the petrochemical industry. The island was the site of the first delivery in the world of liquefied natural gas by container ship and later became the subject of an influential assessment on the risks to a population living within the vicinity of petrochemical shipping and storage facilities.

In 2019, the Conservative Party won 76.7% of the vote in the Castle Point constituency, the highest vote share of the Conservatives in the 2019 General Election tied with Boston and Skegness. Canvey Island has been dubbed the &quot;most Tory place in Britain&quot; by &quot;The Economist&quot;. However, the Conservative Party experienced an almost catastrophic decline in their support at the 2024 General Election with a fall of 38.4% fall in their vote share. They held the seat but with a fall of over 23,000 in their majority to a majority of only 3,251.

==History==

===Roman===

Excavations on Canvey have unearthed a collection of early man-made objects comprising axes from the Neolithic era, a bracelet dating from the Bronze Age, and Iron Age pottery. However, the remains of Roman structures and objects suggests the first settlement of Canvey occurred between AD 50 and 250. The remains point to a community existing with a farmstead, a garrison, a burial ground, and the operation of a large salt-making industry (revealed by the existence of several red hills).

The discovery of a Roman road found to terminate across the creek in neighbouring Benfleet suggests a means may have existed to facilitate the salt&#x27;s distribution to Chelmsford and Colchester, and the recovery of rich items of pottery and glassware of a variety only matched elsewhere by excavations of port facilities suggests the Romans may also have exploited Canvey&#x27;s location in the Thames for shipping.

====Counus Island events====
In 1607 the Elizabethan antiquarian William Camden noted in his work &quot;Britannia&quot; (a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland) that Canvey Island (which he called &quot;Island Convennon&quot;) was documented in the 2nd century by the Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy. In his work &quot;Geographia&quot;, Ptolemy mentions a headland in the mouth of the Thames to the east of the Trinovantes region called &quot;Counus Island&quot;. However, the difficulties faced in determining the location of land areas in Ptolemy&#x27;s ancient work have led modern researchers to question the correlation between Ptolemy&#x27;s island and contemporary Canvey. MacBean and Johnson, 18th-century historians, contend that Counus Island would have existed much further out to sea (or may even have been the Isle of Sheppey), so any similarity between the names is mere coincidence. Without any suitable island matching Ptolemy&#x27;s Counus Island, 20th-century historians White and Yearsley posit the documented island to have been lost or reduced to an insignificant sandbank by subsidence and the constant effects of the sea.

=== Saxon and medieval ===
The settlement and agricultural development of Essex by the Saxons from the 5th century saw the introduction of sheep farming, which would dominate the island&#x27;s industry until the 20th century. After the Norman conquest the area of Canvey was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as a sheep-farming pasture under the control of nine parishes across south inland and coastal Essex; some of these parishes were on the adjacent mainland, but others were as far afield as Laindon and Prittlewell. Apart from the meat and wool produced from the sheep, the milk from the ewes was used for cheese-making. The abundance in later centuries would see the cheeses become a commodity taken for sale at the London markets, and at one stage exported via Calais to the continent.

The existence of several place names on modern Canvey using the &quot;wick&quot; suffix (denoting the sheds in which the cheese was made) shows the influence of the early Saxon culture. Historian Ian Yearsley states that the name of the island is derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Caningaege&quot;, meaning &quot;the Island of Cana&#x27;s People&quot;. Developments in the English language yielded the more familiar form &quot;Caneveye&quot; found in manorial records of 1254. The period of transition from Old to Early Middle English often give rise to confusions of orthography, leading, in this instance, to such variant spellings as &quot;Canefe&quot;, &quot;Kaneweye&quot;, &quot;Kaneveye&quot; and &quot;Koneveye&quot;. By the 12th century, Essex and subsequently Canvey were in the possession of Henry de Essex who inherited the land from his grandfather, Swein, son of Robert fitz Wymarch. During the reign of Henry II (1154–1189) the land was confiscated from de Essex and redistributed among the King&#x27;s favoured nobles.

=== Tudor divisions ===

Shown on John Norden&#x27;s 1594 map with the second word &quot;insula&quot; (with the traditional medial &quot;ſ&quot;), facing the &#x27;Isle&#x27; of Grain rather than a Latinised &quot;Sheppey insula&quot; to the southeast, is a close eastern division which is perhaps the part that later almost wholly merged into the present island, with a ditch being the current boundary, having the same far eastern points as the Canvey Point and Leighbeck Point marshes. Two Tree Island to the north is also recognisable, if halved in length.

The third eastern island or mudflat could well be the Counus (i.e. &quot;&quot;) Island, where the Trinovantes, Cantiaci and the Catuvellauni counselled with the Iceni, shortly before staging Boudicca&#x27;s rebellion against the Romans.

If so, Counus occupied an area from the Canvey Point Sand Bank until just before Shoeburyness, the eastern point of the relatively straight estuary stretched the whole length of Southend-on-Sea, giving a reason for the tidal flats along this shore being so shallow .

Cana&#x27;s People were descendants of both Cantiaci and the Catuvellauni. A boundary point, Counus, would then in tribal terms be placed at the southern border of the Trinovantes on the eastern extent of the loose tribes also seen as the Tames (Thames).

===14th century – 17th century===

During Edward II&#x27;s reign (1307–1327) the land was under the possession of John de Apeton and the first attempts were made at managing the effects of the sea with rudimentary defences, but periodical flooding continued to blight the small population of mostly shepherds and their fat-tailed variety of sheep for a further 300 years. William Camden wrote of the island in 1607 that it was so low that it was often quite flooded, except the hills, upon which the sheep had a place of safe refuge. The uniform flatness of Canvey suggests that these hills are likely to be the red hills of the Roman saltmaking industry, or the early makeshift sea defences constructed by some of the landowners around their farms.
In 1622, Sir Henry Appleton (a descendant of John de Apeton) and Canvey&#x27;s other landowners instigated a project to reclaim the land and wall the island from the Thames. The scheme was managed by an acquaintance of Appleton&#x27;s – Joas Croppenburg, a Dutch Haberdasher of Cheapside in London. An agreement reached in 1623 stipulated that in return for inning and recovering the island, the landowners would grant a third of the land as payment for the work.

The presence of the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden, a relation of Croppenburg&#x27;s, in England at the time of the project on a commission to drain the Fens and involved in repairing the seawall at Dagenham, has led to speculation that Vermuyden oversaw the project, but proof appears to be vague; nevertheless, the work was completed by around 300 Dutch workers skilled in the construction of dykes and other sea defences. The engineers successfully reclaimed by walling the island with local chalk, limestone and the heavy clay of the marshes, with the main length along the Thames faced with Kentish ragstone.

A broad drainage ditch was dug inland off the area facing the river while smaller inlets were filled in. Excess water would have collected in the broad ditch and then been discharged into the river by the means of seven sluices (later known as Commissioners Dykes). The completion of the work saw a considerable number of the Dutch engineers take land as payment for their work, and consequently settle on the island.

=== Modern era ===

==== Chapman Lighthouse ====

The Chapman Lighthouse, briefly described in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, was on the coast of Canvey Island. It is believed that the peril of the mudflats below such shallow waters off the Canvey Island coast prompted the Romans to devise some form of beacon as a warning in the area. In 1851 a hexagonal lighthouse was constructed by the engineer James Walker, a consultant lighthouse engineer at Trinity House at the time. This all-iron lighthouse replaced a lightship which had been moored in the area for the preceding four years. The lighthouse was demolished in 1957–1958 because of its poor condition.

==== Bare-knuckle boxing ====

The Lobster Smack Inn saw many bare-knuckle fights in the 1850s. Sometimes the bouts were between local families, the best known being that between champion Ben Caunt and Nat Langham. The fight arose from a family feud and Caunt took Langham to 60 rounds in September 1853. Langham was knocked down 59 times during the bout and because, it is said, of his sportsmanship Caunt agreed to settle their differences with a handshake.

==== Preventive service ====

Historian Philip Benton reported about Canvey Chapel in 1867: &quot;The seats are open and unappropriated, except one, which is set apart for the officer and the men under him of the Preventive Service; there being a station on the island for nine men, an officer and a chief boatman.&quot; The Preventive Men had their own special row of cottages close to the seafront near the old Lobster Smack Inn. That ancient pub was itself described by Charles Dickens in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. So out of the way (and therefore the haunt of smugglers) was the inn behind the sea wall, in the 18th century it was known as &#x27;The World&#x27;s End&#x27;. In the 19th century, the isolation made it an ideal point for the meetings of pugilists. The row of Preventive Men&#x27;s Cottages has survived against the odds. Today they are surrounded by a small housing estate.

==== Canvey-on-sea ====

During the Victorian era Canvey became a very fashionable place to visit, and its air was promoted as having healing properties. This started in 1899, after the Black Monday floods, when an entrepreneur called Frederick Hester bought Leigh Beck Farm, and started what was to be called Southview Park estate. The properties sold very quickly so Frederick bought more plots of land, selling them as dream homes for London&#x27;s Eastenders. Hester wanted to create Canvey as a great seaside resort for Londoners, and so built the first promenade, a pier and a magnificent winter garden and palace, which he planned to cover six miles (but only covered a mile), as well as a monorail system (initially horse-drawn then later electric). Hester marketed Canvey as &quot;Ye Old Dutch Island&quot;, giving many of the new roads Dutch-sounding names and enticing potential buyers with free rail tickets. The project started well with thousands of plots sold, but by 1905 had fallen apart due to materials not being delivered and issues with land ownership with the laying of the monorail. Hester was declared bankrupt and everything was sold off at an auction held at Chimney&#x27;s Farm.

A new seafront was developed in the 1930s, with Canvey Casino – an amusement arcade and park – opening as the first building on what would become Eastern Esplanade. 
Since then further amusements, a cinema, the pioneering Labworth Cafe, the Monico pub and nightclubs such as the Goldmine were built. Canvey Island remained a popular holiday and weekend destination until the cheap foreign package holiday became popular in the 1970s.

==== Second World War ====

During the Second World War the island was a part of the GHQ Line, a line of 11 concrete pillboxes constructed as a part of the defence against the expected German invasion. Only one of the old pillboxes still can be seen, just off Haven Road, with the others believed to have been buried in the sea wall development of the 1970s. Also, concrete barges were used extensively just off the south coast of the island, partly as a sea-barrier and also as a mounting point for anti-aircraft guns. A concrete barge which had been beached on the east end of the island, remaining for many years as a point of interest for visitors and a play area for many generations of the island&#x27;s children, was however not part of these defences and had been brought there by the Island Yacht Club, who have since demolished it as it was considered dangerous.

Along with the Coalhouse Fort at nearby East Tilbury, Thorney Bay on the southern coast of the island was the site of a degaussing station built to monitor the effectiveness of the equipment on board the allied ships passing along the Thames. The structure is the last intact degaussing station on the north side of the river, and was still operating in 1974. Known as the Canvey loop, the building was occupied by the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service and used for monitoring merchant ships. The building has since been re-opened as a museum dubbed the &quot;Bay Museum&quot; and has First World War exhibits on the ground floor and Second World War exhibits on the first floor.

An anti-aircraft battery was located at Little Gypps, called &quot;TN7 Furtherwick&quot; with had six gun emplacements. The site, known as the Gunny by locals, was designated a scheduled monument in January 2001.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission records four civilian residents of Canvey Island Urban District died as a result of enemy action during the war.

==== Floods of 1953 ====
On 1 February 1953, the infamous North Sea Flood hit the island during the night and caused the deaths of 58 people. Many of the victims were in the holiday bungalows of the eastern Newlands estate and perished as the water reached ceiling level.

The small village area of the island is approximately two feet (60 cm) above sea level and consequently escaped the effects of the flood. This included the Red Cow pub, which was later renamed the King Canute in reference to the legend of the 11th-century Danish king of England commanding the tide to halt with the sea lapping at his feet. The King Canute pub was closed in May 2014. In 2016 a scheme to convert the building into retail space and apartments was proposed.

After the flooding of 1953, a new seawall was built, which was then replaced with a significantly larger construction in the 1970s and 1980s, which was formerly opened by Princess Margaret in April 1984.

==== Petrochemical industry ====
The southern area of the Canvey Island West ward at Hole Haven has predominantly existed as petrochemical site since the first construction of an oil terminal there in 1936. In 1959, as part of a pioneering Anglo-American project designed to assess the viability of transporting liquefied natural gas overseas, a gas terminal with two 1000-tonne storage tanks was constructed at the site alongside the oil terminal. The gas terminal built by the British Gas Council was designed to store and distribute imported gas to the whole of Britain via the facilities at Thames Haven and the local refinery at Shellhaven in Coryton. The first delivery of 2,020 tonnes arrived on 20 February 1959 from Lake Charles, Louisiana, by a specially modified liberty ship &quot;Normarti&quot; renamed the &quot;Methane Pioneer&quot;. The success of seven further deliveries over the following 14 months established the international industry for transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by sea, but the discovery of oil and gas in North Sea limited further British development. Canvey continued to receive 50 shipments of LNG per year from Arzew Algeria in the &quot;Methane Princess&quot; and the &quot;Methane Progress&quot;, until about 1982, British Gas closed the site in 1994.

In 1964 the Italian company Agip Ltd were given an industrial development certificate to build a £15 million oil refinery in the north west of the island. The refinery was never built.
In 1972 Occidental Petroleum began construction of an oil refinery. Access roads, about 20 oil-storage tanks, a river jetty and a concrete chimney were constructed, but work was halted in 1975 pending a major design study review following the oil crisis of 1973–4 and OPEC&#x27;s increase of oil prices.

On 28 March 1973 planning permission was granted to United Refineries Ltd to develop a site to the north of the Occidental refinery site for the construction of another oil refinery. An exploratory public inquiry was held in February/March 1975 into the possible revocation of the planning permission for the United Refineries development. The report of 30 April 1975 recommended revocation and further expert evaluation of the totality of risks facing people who lived in and around Canvey. In March 1976 the Secretaries of State for the Environment and Employment asked the Health and Safety Commission to investigate the risks to health and safety of various installations on Canvey and the neighbouring part of Thurrock. The Commission invited the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to carry out an investigation.

From the &quot;Canvey Report&quot; (1978) the following hazardous installations were identified:
In 1978 the HSE concluded that the residents of the island faced a risk more than five times higher than those in neighbouring South Benfleet. 

On 27 July 1978 Castle Point District Council asked the Secretary of State &quot;to revoke the planning permission granted to United Refineries Ltd in accordance with his Inspector&#x27;s recommendation at the exploratory inquiry in 1975&quot;.

The issue of risk was again highlighted in an attack by the IRA in January 1979 on a storage tank at the island&#x27;s Texaco oil terminal. A bomb was detonated at a tank containing aviation fuel, but failed to ignite with the fuel escaping into a safety moat. The Occidental site was abandoned in 1975 leaving a half-built oil refinery, storage tanks, and an unused mile-long jetty that cost around £10 million of the approximate total of £60 million spent on the project. However, in the following years the disused and undisturbed site flourished as a haven for wildlife, and in 2003, the final storage tanks were removed in a clean-up operation, and the site was renamed as Canvey Wick and opened as a nature reserve.

In September 1997, the celebrity steeplejack Fred Dibnah was hired by Safeway supermarkets to demolish the unused concrete chimney that was part of the abandoned oil refinery. Safeway had planned for the 2,500-ton chimney to be demolished on 18 September in front of a large crowd of invited guests. This would have been the first time Dibnah&#x27;s demolition technique of pit props and fire (without explosives) had been attempted on a concrete chimney and it was also the tallest chimney he had ever attempted to fell. However the chimney unexpectedly collapsed the previous day whilst Dibnah and his team were making the final preparations for the controlled demolition, fortunately without injury. The incident is described in detail in various biographies and by Dibnah himself in his public speaking events afterwards. Dibnah later presented Safeway head office staff with brass paperweights (made from material salvaged from the chimney) stamped &quot;The Great Canvey Island Chimney Disaster 1997&quot;.

===== The sites today =====
Calor Gas Ltd now operate the former British Gas site. The site imports, stores, bottles and exports liquified petroleum gases (LPG), propane and butane. There were plans in 2005–7 to convert the plant back to the import of liquified natural gas (LNG) but the planning application was rejected.

Oikos Storage Limited now operate the former London &amp; Coastal Wharves Ltd. The site offers a bulk liquid storage facility for refined petroleum products.

Neither of the refineries proposed in the 1970s were completed or commissioned. The Occidental site was demolished and the tanks removed, though the former river jetty is still extant, and was nominated for the Design Museum&#x27;s &quot;Lesser Known Architecture&quot; display in 2013.

==Geography==
Canvey Island lies off the south coast of Essex east of London, and west of Southend-on-Sea. The island is separated from the mainland to the north and west by Benfleet, East Haven and Vange creeks, and faces the Thames Estuary to the east and south. Along with neighbouring Two Tree Island, Lower Horse and Upper Horse, Canvey is an alluvial island formed in the Holocene period from silt in the River Thames and material entering the estuary on the tides of the North Sea from the coast of Norfolk. An unsuccessful search for coal beneath the island in 1953 revealed that the alluvium rests upon layers of London Clay, Lower London Tertiaries, Chalk, Lower Greensand and Gault Clay, with the basement rocks at a depth of consisting of hard Old Red Sandstone of Devonian age.

The island is extremely flat, lying below mean high water level and consequently is at risk of flooding. Before reclamation, the surrounding area contained a number of islands separated by tidal creeks. Flood defences have been constructed since the Middle Ages, and the first sea wall to completely surround the island was built as part of the island&#x27;s reclamation in 1622. The island suffered extensive flooding in 1731, 1736, 1791, 1881 and 1897, and substantial loss of life in the North Sea Flood of 1953.

The extensive sea wall, completed in 1982, is long and surrounds 75% of the island&#x27;s perimeter terminating with flood barriers spanning Benfleet Creek to the north and East Haven Creek in the west. The drainage system consists of sewers, culverts, natural and artificial dykes and lakes which feed seven pumping stations and gravity sluices that discharge the water into the Thames and creeks. Four of the discharge sites are &quot;high flow&quot; stations capable of discharging 600 litres of water per second at any tide level. The levels within the system are managed by a further five &quot;low flow&quot; pumping stations. The Environment Agency&#x27;s Thames Estuary 2100 flood defence plan includes Canvey Island as one site for alleviating the flood risks to London and the Thames estuary area. It is proposed that the western side of Canvey is developed as a site which is either temporarily flooded at times of risk, or transformed into a permanent wetland.
Developments in the 20th century have produced a marked contrast between the environments in the east and west of the island. The eastern half of the island is allocated to residential areas, the main public amenities and a small holiday camp and seafront, while the western half of the island is mainly farmland, marshes and industrial areas. The marshes in the west include the 30 hectares known as West Canvey marshes, acquired by the RSPB in 2007, and the Canvey Wick nature reserve. Canvey Wick is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) at the site of the abandoned and incomplete oil refinery. The foundations of the 100-hectare (0.4 sq mile) site were prepared in the 1970s by laying thousands of tonnes of silt dredged from the Thames; the abandoned and undisturbed area has flourished as a haven for around 1,300 species of wildlife, some of which are endangered or were thought to be extinct in the UK, including the Shrill carder bee, the Beewolf wasp and the Bombardier beetle.

It has been said that the site may have one of the highest levels of biodiversity in Western Europe. Other areas of natural interest include the of Canvey Lake Local Nature Reserve owned by Castle Point Borough Council. The lake was used for salt-making during the Roman settlement of the island, and is also thought to have functioned as an oyster bed. At the eastern point of the island is the Canvey Heights Country Park which was reclaimed from the Newlands landfill site that operated there between 1954 and 1989. The park is the highest land on the island and thus has wide views across the creeks and marshes and along the Thames. The environment supports an array of birds including skylarks, dark-bellied brent geese and grey plover.

==Governance==
Canvey Island coalesced into a separate civil parish and ecclesiastical parish in 1881. These with separate remits replaced the 17 divisions of the land split largely into grazing meadowland since the Norman era by the neighbouring parishes of North Benfleet, South Benfleet, Bowers Gifford, Prittlewell, Southchurch, Hadleigh, Laindon, Pitsea and Vange. In 1926, the parish was converted to the Canvey Island Urban District, then dissolved along with the Benfleet Urban District in the Local Government Act 1972 to form the local government district and borough of Castle Point.

Since the 2010 General Election, the Member of Parliament representing the parliamentary constituency of Castle Point has been Rebecca Harris of the Conservative Party.

Canvey holds two seats on Essex County Council.

All four of the UKs emergency services operate on Canvey Island. Essex Police has a small police station located near to an On Call fire station crewed by Essex County Fire and Rescue Service. His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard also have a station located on Charfleets Industrial Estate close to Holehaven Creek. There is also a small localised ambulance station run by East of England Ambulance Service.


Canvey is represented on Castle Point Borough Council by 17 councillors elected from six wards: Canvey Island Central, East, North, South, West and Winter Gardens. Since the 2024 local elections, 15 of the 15 councillors belong to the Canvey Island Independent Party (CIIP) formed in 2003 by ex-Labour deputy Council leader and local resident Dave Blackwell.

===Town Council===

The Canvey Island town council was formed in 2007 after a petition spearheaded by islander Albert Payne, with the signatures of 3,000 islanders, was accepted by the government. , the council has 11 councillors, all of whom are Canvey Island Independent members, and functions with Councillor surgeries and through four committees – Community Relations, Environment and Open Spaces, Planning and Policy and Finance. The surgeries are held at the town council offices, while the committees meet at various venues every fortnight.

Some Canvey Islanders want independence from Castle Point Borough Council.

==Demography==
===Cockney diaspora===
Like much of Essex, the population of Canvey has increased significantly in the last 100 years, with migration from London, especially East London, driving the growth. Government policy and the island&#x27;s former popularity as a holiday resort were important factors. An example of the policy of moving East Londoners to Canvey and elsewhere, was the introduction of council estates for 100 families from the Dagenham and Walthamstow boroughs in 1959. Since the 2011 census, this trend has been renewed with a number of orthodox Jewish families moving to the island from the Stamford Hill neighbourhood of Hackney.

===Statistics===


At the 2001 United Kingdom census, the population of Canvey was 37,479 of which 87.9% of people were living within the five wards of the eastern area of the island at a population density of 38 persons per hectare, while the population density within the west ward – covering a larger area of the island – was 4.6 persons per hectare.

There were 15,312 dwellings on Canvey of which 98.7% were households. 42.4% were occupied by married couples, 13.9% of households contained three or more adults and no children, 26% were one person households and 8.1% were occupied by co-habiting couples. Canvey had a higher proportion at 35.2% of households owning their properties outright compared with the average of 29.2% for England, but had a lower proportion when compared to the average for Castle Point at 39.9%.

There was a higher proportion of female residents than male by 0.03%. The median age of the population was 40 years, and 23% were under 18, while 15% of residents were over 65.

The island has a high proportion of white people compared to national figures; the ethnicity recorded was 98.2% white compared with 91% for England. 0.6% of the population of Canvey were of a mixed ethnic group, while 0.6% were Asian, 0.2% Black and 0.2% Chinese.

4.2% of the population were foreign born, with 1.7% of residents born in another constituent country of the UK. 2.5% of the population were born outside the UK; and 1.2% of residents born outside Europe.

Religion was recorded as 74% Christian, 0.2% Muslim, 0.1% Jewish, 0.1% Hindu, while 16% of islanders had no religion.

The proportion of unemployed persons on Canvey was lower at 2.2% than for Castle Point at 2.4%, and England at 3.3%.

== Retail, leisure and industry ==
Canvey Island has several shopping areas. The main town centre known by older locals as the Haystack (after the pub in the town centre) is based around Furtherwick Road and the High Street. Most shops are located either in the Knightswick Centre (opened 1978) and Furtherwick Road with the lead store being Sainsbury&#x27;s (formerly Key Markets). The other main store on Canvey is Morrisons which is located on Northwick Road, some way from the town centre. There are small shopping parades in St Michael&#x27;s Road, The village on Long Road, Jones Corner on Long Road, Third Avenue, Point Road and dotted along the High Street. Castle Point Council are currently planning a £50m regeneration scheme for the town centre including building a larger Sainsbury&#x27;s on the current Knightswick Car Park (with parking on the roof) and better connection to the town centre and the lake.

Canvey currently has a small multi screen cinema located on the seafront called Movi-Starr (opened late 1990s) which replaced the former Rio Cinema which closed in the 1970s and was replaced by Rio Bingo Hall (Furtherwick Road). There are several arcades along this stretch of the seafront, along with a small amusement park and the Monico public house. The island had previously been known for its nightlife with both the Goldmine (hosted big name DJs including Emperor Rosko and Chris Hill) and King&#x27;s Nightclubs (acts included comedian Mike Read) being well known hot spots but these closed in the 1980s and 1990s respectively.

Canvey&#x27;s industry is primarily based in two locations. The main location is Charfleet Industrial Estate, while there is further industrial buildings in Point Road. Canvey Island was home to Prout&#x27;s Catamarans from 1949 to 2002. Canvey is also home to a Calor Gas Storage Terminal, and an Oikos Oil depot located off Thames Road and Holehaven Road.

Additionally private developers have announced a new retail park to be built next to the Morrisons supermarket at Roscommon Way on Canvey Island which was due to open in 2018. A Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s opened next to Morrisons in 2019 and was later accompanied by a Costa Coffee, Sports Direct, and B&amp;M Bargains Store later followed by a Food Warehouse taking over two of the last remaining units.

==Landmarks==

The &quot;Lobster Smack&quot; public house at the southwest corner of the island is a grade II listed building dated to the 17th century. The pub was known to Charles Dickens who mentioned it in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Alongside the pub is a row of wooden Coastguard cottages that date from the late 19th century which are also of grade II listed status.

Landmarks from the era of Canvey&#x27;s development as a seaside resort in the 20th century include the International style Labworth Café built 1932–33 and designed by Ove Arup. The building fell into a state of disrepair in the 1970s and 1980s but was renovated in 1996 and now functions as both a beach bistro and restaurant.

Opened in 1979, the Heritage Centre along Canvey Road is housed in the former St. Katherine&#x27;s Church, which was built in 1874. Originally timber-framed, the church was rendered over in the 1930s to give it its present appearance; it closed as a place of worship in 1962. It now contains an art and craft centre with a small folk museum.

The island is also home to two Dutch Cottages, one in Haven Road and the other on Canvey Road, which were built during the 17th century by Dutch immigrants working on the sea walls. The cottage at Canvey Road is home to the Dutch Cottage museum.

Some of Canvey&#x27;s lost landmarks include the Goldmine club on Western Esplanade, the original Oysterfleet public house and lighthouse and Cherry Stores.

==Transport==

===Road===
Canvey Island is connected to the mainland in the northwest by two roads with bridges: the A130 (Canvey Way) and the B1014 (Canvey Road). Built in 1972, the A130 crosses East Haven Creek to Bowers Gifford and joins the London-Southend A13 at Sadler&#x27;s Farm Roundabout. The two lanes of the A130 are currently the island&#x27;s primary access route with 25,000 vehicles using the road and bridge per day. The B1014 and Canvey Road Bridge (or Canvey Bridge) crosses Benfleet Creek to South Benfleet, and provides access to the c2c London (Fenchurch Street) to Shoeburyness line via Benfleet railway station.

Canvey Road Bridge was built in 1973, and replaced the island&#x27;s first bridge to the mainland, which dated from 1931. The Colvin Bridge – named after the Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Brigadier-General R.B. Colvin – operated with a sliding central section that retracted for boats passing along Benfleet Creek. Prior to the Colvin Bridge&#x27;s construction, crossing the creek was achieved by either rowing-boat ferry or by a gravel causeway or stepping-stones at low tides.

====Congestion and the third road====
Since the late 1970s, residents and local politicians have campaigned for the construction of a third access route (or &quot;third road&quot;) to ease the island&#x27;s congestion at rush hour and as a viable means of evacuation from flooding or industrial accidents at the petrochemical facilities. In 2008, the congestion and failure to secure the construction of such a route or significant improvements has had the island at &quot;breaking point&quot; and on the verge of &quot;civil unrest&quot;. Plans for the third access route have included a tunnel to Kent, and road bridges to places such as Leigh-on-Sea and Coryton. Opposition to the route cite the enormous cost, the environmental damage, and the increase of vehicles to districts with already overburdened traffic systems.

The island&#x27;s access congestion was partially addressed by Essex Council in December 2011 with its completion of the £12.1 million Roscommon Way Extension. The road runs from Northwick Road to Haven Road, providing a bypass for small numbers of traffic and adding a new entrance to Charfleet Industrial Estate while also remaining navigable in the case of flooding. 
However, the road did not gain public support, and the extension has become known as &#x27;The Road to Nowhere&#x27;. This road is used by boy racers to do drifting in cars. As such, there are talks about putting speed restrictions in place such as road humps.

=== Bus and rail ===

Bus services have been running on Canvey since 1906. From 1934, the services ran from the island&#x27;s local bus depot at Leigh Beck by the Canvey &amp; District Bus Co, later to be incorporated into the Eastern National Omnibus Company. The depot closed in 1978, but the building re-opened a year later as the &quot;Castle Point Transport Museum&quot;. The museum currently houses a collection of buses, commercial, military and emergency vehicles, and general items related to public road transport. Organised by volunteers, the museum&#x27;s annual show and open days coincide with a classic vehicle cruise that convenes at the car parks of the seafront.

The current bus services on the island are operated by First Essex from the Hadleigh bus depot. First Essex is the main operator providing the island&#x27;s internal services via the town centre, and provides services to places such as Southend, Basildon and Bournes Green. The 21C bus runs from Canvey Seafront to Hadleigh via Essex Way but only runs during offpeak time on weekdays.

Both bus companies provide services to Benfleet railway station, which is located close to Canvey Bridge, just north of the island. The railway station has a taxi rank. Train services are provided by c2c between London Fenchurch Street and Southend Central/Shoeburyness.
==Education==
Canvey Island has two comprehensive schools: the Cornelius Vermuyden School and Castle View School. Both were rebuilt in 2012 as replacements for the island&#x27;s three ageing comprehensives, and as a response to the island&#x27;s decreasing numbers of 11- to 16-year-olds.

Cornelius Vermuyden occupies the same site as its predecessor near Waterside Farm, while Castle View School – within the town centre and centre of the island – has replaced Furtherwick Park School, having previously existed within the island&#x27;s north/central Winter Gardens Ward, overlooked by Hadleigh Castle. Furtherwick Park School shut in 2010, remaining pupils were then moved to Castle View School to finish their education. This site is now the location of Canvey Skills Campus which was built in 2013 and provided vocational education for 14- to 19-year-olds, and adult learning and was run by PROCAT. However, after the merger of South Essex College and PROCAT, the centre was closed and was reopened by USP College in September 2021 as their XTEND digital campus and new home to its digital apprenticeship provider ITEC.

==Culture==

===Folklore===

The island has only been populated since the 17th century when the Dutch including reputedly Cornelius Vermuyden made the marshlands habitable. There are local legends of a Dutchman carrying a sack wandering the northern parts of the island.

Canvey has its own &#x27;lady of the lake&#x27; in the form of a woman who was drowned there many years ago. Though the stories about her are inconsistent, some even saying that it was a man who drowned, the majority speak of a female ghost who has wandered the area since her horse-drawn carriage plummeted into the lake. A recent clean-up of the lake found remains of two horses and fragments of a wooden carriage. 

The story of &#x27;The Black Man&#x27; and &#x27;The White Lady&#x27; is believed to be a mythical tale conjured up by smugglers to stop people wandering onto the &#x27;saltings&#x27; and finding their smuggled goods. It was said that &#x27;The Black Man&#x27; offered a price for your soul, while the &#x27;White Woman&#x27; would tempt you to dance with her. Men often spoke of trying to chase away the figures, only to watch them vanish before their eyes.

Many night fishermen have reported seeing a tall, burly Viking standing on the mudflats at The Point, on the far eastern side of the island. It is believed that he was left behind by his fleet and waited for his ship to return; only to drown in the rising tide.

According to an urban legend, a female farmhand at the now demolished Knightswick Farm watched a nun approach the farm from the fields one afternoon from the porch of the farmhouse. Puzzled as to why the nun had walked across the muddy fields, the girl left the porch and walked towards the nun intending to greet her. Allegedly the nun began to vanish into the ground as she walked.

According to local legend a tunnel used to run from the Lobster Smack to Hadleigh Castle, and was said to be used by smugglers bringing in French wines.

=== Music ===
Canvey Island was an influential destination in the 1970s for artists of the pub rock genre of music such as Graham Parker, Elvis Costello, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Nick Lowe, Paul Andrew Smith Wednesday and The Kursaal Flyers, while also being home to &quot;Canvey Island&#x27;s finest&quot; band Dr. Feelgood. During the 1970s The Goldmine opened in the former Bay Country Club and the name became synonymous with the Brit funk movement with regular DJ Chris Hill. The community hall, The Paddocks, was host to a number of big name gigs during the 1970s including Queen in March 1974, Elvis Costello, Clive Langer and Nick Lowe along with jazz and blues singer George Melly.

The island continues to be a source of inspiration for artists such as British Sea Power who included a song entitled &quot;Canvey Island&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;Do You Like Rock Music?&quot;

Peter Green, founding member of Fleetwood Mac, lived on Canvey after leaving the band.

=== Cultural references ===
Canvey Island is the setting for the British author Nicola Barker&#x27;s 2002 novel&quot; Behindlings&quot;. The island was also the subject of 2006 Turner Prize nominee Rebecca Warren&#x27;s 2003 painted clay sculpture titled &quot;Canvey Island&quot;. Canvey was also home to a Prada fashion shoot in 2014 starring James McAvoy, and featured in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Silent Witness&quot; shown on 2 and 3 February 2015.

==Media==
The area is served by BBC London and ITV London with television signals received from Crystal Palace TV transmitter, BBC South East and ITV Meridian can also be received from Bluebell Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Essex on 95.3 FM, Heart on 96.3 FM and Radio Essex on 105.1 FM.

The local newspapers are &quot;The Evening Echo&quot; and &quot;The Canvey and Benfleet Times&quot;.

==Sport==
Canvey Island has two senior semi-professional football teams in Canvey Island F.C. (founded in 1926) (&#x27;The Gulls&#x27;) and Concord Rangers F.C. (founded in 1967) (&#x27;The Beachboys&#x27;). As of 2023 both teams play in the 7th tier of English football. Despite Canvey Island F.C. having historical successes reaching the National League in 2004 and winning the FA Trophy in 2001, it is Concord Rangers F.C. who are currently more successful, being crowned Essex Senior Cup champions consecutively between 2013 and 2016.

Amateur participation in sport is popular on the island, with sports such as rugby union, cricket, and martial arts represented by clubs and corresponding facilities. The Castle Point Golf Course is situated on Canvey, and the Waterside Farm Sports Centre (refurbished 2013) provides members of Castle Point district with access to a swimming pool, an athletics track, general purpose sports halls, and a full size artificial surface football pitch. It is also the headquarters of Canvey Island Swimming Club, which provides coaching for children ages 4 and upwards from beginners to competitive swimming through to national standard.

Water sports are also popular recreational pursuits. Canvey has two sailing clubs, the Island Yacht Club and the Chapman Sands Sailing Club, with Benfleet Yacht Club and slipway also situated on the island at Benfleet Creek in the north. A region between Thorney bay and Labworth beach is designated by the Port of London Authority as an approved windsurfing area. The Canvey Island Swimming Club provides lessons and training and is based at Waterside Farm Leisure Centre.

The British record for the largest shore-caught angler fish (&quot;Lophius piscatorius&quot;) is from Canvey Island, caught by H. Legerton in 1967. During 1953 and 1954 two unusual fish were washed up the shoreline and are known as Canvey Island Monster.

<text>Baron de Freyne, of Coolavin in the County of Sligo, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1851 for Arthur French, 1st Baron de Freyne, with remainder to his younger brothers John, Charles and Fitzstephen French. He had earlier represented County Roscommon in the House of Commons and later served as Lord Lieutenant of County Roscommon. French had already been created Baron de Freyne, of Artagh in the County of Roscommon, in 1839, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom but with normal remainder to heirs male. Lord de Freyne was childless and on his death in 1856 the barony of 1839 creation became extinct. The barony of 1851 creation survives according to the special remainder by his younger brother John, the second Baron.

On his death, the title passed to another brother, Charles, the third Baron. In 1851 this Charles was married to Catherine Maree, daughter of Luke Maree, by a Catholic priest. Afterwards, a question arose as to the validity of the marriage with her being a Roman Catholic and he a Protestant and they were again married in 1854 in the Church of Ireland. By then they had had three sons, Charles French (MP; 1851–1925) (Member of Parliament for County Roscommon), John French (1853–1916) and William French (1854–1868). However, due to the uncertainty over the first marriage Lord de Freyne was succeeded by his eldest son born after the marriage of 1854, Arthur French, the fourth Baron. His eldest son, the fifth Baron, was killed in action at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in 1915. He was succeeded by his half-brother, the sixth Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the 8th Baron, who succeeded his father in 2009.

The French family is descended from John French, of Frenchpark, County Roscommon, nicknamed &quot;An Tiarna Mór&quot; (the great landowner). He sat in the Irish House of Commons for Carrick, County Galway, and Tulsk. His son, Arthur French, represented County Roscommon in the Irish Parliament. His elder son, John French, was a member of the Irish Parliament for County Roscommon. He was about to be raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Dangar in 1775 but died before the peerage was formally created. His younger brother, Arthur (1728–1799), member of the Irish Parliament for County Roscommon, refused the offer of the peerage originally intended for his brother. His son, Arthur French (d. 1820), was also a member of the Irish House of Commons for County Roscommon. His eldest son was the first Baron de Freyne. Fitzstephen French, youngest brother of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for County Roscommon.

The family seat was French Park, also known as French Park House, on the outskirts of the village of Frenchpark in County Roscommon.

<text>The 100th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1987, to January 3, 1989, during the last two years of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 1980 United States census.

This is the most recent Congress with a Democratic senator from the state of Mississippi, John C. Stennis, who retired at the end of Congress, and a Republican senator from the state of Connecticut, Lowell Weicker, who lost re-election in 1988.

Both chambers had a Democratic majority, with the Democrats increasing their lead in the House, and regaining the Senate for the first time since the 96th Congress from 1979 to 1981.

<text>The Opera Company of Boston was an American opera company located in Boston, Massachusetts, that was active from the late 1950s through the 1980s. The company was founded by American conductor Sarah Caldwell in 1958 under the name Boston Opera Group.

At one time, the touring arm of the company was called Opera New England. Caldwell served as both director and conductor for most of the company&#x27;s productions throughout its more than three decade-long history. Under her leadership, the company presented a repertoire of more than 75 operas that came from a wide array of musical periods and styles, including many works previously unheard in the United States, and a significant number of contemporary operas.

This focus on distinctive repertoire, along with Caldwell&#x27;s innovative stage direction, garnered the group wide acclaim and earned it a place among the leading opera companies in the U.S. In 1990, after 32 seasons, the company was forced to close due to financial difficulties.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1958, Sarah Caldwell and Linda Cabot Black, among others, started the Opera Company of Boston with just $5,000, beginning with a production of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Moon&quot; that was presented on Boston Common with a cast that included Adelaide Bishop as Queen Popotte. Hailed by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; as a masterful production, the company was invited to present the work on the lawn of the White House in a performance attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. On the heels of this success, Caldwell decided to stage a production of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;.

===1958–1979===
At this point the opera company did not have a home theatre. The fifty-year-old Boston Opera House had been in disuse for a long time and was torn down just months before Caldwell founded her company. Caldwell eventually settled on renting the Donnelly Theater for the company&#x27;s performance of &quot;La Boheme&quot;, and that theatre became the company&#x27;s performance venue until it was torn down ten years later in 1968.

After 1968 the company spent the next 7 years looking for a stable performing venue and lived a nomadic existence, performing at various venues including the Shubert Theatre, MIT&#x27;s Kresge Auditorium, the Cyclorama, and the Tufts University Field House. Finally in 1975 the company settled on renting the Orpheum Theatre where it held performances for the next five years.

===1980–1990===
Although the Orpheum Theater was adequate for the company&#x27;s needs, Caldwell dreamed of having her own facility. In 1978 the company bought the B. F. Keith Memorial Theater, a former movie palace, on Washington Street in downtown Boston. The theater was acquired with the help of opera patron Susan Timken, the heiress to a prominent New England company fortune. At the time of its purchase, the theatre was run-down but had a lot of potential, being able to seat 2,500 people and possessing both good acoustics and opulent architecture. However, the stage was only 35 feet deep, and therefore somewhat limiting. Further, a complete renovation of the theatre was impossible, as the company was not able to afford the expense of all the necessary repairs. In spite of these problems, Caldwell pressed ahead and the company moved into their new home in 1980, rechristening the theatre the Boston Opera House. Eventually the cost of upkeep on the building proved to be too much as more and more things began to break down. The company could not afford to maintain the building and sold it after the 1989/1990 season to a Texas developer. Although the company still technically existed for another year, they never produced another opera after this point.

===Legacy===
Throughout its history an impressive roster of singers have performed with the Opera Company of Boston (OCB). Even from the beginning years at the Donnelly, Caldwell was able to attract first rate artists, most notably Beverly Sills and Joan Sutherland, to the company&#x27;s roster. She also had an eye for emerging talent with singers like James Billings getting their start with the company. Other notable singers to have sung in OCB productions include Eunice Alberts, John Alexander, Richard Cassilly, Plácido Domingo, Donald Gramm, Marilyn Horne, Eva Likova, Elaine Malbin, Éva Marton, Sherrill Milnes, Magda Olivero, Renata Tebaldi, Norman Treigle, Shirley Verrett, Anja Silja, and Jon Vickers among many others.

Likewise, a number of notable people have worked on the staff of the company or have served in some other artistic capacity. Ralph Lyford served as the company&#x27;s associate conductor for a number of years and Kent Nagano began his conducting career with the company. Laszlo J. Bonis served as its president (1967–1986), and Dar Williams worked as a stage manager for the company. Also many important designers worked with the company, including Rudolf Heinrich, Ming Cho Lee, Herbert Senn, Helen Pond, Gilbert Vaughn Hemsley, Jr., and David Sharir. Ballet dancer Pat Colgate performed with the company on a number of occasions. Associate Director, Esquire Jauchem went on to found The Boston Repertory Theatre (with Sarah Caldwell&#x27;s assistance) produce, direct and design opera, theater and television.

During its 32-year history, the Opera Company of Boston gained international acclaim for its innovative programming. Under the leadership of Caldwell, the company staged the American premieres of such operas as Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, Hector Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Les Troyens&quot; and &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, Luigi Nono&#x27;s &quot;Intolleranza 1960&quot;, Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot;, Roger Sessions&#x27; &quot;Montezuma&quot;, and Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27;s &quot;Taverner&quot; to name just a few.

<doc id="488876" wikidata="Q4862314" url="?curid=488876" title="Baron Derwent">
<text>Baron Derwent, of Hackness in the North Riding of the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 10 October 1881 for the former Liberal Member of Parliament for Scarborough, Sir Harcourt Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, 3rd Baronet. His grandson, the third Baron (who succeeded his uncle the second Baron), was an author, poet and minor diplomat. On his death in 1949 the titles passed to his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He served in the Conservative administrations of Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home as Minister of State for Trade and Minister of State for Home Affairs. the titles are held by his son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 1986.

The Baronetcy, of Hackness Hall in the North Riding of the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 6 July 1795 for Richard Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, with remainder in default of male issue of his own to the male issue of his brother Charles John. He notably represented Weymouth in the House of Commons. Born Richard Johnstone, he was the son of Colonel John Johnstone, second son of Sir William Johnstone, 2nd Baronet, of Westerhall (see Johnstone baronets of Westerhall). His mother was Charlotte, daughter of John van den Bempde of Hackness Hall in Yorkshire. In 1793 Richard Johnstone assumed by Act of Parliament his maternal grandfather&#x27;s surname of Vanden-Bempde in lieu of Johnstone but in 1795 he was authorised by Royal licence to resume the name of Johnstone in addition to those of Vanden-Bempde. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Yorkshire and Scarborough. On his death the title passed to his son, the aforementioned third Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Derwent in 1881.

The title of the barony, Derwent (pronounced &quot;Darwent&quot;), is named after the River Derwent in Yorkshire.

<doc id="488880" wikidata="Q2322258" url="?curid=488880" title="Measurement and signature intelligence">
<text>Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is a technical branch of intelligence gathering, which serves to detect, track, identify or describe the distinctive characteristics (signatures) of fixed or dynamic target sources. This often includes radar intelligence, acoustic intelligence, nuclear intelligence, and chemical and biological intelligence.
MASINT is defined as scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter or sender, to facilitate the latter&#x27;s measurement and identification.

MASINT specialists themselves struggle with providing simple explanations of their field. One attempt calls it the &quot;CSI&quot; of the intelligence community, in imitation of the television series &quot;&quot;. 

Another possible definition calls it &quot;astronomy except for the direction of view.&quot; The allusion here is to observational astronomy being a set of techniques that do remote sensing looking away from the earth (contrasted with how MASINT employs remote sensing looking toward the earth). Astronomers make observations in multiple electromagnetic spectra, ranging through radio waves, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light, into the X-ray spectrum and beyond. They correlate these multispectral observations and create hybrid, often &quot;false-color&quot; images to give a visual representation of wavelength and energy, but much of their detailed information is more likely a graph of such things as intensity and wavelength versus viewing angle.

== Discipline ==
MASINT may have aspects of intelligence analysis management, since certain aspects of MASINT, such as the analysis of electromagnetic radiation received by signals intelligence, are more of an analysis technique than a collection method. Some MASINT techniques require purpose-built sensors.

MASINT was recognized by the United States Department of Defense as an intelligence discipline in 1986. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that—when collected, processed, and analyzed by dedicated MASINT systems—results in intelligence that detects and classifies targets, and identifies or describes signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources. In addition to MASINT, IMINT and HUMINT can subsequently be used to track or more precisely classify targets identified through the intelligence process. While traditional IMINT and SIGINT are not considered to be MASINT efforts, images and signals from other intelligence-gathering processes can be further examined through the MASINT discipline, such as determining the depth of buried assets in imagery gathered through the IMINT process.

William K. Moore described the discipline: &quot;MASINT looks at every intelligence indicator with new eyes and makes available new indicators as well. It measures and identifies battlespace entities via multiple means that are difficult to spoof and it provides intelligence that confirms the more traditional sources, but is also robust enough to stand with spectrometry to differentiate between paint and foliage, or recognizing radar decoys because the signal lacks unintentional characteristics of the real radar system.
At the same time, it can detect things that other sensors cannot sense, or sometimes it can be the first sensor to recognize a potentially critical datum.&quot;

It can be difficult to draw a line between tactical sensors and strategic MASINT sensors. Indeed, the same sensor may be used tactically or strategically. In a tactical role, a submarine might use acoustic sensors—active and passive sonar—to close in on a target or get away from a pursuer. Those same passive sonars may be used by a submarine, operating stealthily in a foreign harbor, to characterize the signature of a new submarine type.

MASINT and technical intelligence (TECHINT) can overlap. A good distinction is that a technical intelligence analyst often has possession of a piece of enemy equipment, such as an artillery round, which can be evaluated in a laboratory. MASINT, even MASINT materials intelligence, has to infer things about an object that it can only sense remotely. MASINT electro-optical and radar sensors could determine the muzzle velocity of the shell. MASINT chemical and spectroscopic sensors could determine its propellant. The two disciplines are complementary: consider that the technical intelligence analyst may not have the artillery piece to fire the round on a test range, while the MASINT analyst has multispectral recordings of it being used in the field.

As with many intelligence disciplines, it can be a challenge to integrate the technologies into the active services, so they can be used by warfighters.

==Terminology==
In the context of MASINT, measurement relates to the finite metric parameters of targets and signature covers the distinctive features of phenomena, equipment, or objects as they are sensed by the collection instrument(s). The signature is used to recognize the phenomenon (the equipment or object) once its distinctive features are detected.

MASINT measurement searches for differences from known norms, and characterizes the signatures of new phenomena. For example, the first time a new rocket fuel exhaust is measured, it would be a deviation from a norm. When the properties of that exhaust are measured, such as its thermal energy, spectral analysis of its light (i.e., spectrometry), etc., those properties become a new signature in the MASINT database. MASINT has been described as a &quot;non-literal&quot; discipline. It feeds on a target&#x27;s unintended emissive byproducts, or &quot;trails&quot;—the spectral, chemical or RF emissions an object leaves behind. These trails form distinctive signatures, which can be exploited as reliable discriminators to characterize specific events or disclose hidden targets.&quot;

While there are specialized MASINT sensors, much of the MASINT discipline involves analysis of information from other sensors. For example, a sensor may provide information on a radar beam, collected as part of Electronics intelligence (ELINT) gathering mission. Incidental characteristics recorded such as the &quot;spillover&quot; of the main beam (side lobes), or the interference its transmitter produces would come under MASINT.

== National and multinational ==
There has been work on developing standardized MASINT terminology and architecture in NATO. Other work addresses the disappointments of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition. For this function, infrared beacons (infrared MASINT) proved disappointing, but millimeter-wave recognition shows more promise. Still, cooperative, network-based position exchange may be crucial in preventing fratricide. The bottom line is that MASINT cannot identify who is inside a tank or aircraft of interest.

Numerous countries produce their own antisubmarine warfare sensors, such as hydrophones, active sonar, magnetic anomaly detectors, and other hydrographic sensors that are frequently considered too &quot;ordinary&quot; to be called MASINT.

=== China ===
As of 2004, China was reported not to be pursuing the more specialized MASINT technologies, although it does produce its antisubmarine sensors.

=== Germany ===
Following the first successful launch on December 19, 2006, about a year after the intended launch date, further satellites were launched at roughly six-month intervals, and the entire system of this five-satellite SAR Lupe synthetic aperture radar constellation achieved full operational readiness on 22 July 2008.

=== Italy ===
Italy and France are cooperating on the deployment of the dual-use Orfeo civilian and military satellite system.

Orfeo is a dual-use (civilian and military) earth observation satellite network developed jointly between France and Italy. Italy is developing the Cosmo-Skymed X-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar, to fly on two of the satellites.

=== Russia ===
Russia does have nonimaging infrared satellites to detect missile launches. Russia produces a wide range of antisubmarine warfare sensors.

=== United Kingdom ===
UK developed the first successful acoustic system, sound ranging to detect hostile artillery and anti-submarine acoustic detection in World War I. In the 1990s, an improved acoustic system for artillery location acoustic artillery location system was introduced, which complements Counter-battery radar.

=== United States ===
Within the US Intelligence Community the Directorate of MASINT and Technical Collections office of the Defense Intelligence Agency is the central agency for MASINT. This was formerly called the Central MASINT Office. For education and research, there is the Center for MASINT Studies and Research of the Air Force Institute of Technology.

Clearly, the National Reconnaissance Office and National Security Agency work in collecting MASINT, especially with military components. Other intelligence community organizations also have a collection role and possibly an analytic role. In 1962, the Central Intelligence Agency, Deputy Directorate for Research (now the Deputy Directorate for Science and Technology), formally took on ELINT and COMINT responsibilities.

The consolidation of the ELINT program was one of the major goals of the reorganization. ... it is responsible for:
* Research, development, testing, and production of ELINT and COMINT collection equipment for all Agency operations.
* Technical operation and maintenance of CIA deployed non-agent ELINT systems.
* Training and maintenance of agent ELINT equipment
* Technical support to the Third Party Agreements.
* Data reduction of Agency-collected ELINT signals.
* ELINT support peculiar to the penetration problems associated with the Agent&#x27;s reconnaissance program under NRO.
* Maintain a quick reaction capability for ELINT and COMINT equipment.

CIA&#x27;s Office of Research and Development was formed to stimulate research and innovation testing leading to the exploitation of non-agent intelligence collection methods. ... All non-agent technical collection systems will be considered by this office and those appropriate for field deployment will be so deployed. The Agency&#x27;s missile detection system, Project [deleted] based on backscatter radar is an example. This office will also provide integrated systems analysis of all possible collection methods against the Soviet antiballistic missile program is an example.

It is not clear where ELINT would end and MASINT would begin for some of these projects, but the role of both is potentially present. MASINT, in any event, was not formalized as a US-defined intelligence discipline until 1986.

====MASINT from clandestinely placed sensors====
CIA took on a more distinct MASINT responsibility in 1987. The National Security Archive commented, &quot;In 1987, Deputy Director for Science and Technology Evan Hineman established ... a new Office for Special Projects, concerned not with satellites, but with emplaced sensors—sensors that could be placed in a fixed location to collect signals intelligence or measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) about a specific target. Such sensors had been used to monitor Chinese missile tests, Soviet laser activity, military movements, and foreign nuclear programs. The office was established to bring together scientists from the DS&amp;T&#x27;s Office of SIGINT Operations, who designed such systems, with operators from the Directorate of Operations, who were responsible for transporting the devices to their clandestine locations and installing them.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency plays a role in geophysical MASINT.

=== Multinational counterproliferation ===
All nuclear testing, of any level, was forbidden under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) (which has not entered into force), but there is controversy over whether the preparatory commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) or the Treaty Organization itself will be able to detect sufficiently small events. It is possible to gain valuable data from a nuclear test that has an extremely low yield, useless as a weapon but sufficient to test weapons technology. CTBT does not recognize the threshold principle and assumes all tests are detectable.

The CTBTO runs an International Monitoring System (IMS) of MASINT sensors for verification, which include seismic, acoustic, and radionuclide techniques. See National technical means of verification for a discussion of the controversies surrounding the ability of the IMS to detect nuclear tests.

== Military uses ==
Even though today&#x27;s MASINT is often on the edge of technologies, many of them under high security classification, the techniques have a long history. Captains of warships, in the age of sail, used his eyes, and his ears, and sense of touch (a wetted finger raised to the breeze) to measure the characteristics of wind and wave. He used a mental library of signatures to decide what tactical course to follow based on weather. Medieval fortification engineers would put their ear to the ground to obtain acoustic measurements of possible digging to undermine their walls.

Acoustic and optical methods for locating hostile artillery go back to World War I. While these methods were replaced with radar for modern counter-battery fire, there is a resurgence of interest in acoustic gunfire locators against snipers and urban terrorists. Several warfighter application areas are listed below; also see Deeply Buried Structures.

===Non-cooperative target recognition===
MASINT could be of tactical use in &quot;Non-Cooperative Target Recognition&quot; (NCTR) so that, even with the failure of identification friend or foe (IFF) systems, friendly fire incidents could be prevented.

===Unattended ground sensors===
Another strong need where MASINT may help is with unattended ground sensors (UGS). During the Vietnam War, UGS did not provide the functionality desired in the McNamara Line and Operation Igloo White. They have improved considerably, but are still an additional capability for humans on the ground, not usually replacing people altogether.

In the U.S., much of the Igloo White technology came from Sandia National Laboratories, which subsequently designed the Mini Intrusion Detection System (MIDS) family, and the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s AN/GSQ-261 Tactical Remote Sensor System (TRSS). Another major U.S. Army initiative was the Remotely Monitored Battlefield Sensor System (REMBASS), which it upgraded to Improved REMBASS (IREMBASS), and now is considering REMBASS II. The REMBASS generations, for example, increasingly intertwine interconnections of infrared MASINT, Magnetic MASINT, seismic MASINT, and acoustic MASINT.

The UK and Australia also are interested in UGS. Thales Defence Communications, a division of the French Thales Group and formerly Racal, builds the Covert Local Area Sensor System for Intruder Classification (CLASSIC) for use in 35 countries, including 12 NATO members. Australia adopted the CLASSIC 2000 version, which, in turn, becomes part of the Australian Ninox system, which also includes Textron Systems’ Terrain Commander surveillance system. CLASSIC has two kinds of sensors: Optical Acoustic Satcom Integrated Sensor (OASIS) and Air Deliverable Acoustic Sensor (ADAS), as well as television cameras, thermal imagers, and low-light cameras.

ADAS sensors were in a U.S. program, Army Rapid Force Projection Initiative advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD), using OASIS acoustic sensors and central processing, but not the electro-optical component. ADAS sensors are emplaced in clusters of three or four, for increased detection capability and for triangulation. Textron says that the ADAS acoustic sensors can track fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and UAVs as well as traditional ground threats.

ACTD added Remote Miniature Weather Station (RMWS), from System Innovations. These RMWS measure temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, visibility and barometric pressure, which can then be sent over commercial or military satellite links.

Employing UGS is especially challenging in urban areas, where there is a great deal more background energy and a need to separate important measurements from them. Acoustic sensors will need to distinguish vehicles and aircraft from footsteps (unless personnel detection is a goal), and things such as construction blasting. They will need to discriminate among simultaneous targets. Infrared imaging, for the urban environment, will need smaller pixels. If either the targets or the sensor is moving, micro-electromechanical accelerometers will be needed.

===Research programs: Smart Dust and WolfPack===
Still more of an UGS research program, under DARPA, is Smart Dust, which is a program for developing massively parallel networks of hundreds or thousands of &quot;motes,&quot; in the order of 1 mm3.

Another DARPA program is WolfPack, a ground-based electronic warfare system. WolfPack is made up of a &quot;pack&quot; of &quot;wolves.&quot; Wolves are distributed electronic detection nodes with location and classification capability, which may use radiofrequency MASINT techniques along with ELINT methods. The wolves could be hand, artillery, or airdrop delivered. WolfPack may fit into an Air Force program for a new subdiscipline of counter-ESM, as well as Distributed Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (DSEAD), an enhancement on SEAD. If the Wolves are colocated with jammers or other ECM, and they are very close to the target, they will not need much power to mask the signatures of friendly ground forces, in frequencies used for communications or local detection. DSEAD works in a similar way, but at radar frequencies. It may be interesting to compare this counter-ELINT discipline with ECCM.

== Disciplines ==

MASINT is made up of six major disciplines, but the disciplines overlap and intertwine. They interact with the more traditional intelligence disciplines of HUMINT, IMINT, and SIGINT. To be more confusing, while MASINT is highly technical and is called such, TECHINT is another discipline, dealing with such things as the analysis of captured equipment.

An example of the interaction is &quot;imagery-defined MASINT (IDM)&quot;. In IDM, a MASINT application would &quot;measure&quot; the image, pixel by pixel, and try to identify the physical materials, or types of energy, that are responsible for pixels or groups of pixels: &quot;signatures&quot;. When the signatures are then correlated to precise geography, or details of an object, the combined information becomes something greater than the whole of its IMINT and MASINT parts.

As with many branches of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT defined by the Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency disciplines.

A different set of disciplines comes from DIA:
:* nuclear, chemical, and biological features;
:* emitted energy (e.g., nuclear, thermal, and electromagnetic);
:* reflected (re-radiated) energy (e.g., radio frequency, light, and sound);
:* mechanical sound (e.g., engine, propeller, or machinery noise);
:* magnetic properties (e.g., magnetic flux and anomalies);
:* motion (e.g., flight, vibration, or movement); and
:* material composition.

The two sets are not mutually exclusive, and it is entirely possible that as this newly recognized discipline emerges, a new and more widely accepted set will evolve. For example, the DIA list considers vibration. In the Center for MASINT Studies and Research list, mechanical vibrations, of different sorts, can be measured by geophysical acoustic, electro-optical laser, or radar sensors.

==Basic interaction of energy sources with targets==
Remote sensing depends on the interaction of a source of energy with a target, and energy measured from the target. In the &quot;Remote Sensing&quot; diagram, Source 1a is an independent natural source such as the Sun. Source 1b is a source, perhaps manmade, that illuminates the target, such as a searchlight or ground radar transmitter. Source 1c is a natural source, such as the heat of the Earth, with which the Target interferes.

The Target itself may produce emitted radiation, such as the glow of a red-hot object, which Sensor 1 measures. Alternatively, Sensor 2 might measure, as reflected radiation, the interaction of the Target with Source 1a, as in conventional sunlit photography. If the energy comes from Source 1b, Sensor 2 is doing the equivalent of photography by flash.

Source 3a is under the observer&#x27;s control, such as a radar transmitter, and Sensor 3b can be tightly coupled to Source 3. An example of coupling might be that Sensor 3 will only look for backscatter radiation after the speed-of-light delay from Source 3a to the target and back to the position of Sensor 3b. Such waiting for a signal at a certain time, with radar, would be an example of electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), so that a signal jamming aircraft closer to Sensor 3b would be ignored.

A bistatic remote sensing system would separate source 3a from sensor 3b; a multistatic system could have multiple pairs of coupled sources and sensors, or an uneven ratio of sources and sensors as long as all are correlated. It is well known that bistatic and multistatic radar are a potential means of defeating low-radar-observability aircraft. It is also a requirement, from operations personnel concerned with shallow water operations.

Techniques such as synthetic aperture have source 3a and sensor 3b colocated, but the source-sensor array takes multiple measurements over time, giving the effect of physical separation of source and sensor.

Any of the illuminations of the target (i.e., Source 1a, 1b, or 3a), and the returning radiation, can be affected by the atmosphere, or other natural phenomena such as the ocean, between source and target, or between target and sensor.

Observe that the atmosphere comes between the radiation source and the target, and between the target and the sensor. Depending on the type of radiation and sensor in use, the atmosphere can have little interfering effect, or have a tremendous effect requiring extensive engineering to overcome.

First, the atmosphere may absorb part of the energy passing through it. This is bad enough for sensing if all wavelengths are affected evenly, but it becomes much more complex when the radiation is of multiple wavelengths, and the attenuation differs among wavelengths.

Second, the atmosphere may cause an otherwise tightly collimated energy beam to spread.

===Classes of sensor===
Sensing systems have five major subcomponents:
:*Signal collectors, which concentrate the energy, as with a telescope lens, or a radar antenna that focuses the energy at a detector
:*Signal detectors, such as charge-coupled devices for light or a radar receiver
:*Signal processing, which may remove artifacts from single images, or compute a synthetic image from multiple views
:*Recording mechanism
:*Recording return mechanisms, such as digital telemetry from satellites or aircraft, ejection systems for recorded media, or physical return of a sensor carrier with the recordings aboard.

MASINT sensors may be framing or scanning or synthetic. A framing sensor, such as a conventional camera, records the received radiation as a single object. Scanning systems use a detector that moves across the field of radiation to create a raster or more complex object. Synthetic systems combine multiple objects into a single one.

Sensors may be passive or coupled to an active source (i.e., &quot;active sensor&quot;). Passive sensors receive radiation from the target, either from the energy the target emits, or from other sources not synchronized with the sensor.

Most MASINT sensors will create digital recordings or transmissions, but specific cases might use film recording, analog recording or transmissions, or even more specialized means of capturing information.

====Passive sensing====
Figure &quot;Remote Sensing Geometry&quot; illustrates several key aspects of a scanning sensor.

The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) is the area from which radiation currently impinges on the detector. The swath width is the distance, centered on the sensor path, from which signal will be captured in a single scan. Swath width is a function of the angular field of view (AFOV) of the scanning system. Most scanning sensors have an array of detectors such that the IFOV is the angle subtended by each detector and the AFOV is the total angle subtended by the array.

Push broom sensors either have a sufficiently large IFOV, or the scan moves fast enough with respect to the forward speed of the sensor platform, that an entire swath width is recorded without movement artifacts. These sensors are also known as survey or wide field devices, comparable to wide angle lenses on conventional cameras.

Whisk broom or spotlight sensors have the effect of stopping the scan, and focusing the detector on one part of the swath, typically capturing greater detail in that area. This is also called a close look scanner, comparable to a telephoto lens on a camera.

Passive sensors can capture information for which there is no way to generate man-made radiation, such as gravity. Geodetic passive sensors can provide detailed information on the geology or hydrology of the earth.

====Active sensors====
Active sensors are conceptually of two types, imaging and non-imaging. Especially when combining classes of sensor, such as MASINT and IMINT, it can be hard to define if a given MASINT sensor is imaging or not. In general, however, MASINT measurements are mapped to pixels of a clearly imaging system, or to geospatial coordinates known precisely to the MASINT sensor-carrying platform.

In MASINT, the active signal source can be anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, limited only by the propagation of the signal from the source. X-ray sources, for example, must be in very close proximity to the target, while lasers can illuminate a target from a high satellite orbit. While this discussion has emphasized the electromagnetic spectrum, there are also both active (e.g., sonar) and passive (e.g., hydrophone and microbarograph) acoustic sensors.

===Quality of sensing===

Several factors make up the quality of a given sensor&#x27;s information acquisition, but assessing quality can become quite complex when the end product combines the data from multiple sensors. Several factors, however, are commonly used to characterize the basic quality of a single sensing system.
* Spatial resolution defines the correspondence between each recorded pixel and the square real-world area that the pixel covers.
* Spectral resolution is the number of discrete frequency (or equivalent) bands recorded in an individual pixel. (Relatively coarse spectral resolution from one sensor, such as the spectroscopic analyzer that reveals a &quot;bush&quot; is painted plaster, may greatly enhance the ultimate value of a different sensor with finer spectral resolution.)
* Radiometric resolution is the number of levels of energy recorded, per pixel, in each spectral band.
* Temporal resolution describes the intervals at which the target is sensed. This is meaningful only in synthetic imaging, comparison over a longer time base, or in producing full-motion imagery.

===Cueing===
Cross-cueing is the passing of detection, geolocation and targeting information to another sensor without human intervention. In a system of sensors, each sensor must understand which other sensors complement it. Typically, some sensors are sensitive (i.e., with a low incidence of false negatives) while others have a low incidence of false positives. A fast sensitive sensor that covers a large area, such as SIGINT or acoustic, can pass coordinates of a target of interest to a sensitive narrowband RF spectrum analyzer for ELINT or a hyperspectral electro-optical sensor. Putting sensitive and selective, or otherwise complementary sensors, into the same reconnaissance or surveillance system enhances the capabilities of the entire system, as in the Rocket Launch Spotter.

When combining sensors, however, even a quite coarse sensor of one type can cause a huge increase in the value of another, more fine-grained sensor. For example, a highly precise visible-light camera can create an accurate representation of a tree and its foliage. A coarse spectral analyzer in the visible light spectrum, however, can reveal that the green leaves are painted plastic, and the &quot;tree&quot; is camouflaging something else. Once the fact of camouflage is determined, a next step might be to use imaging radar or some other sensing system that will not be confused by the paint.

Cueing, however, is a step before automatic target recognition, which requires both extensive signature libraries and reliable matching to it.

<text>Baron Deramore, of Belvoir in the County of Down, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 18 November 1885 for the Conservative Member of Parliament Sir Thomas Bateson, 2nd Baronet. His father Robert Bateson had been created a baronet, of Belvoir Park in the County of Down, on 18 December 1818 in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The barony was created with special remainder to the first Baron&#x27;s younger brother George, who succeeded him as second Baron.

He was the husband of Mary Elizabeth de Yarburgh (died 1884), daughter and heiress of George John de Yarburgh, of Heslington Hall, near York, and assumed in 1876 by Royal licence the additional surname of de Yarburgh after the death of his father-in-law. In 1892 Lord Deramore assumed the surname of Bateson after, instead of before that of de Yarburgh. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1924 to 1936. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the fourth Baron.

The family seat of Heslington Hall was acquired by the University of York in 1962 and now forms part of its campus. The Hall was lived in by the family of the Barons Deramore until ca 1940, when it was vacated in favour of No. 4 Group RAF.

<doc id="488896" wikidata="Q6786846" url="?curid=488896" title="Mathematical Tables Project">
<text>The Mathematical Tables Project was one of the largest and most sophisticated computing organizations that operated prior to the invention of the digital electronic computer. Begun in the United States in 1938 as a project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), it employed 450 unemployed clerks to tabulate higher mathematical functions, such as exponential functions, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. These tables were eventually published in a 28-volume set by Columbia University Press.

==History==
The group was led by a group of mathematicians and physicists, most of whom had been unable to find professional work during the Great Depression. The mathematical leader was Gertrude Blanch, who had just finished her doctorate in mathematics at Cornell University. She had been unable to find a university position and was working at a photographic company before joining the project.

The administrative director was Arnold Lowan, who had a degree in physics from Columbia University and had spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton University before returning to New York without a job. Perhaps the most accomplished mathematician to be associated with the group was Cornelius Lanczos, who had once served as an assistant to Albert Einstein. He spent a year with the project and organized seminars on computation and applied mathematics at the project&#x27;s office in Lower Manhattan.

In addition to computing tables of mathematical functions, the project did large computations for sciences, including the physicist Hans Bethe, and did calculations for a variety of war projects, including tables for the LORAN navigation system, tables for microwave radar, bombing tables, and shock wave propagation tables.

The Mathematical Tables Project survived the termination of the WPA in 1943 and continued to operate in New York until 1948. At that point, roughly 25 members of the group moved to Washington, D.C., to become the Computation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Blanch moved to Los Angeles to lead the computing office of the Institute for Numerical Analysis at UCLA and Arnold Lowan joined the faculty of Yeshiva University in New York. The greatest legacy of the project is the &quot;Handbook of Mathematical Functions&quot;, which was published 16 years after the group disbanded. Edited by two veterans of the project, Milton Abramowitz and Irene Stegun, it became a widely circulated mathematical and scientific reference.

<text>Baron de Villiers, of Wynberg in the Cape of Good Hope Province and the Union of South Africa, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 21 September 1910 for the prominent South African lawyer and judge John de Villiers. He served as Chief Justice of South Africa between 1910 and 1914. The 3rd Baron graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford and worked as a barrister in Auckland, New Zealand. In 1949, he was admitted to the Supreme Court in Auckland. He lived in Huapai near Auckland. , the title is held by his great-grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2001.

Asked how to say his name, the third Baron told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;: &quot;In England it is pronounced &#x27;Villars.&#x27; But the pronunciation which is used by English-speaking South Africans, and which I myself use, would be written &quot;duh vil&#x27;yers&quot;. There is a suspicion of an &quot;i&quot; sound between the &quot;l&quot; and the &quot;y&quot;.&quot;

==Barons de Villiers (1910)==

*John de Villiers, 1st Baron de Villiers (1842–1914)
*Charles Percy de Villiers, 2nd Baron de Villiers (1871–1934)
*Arthur Percy de Villiers, 3rd Baron de Villiers (1911–2001)
*Alexander Charles de Villiers, 4th Baron de Villiers (b. 1940)

There is no heir to the barony.

<text>The MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 is a twin-engined light utility–transport helicopter. It was jointly developed and manufactured by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) of Germany and Kawasaki of Japan. MBB was later purchased by Daimler-Benz and eventually became a part of Eurocopter, which was later rebranded as Airbus Helicopters.

On 25 February 1977, MBB and Kawasaki signed a cooperative agreement to abandon their independent efforts to design twin-engined general purpose helicopters in favour of a collaborative venture to development of a new rotorcraft for that role. While the programme&#x27;s costs were shared equally, the workshare was divided into certain areas of the design. MBB utilised their expertise with the rigid rotor system used on the earlier Bo 105 to develop the majority of the dynamic systems and flight controls, while Kawasaki focused on the airframe, structural elements, and various other components. On 13 June 1979, MBB&#x27;s flying prototype conducted its maiden flight at Ottobrunn, Bavaria, Germany; months later, it was followed by the Kawasaki prototype at Gifu, Chūbu region, Japan on 10 August 1979.

Each company established their own final assembly line, producing the BK 117 for their respective regions. The BK 117 has proven to be popular for passenger services and VIP-transport, the cabin can be outfitted with various seating configurations, seating between seven and ten passengers. It is also used for a diverse range of operations, such as aerial crane and sling work, law enforcement, and military transport, and is exceptional as an air ambulance and search and rescue platform. During the 1990s, due to its popularity, a refined derivative, initially marketed as the BK 117 C-2 before being rebranded as the EC 145 and later as the H145, was developed from the BK 117 C-1 version; this improved version of the rotorcraft has since succeeded the original BK 117 in production.

The original BK 117, Eurocopter EC 145, and Airbus Helicopters H145, are typically thought of as being in one design family, despite different marketing and naming.

==Development==
===Origins===
According to aviation author J. Mac. McCellan, the BK 117 has its origins in an earlier rotorcraft designed and produced by German aerospace manufacturer Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), the MBB Bo 105. This helicopter, which proved to be a commercial success, had made use of a revolutionary hingeless main rotor composed of fibreglass, which was developed by German engineer Ludwig Bölkow. Having established a reputation for reliability and safety, during the early 1970s MBB, along with one of its major shareholders, Boeing Vertol, began studying options for producing an enlarged derivative of the type to accompany the Bo 105. However, Boeing soon withdrew from the venture, leading to MBB searching for another partner; this was found in the form of Japanese company Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

On 25 February 1977, MBB and Kawasaki signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a new rotorcraft. Under the terms of this agreement, the two corporations merged their previously separate projects to produce twin-engined general purpose helicopters, these being the &quot;Bo 107&quot; by MBB and the &quot;KH-7&quot; from Kawasaki. All of the privately incurred development costs were shared equally between the two partners; in November 1977, the programme received a huge boost when the government of West Germany announced that it would fund half of the costs of development. By April 1978, project definition studies had been completed, enabling the joint venture to proceed with the detail design phase of development.

Separate elements of the design were assigned to each company; MBB were responsible for developing the rotors (these were based on the rigid rotor system previously used on MBB&#x27;s Bo 105), tailboom, flight controls and hydraulic system while Kawasaki undertook the development of the landing gear, airframe, main transmission, electrical system and other minor components. German vehicle manufacturer BMW acted as a consultant on the styling of the BK 117. As per their agreement, each company established their own final assembly line for the type, on which they would produce the rotorcraft to meet demands within their respective local markets.

Originally, each company intended to construct a pair of prototypes (in actuality, Kawasaki opted to only build a single prototype) which were to be completed by 1979; one for flight testing purposes and the others for tie down testing and static testing. On 13 June 1979, MBB&#x27;s flying prototype conducted its maiden flight at Ottobrunn, Bavaria, Germany; months later, it was followed by the Kawasaki prototype at Gifu, Chūbu region, Japan on 10 August 1979. The pace of development on the programme had been slower than expected, a problem that was exacerbated by a shortage of skilled manpower that was available at MBB. Although it was originally planned for the rotorcraft&#x27;s airworthiness certification to be achieved before the end of 1980, German certification was not achieved until 9 December 1982, being quickly followed by the receipt of Japanese certification on 17 December 1982. On 29 March 1983, the type secured the all-important United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, clearing it for widespread use.

===Further development===

During 1983, the initial production version, designated as the &quot;BK 117A-1&quot; was first delivered. Improved variants were quickly developed; in early 1985, the &quot;BK 117A-3&quot;, featuring an increased maximum takeoff weight and an enlarged tail rotor with twisted airfoils, was certified; two years later, the &quot;BK 117A-4&quot;, equipped with LTS 101-750B-1 engines for improved hot/high performance and increased maximum takeoff weight, along with improvements to the main rotor transmission and tail rotor mast, as well as a larger capacity fuel tank, was introduced. During 1990, MBB&#x27;s American division launched a dedicated corporate version of the BK 117; it was furnished with a Honeywell-built SPZ-7000 digital automatic flight control system and a cocoon-type interior system; optional extras included a Bendix/King electronic flight instrumentation system (EFIS) and a clamshell cabin door. During 1992, the &quot;BK 117C-1&quot;, equipped with a revised EFIS panel and an improved environmental control system, along with greater hot-and-high performance, was introduced to service.

At one stage, there was considerable attention paid to the concept of a dedicated militarised variant of the type. During the 1985 Paris Air Show, the concept of an armed attack helicopter derivative, referred to as the &quot;BK 117A-3M&quot;, was revealed to the general public. As promoted, this variant would have been capable of being armed with launchers for eight Euromissile HOT 2 missiles and a chin-mounted Lucas-built turret for a Browning 12.7mm machine gun, aimed using a helmet-mounted sight. It was also to be equipped with various advanced targeting sensors, including an SFIM APX-M 397 roof-mounted stabilized sight. In order to provide sufficient ground clearance for the gun turret, the use of higher skid landing gear would have also been necessitated.

During the 1990s, as a result of the commercial success of the type, a refined derivative, initially marketed as the &quot;BK 117 C-2&quot; prior to its rebranding as the EC 145 and later as the &quot;H145&quot;, was developed from the BK 117 C-1 version; this improved version of the rotorcraft has succeeded and eventually replaced the original BK 117 in production. In total, 443 BK 117s were manufactured by the two partners; 329 (and two prototypes) were produced by MBB at their Donauworth facility while 111 (and one prototype) were completed by Kawasaki in Japan. During the 1980s, an agreement was formed with Indonesian Aerospace, enabling the type to be produced under license in Indonesia, which was accordingly designated as the &quot;NBK 117&quot;; however, according to economics author Sören Eriksson, the Indonesian production programme was terminated after only a handful of rotorcraft were completed.

Since exiting production, third parties have produced their own upgrade programmes for existing BK 117s. In 2010, Airwork launched its conversion programme for the type, replacing the original LTS101-750B-1 engine with the newer LTS101-850B-2 engine, increasing both its performance, reliability and safety margins, resulting in the &quot;BK117-850D2&quot;; by 2016, Airwork had upgraded nearly 50 rotorcraft in this manner.

==Design==

The MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 is a twin-engined medium utility–transport helicopter. It possessed several attributes that lend itself to performing many different roles, such as twin-engine redundancy, sizable clamshell-shaped rear-facing double doors, and a relatively spacious cabin; one mission to which it was deemed to be suitable was the emergency medical services (EMS). The airframe is composed of rivetted metal, making minimal use of composite materials, in order to free up internal space, both the engines and transmission are positioned above the main cabin. Considerable efforts were made to reduce the weight of the aircraft where possible albeit without compromising the aircraft&#x27;s structural integrity. The cabin could be configured with various interiors in order to suit its purpose.

Early versions of the BK 117 were powered by a pair of Lycoming LTS101 turboshaft engines, rated to generate 550 shp at takeoff with considerable reserve power to guard against a single engine failure. While each engine possesses sufficient power to maintain flight and even takeoff in the event of a single engine being rendered inoperable, the type also has favourable autorotation capabilities. In order to extend their operational lifespan and increase their reliability, MBB tuned the engines to operate at lower-than-standard revolutions per minute (RPM). The engines are regulated using a specialised control system which smoothly and evenly regulate RPM and torque between both engines, even during vigorous manoeuvers. Power management has been greatly eased via the addition of an automatic engine-governor system, allowing pilots to simply monitor the torque and engine temperature gauges. The aircraft can be suitably equipped for flight under instrument flight rules (IFR) as well as for single-pilot operations.

According to aviation publication &quot;Flying&quot;, as a consequence of its uncommon rigid main rotor system, the BK 117 possessed relatively high stability and manoeuvrability which, amongst other capabilities, reportedly gave the type the ability to perform a steeper approach than any other helicopter in its class. The four-bladed main rotor was smaller and slower-turning than many of its contemporaries, reducing both vibration and noise while also enabling the type to use more compact landing sites. The high-mounted tail boom and tail rotor of the BK 117 also presented several benefits, such as enhanced safety to personnel on the ground. In terms of its flight performance, the type was considered to be suitable for the execution of various aerobatic manoeuvres, such as flying loops and rolls, while retaining such levels of inherent stability that pilots could readily release both the cyclic and collective controls, unlike the majority of rotorcraft. An optional Sperry-built three-axis stability augmentation system also served to improve the rotorcraft&#x27;s ease of handling.

==Operational history==

A single BK 117 A-3 (c/n 7106) was leased by the Canadian Forces Air Command for a test program and designated as the CH-143. When the program was over, the aircraft was returned to MBB Canada.

A BK 117 helicopter contracted by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service to fight fires crashed on 17 August 2018, the pilot died in the crash.

<text>Barabbas (; ) was, according to the New Testament, a prisoner who rebelled against the Roman occupying forces and who was chosen over Jesus by a crowd in Jerusalem to be pardoned and released by Roman governor Pontius Pilate at the Passover feast.

==Biblical account==

According to all four canonical gospels, there was a prevailing Passover custom in Jerusalem that allowed Pontius Pilate, the &quot;&quot; or governor of Judea, to commute one prisoner&#x27;s death sentence by popular acclaim. In one such instance, the &quot;crowd&quot; (&quot;ὄχλος : óchlos&quot;), &quot;the Jews&quot; and &quot;the multitude&quot; in some sources, are offered the choice to have either Barabbas or Jesus released from Roman custody. According to the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and the account in John, the crowd chooses Barabbas to be released and Jesus of Nazareth to be crucified. Pilate reluctantly yields to the insistence of the crowd. One passage, found in the Gospel of Matthew, has the crowd saying (of Jesus), &quot;Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.&quot;

Matthew refers to Barabbas only as a &quot;notorious prisoner&quot;. Mark and Luke further refer to Barabbas as one involved in a στάσις (&quot;stásis&quot;, a riot), probably &quot;one of the numerous insurrections against the Roman power&quot; who had committed murder. Robert Eisenman states that John 18:40 refers to Barabbas as a λῃστής (&quot;lēistēs&quot;, &quot;bandit&quot;), &quot;the word Josephus always employs when talking about Revolutionaries&quot;.

Three gospels state that there was a custom that at Passover the Roman governor would release a prisoner of the crowd&#x27;s choice; , , and . Later copies of Luke contain a corresponding verse (), although this is not present in the earliest manuscripts, and may be a later gloss to bring Luke into conformity.

The custom of releasing prisoners in Jerusalem at Passover is known to theologians as the &quot;Paschal Pardon&quot;, but this custom, whether at Passover or any other time, is not recorded in any historical document other than the gospels, leading some scholars to question its historicity and make further claims that such a custom was a mere narrative invention of the Bible&#x27;s writers.

==Name==

There exist several versions of this figure&#x27;s name in gospel manuscripts, most commonly simply without a first name. However the variations (, , ) found in different manuscripts of the Matthew 27:16–17 give this figure the first name &quot;Jesus&quot;, making his full name &quot;Jesus Barabbas&quot; or &quot;Jesus Bar-rhabban&quot;, and giving him the same first, given name as Jesus. 

The Codex Koridethi seems to emphasise Bar-rhabban as composed of two elements in line with a patronymic Aramaic name. These versions, featuring the first name &quot;Jesus&quot; are considered original by a number of modern scholars. 

Origen seems to refer to this passage of Matthew in claiming that it must be a corruption, as no sinful man ever bore the name &quot;Jesus&quot; and argues for its exclusion from the text. He however does not account for the high priest from 2 Maccabees 4:13, whose name seems to transliterate the same Aramaic name into Greek, as well as other bearers of the name Jesus mentioned by Josephus. It is possible that scribes when copying the passage, driven by a reasoning similar to that of Origen, removed this first name &quot;Jesus&quot; from the text to avoid dishonor to the name of the Jesus whom they considered the Messiah.

Of the two larger categories in which transmitted versions of this name fall , seems to represent Jewish Palestinian Aramaic: בּר רַבָּן, &quot;Bar Rabbān&quot;, &#x27;Son of our Rabbi/Master&#x27;, while appears to derive ultimately from Jewish Palestinian Aramaic: בּר אַבָּא , &quot;Bar ʾAbbā &#x27;Son of ʾAbbā/[the] father&quot;&#x27;, a patronymic Aramaic name. However, &quot;ʾAbbā&quot; has been found as a personal name in a 1st-century burial at Giv&#x27;at ha-Mivtar. Additionally it appears fairly often as a personal name in the Gemara section of the Talmud, a Jewish text dating from AD 200–400.

==Historicity==
According to Max Dimont, the story of Barabbas as related in the Gospels lacks credibility from both the Roman and Jewish standpoint. The story, on its face, presents the Roman authority, Pontius Pilate, backed by overwhelming military might, being cowed by a small crowd of unarmed civilians into releasing a prisoner condemned to death for insurrection against the Roman Empire. 

Dimont argues against the believability of the Barabbas story by noting that the alleged custom of , &quot;the privilege of Passover&quot;, where a criminal is set free, is only found in the Gospels. Raymond E. Brown argued that the Gospels&#x27; narratives about Barabbas cannot be considered historical, but that it is probable that a prisoner referred to as Barabbas (&quot;bar abba&quot;, &quot;son of the father&quot;) was freed around the period Jesus was crucified, and this gave birth to the story. 

Similarly, Bart D. Ehrman strongly believes that the story lacks credibility, as it is not in Pontius Pilate&#x27;s character to release an insurrectionist for the Jews, as well as commenting that the name Barabbas &quot;son of the father&quot; is interestingly similar to Jesus&#x27;s role as the son of God.

On the other hand, Craig A. Evans and N. T. Wright argue in favor of the historicity of the Passover pardon narrative, quoting evidence of such pardons from Livy&#x27;s &quot;Books from the Foundation of the City&quot;, Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Papyrus Florence, Pliny the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot; and the Mishnah.

The similarities of the name () in some manuscripts and the name of Jesus have led some modern scholars to argue that the counter-intuitive similarity of the two men&#x27;s names is evidence of its historicity. They doubt a Christian writer would invent a similar name for a criminal, practically equating Christ with a criminal, if he were fictionalizing the story for a polemical or theological purpose.

A minority of scholars, including Benjamin Urrutia, Stevan Davies, Hyam Maccoby and Horace Abram Rigg, have contended that Barabbas and Jesus were the same person.

==Antisemitism==

The story of Barabbas has played a role in historical antisemitism, because it has historically been used to lay the blame for the crucifixion of Jesus on the Jews, and thereby to justify antisemitism – an interpretation known as &quot;Jewish deicide&quot;.

Pope Benedict XVI, in his 2011 book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, dismisses this reading, since the Greek word ὄχλος (óchlos) in means &quot;crowd&quot;, rather than &quot;Jewish people&quot;.

==In literature==

Samuel Crossman&#x27;s English hymn &quot;My Song Is Love Unknown&quot; (published 1684) contains this verse alluding anonymously to Barabbas as &quot;a murderer&quot;

:They rise, and needs will have
:my dear Lord made away;
:a murderer they save,
:the Prince of Life they slay.
:Yet cheerful He
:to suffering goes,
:that He His foes
:from thence might free.

Barabbas is the main character in the novel &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1950) by Pär Lagerkvist.

<text>Sand Land (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from May to August 2000, and was collected into a single volume in November 2000. &quot;Sand Land&quot; was first serialized in North America by Viz Media in their English &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine in 2003, then later released in one graphic novel in December 2003. A CGI anime film adaptation co-produced by Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga, and Anima was released in August 2023, while an original net animation (ONA) series was released worldwide on Disney+ and Hulu from March to May 2024. An action role-playing video game adaptation, also titled &quot;Sand Land&quot;, was released in April 2024.

==Plot==
After enduring years of natural disaster and war, the world is left without its main supply of water; the river that provided water to the country dried up long ago. With the greedy king of the land&#x27;s personal water supply becoming increasingly more expensive for the citizens of Sand Land to buy, the people begin robbing one another for water and money. Sheriff Rao, tired of the king&#x27;s greed, approaches the demons of Sand Land for help in searching for a new water supply. Demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief agree to join Rao.

Soon after their quest begins, their car breaks down and they are forced to steal a tank from the king&#x27;s army. This attracts the anger of the king and he mobilizes his forces to stop them. Sheriff Rao, a former legendary general of the king&#x27;s army, is able to quickly deal with all of the current army&#x27;s attempts to hinder their progress. Once they reach the supposed water supply at the end of the now dried up river bed, they find a lake that now acts as the king&#x27;s private reserves. With the water sealed away behind a dam to give the king a monopoly over water, Rao, the demons, and those sympathetic to their cause tear it down. With the water returned to the world as a result, the king&#x27;s oppressive rule is brought to an end.

==Characters==
:
:Beelzebub, named after the biblical demon of the same name, is the son of Lucifer and the prince of demons. Generally referred to only as &quot;Prince&quot; by his fellow demons and nicknamed &quot;Beelz&quot; by Rao, Beelzebub tries to live in relative harmony with the humans. Although he regularly steals water from them, he only takes as much as he and the demons need to survive. Simply joining Sheriff Rao out of boredom, Beelzebub lends his enhanced sight and demonic strength to fight against the tyrannous king. By basking in moonlight, Beelzebub can absorb the &quot;power of darkness,&quot; which he can unleash to temporarily boost his strength and demonic powers.
:
:An elderly man and sheriff of a small village, Rao seeks to free the people of Sand Land from the king&#x27;s pocket. Formerly known as , he is in truth a legendary tank commander believed to have died 30 years ago along with his forces while destroying a mysterious weapon produced by the Picchi on the King&#x27;s orders. Rao learns from Beelzebub and Thief that it was not a weapon, but a machine to produce water. This information prompts Rao to right his wrong by bringing down the king and help those whose families died due to his actions. He is a skilled tonfa fighter.
:
:Thief is reluctantly recruited by Beelzebub for his expertise at stealing and his great wisdom. He often fights with Beelzebub for turns to drive the tank and frequently complains about the constant danger the group faces. He dresses in a Santa Claus costume when thieving. Despite looking and acting like an old man, Thief claims he is not that much older than Beelzebub.
:
:Rao&#x27;s replacement in the king&#x27;s army, Are&#x27;s father died during the raid against the mysterious weapon. Initially, he actively pursues Rao in order to avenge his father. However, once he learns the truth about the mysterious weapon, he joins Rao in bringing down the king. His tank is unique compared to others in the tank brigade, as it is equipped with a more powerful artillery cannon.
:
:The true antagonist of Sand Land, Zeu is the aging commander of the king&#x27;s forces. Due to his failing body, Zeu is confined to a floating robotic lift. He ordered the attack on the Picchi people, the creators of the water-producing machine, to both rid himself of Shiba&#x27;s disobedient tank brigade and the threat to the king&#x27;s monopoly. He uses the king as a figurehead to rule Sand Land. Ultimately, Are shoots and kills him with a tank cannon blast.
:
:As the current ruler of Sand Land, the king makes enormous profit by selling bottled water at high prices. He tries to eliminate Rao to make sure nobody finds out about his personal water supply or the water-creating machine he had destroyed. After water is returned to Sand Land, he is forced by Rao to give his wealth to the people. A cowardly hedonist, the king cares only about maintaining his power and profits and is quick to abandon his people when Sand Land is threatened by the flying fortress Garam.
:
:King of the demons and Beelzebub&#x27;s father. Cold and strict, he does not concern himself with the affairs of humans and possesses immense power. Despite his attitude, he cares for his people and agrees to let Beelzebub journey with Rao because of the potential benefit to demonkind.
:
:The muscular leader of the , the self-proclaimed &quot;greatest criminals in Sand Land&quot;, and father of the other members.
:
:A skinny member of the Swimmers who wears a necktie with no shirt and a cooking pot as a helmet. He has superhuman eyesight and can draw incredibly detailed and accurate sketches from memory.

:
:A character from &quot;Sand Land: The Series&quot; and the &quot;Sand Land&quot; video game. He is the main antagonist of the game and the second half of the series. He is an angel who proclaims to be the hero of Forest Land. Originally a low-ranked archive clerk, Muniel steals a staff that creates lightning clouds and a demon-sealing urn and descends to the mortal realm without permission, intending to purge the world of demons.

Lilith is Lucifer&#x27;s eldest daughter and Beelzebub&#x27;s older sister. She has the same demonic powers as her father and brother and usually disguises herself as a human.

==Production==
Following the conclusion of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in 1995, Akira Toriyama created short stories and one-offs. However, he decided to write one more work that would be his last, and in which he would put everything he had. He intended for &quot;Sand Land&quot; to be a short story about an old man and a tank that he wrote for his own enjoyment. However, he had difficulty drawing the tank and, as he insisted on drawing everything himself, soon regretted it. Although he became frustrated, Toriyama had already devised the plot to involve the tank and thus grudgingly went through with it. While he personally preferred lighthearted content, he was aware most readers did not, and therefore tried his best to tone down the light parts and make it a serious story. However, Toriyama said he ultimately ended up prioritizing his personal preferences and should have thought about the readers more. He inked the manuscripts on paper before scanning them into a computer and using software to paint in solid colors and apply tones. After drawing the pages for &quot;Sand Land&quot;, he lost the pen holder that he had used since before his debut. Toriyama later quipped that this was the reason he hardly drew any more manga. Looking back on the series 23 years later, he found that his drawing ability and energy were incredible at the time it was made.

==Media==
===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, &quot;Sand Land&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from May 9 to August 8, 2000.

====Chapters====


===Anime===

On December 8, 2022, Bandai Namco opened a website for &quot;Sand Land Project&quot; and uploaded a teaser video featuring Toriyama&#x27;s art from the manga. The website featured a countdown that ended on December 17. On that date, it was announced that the series would receive a CGI anime film adaptation co-produced by Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga, and Anima. The film was directed by Toshihisa Yokoshima, with Hiroshi Kōjina serving as directing advisor, Hayashi Mori writing the screenplay, Yoshikazu Iwanami directing the sound, and Yugo Kanno composing the music. Imase performed the film&#x27;s theme song . The film had its world premiere screening at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2023. It was then officially released in Japanese theaters on August 18, 2023, by Toho, with a North American release following in 2024. 

An original net animation (ONA) series was announced on November 14, 2023. The cast and staff members from the film reprised their roles. The opening theme is &quot;Water Carrier&quot; by Kroi, while the ending theme is by Tempalay. The first seven episodes of the series began streaming worldwide on Disney+ and in the United States on Hulu on March 20, 2024. The remaining episodes were released once a week. The first six episodes comprise arc and retell the story of the film with some new scenes, while the final seven episodes comprise arc, which Toriyama newly wrote for the ONA. Toriyama also named the two arcs and designed the new characters such as Ann and Muniel. However, he died before the ONA premiered on March 1, 2024.

====Episodes====
===Video game===

An action role-playing video game based on the series was announced during Summer Game Fest on June 8, 2023. It was developed by ILCA and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, and uses Unreal Engine 5. The game was released in Japan for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows on April 25, 2024, and the following day worldwide.

==Reception==
===Manga===
Greg McElhatton called &quot;Sand Land&quot; &quot;the ultimate disposable comic, executed perfectly&quot;. His review for &quot;Read About Comics&quot; summarized, refers to it as a fun light story that, while not necessarily deep or memorable, does well to explore the fictional world and the unique characters that inhabit it. Despite Toriyama&#x27;s complaints about designing the tank, McElhatton praised the art, declaring it more consistent than his previous work &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. John Jakala of Anime News Network also called the artwork, and story, superior to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Jakala said the characters are a big part of the series&#x27; charm, claiming Toriyama did a &quot;masterful job&quot; establishing the look and personality of each character in the first chapter.

===Anime===
At the 2023 Fantasia International Film Festival, the film adaptation of &quot;Sand Land&quot; won a Special Jury Mention in the Excellence in Animation category. The film opened at number six at the Japanese box office, and grossed US$2.98 million by its third week. Evan Mullicane of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; strongly praised the film, writing that it &quot;proves that the original &quot;Sand Land&quot; manga is Toriyama&#x27;s true opus.&quot; He found the &quot;seamless&quot; blend of 3D and 2D animation creates a distinctive look that captures Toriyama&#x27;s artwork &quot;beautifully&quot;, and noted that the film&#x27;s best moments are all based on developing the three central characters. Writing for Anime News Network, Kalai Chik called the film a &quot;feel good popcorn movie&quot; and gave it a B+ rating. They cited the script as its strongest feature; &quot;For a story that touches on the impacts of war, global warming, and corporate greed, it never overcomplicates the message, nor does it talk down to the audience.&quot; Although they praised the music, Chik noted it also exposes the &quot;underutilized animation&quot;. Giving the film three out of five stars, Matt Schley of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; called it a straightforward romp that is &quot;fun first and foremost&quot;, but leaves the audience with deeper themes to contemplate. He praised the banter between the three main characters as entertaining, with Mutsumi Tamura&#x27;s Beelzebub being &quot;especially endearing&quot;, and the supporting characters for highlighting Toriyama&#x27;s skill for visual gags. Although Schley wrote that the story and CG animation in &quot;Sand Land&quot; are not likely to disappoint audiences, he noted that there is &quot;nothing particularly revolutionary&quot; about it and suggested it could have been slightly shorter in length.

<text>Poor pussy is an old party game played by children and adults often in drama classes or at parties. As it is described:

:This game makes everybody laugh. Have the guests sit around the room. Choose one person to be the pussy. Pussy must go over to a guest and meow three times. The guest must pet pussy&#x27;s head three times and say &quot;Poor pussy, poor pussy, poor pussy,&quot; without laughing. The pussy should do their best to make the guest laugh. They can make funny meows and walk around like a cat. The pussy goes from one guest to another until someone laughs. The first one to laugh becomes the new pussy.

A variation of this game involves the exchange:
Person: &quot;Honey, I love you, give me a smile.&quot;
Guest: &quot;Honey, you know I love you, but I just can&#x27;t smile.&quot;

<doc id="488940" wikidata="Q470591" url="?curid=488940" title="John Saxon">
<text>John Saxon (born Carmine Orrico; August 5, 1936 – July 25, 2020) was an American actor who worked on more than 200 film and television projects during a span of 60 years. He was known for his work in Westerns and horror films, often playing police officers and detectives.

Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Saxon studied acting with Stella Adler before beginning his career as a contract actor for Universal Pictures, appearing in such films as &quot;Rock, Pretty Baby&quot; (1956) and &quot;Portrait in Black&quot; (1961), which earned him a reputation as a teen idol and won him a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. During the 1970s and 1980s, he established himself as a character actor, frequently portraying law-enforcement officials in horror films such as &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974) and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984).

Saxon appeared in numerous Italian films from the early 1960s. In a 2002 interview, he said of this period: &quot;At the time, Hollywood was going through a crisis, but England and Italy were making a great many films. Besides, I thought the European films were of a much more mature quality than most of what Hollywood was making at the time.&quot; Saxon appeared in Italian productions all through the 1970s and 1980s, until 1994, when he made &quot;Jonathan of the Bears&quot;.

In addition to his roles in horror films, Saxon co-starred with Bruce Lee in the martial arts film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973), and he had supporting roles in the Westerns &quot;The Appaloosa&quot; (1966; for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture), &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot; (1969), and &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; (1972), as well as the made-for-television thriller &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot; (1977). In the 1990s, Saxon occasionally appeared in films, with small roles in &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994) and &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996).

==Early life==
Of Italian descent, Saxon was born Carmine Orrico in Brooklyn, New York in 1936. His father, Antonio Orrico, was a New York-born dock worker, and his mother Anna (née Protettore) was an immigrant from Calabria. Italian was the primary language spoken at home, though Saxon also spoke some Spanish. He attended New Utrecht High School and studied acting with famous acting coach Stella Adler. He entered show business as a teenager, when he was spotted by a modeling scout at a movie theatre.

According to Robert Hofler&#x27;s 2005 biography, &quot;The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson&quot;, agent Henry Willson saw Saxon&#x27;s picture on the cover of a detective magazine, where Saxon posed as &quot;a Puerto Rican guy&quot; who gets shot and falls over a garbage can while his girlfriend looks on. Willson immediately contacted the boy&#x27;s family in Brooklyn. With his parents&#x27; permission, the 17-year-old Orrico contracted with Willson, and he was given the stage name John Saxon. He contracted with Universal Studios in April 1954 at $150 a week.

==Career==
===Universal Pictures===

Saxon spent 18 months at Universal before the studio first used him in a film. His first significant role was a juvenile delinquent in &quot;Running Wild&quot; (1955), co-starring Mamie Van Doren. According to &quot;Filmink&quot;, &quot;young Saxon had a scowling, broody teen quality that was in fashion in mid-‘50s Hollywood.&quot;

He was then given a good role in &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot; (1956), playing a youth who seemingly stalks Esther Williams. During February 1956, Universal exercised its option on Saxon and he was paid $225 a week.

===Teen idol===
Saxon had the lead in a low-budget teen film, &quot;Rock, Pretty Baby&quot; (1956), which became an unexpected success and established Saxon as a teen idol. Universal executives were pleased, and Ross Hunter announced he would be in &quot;Teach Me How To Cry&quot;. Saxon quickly reprised his &quot;Rock, Pretty Baby&quot; role in a sequel, &quot;Summer Love&quot; (1958). By this time, he was getting about 3,000 fan letters a week. He then made &quot;Teach Me How to Cry&quot; with Sandra Dee, which was retitled &quot;The Restless Years&quot; (1958).

Universal put him in an &quot;A&quot; film, &quot;This Happy Feeling&quot; (1958), directed by Blake Edwards, where Saxon romanced Debbie Reynolds in support of Curt Jurgens. MGM borrowed him to appear opposite Sandra Dee in &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958), for director Vincente Minnelli, which was widely seen. Saxon was billed third, beneath Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall. He had a support role in a large-budget Biblical drama about Simon Peter, &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; (1959) for director Frank Borzage, starring Howard Keel. Released by Buena Vista instead of Universal-International, it was a financial disappointment.

In August 1958, Saxon signed a three-picture deal with Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, the first of which was to be the main role in &quot;Cry Tough&quot; (1959), a film about juvenile delinquents. He was meant to follow it with &quot;The Ballad of Cat Ballou&quot; (not made until years later, with Jane Fonda). Instead, for HHL, he worked with another major director, John Huston, in the Western &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; (1960), playing an Indian in support of Burt Lancaster and Audrey Hepburn. Back at Universal, he remained in a supporting role for &quot;Portrait in Black&quot; (1960), reunited with Dee, with Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn.

He appeared in the Western &quot;Posse from Hell&quot; (1961) with Audie Murphy and guest-starred in television series, including &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;. &quot;I want to do all sorts of character parts,&quot; he said in 1960.

Saxon played a serial-killer soldier in &quot;War Hunt&quot; (1962) and had a small role in the comedy success &quot;Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation&quot; (1962).

===Europe===
Saxon traveled to Italy to make &quot;Agostino&quot; (1962).

In 1963, Saxon co-starred with Letícia Román in Mario Bava&#x27;s Italian &quot;giallo&quot; film &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot;.

He returned to Hollywood to perform in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963) and an episode of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, then was back to Europe for &quot;The Cavern&quot; (1964).

&quot;The Ravagers&quot; (1965) was shot in the Philippines; &quot;Night Caller from Outer Space&quot; (1965) was a science-fiction film shot in Britain.

In 1966, he starred in Curtis Harrington&#x27;s science-fiction/horror classic &quot;Queen of Blood&quot; with Basil Rathbone and Dennis Hopper, then appeared opposite Marlon Brando in &quot;The Appaloosa&quot; (1966), winning a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor nomination for his portrayal of a Mexican bandit. Saxon recalls, &quot;This was to me a terrific role and something I was ready for, but he [Brando] was despondent. He said he had lent a whole bunch of money to his father, and what he was saying to me was that his father ruined his life by losing all of his money. He was kind of bored in the picture.&quot;

&quot;The Doomsday Flight&quot; (1966) was a made-for-television film. In an interview in 1966, he said, &quot;I never felt comfortable being a teenage dreamboat... I regard myself as a craftsman.&quot;

He portrayed Marco Polo in episode 26 of &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; (&quot;Attack of the Barbarians&quot;), originally broadcast on March 10, 1967, and was a guest actor on &quot;Bonanza&quot; in 1967 (&quot;The Conquistadores&quot;). In episode 19, season 5 of &quot;The Virginian&quot; (&quot;The Modoc Kid&quot;) Saxon appeared in the title role alongside Harrison Ford, who was appearing in one of his first speaking roles. And in 1969 he appeared in Bonanza again (&quot;My Friend, My Enemy&quot;).

Saxon was in a sex comedy for Sam Katzman, &quot;For Singles Only&quot; (1968), and appeared in some Westerns, &quot;One Dollar Too Many&quot; (1968), &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot; (1969), &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; (rebranded name for &quot;The Virginian&quot;, 1971), and &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; (1972) (again playing a Mexican, this time a revolutionary named Luis Chama). &quot;I Kiss the Hand&quot; (1973) was a thriller made in Italy.

He spent three years playing Dr. Theodore Stuart for the television series &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot; (1969–1972).

===&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and 1970s===

Saxon, who had done martial arts since 1957, appeared as the martial artist Roper in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. It was Bruce Lee&#x27;s first major role in a Hollywood feature. He almost backed out of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, on account of the script being too light. &quot;It was a 60-page treatment&quot;, said Saxon in a 2002 interview. &quot;I thought: there’s not enough to act here. A stunt man could play it. But they talked me into it, saying they would work in my suggestions. Some things they shot and kept in the film, but most of it they discarded.&quot; After &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, Saxon had no further interest in appearing in martial-arts films.

He was in such action films as &quot;Mitchell&quot; (1975), &quot;The Swiss Conspiracy&quot; (1975), &quot;Strange Shadows in an Empty Room&quot; (1976), &quot;Napoli violenta&quot; (1976), &quot;Mark Strikes Again&quot; (1976), &quot;A Special Cop in Action&quot; (1976), &quot;Cross Shot&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Cynic, the Rat and the Fist&quot; (1977).

In 1974, he appeared as police Lieutenant Fuller in the slasher horror film &quot;Black Christmas&quot;. From 1974 to 1976, he appeared in &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, first as Major Frederick Sloan and then as Nedlick. This role also extended into &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;. The actor&#x27;s likeness was later used for the Kenner action-figure doll called &quot;Maskatron&quot; that was based on the series.

Saxon starred as Dylan Hunt in the 1974 Gene Roddenberry television pilot &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, replacing Alex Cord from &quot;Genesis II&quot;. A 20th-century scientist unfrozen in the postnuclear world of 2133, he leads a team of explorers and encounters a matriarchal society. Although ABC declined the series, Saxon played a nearly identical character in the 1975 television film &quot;Strange New World&quot;.

In 1976, Saxon portrayed a homicidal vampire-like strangler in the season-two &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; episode &quot;Vampire&quot;. He played Captain Radl in the two-part &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; episode &quot;The Feminum Mystique&quot; (1976). Also in 1976, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; titled &quot;A Portrait of Elizabeth&quot;, in which he played a crooked corporate lawyer and painter named Dave Delaroux, who was involved in a securities rip-off and with whom Rockford&#x27;s attorney Beth Davenport was smitten. In this episode, Saxon was able to display his considerable martial-arts abilities in two fight scenes. &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot; (1977) was a prestige television movie for him. &quot;Moonshine County Express&quot; was a big success for Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures; Saxon made another film for that company, &quot;The Bees&quot; (1978). He appeared in a Bollywood movie, &quot;Shalimar&quot; (1978), then it was back to exploitation: &quot;Fast Company&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Glove&quot; (1979).

Saxon played Hunt Sears, chief of a breakfast-cereal conglomerate, opposite Robert Redford and Jane Fonda in the 1979, Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;.

===1980s–1990s===
He appeared in the 1982 television movie &quot;Rooster&quot;, and he was an occasional celebrity guest on the short-lived game show &quot;Whew!&quot;, including during the series&#x27; final week. His extensive television credits include two years as Tony Cumson on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1982, 1986–1988) and the recurring role of Rashid Ahmed on &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1982–84). He appeared twice (in different roles) on &quot;The A-Team&quot;, in 1983 and 1985.

Saxon played in Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1982) as the writer hero&#x27;s shifty agent; in &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; (1980) as Sador; in &quot;Cannibal Apocalypse&quot; (1980) where he played a Vietnam veteran tormented because his worthless pal bit him and years later, he is starting to get the urge to do the same; in &quot;Prisoners of the Lost Universe&quot; as an alternate-universe warlord, and in Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) as the heroine&#x27;s (Nancy Thompson&#x27;s) father. He reprised his role in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987) and &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994) as he played himself in a dual role.

He made his directorial debut in 1987 with the horror film &quot;Zombie Death House&quot;, which starred Dennis Cole and Anthony Franciosa. &quot;Filmink&quot; wrote, &quot;Few other actors of his generation have as fine a track record in&quot; horror movies. &quot;Why did he appear in so many? I guess for starters he was willing – he wasn’t snobby. He made a good on-screen cop and there’s always roles for a cop actor in a slasher film. He could also seem scary so made an excellent red herring/villain.&quot;

He starred in &quot;Blood Salvage&quot; (1990) as Clifford Evans, &quot;Maximum Force&quot; (1992) as Captain Fuller, and also appeared in &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996).

===Later career===
In his later years, Saxon continued to appear mostly in independent films and appeared in several television series. He had a notable guest part in &quot;Grave Danger&quot;, the fifth-season finale of &quot;,&quot; which was directed by &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; screenwriter and star Quentin Tarantino. Saxon starred in the episode opposite fellow cult film luminary Andrew Prine. He also appeared in an episode (&quot;Pelts&quot;) of the anthology horror series &quot;Masters of Horror,&quot; which reunited him with &quot;Tenebrae&quot; director Dario Argento.

Saxon was a regular guest at horror- and cult-film conventions, including the Creation Entertainment – Weekend of Horrors 2010 on May 21, 2010, in Los Angeles. His last acting role was in the film &quot;Bring Me the Head of Lance Henriksen&quot;, which as of his death was in postproduction.

==Personal life==
John Saxon was married three times. His first marriage was to Mary Ann Saxon, a screenwriter and television director of development. His second wife was Elizabeth (Phillips) Saxon, a former investment banker, airline union negotiator, and psychologist. John Saxon&#x27;s third and last wife was Gloria (Potts) Martel Saxon, a model and esthetician. He and Mary Ann had a son, Antonio. He was a Democrat.

Saxon held a black belt in Shotokan karate, having studied under Hidetaka Nishiyama, and was also proficient in Judo.

== Death ==

Saxon died of complications from pneumonia, on July 25, 2020, aged 83, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a city about 35 miles southeast of Nashville, where he had resided for several years. He was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, Washington, near his former co-star Bruce Lee.

<text>The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is a small freshwater mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Dreissenidae. The species originates from the lakes of southern Russia and Ukraine, but has been accidentally introduced to numerous other areas and has become an invasive species in many countries worldwide. Since the 1980s, the species has invaded the Great Lakes, Hudson River, Lake Travis, Finger Lakes, Lake Bonaparte, and Lake Simcoe. The adverse effects of dreissenid mussels on freshwater systems have led to their ranking as one of the world&#x27;s most invasive aquatic species.

The species was first described in 1769 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in the Ural, Volga, and Dnieper Rivers. Zebra mussels get their name from a striped pattern commonly seen on their shells, though it is not universally present. They are usually about the size of a fingernail, but can grow to a maximum length around . Their shells are D-shaped, and attached to the substrate with strong byssal fibers, which come out of their umbo on the dorsal (hinged) side.

== Ecology ==

Zebra mussels and the closely related and ecologically similar quagga mussels are filter-feeding organisms; they remove particles from the water column. Zebra mussels process up to of water per day, per mussel. Some particles are consumed as food, and feces are deposited on the lake floor. Nonfood particles are combined with mucus and other matter and deposited on lake floors as pseudofeces. Since the zebra mussel has become established in Lake Erie, water clarity has increased from to up to in some areas. This increased water clarity allows sunlight to penetrate deeper, enabling growth of submerged macrophytes. These plants, when decaying, wash up on shorelines, fouling beaches and causing water-quality problems.

Lake floor food supplies are enriched by zebra mussels as they filter pollution out of the water. This biomass becomes available to bottom-feeding species and to the fish that feed on them. The catch of yellow perch increased five-fold after the invasion of zebra mussels into Lake St. Clair.

Zebra mussels attach to most substrates, including sand, silt, and harder substrates, but usually juveniles prefer harder, rockier substrates on which to attach. Other mussel species frequently represent the most stable objects in silty substrates, and zebra mussels attach to and often kill these mussels. They build colonies on native unionid clams, reducing their ability to move, feed, and breed, eventually leading to their deaths. This has led to the near extinction of the unionid clams in Lake St. Clair and the western basin of Lake Erie. This pattern is being repeated in Ireland, where zebra mussels have eliminated the two freshwater mussels from several waterways, including some lakes along the River Shannon in 1997.

In 2012, the National University of Ireland, Galway, said &quot;the discovery of zebra mussels (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;) in Lough Derg and the lower Shannon region in 1997 has led to considerable concern about the potential ecological and economic damage that this highly invasive aquatic nuisance species can cause.&quot;

The zebra mussel is a freshwater species and cannot survive in the ocean.

=== Life cycle ===

The lifespan of a zebra mussel is four to five years. A female zebra mussel begins to reproduce within 6–7 weeks of settling.
An adult female zebra mussel can produce 30,000 to 40,000 eggs in each reproductive cycle, and over 1 million each year. Free-swimming microscopic larvae, called veligers, drift in the water for several weeks and then settle onto any hard surface they can find. Zebra mussels also can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, and adults can even survive out of water for about seven days.

===Indicators of environmental pollution===

Zebra mussels can be used to detect risks to humans from environmental hazards and are considered effective indicators of environmental pollution. Exposure of &quot;D. polymorpha&quot; gill cells to model contaminants representative of water pollution was found to cause DNA damage measured as the formation of 8-oxodG and DNA strand breaks.

=== Predators ===

Research on natural enemies, both in Europe and North America, has focused on predators, particularly birds (36 species) and fish (15 species eating veligers and 38 eating attached mussels). Annually, the wintering waterbirds at Lake Constance decrease zebra mussel biomass in shallow areas by &gt;90%. Biomass reduction in deeper areas varies considerably based on substratum; Werner &quot;et al.&quot; observed no reduction at the lowest observed depth of except for a site at Hagnau.

The vast majority of the organism&#x27;s natural enemies are not present in North America. Ecologically similar species do exist, but these species are unlikely to be able to eliminate those mussels already established and have a limited role in their control unlike their counterparts in Europe.

It is pointed out that crayfish could have a significant impact on the densities of -long zebra mussels. An adult crayfish consumes around 105 zebra mussels every day, or about 6,000 mussels in a season. However, predation rates are significantly reduced at lower water temperatures. Additionally, certain fish, such as the Smallmouth bass, is a predator in the zebra mussels&#x27; adopted North American Great Lakes habitat, but in European lakes, fish do not seem to limit the densities of zebra mussels.

There have been some high winter mortalities, for example in the winter of 1994–1995 in the invasive population of Lake Simcoe. Evans &quot;et al.&quot;, 2011 attributes this to predation by the crayfish &quot;Orconectes propinquus&quot;. Nonetheless this has not been sufficient to eradicate the problem.

=== Other control ===
On June 4, 2014, Canadian conservation authorities announced that a test using liquid fertilizer to kill invasive zebra mussels was successful. This test was conducted in a lakefront harbor in the western province of Manitoba. However, outbreaks continue in Lake Winnipeg.

Similar tests were run in Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan, using zequanox, a biopesticide. Niclosamide proves effective in killing invasive zebra mussels in cool waters.

== As an invasive species ==
===Europe===
The native distribution of the species is in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea in Eurasia. Zebra mussels have become an invasive species in North America, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. They disrupt the ecosystems by monotypic colonization, and damage harbors and waterways, ships and boats, and water-treatment and power plants. Water-treatment plants are most affected because the water intakes bring the microscopic, free-swimming larvae directly into the facilities. Zebra mussels also cling to pipes under the water and clog them.

Grossinger reported it in Hungary in 1794. Kerney and Morton described the rapid colonization of Britain by the zebra mussel, first in Cambridgeshire in the 1820s, London in 1824, and in the Union Canal near Edinburgh in 1834.

In 1827, zebra mussels were seen in the Netherlands at Rotterdam. Canals that artificially link many European waterways facilitated their early dispersal. It is nonindigenous in the Czech Republic in the Elbe River in Bohemia since 1893; in southern Moravia, it is probably native. Around 1920 the mussels reached Lake Mälaren in Sweden.

The first appearance of the organism in northern Italy was in Lake Garda in 1973; in central Italy, they appeared in Tuscany in 2003.

Zebra mussels are present in British waterways. Many water companies are reporting having problems with their water-treatment plants with the mussels attaching themselves to pipeworks. Anglian Water has estimated that it costs £500,000 per year to remove the mussels from their treatment plants. Zebra mussels arguably have also had an effect on fishing, for example at Salford Quays, where their introduction has changed the environment for the fish.

Zebra mussels were first reported in Ireland in 1997, but probably arrived in 1994 or earlier. First identified near Lough Derg, they may have been introduced to Ireland through several vectors but have since spread through much of the River Shannon and its adjacent waters. In the summers of 2023 and 2024, zebra mussels were one contributing factor to a major bloom of toxic cyanobacteria in Lough Neagh, the largest body of freshwater in the United Kingdom. In 2021 the similar quagga mussel was identified in the Shannon, which is capable of tolerating a wider range of environmental conditions. The spread of quagga mussels is expected to reduce zebra mussel populations over time while increasing the overall environmental impact.

The mussels have displaced native species of molluscs in Lake Constance, reaching densities of up to . The mussels present a food source to waterfowl and have caused bird numbers to double over the last 30 years. By the end of winter, birds decimate zebra mussel populations and reduce them by 95–99% up to the maximum depth reachable by birds of c. . The estimated quantity of consumed zebra mussels is . Zebra mussel populations recover annually, indicating that waterfowl may control infested bodies of water but not reverse the infestation status entirely.

=== North America ===
They were first detected in Canada in the Great Lakes in 1988, in Lake St. Clair. They are thought to have been inadvertently introduced into the lakes by the ballast water of ocean-going ships that were traversing the St. Lawrence Seaway. Another possible, but unproven, mode of introduction is on anchors and chains. Since adult zebra mussels can survive out of water for several days or weeks if the temperature is low and humidity is high, chain lockers provide temporary refuge for clusters of adult mussels that could easily be released when transoceanic ships drop anchor in freshwater ports. They have become an invasive species in North America, and as such, they are the target of federal policy to control them, for instance in the National Invasive Species Act (1996).

Using models based on the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), a group of researchers predicted that the Southeastern United States is moderately to highly likely to be inhabited by zebra mussels and the Midwest unlikely to experience a zebra mussel invasion of water bodies. This model, though, has since been proven incorrect. In 2006, a researcher (also using GARP) predicted invasion as far west as the North Platte River by 2015. As of March 2016, zebra mussels have affected hundreds of lakes in the Midwest including Lake Michigan, and the largest interior lake in Wisconsin, Lake Winnebago.

Congressional researchers have estimated that the zebra mussel has cost businesses and communities over $5 billion since their initial invasion. Zebra mussels have cost power companies alone over $3 billion.

On 2 March 2021, the US Geological Survey was notified that zebra mussels had been discovered in marimo moss balls, a common aquarium plant, sold in pet stores across North America. By 8 March, the invasive species were detected in moss balls in 30 different states at multiple retail locations in the United States. These discoveries were prompted by the initial find at a Petco in Seattle. Infested-moss balls have also been found from online retailers and smaller, independent stores. Though it is more difficult to know the extent of the spread at a larger scale, Wesley Daniel, a fisheries biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, says that about 30% of the inventory pulled from shelves were found to contain the zebra mussels.

After working with the USGS, PetSmart and Petco voluntarily recalled their moss balls due to the potential harm zebra mussels could cause to indigenous ecosystems. As of November 2021, nearly eight months after the recall, marimo moss balls have not returned to shelves.

==== By location ====

From their first appearance in North American waters in 1988, zebra mussels have spread to a large number of waterways, including Lake Simcoe in the Great Lakes region, the Mississippi, Hudson, St. Lawrence, Ohio, Cumberland, Missouri, Tennessee, Huron, Colorado, and Arkansas rivers, and, by mid-2023, 31 lakes and seven river basins in Texas. However, zebra mussels could not establish reproducing populations in Kentucky Lake (Tennessee River). This may be due to relatively low dissolved calcium levels in this water body.

In 2009, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation confirmed that zebra mussels had been found in Laurel Lake in the Berkshires. That same year, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources announced that live zebra mussels had been found in Pelican Lake. This was the first confirmed sighting in the Red River Basin, which extends across the international border into the province of Manitoba. In 2013, their presence in Manitoba&#x27;s Lake Winnipeg was confirmed, and aggressive efforts to eradicate them in 2014 have not succeeded. New contamination was found outside treated areas of Lake Winnipeg in 2015, and they have also been found in the Red River near the lake in Selkirk Park in 2015. Large numbers were seen at Grand Beach in 2017.

In July 2010, the North Dakota Game and Fish Department confirmed the presence of zebra mussel veliger in the Red River between Wahpeton, North Dakota, and Breckenridge, Minnesota. , California similarly reported invasions.

In 2011, an invasion of zebra mussels shut down a water pipeline in the Dallas area. This resulted in reduced water supplies during a drought year, worsening water restrictions across the Dallas area.

A common inference made by scientists predicts that the zebra mussel will continue spreading passively, by ship and by pleasure craft, to more rivers in North America. Trailered boat traffic is the most likely vector for invasion into Western North America. This spread is preventable if boaters thoroughly clean and dry their boats and associated equipment before transporting them to new bodies of water. Since no North American predator or combination of predators has been shown to significantly reduce zebra mussel numbers, such spread would most likely result in permanent establishment of zebra mussels in many North American waterways.

A major decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen was observed in the Seneca River in central New York in the summer of 1993. This decrease was caused by extremely high concentrations of zebra mussels in the watershed. Additionally, the Seneca River had significantly less chlorophyll in the water, which is used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, because of the presence of zebra mussels.

==== Cost ====
The cost of fighting the pests at power plants and other water-consuming facilities is substantial, but the magnitude of the damages is a matter of some controversy. According to the Center for Invasive Species Research at the University of California, Riverside, the cost of management of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes alone exceeds $500 million per year. A more conservative study estimated total economic costs of $267 million for electric-generation and water-treatment facilities in the entire United States from 1989 through 2004. In a study conducted by the US Department of State in 2009, the total cost of the zebra mussel invasion is estimated at 3.1 billion over the next 10 years.

Concerns are also high following the contamination of zebra mussels in at home aquariums. If zebra mussels had reached open water in Seattle, Washington, where the first case was confirmed, the invasive species would have cost the state $100 million each year in maintenance for power and water systems.

== Effects ==
As with most bivalves, zebra mussels are filter feeders. When in the water, they open their shells to admit detritus. Their shells are very sharp and are known for cutting people&#x27;s feet, resulting in the need to wear water shoes wherever they are prevalent.

Since their colonization of the Great Lakes, they have covered the undersides of docks, boats, and anchors. They have also spread into streams and rivers throughout the U.S. In some areas, they completely cover the substrate, sometimes covering other freshwater mussels. They can grow so densely that they block pipelines, clogging water intakes of municipal water supplies and hydroelectric companies. Zebra mussels do not attach to cupronickel alloys, which can be used to coat intake and discharge grates, navigational buoys, boats, and motors where the species tends to congregate.

Zebra mussels are believed to be the source of deadly avian botulism poisoning that has killed tens of thousands of birds in the Great Lakes since the late 1990s. They are edible, but since they are so efficient at filtering water, they tend to accumulate pollutants and toxins, so most experts recommend against consuming zebra mussels.

Zebra mussels affect all classes of algal species, resulting in a shortage of food sources to native species of freshwater mussels and fish in the Great Lakes.

However, zebra mussels and other non-native species are credited with the increased population and size of smallmouth bass in Lake Erie and yellow perch in Lake St. Clair. They cleanse the waters of inland lakes, resulting in increased sunlight penetration and growth of native algae at greater depths. This cleansing also increases water visibility and filters out pollutants. Each quagga and zebra mussel filters about of water per day when confined to small tanks. In lakes, their filtering effects are usually spatially restricted (near the lake bottom) because of nonhomogeneous water column mixing.

In Lake Pleshcheyevo in Russia, zebra mussels have greatly changed the fish community. All fish species remained in the lake, but catches changed significantly. Gillnets set in the littoral and sublittoral zones during the feeding period consist mainly of large roach and perch while vendace were prevalent in the pelagic zone. The abundance of benthophagous fishes increased slightly due to the presence of the zebra mussel which made up a significant part of the diet followed by an increase (p&lt;0.05) in the growth rates of roach and silver bream. The growth rates of the bream, which prefers soft zoobenthos, decreased. In addition, the formation of a stable biocenosis of zebra mussels in the lake probably caused changes in the spatial structure of the fish community. What is notable is the disappearance of small roach from pelagic assemblages, probably due to alterations in the trophic links of the littoral and sublittoral zones, as well as the expected increase in food competition among pelagic fish species.

Because zebra mussels damage water intakes and other infrastructure, methods such as adding oxidants, flocculants, heat, dewatering, mechanical removal, and pipe coatings are becoming increasingly common.
== Preventing their spread ==

Zebra mussels cling to boat motors. Boat-owners should follow a few steps prior to putting their boats into a new lake and after removing their boats from infected lakes to stop the spreading of the species. Boat owners should make sure to inspect their boat, trailer, and other recreational equipment that have been in contact with water, remove all mud, plants, or animals, drain all bilge water, live wells, bait buckets, and all other water from their boats, engines and equipment, wash all parts of their boats, paddles, and other equipment that have been in contact with water, and dry their boats and trailers in the sun for five days before launching into another body of water. This is important because adult zebra mussels are able to close their shells and may survive out of water for several days. When washing their boats, boat owners should be sure to wash with warm, soapy water as well.

If marimo moss balls were purchased around the time of the first discovery and recall in March 2021, aquatic hobbyists have been urged to decontaminate the moss balls by either boiling them for at least one minute, freezing for at least 24 hours, or placing them in diluted chlorine bleach. Another way to rid of the zebra mussels can be to submerge the moss balls in undiluted white vinegar for a minimum of 20 minutes. After following one of these methods, the USGS urges owners to bag these moss balls before disposing of them in the trash to prevent spread to local water ways and ecosystems.

Even if moss balls infected with zebra mussels are contained in an aquarium, the concern that they could contaminate local waterways is high, especially in regions and states where they have not yet infested. Aquarium dumping and disposing of unwanted pets is common, according to Eric Fischer with Indiana&#x27;s Department of Natural Resources (DNR). It is illegal to own, sell, or distribute zebra mussels in the U.S. If spotted, either in an aquarium or out in nature, it is advised to contact the local DNR in the region resided. Recent research shows that zebra mussels could not establish reproducing populations in Kentucky Lake, indicating that the physico-chemical characteristics of this lake deter the species. A better understanding of the lake&#x27;s characteristics and identification of the key parameters that deter zebra mussels may pave the way for protecting other aquatic ecosystems from the spreading of this invasive species.

<text>The Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas (SCOBA) was an organization of bishops from Eastern Orthodox Christian jurisdictions in the Americas. It acted as a clearinghouse for educational, charitable, and missionary work in the Americas. In 2010, it was replaced by the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America.

The members of SCOBA were the archbishops, metropolitan bishops, and bishops of the canonical Eastern Orthodox Churches in North and South America. These are churches in full communion with the four ancient Greek Orthodox Patriarchates – Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul, Turkey), Patriarch of Antioch (now in Damascus, Syria), Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria (Egypt), Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem – and with the Patriarchate of Moscow.

== Jurisdictions ==
* Ecumenical Patriarchate
** Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America
** Albanian Orthodox Diocese of America (not to be confused with the Albanian Orthodox Archdiocese in America, which is an archdiocese within the OCA)
** American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese
** Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA
** Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada
* Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America
* Russian Orthodox Church in the USA (parishes directly under the Patriarch of Moscow)
* Serbian Orthodox Church in the USA and Canada
* Romanian Orthodox Archdiocese in America and Canada
* Bulgarian Orthodox Church Diocese of America, Canada &amp; Australia
* Orthodox Church in America (the only autocephalous Orthodox church in North America, its autocephaly granted by the Patriarch of Moscow, is however not recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, though still in communion with it)

== Agencies ==

The main agencies of SCOBA along with their dates of establishment are

* The Orthodox Christian Education Commission (OCEC), 1960 
* The Eastern Orthodox Committee on Scouting (EOCS), 1960 
* The Orthodox Christian Fellowship (OCF) 1965, 2001 
* International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), 1992
* The Orthodox Christian Mission Center (OCMC), 1994 
* The Orthodox Christian Network (OCN), 2003

<text>Papeete (Tahitian: &quot;Papeʻete&quot;, pronounced ; old name: &quot;Vaiʻete&quot;) is the capital city of French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in the Pacific Ocean. The commune of Papeete is located on the island of Tahiti, in the administrative subdivision of the Windward Islands, of which Papeete is the administrative capital. Both the President of French Polynesia and French High Commissioner reside in Papeete.

It is the primary center of Tahitian and French Polynesian public and private governmental, commercial, industrial, and financial services, the hub of French Polynesian tourism and a commonly used port of call. The Windward Islands are themselves part of the Society Islands. The name Papeetē, means &quot;water from a basket&quot;— this was an effect of a naming taboo during Pōmare I&#x27;s reign where the Tahitian contemporary word for water &quot;vai&quot; was substituted with &quot;pape&quot;, the old name Vaietē is still recognised in some areas such as the Marquesas. The urban area of Papeetē had a total population of 124,724 inhabitants at the 2022 census, 26,654 of whom lived in the commune of Papeetē proper.

==Geography==

The commune of Papeetē is subdivided into eleven &quot;quartiers&quot; (wards):
===Climate===
Papeetē features a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification) with a wet season and dry season, bordering a tropical rainforest climate, with high temperatures and humidity year round. However, precipitation is observed even during the city&#x27;s dry season. The dry season is short, covering only the months of August and September. The rest of the year is wet, with the heaviest precipitation falling in the months of December and January. Sunshine is moderately high, as most precipitation comes as thunderstorms and cyclones, and does not last for long.

== History of Papeetē ==

In 1902, it became necessary to move the post office of Papeetē to another location. Instead of demolishing it and rebuilding it at the new site, it was lifted from the subsoil and moved as a whole on a Decauville railway.

Previously, during the construction of the Faaiere water tower with a capacity of 150,000 litres for the drinking water supply of the city of Papeetē, a difference in altitude of was overcome with a light railway laid on a long inclined plane. A winch driven by a 12-horsepower Fowler or Decauville locomobile carried three narrow gauge railway trucks at a time, consuming up to of coal per day for about sixty journeys. Paul Decauville mentioned in a letter to Governor Theodore Lacascade, dated 18 June 1891, an order for &quot; of portable rail tracks and about 12,000 francs of rolling stock, payable in three years&quot;, presumably for a tramway from Papeetē to Punaauia operated by hand or animals.

At the outbreak of World War I Papeetē was shelled by German vessels, causing loss of life and significant damage.

The growth of the city was boosted by the decision to move the French nuclear weapon test range from Algeria, which had become independent, to the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa, some to the east of Tahiti. This was motivated, in particular, by the construction of the Faaā International Airport, the only international airport in French Polynesia, near Papeetē. In 1983, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built the Papeetē Tahiti Temple here because of its large number of members in the region. On 5 September 1995 the government of Jacques Chirac conducted the first of a series of nuclear test detonations off the shores of Moruroa. A resulting riot in Papeetē lasted for two days and damaged the international airport, injured 40 people, and scared away tourism for some time. Similar rioting had occurred after another French nuclear test in the same area in 1987.

== Transportation ==
The streets of the town center are very busy, and traffic can be a problem since they are very narrow. The Tahiti freeway starts close to the town center as Pōmare Boulevard, named after the Tahitian Royal Family of the 19th century. By air, passengers depart from the Faaā International Airport. Domestic interisland service is operated by Air Tahiti with international flights being operated by Air Tahiti Nui, Air France, LATAM Chile, United and other airlines. By sea, passengers can use a marine ferry service for travel to Moorea or a Bora Bora cruise line service for travel to Bora Bora.

<text>Baron Davies, of Llandinam in the County of Montgomery, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1932 for the Welsh businessman, Liberal Member of Parliament and philanthropist, David Davies. He was the grandson and namesake of the prominent industrialist David Davies Llandinam.

The second Baron Davies was the son of the first Baron and his first wife, Amy, daughter of L. T. Penman. He married Ruth, daughter of Major William Marshall Dugdale, in 1939. They had two sons. Lord Davies fought in the Second World War as a major in the Royal Welch Fusiliers and was killed on the Western Front in September 1944, aged 29, only three months after succeeding his father in the barony. His three-year-old eldest son, David, inherited the barony shortly before his fourth birthday.

As of 2025, the title is held by the fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in that year.

<text>Baron Denham, of Weston Underwood in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1937 for Sir George Bowyer, 1st Baronet, a Conservative politician who had earlier represented Buckingham in the House of Commons. He had already been created a [[baronet]], of Weston Underwood, in 1933. Bowyer was a great-great-great-grandson of Sir William Bowyer, 3rd Baronet, of Denham Court, through his fifth son (see title succession chart below).

The 1st Baron was succeeded in both titles by his second but only surviving son in 1948, who in 1950 also succeeded a distant relative in the older baronetcy, that of Denham Court. Like his father, the 2nd Baron Denham was a Conservative politician; he was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remained in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.

 the titles are held by his first son, the 3rd Baron, who succeeded in 2021.

The Bowyer baronetcy, of Denham Court in the County of Buckingham, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1660 for William Bowyer. He represented Buckinghamshire in the House of Commons.

His great-great-grandson Sir George Bowyer, third son of the 3rd Baronet, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and distinguished himself at the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794 (in which he lost a leg). For this he was created a baronet, of Radley in the County of Berkshire, in his own right. In 1799, he also succeeded his eldest brother, the 4th Baronet, in the baronetcy of Denham Court, thus becoming the 5th and 1st Baronet.

His son, the 6th and 2nd Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Malmesbury and Abingdon. He was succeeded by his son, the 7th and 3rd Baronet, who represented Dundalk and County Wexford in Parliament as a Liberal. On the death in 1950 of his nephew, the 9th and 5th Baronet, the baronetcy of Radley became extinct. The late Baronet was succeeded in the baronetcy of Denham Court by his distant relative, the aforementioned 2nd Baron Denham, 2nd Baronet, of Weston Underwood, who thus also became the 10th Baronet. The titles remain united.

The family seat is The Laundry Cottage, near Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="488957" wikidata="Q222818" url="?curid=488957" title="Eartha Kitt">
<text>Eartha Mae Kitt (née Keith; January 17, 1927 – December 25, 2008) was an American singer and actress. She was known for her highly distinctive singing style and her 1953 recordings of &quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot; and the Christmas novelty song &quot;Santa Baby&quot;.

Kitt began her career in 1942 and appeared in the 1945 original Broadway theatre production of the musical &quot;Carib Song&quot;. In the early 1950s, Kitt had six US Top 30 entries, including &quot;Uska Dara&quot; (1953) and &quot;I Want to Be Evil&quot; (1953). Her other recordings include the UK Top 10 song &quot;Under the Bridges of Paris&quot; (1954), &quot;Just an Old Fashioned Girl&quot; (1956) and &quot;Where Is My Man&quot; (1983). Orson Welles once called her the &quot;most exciting woman in the world&quot;. Kitt starred as Catwoman in the third and final season of the television series &quot;Batman&quot; in 1967.

In 1968, Kitt&#x27;s career in the U.S. deteriorated after she made anti-Vietnam War statements at a White House luncheon with Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Ten years later, Kitt made a successful return to Broadway in the 1978 original production of the musical &quot;Timbuktu!&quot;, for which she received the first of her two Tony Award nominations. Kitt&#x27;s second was for the 2000 original production of the musical &quot;The Wild Party&quot;. Kitt wrote three autobiographies.

Kitt found a new generation of fans through her various voice acting roles in the last decade of her life. She voiced the villains Yzma and Vexus in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; franchise and &quot;My Life As A Teenage Robot&quot;, with the former earning her two Daytime Emmy Awards. Kitt posthumously won a third Emmy in 2010 for her guest performance on &quot;Wonder Pets!&quot;.

==Early life==
Eartha Mae Keith was born in the small town of North, South Carolina, on January 17, 1927. Her mother, Annie Mae Keith (later Annie Mae Riley), was of Cherokee and African descent. Though she had little knowledge of her father, it was reported that he was the son of the owner of the plantation where she had been born, and that Kitt was conceived by rape. In a 2013 biography, British journalist John Williams claimed that Kitt&#x27;s father was a white man, a local doctor named Daniel Sturkie. Kitt&#x27;s daughter, Kitt McDonald Shapiro, has questioned the accuracy of the claim.

Eartha&#x27;s mother soon went to live with a black man who refused to accept Eartha because of her relatively pale complexion. Kitt was raised by a relative named Aunt Rosa, in whose household she was abused. Interviewed on BBC Wales&#x27; &quot;Late Call&quot; in 1971, Kitt said:

I remember at times when we didn&#x27;t have anything to eat for what seemed like an insurmountable amount of time. We had to rely on the forest and whatever we could dig out of the ground, such as weeds or a grass I remember that had a kind of onion growing at the bottom of it. And when we could find things like that to eat then we were alright. ... I&#x27;m very glad that [her childhood self] will always be a part of me because she helps me do what she knows I have to do out there on that stage.

After the death of Annie Mae, Eartha was sent to live with another close relative named Mamie Kitt (who Eartha later came to believe was her biological mother) in Harlem, New York City, where Eartha attended the Metropolitan Vocational High School (later renamed the High School of Performing Arts).

==Career==

Kitt began her career as a member of the Katherine Dunham Company in 1943 and remained a member of the troupe until 1948. A talented singer with a distinctive voice, Kitt recorded the hits &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot;, &quot;Champagne Taste&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot; (which Stan Freberg famously burlesqued), &quot;Just an Old Fashioned Girl&quot;, &quot;Monotonous&quot;, &quot;Je cherche un homme&quot;, &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Burned as a Witch&quot;, &quot;Kâtibim&quot; (a Turkish melody), &quot;Mink, Schmink&quot;, &quot;Under the Bridges of Paris&quot;, and her most recognizable hit &quot;Santa Baby&quot;, which was released in 1953. Kitt&#x27;s unique style was enhanced as she became fluent in French during her years performing in Europe. Kitt spoke four languages and sang in 11, which she demonstrated in many of the live recordings of her cabaret performances.

===Career peaks===

In 1950, Orson Welles gave Kitt her first starring role as Helen of Troy in his staging of &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot;. Two years later, Kitt was cast in the revue &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot;, introducing &quot;Monotonous&quot; and &quot;Bal, Petit Bal&quot;, two songs with which she is still identified. In 1954, 20th Century-Fox distributed an independently filmed version of the revue entitled &quot;New Faces&quot;, in which Kitt performed &quot;Monotonous&quot;, &quot;Uska Dara&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot;, and &quot;Santa Baby&quot;. Though it is often alleged that Welles and Kitt had an affair during her 1957 run in &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;, Kitt categorically denied this in a June 2001 interview with George Wayne of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. &quot;I never had sex with Orson Welles,&quot; Kitt told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;: &quot;It was a working situation and nothing else.&quot; Her other films in the 1950s included &quot;The Mark of the Hawk&quot; (1957), &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1958) and &quot;Anna Lucasta&quot; (1958).

Throughout the rest of the 1950s and early 1960s, Kitt recorded; worked in film, television, and nightclubs; and returned to the Broadway stage, in &quot;Mrs. Patterson&quot; (during the 1954–1955 season), &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot; (in 1957), and the short-lived &quot;Jolly&#x27;s Progress&quot; (in 1959). In 1964, Kitt helped open the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, California. In the late 1960s, &quot;Batman&quot; featured Kitt as Catwoman after Julie Newmar had left the show in 1967. She appeared in a 1967 &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Traitor&quot;, as Tina Mara, a contortionist.

In 1956, Kitt published an autobiography called &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot;, which would later serve as inspiration for the name of the 1999 David Bowie song &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot;.

===The &quot;White House Incident&quot;===
On January 18, 1968,&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/kitt-lady-bird-vietnam&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; during Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s administration, Kitt encountered a substantial professional setback after she made anti-war statements during a White House luncheon. Kitt was asked by First Lady Lady Bird Johnson about the Vietnam War. She replied: &quot;You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. No wonder the kids rebel and take pot.&quot;
During a question-and-answer session, Kitt stated:

Kitt&#x27;s remarks reportedly caused Mrs. Johnson to burst into tears. It is widely believed&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter/1343319513769660416&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that Kitt&#x27;s career in the United States was ended following her comments about the Vietnam War,&lt;ref name=&quot;mpr/2006/01/27_kerre_kitt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; after which she was branded &quot;a sadistic nymphomaniac&quot; by the CIA. A CIA dossier about Kitt was discovered by Seymour Hersh in 1975. Hersh published an article about the dossier in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The dossier contained comments about Kitt&#x27;s sex life and family history, along with negative opinions of her that were held by former colleagues. Kitt&#x27;s response to the dossier was to say: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand what this is about. I think it&#x27;s disgusting.&quot; Following the incident, Kitt devoted her energies to performances in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Eartha-Kit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2022, &quot;Catwoman vs. the White House&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;scottcalonico/catwoman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; short documentary, directed by Scott Calonico used photos, clippings and footage to show how Kitt disrupted the White House luncheon, taking Lyndon B. Johnson to task.&lt;ref name=&quot;openculture/kitt-truth-power-1968&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitt would later return to the White House on 29 January 1978 after accepting an invitation from U.S. President Jimmy Carter to attend a reception honoring the 10th anniversary of the reopening of Ford&#x27;s Theatre.

===Broadway===
In the 1970s, Kitt appeared on television several times on BBC&#x27;s long-running variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, and in 1987 took over from fellow American Dolores Gray in the London West End production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; and returned at the end of that run to star in a one-woman-show at the same Shaftesbury Theatre, both to tremendous acclaim. In both those shows, Kitt performed the show-stopping theatrical anthem &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;. Kitt returned to New York City in a triumphant turn in the Broadway spectacle &quot;Timbuktu!&quot; (a version of the perennial &quot;Kismet&quot;, set in Africa) in 1978. In the musical, one song gives a &quot;recipe&quot; for &quot;mahoun&quot;, a preparation of cannabis, in which her sultry purring rendition of the refrain &quot;constantly stirring with a long wooden spoon&quot; was distinctive. Kitt was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance. In the late 1990s, Kitt appeared as the Wicked Witch of the West in the North American national touring company of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. In 2000, she again returned to Broadway in the short-lived run of Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Party&quot;. Beginning in late 2000, Kitt starred as the Fairy Godmother in the U.S. national tour of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In 2003, she replaced Chita Rivera in &quot;Nine&quot;. Kitt reprised her role as the Fairy Godmother at a special engagement of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which took place at Lincoln Center during the holiday season of 2004. From October to early December 2006, Kitt co-starred in the off-Broadway musical &quot;Mimi le Duck&quot;.

===Voice-over===
In 1978, Kitt did the voice-over in a television commercial for the album &quot;Aja&quot; by the rock group Steely Dan. In 1988, she voiced &quot;Vietnam After The Fire&quot;. a British documentary which looked at the legacy left to the Vietnamese people after the devastation of the war and showed the effects of bombings and defoliants on farmland and forests 13 years after the war ended. One of Kitt&#x27;s more unusual roles was as Kaa in a 1994 BBC Radio adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. In 1998, she voiced Bagheera in the live-action direct-to-video Disney film &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;. Kitt also lent her distinctive voice to Yzma in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (for which she won her first Annie Award) and reprised her role in &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;, for which Kitt won two Emmy Awards and, in 2007–08, two more Annie Awards for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production. From 2002 to 2006, she also voiced the villain Vexus in the Nickelodeon series &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;.

===Later years===
====1980s====
In 1984, Kitt returned to the music charts with a disco song titled &quot;Where Is My Man&quot;, the first certified gold record of her career. &quot;Where Is My Man&quot; reached the Top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 36; the song became a standard in discos and dance clubs of the time and made the Top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart, where it reached No. 7. The single was followed by the album &quot;I Love Men&quot; on the Record Shack label. Kitt found new audiences in nightclubs across the UK and the United States, including a whole new generation of gay male fans, and she responded by frequently giving benefit performances in support of HIV/AIDS organizations. Kitt&#x27;s 1989 follow-up hit &quot;Cha-Cha Heels&quot; (featuring Bronski Beat), which was originally intended to be recorded by Divine, received a positive response from UK dance clubs, reaching No. 32 in the charts in that country. In 1988, Kitt replaced Dolores Gray in the West End production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; as Carlotta, receiving standing ovations every night for her rendition of &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; at the beginning of act 2. Kitt went on to perform her own one-woman show at the Shaftesbury Theatre to sold-out houses for three weeks in early 1989 after &quot;Follies&quot;.

====1990s====
Kitt appeared with Jimmy James and George Burns at a fundraiser in 1990 produced by Scott Sherman, an agent from the Atlantic Entertainment Group. It was arranged that James would impersonate Kitt and then Kitt would walk out to take the microphone. This was met with a standing ovation. In 1991, Kitt returned to the screen in &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot; as Old Lady Hackmore. In 1992, she had a supporting role as Lady Eloise in &quot;Boomerang&quot;. In 1995, Kitt appeared as herself in an episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot;, where she performed a song in French and flirted with Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy). In November 1996, Kitt appeared in an episode of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;. She also did a series of commercials for Old Navy.

====2000s====
In 2000, Kitt won an Annie Award for her starring voice role as Yzma in the Disney feature film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, later reprising the role in 2005 in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot;. Kitt returned once again to the silver screen in 2003 with the charming role of Madame Zeroni in the film &quot;Holes&quot; based on the book by the same name, by author Louis Sachar. In August 2007, Kitt was the spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics&#x27; Smoke Signals collection. She re-recorded &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; for the occasion, was showcased on the MAC website, and the song was played at all MAC locations carrying the collection for the month. Kitt also appeared in the 2007 independent film &quot;And Then Came Love&quot; opposite Vanessa Williams. In her later years, Kitt made annual appearances in the New York Manhattan cabaret scene at venues such as the Ballroom and the Café Carlyle. As noted, Kitt did voice work for the animated projects &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and its spinoffs, as well as for &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;. In April 2008, just months before her death, Kitt appeared at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival; the performance was recorded. Kitt voiced herself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Once Upon a Time in Springfield&quot;, where she is depicted as a former lover of Krusty the Clown.

==Personal life==
Kitt married John William McDonald, an associate of a real estate investment company, on June 9, 1960. Their daughter, Kitt McDonald, was born on November 26, 1961, and was baptized Catholic at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church. Eartha Kitt and McDonald separated on July 1, 1963, and divorced on March 26, 1964.

A longtime Connecticut resident, Kitt lived in a converted barn on a sprawling farm in the Merryall section of New Milford for many years and was active in local charities and causes throughout Litchfield County. She later moved to Pound Ridge, New York, but returned in 2002 to the southern Fairfield County, Connecticut town of Weston, in order to be near her daughter Kitt and family. Her daughter, Kitt, married Charles Lawrence Shapiro in 1987.

==Activism==
Kitt was active in numerous social causes in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, she established the Kittsville Youth Foundation, a chartered and non-profit organization for underprivileged youths in the Watts area of Los Angeles. Kitt was also involved with a group of youths in the area of Anacostia in Washington, D.C., who called themselves &quot;Rebels with a Cause&quot;. She supported the group&#x27;s efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas in an effort to keep them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Education and Labor. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels&#x27; &quot;achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult &#x27;do-gooders&#x27; realize that these young men and women have performed in 1 short year – with limited finances – that which was not achieved by the same people who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it&quot;. Kitt added that &quot;the Rebels could act as a model for all urban areas throughout the United States with similar problems&quot;. &quot;Rebels with a Cause&quot; subsequently received the needed funding. Kitt was also a member of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom; her criticism of the Vietnam War and its connection to poverty and racial unrest in 1968 can be seen as part of a larger commitment to peace activism. Like many politically active public figures of her time, Kitt was under surveillance by the CIA, beginning in 1956. After &quot;The New York Times&quot; discovered the CIA file on Kitt in 1975, she granted the paper permission to print portions of the report, stating: &quot;I have nothing to be afraid of and I have nothing to hide.&quot;

Kitt later became a vocal advocate for LGBT rights and publicly supported same-sex marriage, which she considered a civil right. She had been quoted as saying: &quot;I support it [gay marriage] because we&#x27;re asking for the same thing. If I have a partner and something happens to me, I want that partner to enjoy the benefits of what we have reaped together. It&#x27;s a civil-rights thing, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Kitt famously appeared at many LGBT fundraisers, including a mega event in Baltimore, Maryland, with George Burns and Jimmy James. Scott Sherman, an agent at Atlantic Entertainment Group, stated: &quot;Eartha Kitt is fantastic... appears at so many LGBT events in support of civil rights.&quot; In a 1992 interview with Dr. Anthony Clare, Kitt spoke about her gay following, saying:
==Death==
Kitt died of colon cancer on Christmas Day 2008 at her home in Weston, Connecticut; she was 81 years old. Her daughter, Kitt McDonald, described her last days with her mother:

<text>The ancient universities of Scotland () are medieval and renaissance universities that continue to exist in the present day. Together, the four universities are the oldest universities in continuous operation in the English-speaking world after the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The majority of the ancient universities of the British Isles are located within Scotland, and have a number of distinctive features in common, being governed by a series of measures laid down in the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858–1966. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 uses the term &#x27;older universities&#x27; to refer to St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The four universities are generally regarded as the country&#x27;s most selective, eminent and well-ranked universities.

In common with the other ancient universities of the United Kingdom, the Scottish ancients find themselves administered in a quite different fashion from the new universities (there are now fifteen universities in Scotland) and are granted a number of privileges as a result of their different status. The ancient universities are part of twenty-seven culturally significant institutions recognised by the British monarchy as privileged bodies of the United Kingdom.

==Foundation and development==
The surviving ancient universities in Scotland are, in order of formation:

==Members==
===St Andrews===

The University of St Andrews traces its origin to a society formed in 1410 by Laurence of Lindores, archdeacon Richard Cornwall, bishop William Stephenson and others. Bishop Henry Wardlaw (died 1440) issued a charter in 1411 and attracted the most learned men in Scotland as professors. In 1413 Avignon Pope Benedict XIII issued six bulls confirming the charter and constituting the society a university.

All of the ancient universities with the exception of St Andrews were both universities and colleges, with both titles being used. However the University of St Andrews was a traditional collegiate university with a number of colleges. Today, only two statutory colleges exist: United College and the much smaller St Mary&#x27;s College for students of theology.

In 1897 a third college was created when University College Dundee (founded in 1891) was incorporated and absorbed into St Andrews University (1897). University College subsequently became Queen&#x27;s College (1954). In 1978 Queen&#x27;s College separated from the University of St Andrews to become the independent University of Dundee. A fourth non-statutory college, St Leonard&#x27;s College was founded in 1972 using the name of an earlier institution as a formal grouping of postgraduate students. In 2022, the university announced its intention to found New College, which would form a new hub for the schools of economics and finance, international relations, and management.

===Glasgow===

The University of Glasgow was founded in 1451 by a charter or papal bull from Pope Nicholas V, at the suggestion of King James II, giving Bishop William Turnbull, a graduate of the University of St Andrews, permission to add a university to the city&#x27;s Cathedral. It is the second-oldest university in Scotland after St Andrews and the fourth-oldest in the English-speaking world. The universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen were ecclesiastical foundations, while Edinburgh was a civic foundation. As one of the ancient universities of the United Kingdom, Glasgow is one of only eight institutions to award undergraduate master&#x27;s degrees in certain disciplines.

===Aberdeen===

No college is mentioned in the foundation bill, only a university and it was the &quot;University of Aberdeen&quot; by that name which was established in 1495. Subsequently, a single college, originally known as St. Mary of the Nativity, was established (it was founded by William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, who drafted a request on behalf of King James IV to Pope Alexander VI which resulted in a papal bull being issued). Soon the entity came to be called King&#x27;s College, after its royal founder James IV.

A separate university (Marischal College) was founded in 1593. In 1860, King&#x27;s merged with Marischal College. While both institutions were universities and would be considered ancient, the act of parliament uniting the two specified that the date of the foundation of the new united university would be taken to be that of the older King&#x27;s College.

Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century university prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge). In addition, Fraserburgh University was set up to the north of Aberdeen in Fraserburgh in 1595, but was closed down about a decade later. A further institute that was established in 1750 under the wishes of Robert Gordon, a wealthy University of Aberdeen alumnus, has since evolved into the modern Robert Gordon University.

===Edinburgh===

Founded by the Edinburgh Town Council, the university began as a college of law using part of a legacy left by a graduate of the University of St Andrews, Bishop Robert Reid of St Magnus Cathedral, Orkney. The university was established by a royal charter granted by James VI in April 1582, and instruction began under the charge of theologian Robert Rollock in October 1583. As the first Scottish university to be founded by royal charter at the urging of the &#x27;town council and burges of Edinburgh&#x27;, rather than through papal bulls as had been the case for the three older universities, this set a new precedent. Despite this difference, it is universally considered one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland (and ten years older than the youngest ancient university, the Trinity College Dublin), a status affirmed by the Scottish Government.

==Anomalies==
===University of Dundee===
The University of Dundee gained independent university status by royal charter in 1967, having previously been a college of the University of St Andrews. While not governed by the Universities (Scotland) Acts, the institution&#x27;s Royal Charter provided for it to adopt the characteristics of ancient university governance such as the academic senate, awarding the undergraduate MA degree and electing a Rector.

As a consequence, some sources have grouped the University of Dundee among the ancient universities. The label has also been used by the university itself. In a Scottish Government report published in 2019, Dundee is classified as a &#x27;Chartered&#x27; university, alongside Strathclyde, Heriot-Watt, and Stirling, as opposed to an &#x27;Ancient&#x27; university.

At the installation of the university&#x27;s Rector in 2007, the Principal and Vice Chancellor Sir Alan Langlands addressed the issue, noting: 
===University of Aberdeen===

Despite being held as an ancient university, the University of Aberdeen was only created in 1860. The university was formed by the amalgamation of two existing ancient universities within Aberdeen, which were:
* University and King&#x27;s College of Aberdeen; founded 1495
* Marischal College and University of Aberdeen; founded 1593

The two universities, generally known simply as King&#x27;s College and Marischal College, were united into the modern University of Aberdeen by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858. The act of parliament uniting the two universities specified that the date of the foundation of the new united university would be taken to be that of the older King&#x27;s College, 1495. Another, short-lived, university existed in the Aberdeenshire town of Fraserburgh from 1595 to 1605 (University of Fraserburgh).

In modern times, former college names may refer to specific university buildings, such as the King&#x27;s College and Marischal College buildings in Aberdeen, the Old College and New College at Edinburgh and the &#x27;Old College&#x27; to refer to the former buildings of the University of Glasgow before its move in the 19th century to Gilmorehill.

==Undergraduate Master of Arts degree==
The ancient universities are distinctive in offering the Magister Artium/Master of Arts (M.A.) as an undergraduate academic degree. This is sometimes known as the Scottish MA, though it is offered by fewer than a third of Scotland&#x27;s Universities.

==Universities (Scotland) Acts==

The Universities (Scotland) Acts created a distinctive system of governance for the ancient universities in Scotland, the process beginning with the 1858 Act and ending with the 1966 Act. Despite not being founded until after the first in these series of Acts, the University of Dundee shares all the features contained therein.

As a result of these Acts, each of these universities is governed by a tripartite system of General Council, University Court, and Academic Senate.

The chief executive and chief academic is the University Principal who also holds the title of Vice-Chancellor as an honorific. The Chancellor is a titular non-resident head to each university and is elected for life by the respective General Council, although in actuality a good number of Chancellors resign before the end of their &quot;term of office&quot;.

Each also has a students&#x27; representative council (SRC) as required by statute, although at the University of Aberdeen this has recently been renamed, the &quot;Students&#x27; Association Council&quot; (the Students&#x27; Association having been the parent body of the SRC).

==Status==
===Student body===
In the 2022–23 academic year, 106,480 students were enrolled at the four institutions: 43,520 were from Scotland (40.9%), 21,110 from the rest of the United Kingdom (19.8%) and 41,615 were from overseas (39.1%).

The Scottish Government enforces a quota on the number of undergraduate places available for students from Scotland and as a result, entry to the four universities are selective. Entrance typically requires strong performances in standardised exams as represented by the average scores of new entrants when converted to UCAS points. All four universities were in the top ten British universities by entry standards for 2021 entry with St Andrews: 1st, Glasgow: joint 2nd (along with Cambridge), Edinburgh: 7th and Aberdeen: 8th.&lt;ref name=&quot;T/ST Entry&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from private education are over-represented at the ancient universities with the four universities hosting the highest proportion of privately educated students out of all Scottish universities in 2020/21 (St Andrews: 36.9%, Edinburgh: 35.5%, Glasgow: 16.1% and Aberdeen: 15.8%). St Andrews&#x27; and Edinburgh&#x27;s higher proportion of private school students are due to the two universities recruiting &quot;substantial numbers of students from the rest of the United Kingdom, many of whom come from prosperous English families and attended private schools&quot; according to a report commissioned for the Scottish Government. In Scotland, around 4 per cent of the school-age population attend private schools and 11 per cent of all higher education students in Scottish institutions have attended private schools.


===Funding and finances===

The total annual income for the ancient universities for 2023–24 was £2.911 billion of which £683.5 million was from research grants and contracts, with an operating surplus of £831.9 million. A total of £1.165 billion was from tuition fees and education contracts, with £94.6 million received from students domiciled in Scotland, £142.9 million from students from the rest of the United Kingdom and £861.5 million was received from overseas students. A further £511.5 million was received from funding body grants. 

The universities hold a total endowment value of £1.034 billion and total net assets of £5.342 billion. The table below is a record of each ancient universities&#x27; financial data for the 2023–24 financial year:

===Rankings and reputation===
In the 2025 national league table rankings, the ancient universities of Scotland are placed within the top twenty in both of &quot;The Guardian University Guide&quot; and in &quot;The Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide&quot;. In the 2025 global rankings, the ancient universities featured in the world&#x27;s top 250 universities in both of the &quot;QS&quot; and the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;.

==Criticism==
The ancient universities have faced criticism for their inability to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In 2014, approximately 48 per cent of the undergraduate population at the four universities comprises Scottish students, with over half of them having received their education from independent schools in Scotland. 71 per cent of independent school entrants gained a place in one of the four ancient universities, compared with only 29 per cent of state school entrants. In addition, fewer than one in seven students at the four ancient universities in Scotland are from working-class backgrounds. Alumni dominate the top levels of the civil service, law, politics, and media. Notably, more than half of Scotland&#x27;s top media professionals and 46 per cent of the country&#x27;s MPs are alumni of these universities. Graduates from the ancients hold a greater influence in the Scottish Government, with 90 per cent of cabinet members and 70 per cent of all ministers having attended one of the ancients. This has prompted claims of elitism, social division and the universities being less inclusive.

Following increasing pressures to address widening access concerns, in 2019, the Scottish Government ordered universities to create lower admissions thresholds for applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. Alex Massie of &quot;The Times&quot; has commented that the new widening access targets for Scotland-domiciled students have now meant that there is &quot;no chance&quot; of admission into competitive courses at the ancient universities unless Scottish applicants have a widening access flag in their application. Scotland&#x27;s Commissioner for Fair Access, Sir Peter Scott, had previously stated that middle-class Scottish students with strong academic results had &quot;no entitlement&quot; to enter ancient universities. Concerns over the Scottish Government&#x27;s approach to funding has also led to accusations that the ancients are incentivised to attract students from the rest of the United Kingdom and from overseas, with all ancient universities of Scotland amongst the most reliant universities in the UK for teaching income from international students.

For the 2016-17 admissions cycle, ancient universities were criticised for the number of clearing places they had for Scottish students. Edinburgh offered 130 courses to students from the rest of the United Kingdom, but only one to Scottish students. Similarly, Aberdeen only offered one course in clearing for Scottish students but 79 for the rest of the UK, while Glasgow offered 5 and 497 courses respectively. St Andrews did not participate in clearing and offered no courses to either Scottish students or students from the rest of the UK.

==Later universities==

Following the creation of the ancient universities before the end of the 16th century, no other universities were formed in Scotland until the twentieth century. The first &#x27;new university&#x27; of the era was the University of Strathclyde which received its royal charter in 1964, although it traces its origins back to the Andersonian Institute (also known at various times as Anderson&#x27;s College and Anderson&#x27;s University) founded in 1796.

<text>Annette Susanne Strøyberg (7 December 1936 – 12 December 2005) was a Danish actress. Her films included &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; (1959), which was directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim.

==Biography==
Annette Strøyberg was born on 7 December 1936 in the village of Rynkeby, Kerteminde Municipality, Denmark, and is related to Danish actress Camilla Søeberg as the cousin of Camilla&#x27;s mother. Prior to 1958, Strøyberg appeared as a cover girl, most notably in an advertisement for Tuborg beer. In 1959, she appeared in the film &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, directed by Roger Vadim, starring Gérard Philipe and Jeanne Moreau. During this production, she and Roger Vadim, a recent divorcé from Brigitte Bardot, fell in love and married on 17 June 1958. Before their marriage, on 7 December 1957, she gave birth to Nathalie Vadim, who went on to be a film director.

Subsequently, she appeared in a series of mostly very poorly rated entertainment films of Italian or French provenance, which revealed her lack of acting talent. In a review of those years, the German publication Die Zeit called Stroyberg&#x27;s acting &quot;unbearably exalted&quot;.

Strøyberg and Vadim divorced in 1961. She lived with Vittorio Gassman for a couple of years, and had liaisons with Alain Delon, Omar Sharif and Warren Beatty. In 1967, Strøyberg married French-Moroccan sugar king Guy Senouf. They had a son, Yan (born 27 June 1967). The couple enrolled at the Sorbonne and divided their time between Paris and north Africa. In 1974, she married Greek shipping magnate Gregory Callimanopulos in New York City. They had a son, Pericles (born 20 July 1974) and settled for a time in America.

In February 1986, former husband Vadim published &quot;Bardot, Deneuve, Fonda -- My Life With the Three Most Beautiful Women in the World&quot;, a book about Vadim&#x27;s relationships in which Strøyberg is written as passing &quot;in and out of the other four lives&quot; such that there is at least as much in the book about Strøyberg as the three women named in the book title. After the break-up of her relationship with Callimanopulos in the early 1990s, she returned to Europe, living in Paris and Copenhagen, where she was part of the circle around Margrethe II of Denmark and Prince Henrik. She married a fourth and final time to Christian Lillelund, an attorney, in 2001.

==Death==
She died of cancer in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 12 December 2005, five days after her 69th birthday. She was survived by her husband and three children.
