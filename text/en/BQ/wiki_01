<text>Nan Madol is an archaeological site adjacent to the eastern shore of the island of Pohnpei, now part of the Madolenihmw district of Pohnpei state in the Federated States of Micronesia in the western Pacific Ocean. Nan Madol was the capital of the Saudeleur dynasty until about 1628. The city, constructed in a lagoon, consists of a series of small artificial islands linked by a network of canals. The site core with its stone walls encloses an area approximately and it contains 92 artificial islets—stone and coral fill platforms—bordered by tidal canals.

The name means &quot;within the intervals&quot; and is a reference to the canals that crisscross the ruins. The original name was , &quot;Reef of Heaven&quot;, according to Gene Ashby in his book &quot;Pohnpei, An Island Argosy&quot;. It is often called the &quot;eighth wonder of the world&quot;, or the &quot;Venice of the Pacific&quot;.

==History==
Nan Madol was the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur Dynasty, which united Pohnpei&#x27;s estimated population of 25,000 people until about 1628. Set apart between the main island of Pohnpei and Temwen Island, it was a scene of human activity as early as the first or second century AD. By the 8th or 9th century, islet construction had started, with construction of the distinctive megalithic architecture beginning 1180–1200 AD.

Polish ethnographer and oceanographer John Stanislaw Kubary made the first detailed description of Nan Madol in 1874.

Little can be verified about the megalithic construction. Pohnpeian tradition claims that the builders of the Leluh archaeological site on Kosrae (likewise composed of huge stone buildings) migrated to Pohnpei, where they used their skills and experience to build the even more impressive Nan Madol complex. Radiocarbon dating indicates that Nan Madol predates Leluh; thus, it is more likely that Nan Madol influenced Leluh.

According to Pohnpeian legend, Nan Madol was constructed by twin sorcerers Olisihpa and Olosohpa from the mythical Western Katau, or Kanamwayso. The brothers arrived in a large canoe seeking a place to build an altar so that they could worship Nahnisohn Sahpw, the god of agriculture. After several false starts, the two brothers successfully built an altar off Temwen Island, where they performed their rituals. In legend, these brothers levitated the huge stones with the aid of a flying dragon. When Olisihpa died of old age, Olosohpa became the first Saudeleur. Olosohpa married a local woman and sired twelve generations, producing sixteen other Saudeleur rulers of the Dipwilap (&quot;Great&quot;) clan.

The founders of the dynasty ruled kindly, though their successors placed ever increasing demands on their subjects. Their reign ended with the invasion by Isokelekel, who also resided at Nan Madol, though his successors abandoned the site.

==Purpose and features==
The elite centre was a special place of residence for the nobility and of mortuary activities presided over by priests. Its population almost certainly did not exceed 1,000, and may have been less than half that. Although many of the residents were chiefs, the majority were commoners. Nan Madol served, in part, as a way for the ruling Saudeleur chiefs to organize and control potential rivals by requiring them to live in the city rather than in their home districts, where their activities were difficult to monitor.

Madol Powe, the mortuary sector, contains 58 islets in the northeastern area of Nan Madol. Most islets were once occupied by the dwellings of priests. Some islets served a special purpose: food preparation, canoe construction on Dapahu, and coconut oil preparation on Peinering. High walls surrounding tombs are located on Peinkitel, Karian, and Lemenkou, but the most prominent is the royal mortuary islet of Nandauwas, where walls high surround a central tomb enclosure within the main courtyard. This was built for the first Saudeleur.

On Nan Madol, there is no fresh water or food; water must be collected and food grown inland. During Saudeleur rule, Pohnpeians brought essential food and water by boat. The Saudeleur received food at a particular islet: first Peiniot, and later the closer Usennamw.

Around 1628, when Isokelekel overthrew the Saudeleurs and began the Nahnmwarki Era, the Nahnmwarkis lived at Nan Madol, but had to gather their own water and grow their own food. This is thought to have caused them eventually to abandon Nan Madol and move back to their own districts, although there are other explanations for the desertion of the complex, such as a sharp population decline.

==Archaeology==

Today Nan Madol forms an archaeological district covering more than and includes the stone architecture built up on a coral reef flat along the shore of Temwen Island, several other artificial islets, and the adjacent Pohnpei main island coastline. The site core with its stone walls encloses an area approximately containing 92 artificial islets—stone and coral fill platforms—bordered by tidal canals.

Carbon dating indicates that megalithic construction at Nan Madol began around AD 1180 when large basalt stones were taken from a volcanic plug on the opposite side of Pohnpei. The earliest settlement on Pohnpei was probably around AD 1 although radiocarbon dating shows human activity starting around AD 80–200.

In 1985, the ruins of Nan Madol were declared a National Historical Landmark.

Until its closure in 2012, objects from the site were displayed at Lidorkini Museum.

===Offshore underwater archaeological surveys at Nan Madol===
In 1978 and 1979, Arthur Saxe conducted underwater archaeological surveys to investigate reports of submerged basalt columns just offshore of Nan Madol and to search for two legendary submerged prehistoric cities known as &quot;Kahnihmw Namkhet&quot; and &quot;Kahnihmweiso&quot;. These surveys reported finding several tall stone pillars covered in coral growth and as tall as tall, wide, at depths of over . Neither Kahnihmw Namkhet nor Kahnihmweiso was found. However, it was hypothesized that the city of Kahnihmweiso might have been built over a cavern, which collapsed and formed a blue hole that swallowed the city.

In 1988 and 1989, a team of archaeologists from the University of Oregon conducted underwater archaeological surveys around Nan Madol. They found a number of prone basalt columns on the sea floor seaward of Nan Madol. They concluded that these columns consisted of lost, discarded or fallen building materials. They also examined underwater pillars reported by Saxe. They located two randomly spaced clusters of columns. They drove a steel rod into two of them and found only coral. One of them was raised and carefully dissected. This column was found to consist entirely of coral and clearly is not a &quot;purposely positioned stone column&quot;.

In 2013, Ishimura and others used multi-beam sonar, ROVs, and scuba diving to examine submerged block-shaped features and columnar objects and the blue hole. They found neither evidence of anthropogenic pillars composed of basalt columns nor any evidence that the underwater columns are man-made structures. They also concluded that the blue hole is a sinkhole that developed in reef limestones during sea level lowstands of glacial maximums.

==In popular culture and lost continent theories==

Nan Madol has been interpreted by some as the remains of one of the &quot;lost continents&quot; of Lemuria or Mu. Nan Madol was one of the sites James Churchward identified as being part of the lost continent of Mu, starting in his 1926 book &quot;The Lost Continent of Mu Motherland of Man&quot;.

The ruins of Nan Madol were used as the setting for a lost race story by A. Merritt, &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; (1918), in which the islands are called Nan-Tauach and the ruins are called the Nan-Matal.

Nan Madol was featured in episode two of the pseudoarchaeological work &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot; by Graham Hancock which aired on Netflix, in which false claims were made about the age of the site. Experts in Pacific geography and archaeology have characterised Hancock&#x27;s claims about Nan Madol as &quot;incredibly insulting to the ancestors of the Pohnpeian [islanders] that did create these structures&quot;, linking them to 19th century &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;white supremacist&quot; ideologies.

There is no scientific basis for the claims of Churchward or Hancock.

<text>The genus Tadarida has nine or more species of free-tailed bats divided into two subgenera, with the first of these containing seven species spread across the Old World (including southern Europe and North Africa, large parts of southern Asia, and India right across to Japan). Four species occur exclusively in Africa including Madagascar while two more species occur in central Papua New Guinea, and western and southern Australia, respectively.

The relatively well-known species &quot;T. teniotis&quot;, which occurs in southern Europe and North Africa, the Middle East, and across southern Asia to Japan, is known to fly often during the late afternoon, where it hawks for insects alongside swifts (Apodidae), swallows, and martins (Hirundinidae).

The other subgenus contains the widespread New World single species &quot;T. brasiliensis&quot; (subgenus &quot;Rhizomops&quot;), which ranges from the southern United States and the West Indies to Chile and Argentina. This species is noted for its massive maternity colonies in the United States, especially in the southwest, where an estimated population of over 25 million (possibly as high as 50 million) existed in Eagle Creek Cave in Arizona in the 1960s.

== Taxonomy ==

Molecular sequence data indicate &quot;Tadarida&quot; is not a monophyletic taxon. The closest relative of &quot;Tadarida aegyptiaca&quot; of Africa and southwest Asia is &quot;Chaerephon jobimena&quot; of Madagascar. These two species plus &quot;T. brasiliensis&quot; of the Americas form a clade believed to be about 9.8 million years old.

The genus name &quot;Tadarida&quot; is attributed to the naturalist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, who gave no clues to its etymology. It has been suggested that the name comes from the Corsican word for bat, &quot;taddarita.&quot; but no such word exists in the Corsican language (where bat is called &quot;topu pinnutu&quot;). Indeed, Rafinesque, being in Palermo, Sicily, during its studies, probably took this name from Sicilian, where the bat is called &quot;taḍḍarita&quot;, from Greek λαχταρίδα (lachtarida) 

Species list for genus:

* &quot;Tadarida aegyptiaca&quot; - Egyptian free-tailed bat
* &quot;Tadarida brasiliensis&quot; (now in subgenus &quot;Rhizomops&quot;) - Mexican free-tailed bat or Brazilian free-tailed bat
* †&quot;Tadarida constantinei&quot; - Constantine&#x27;s free-tailed bat 
* &quot;Tadarida fulminans&quot; - Madagascan large free-tailed bat
* &quot;Tadarida insignis&quot; - East Asian free-tailed bat
* &quot;Tadarida latouchei&quot; - La Touche&#x27;s free-tailed bat
* &quot;Tadarida lobata&quot; - Kenyan big-eared free-tailed bat
* &quot;Tadarida teniotis&quot; European free-tailed bat 
* &quot;Tadarida ventralis&quot; - African giant free-tailed bat

<doc id="487142" wikidata="Q137664" url="?curid=487142" title="Western skink">
<text>The western skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus) is a species of small, smooth-scaled lizard with relatively small limbs. It measures about 100 to 210 mm (about 4 to 8.25 inches) in total length (body + tail). It is one of seven species of lizards in Canada. They spend much of their day basking in the sun. Their diet ranges widely, including spiders and beetles. Western skinks will bite if grasped and will flee if they feel threatened.
It is a common but secretive species whose range extends from southern British Columbia and throughout Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming and into western Montana and northern Arizona and Missouri. They can also live in some areas of Texas It is widespread in northern California but primarily restricted to the coast in central and southern California. Found in a variety of habitats, this lizard is most common in early successional stages or open areas of late successional stages. Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided. Western skinks are found from sea level to at least 2,130 m (7,000 ft). This diurnal reptile is active during the warm seasons.

==Taxonomy==
Initially described in 1852 by Baird and Girard, the Western skink is named for Dr. Avery Judd Skilton (1802–1858), an American physician and naturalist, who collected the first specimens. Together with Gilbert&#x27;s skink (&quot;P. gilberti&quot;), the San Lucan skink (&quot;P. lagunensis&quot;), and the four-lined Asiatic skink (&quot;P. quadrilineatus&quot;), the western skink belongs to the so-called &quot;&quot;skiltonianus&quot; group&quot;. The exact taxonomy within this group has yet to be conclusively determined, and may need revision following DNA analysis research.

There are three recognized subspecies, including the nominotypical subspecies:

*Coronado skink, &quot;P.s. interparietalis&quot; Occurs in southern California and Baja California, Mexico.
*Great Basin skink, &quot;P.s. utahensis&quot; Occurs in Utah.
*Skilton&#x27;s skink, &quot;P.s. skiltonianus&quot; 

The most common is Skilton&#x27;s skink, which occurs throughout the western United States west of the Rocky Mountains and in southern British Columbia, Canada.
==Behavior==
The western skink is a secretive and very agile lizard that forages actively through leaf litter and dense vegetation, preying upon small invertebrates including spiders, a variety of insects and sow bugs. Crickets, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, and other arthropods have been found in the stomachs of skinks. Prey is sometimes stalked and cannibalism has been reported. It is a good burrower and sometimes constructs burrows several times its own body length.

Females take great care of their eggs. Western skink females construct nest chambers that are several centimeters deep in loose moist soil. Typically these chambers are located under surface objects, especially flat stones, logs, and sometimes in or near rock outcrops. The females remain guarding the nest until the young leave the nest. Female western skinks will defend their nests from predators, repair their nests, and even bask in the sun and then return to the nest to provide additional heat.

==Habitat==
Found in a variety of habitats from sea level to at least 2,130 m (7,000 ft), the western skink is commonest in early successional stages or open areas within habitats in which it occurs. Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided. The western skink seems to prefer a somewhat moist environment, although it can also be found on dry hillsides. Frequents grassland, broken chaparral, pinon-juniper and juniper-sage woodland, and open pine-oak and pine forests. The soil of its nest chambers is invariably moist. Standing water is apparently not required.

Although Western skinks avoid forests, they are found in dry areas within forested areas.

==Description==

Adult Western skinks have a broad brown stripe down their backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a conspicuous whitish to beige dorsolateral stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail. A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating on the side of head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown. Juvenile skink&#x27;s tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood. In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail. They usually have seven supralabial scales and four enlarged nuchals. Young skinks&#x27; colorations are more vivid than those of adults.

==Geographic Range==
Western skinks can be found from southern British Columbia, Canada, to the tip of the Baja California Peninsula, and throughout most of Great Basin to extreme Northern Arizona; central Utah to the Pacific Coast. The species is apparently absent from the floor of San Joaquin Valley (they have been observed in rural areas of southeast Lodi, CA), central Sierra Nevada (except a few scattered locations in the foothills where they are very common), and lowland deserts of California. In Northern Baja, California the species occurs in the northwestern part at least as far south as Colonia Guerro and in the south in the cape and Comondu regions, Santa Agueda, and San Francisco de la Sierra. On Santa Catalina, Los Coronados, and Todos Santos Island off the coast of California.

==Predators and Defensive Behavior==
Western skinks risk predation by virtually all mammalian, avian, and reptilian predators. In Idaho, their predators include night snakes, striped whipsnakes, and raptors. Throughout their range, they may be targeted by a range of predators, especially young animals honing their hunting skills, including black bear cubs, bobcats, coyotes, gray, red and swift foxes, least weasels and pumas, as well as domestic and feral cats and dogs. Various carnivorous birds, especially younger or smaller individuals, may hunt these skinks, such as Cooper’s hawk, Harris hawks, kestrels, red-tailed hawks and shrikes (‘butcherbirds’). Reptilian predators include kingsnakes and any other reptile-consuming squamates.

Against predators, a shrink&#x27;s automative response is to retreat. If females are protecting their eggs, they may attempt to bite to scare off any predators. Young western skinks have a bright blue tail with color that fades with age. Skinks can perform autotomy; if seized by a predator its tail is deliberately cast and wriggles violently attracting attention while the lizard may escape. The tail will grow back with time but is often darker in color and misshapen. It will play dead, but this behavior is rarely seen. 

==Life History==
This skink is diurnal during the period of warm-season activity. During summer most activity is concentrated in the morning and late afternoon. Where summer temperatures are not extreme, activity extends throughout the day. Adult skinks usually become inactive by early fall but juveniles extend their period of activity several weeks. The length of time they are inactive varies depending on the climate of the area. During their hibernation period, western skinks remain in communal dens.

The reproductive season for this species varies geographically and from year to year depending on local conditions. Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2–6 eggs during June and July.

Western skinks&#x27; eggs hatch in the months of July and August; the exact time differs by geographic location. They reach sexual maturity at around 3 years, and live up to 9 years

<text>The midbrain or mesencephalon is the uppermost portion of the brainstem connecting the diencephalon and cerebrum with the pons. It consists of the cerebral peduncles, tegmentum, and tectum.

It is functionally associated with vision, hearing, motor control, sleep and wakefulness, arousal (alertness), and temperature regulation.

The name &quot;mesencephalon&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;mesos&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;enkephalos&quot;, &quot;brain&quot;.

==Structure ==
The midbrain is the shortest segment of the brainstem, measuring less than 2cm in length. It is situated mostly in the posterior cranial fossa, with its superior part extending above the tentorial notch.
The principal regions of the midbrain are the tectum, the cerebral aqueduct, tegmentum, and the cerebral peduncles. the midbrain adjoins the diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus, etc.), while it adjoins the hindbrain (pons, medulla and cerebellum). In the rostral direction, the midbrain noticeably splays laterally.

Sectioning of the midbrain is usually performed axially, at one of two levels – that of the superior colliculi, or that of the inferior colliculi. One common technique for remembering the structures of the midbrain involves visualizing these cross-sections (especially at the level of the superior colliculi) as the upside-down face of a bear, with the cerebral peduncles forming the ears, the cerebral aqueduct the mouth, and the tectum the chin; prominent features of the tegmentum form the eyes and certain sculptural shadows of the face.

===Tectum===
The tectum (Latin for &quot;roof&quot;) is the part of the midbrain dorsal to the cerebral aqueduct.The position of the tectum is contrasted with the tegmentum, which refers to the region in front of the ventricular system, or floor of the midbrain.

It is involved in certain reflexes in response to visual or auditory stimuli. The reticulospinal tract, which exerts some control over alertness, takes input from the tectum, and travels both rostrally and caudally from it.

The corpora quadrigemina are four mounds, called colliculi, in two pairs – a superior and an inferior pair, on the surface of the tectum. The superior colliculi process some visual information, aid the decussation of several fibres of the optic nerve (some fibres remain ipsilateral), and are involved with saccadic eye movements. The tectospinal tract connects the superior colliculi to the cervical nerves of the neck, and co-ordinates head and eye movements. Each superior colliculus also sends information to the corresponding lateral geniculate nucleus, with which it is directly connected. The homologous structure to the superior colliculus in non mammalian vertebrates including fish and amphibians, is called the optic tectum; in those animals, the optic tectum integrates sensory information from the eyes and certain auditory reflexes.

The inferior colliculi – located just above the trochlear nerve – process certain auditory information. Each inferior colliculus sends information to the corresponding medial geniculate nucleus, with which it is directly connected.

===Cerebral aqueduct===
The cerebral aqueduct is the part of the ventricular system which links the third ventricle (rostrally) with the fourth ventricle (caudally); as such it is responsible for continuing the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebral aqueduct is a narrow channel located between the tectum and the tegmentum, and is surrounded by the periaqueductal grey, which has a role in analgesia, quiescence, and bonding. The dorsal raphe nucleus (which releases serotonin in response to certain neural activity) is located at the ventral side of the periaqueductal grey, at the level of the inferior colliculus.

The nuclei of two pairs of cranial nerves are similarly located at the ventral side of the periaqueductal grey – the pair of oculomotor nuclei (which control the eyelid, and most eye movements) is located at the level of the superior colliculus, while the pair of trochlear nuclei (which helps focus vision on more proximal objects) is located caudally to that, at the level of the inferior colliculus, immediately lateral to the dorsal raphe nucleus. The oculomotor nerve emerges from the nucleus by traversing the ventral width of the tegmentum, while the trochlear nerve emerges via the tectum, just below the inferior colliculus itself; the trochlear is the only cranial nerve to exit the brainstem dorsally. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus (which controls the shape of the lens and size of the pupil) is located between the oculomotor nucleus and the cerebral aqueduct.

===Tegmentum===

The midbrain tegmentum is the portion of the midbrain ventral to the cerebral aqueduct, and is much larger in size than the tectum. It communicates with the cerebellum by the superior cerebellar peduncles, which enter at the caudal end, medially, on the ventral side; the cerebellar peduncles are distinctive at the level of the inferior colliculus, where they decussate, but they dissipate more rostrally. Between these peduncles, on the ventral side, is the median raphe nucleus, which is involved in memory consolidation.

The main bulk of the tegmentum contains a complex synaptic network of neurons, primarily involved in homeostasis and reflex actions. It includes portions of the reticular formation. A number of distinct nerve tracts between other parts of the brain pass through it. The medial lemniscus – a narrow ribbon of fibres – passes through in a relatively constant axial position; at the level of the inferior colliculus it is near the lateral edge, on the ventral side, and retains a similar position rostrally (due to widening of the tegmentum towards the rostral end, the position can appears more medial). The spinothalamic tract – another ribbon-like region of fibres – are located at the lateral edge of the tegmentum; at the level of the inferior colliculus it is immediately dorsal to the medial lemiscus, but due to the rostral widening of the tegmentum, is lateral of the medial lemiscus at the level of the superior colliculus.

A prominent pair of round, reddish, regions – the red nuclei (which have a role in motor co-ordination) – are located in the rostral portion of the midbrain, somewhat medially, at the level of the superior colliculus. The rubrospinal tract emerges from the red nucleus and descends caudally, primarily heading to the cervical portion of the spine, to implement the red nuclei&#x27;s decisions. The area between the red nuclei, on the ventral side – known as the ventral tegmental area – is the largest dopamine-producing area in the brain, and is heavily involved in the neural reward system. The ventral tegmental area is in contact with parts of the forebrain – the mammillary bodies (from the Diencephalon) and hypothalamus (of the diencephalon).

===Cerebral peduncles===
The cerebral peduncles each form a lobe ventrally of the tegmentum, on either side of the midline. Beyond the midbrain, between the lobes, is the interpeduncular fossa, which is a cistern filled with cerebrospinal fluid .

The majority of each lobe constitutes the cerebral crus. The cerebral crus are the main tracts descending from the thalamus to caudal parts of the central nervous system; the central and medial ventral portions contain the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts, while the remainder of each crus primarily contains tracts connecting the cortex to the pons. Older texts refer to the crus cerebri as the &quot;cerebral peduncle&quot;; however, the latter term actually covers all fibres communicating with the cerebrum (usually via the diencephalon), and therefore would include much of the tegmentum as well. The remainder of the crus pedunculi – small regions around the main cortical tracts – contain tracts from the internal capsule.

The portion of the lobes in connection with the tegmentum, except the most lateral portion, is dominated by a blackened band – the substantia nigra (literally &quot;black substance&quot;) – which is the only part of the basal ganglia system outside the forebrain. It is ventrally wider at the rostral end. By means of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra is involved in motor-planning, learning, addiction, and other functions. There are two regions within the substantia nigra – one where neurons are densely packed (the pars compacta) and one where they are not (the pars reticulata), which serve a different role from one another within the basal ganglia system. The substantia nigra has extremely high production of melanin (hence the colour), dopamine, and noradrenalin; the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in this region contributes to the progression of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Blood supply==
The midbrain is supplied by the following arteries:

* The tectum is supplied by the superior cerebellar artery.
* The central part of the tegmentum is supplied by the paramedian branches of the basilar artery.
* The lateral part of the midbrain is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery.

Venous blood from the midbrain is mostly drained into the basal vein as it passes around the peduncle. Some venous blood from the colliculi drains to the great cerebral vein.

==Development==

During embryonic development, the midbrain (also known as the mesencephalon) arises from the second vesicle of the neural tube, while the interior of this portion of the tube becomes the cerebral aqueduct. Unlike the other two vesicles – the forebrain and hindbrain – the midbrain does not develop further subdivision for the remainder of neural development. It does not split into other brain areas. While the forebrain, for example, divides into the telencephalon and the diencephalon.

Throughout embryonic development, the cells within the midbrain continually multiply; this happens to a much greater extent ventrally than it does dorsally. The outward expansion compresses the still-forming cerebral aqueduct, which can result in partial or total obstruction, leading to congenital hydrocephalus. The tectum is derived in embryonic development from the alar plate of the neural tube.

==Function==
The midbrain is the uppermost part of the brainstem. Its substantia nigra is closely associated with motor system pathways of the basal ganglia. The human midbrain is archipallian in origin, meaning that its general architecture is shared with the most ancient of vertebrates. Dopamine produced in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area plays a role in movement, movement planning, excitation, motivation and habituation of species from humans to the most elementary animals such as insects. Laboratory mice from lines that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running have enlarged midbrains. The midbrain helps to relay information for vision and hearing.

==Related terms==
The term &quot;tectal plate&quot; or &quot;quadrigeminal plate&quot; is used to describe the junction of the gray and white matter in the embryo. ()

<text>The Southern Colonies within British America consisted of the Province of Maryland, the Colony of Virginia, the Province of Carolina (in 1712 split into North and South Carolina), and the Province of Georgia. In 1763, the newly created colonies of East Florida and West Florida would be added to the Southern Colonies by Great Britain until the Spanish Empire took back Florida. These colonies were the historical core of what would become the Southern United States, or &quot;Dixie&quot;. They were located south of the Middle Colonies, albeit Virginia and Maryland (located on the expansive Chesapeake Bay in the Upper South) were also called the Chesapeake Colonies.

The Southern Colonies were overwhelmingly rural, with large agricultural operations, which made use of slavery and indentured servitude extensive. During a series of civil unrest, Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion shaped the way that servitude and slavery worked in the South. After a series of attacks on the Susquehannock, attacks that were ensued after the group of natives burnt one of Bacon&#x27;s farms, Bacon&#x27;s arrest, along with other arrest warrants, were issued by Governor Berkely, for attacking the natives without his permission. Bacon avoided detainment, though, and then burnt Jamestown, in opposition of the governor previously denying him land in fear of native attacks, however Bacon hadn&#x27;t believe his policies were entirely conventional, saying that they didn&#x27;t ensure protection to the English settlers, as well as the exclusion of Bacon from Berkeley&#x27;s social clubs and friend groups. The rebellion dissolved sometime in 1676, following Charles II&#x27;s initial sending of troops to restore order in the colony. This rebellion influenced the view of the Africans, helping create a completely African servitude and workforce in the Chesapeake Colonies, alleviating primarily White servitude, a working-class that could be repugnant at times through disobedience and mischief. This also helped racial superiority in White regions, helping the poor White and wealthy White people, respectively, feel almost equal. It diminished alliances between White and Black people, as had happened in Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion.

The colonies developed prosperous economies based on the cultivation of cash crops, such as tobacco, indigo, and rice. An effect of the cultivation of these crops was the presence of slavery in significantly higher proportions than in other parts of British America.

==Carolina==
The Province of Carolina, originally chartered in 1608, was an English and later British colony of North America. Because the original charter was unrealized and was ruled invalid, a new charter was issued to a group of eight English noblemen, the Lords Proprietors, on March 24, 1663. Led by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, the Province of Carolina was controlled from 1663 to 1729 by these lords and their heirs.

Shaftesbury and his secretary, the philosopher John Locke, devised an intricate plan to govern the many people arriving in the colony. The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina sought to ensure the colony&#x27;s stability by allotting political status by a settler&#x27;s wealth upon arrival - making a semi-manorial system with a Council of Nobles and a plan to have small landholders defer to these nobles. However, the settlers did not find it necessary to take orders from the Council.

By 1680, the colony had a large export industry of tobacco, lumber, and pitch.

In 1691, dissent over the governance of the province led to the appointment of a deputy governor to administer the northern half of Carolina. After nearly a decade in which the British government sought to locate and buy out the proprietors, both Carolinas became royal colonies.

==Georgia==
The British colony of Georgia was founded by James Oglethorpe on February 12, 1733. The colony was administered by the Georgia Trustees under a charter issued by and named for King George II. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the settlement of the colony, known as the Oglethorpe Plan, which envisioned an agrarian society of Yeoman farmers and prohibited slavery. In 1742 the colony was invaded by the Spanish during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the Crown, and Georgia became a Crown colony, with a governor appointed by the king. The warm climate and swampy lands make it perfect for growing crops such as tobacco, rice, sugarcane, and indigo.

==Maryland==
George Calvert received a charter from King Charles I to found the colony of Maryland in 1632. When George Calvert died, Cecilius Calvert, later known as Lord Baltimore, became the proprietor. Calvert came from a wealthy Catholic family and was the first individual (rather than a joint-stock company) to receive a grant from the Crown. He received a grant for a large tract of land north of the Potomac river and on either side of Chesapeake Bay. Calvert planned on creating a haven for English Roman Catholics, many of whom were well-to-do nobles such as himself who could not worship in public. He planned on creating an agrarian manorial society where each noble would have a large manor and tenants would work in the fields and on other tasks. However, with extremely cheap land prices, many Protestants moved to Maryland and bought land for themselves. They soon became a majority of the population, and in 1642 religious tension began to erupt. Calvert was forced to take control and pass the Maryland Toleration Act in 1649, making Maryland the second colony to have freedom of worship, after Rhode Island. However, the Act did little to help religious peace. In 1654, Protestants barred Catholics from voting, ousted a pro-tolerance Governor, and repealed the Toleration Act. Maryland stayed Protestant until Calvert again took control of the colony in 1658.

==Virginia==
The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony or the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia) was an English colony in North America which existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. Jamestown was the first town created by the Virginia colony. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed &quot;The Old Dominion&quot; by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England.

While other colonies were being founded, Virginia continued to grow. Tobacco planters held the best land near the coast, so new settlers pushed inland. Sir William Berkeley, the colony&#x27;s governor, sent explorers over the Blue Ridge Mountains to open up the back country of Virginia to settlement.

After independence from Great Britain in 1776 the Virginia Colony became the Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the original thirteen states of the United States, adopting as its official slogan &quot;The Old Dominion&quot;. The states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and portions of Ohio, were all later created from the territory encompassed earlier by the Colony of Virginia.

<doc id="487147" wikidata="Q1376505" url="?curid=487147" title="Pebble Beach, California">
<text>Pebble Beach is an unincorporated community on the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey County, California, United States. The small coastal residential community of mostly single-family homes is also notable as a resort destination, and the home of the golf courses of Cypress Point Club, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, and Pebble Beach Golf Links. Nonresidents are charged a toll to use 17-Mile Drive, the main road through Pebble Beach, making it a &quot;de-facto&quot; gated community.

The Inn at Spanish Bay, The Lodge at Pebble Beach and four of the eight golf courses inside the Pebble Beach community are among the local assets owned by the &quot;Pebble Beach Company&quot;. Residents pay fees for maintenance as well as Monterey County property taxes. Application of the property tax revenues is the realm of the Pebble Beach Community Services District, a public agency that is independent of local private facilities, e.g., golf courses, with an elected board of directors that manages essential functions including fire protection and emergency medical services, supplemental law enforcement, wastewater collection and treatment, recycled water distribution, and garbage collection, disposal and recycling. The community&#x27;s post office is named Pebble Beach, as is its identity; whereas, the U.S. Census Bureau aggregates census returns from Pebble Beach as part of the larger census-designated place of Del Monte Forest. However, residents and visitors associate and identify with the name Pebble Beach; boundaries of the Del Monte Forest extend outside of the Pebble Beach community boundaries encompassing a larger forest area that comprises the wooded parts of Monterey Peninsula.

Area open space is partly administered by the Del Monte Forest Conservancy, a non-profit organization designated by Monterey County and the California Coastal Commission to acquire and manage certain properties by conservation easement and, as well, by fee title. The Conservancy is governed by a self-elected volunteer board of up to 12 members working with a small part-time group of contractors and volunteers to preserve the open space within the Del Monte Forest and non-forested sites of Pebble Beach. All board members must be property owners and residents of Pebble Beach.

Pebble Beach lies at sea level, its ZIP Code is 93953, and the community is inside area code 831.

==History==
The name Pebble Beach was originally given to a rocky cove and beach strand, a prominent coastal segment of the Rancho Pescadero Mexican land grant that had been awarded to Fabián Barreto in 1836. Barreto died and the land went through several owners. In the 1850s, Chinese immigrants formed a series of fishing settlements along Carmel Bay including one at Stillwater Cove, next to Pebble Beach. They collected abalone and various fish. In 1860, David Jacks bought the Mexican land grant, then sold it in 1880 to the Pacific Improvement Company (PIC), a consortium of The Big Four &quot;railroad barons.&quot;

By 1892, the PIC laid out a scenic road that they called the 17-Mile Drive, meandering along the beaches and among the forested areas between Monterey and Carmel. The drive was offered as a pleasure excursion to guests of the PIC-owned Hotel Del Monte, and it was intended to attract wealthy buyers of large and scenic residential plots on PIC land. Sightseers riding horses or carriages along the 17-Mile Drive sometimes stopped at Pebble Beach to pick up agate and other stones polished smooth by the waves, and they commented on a few unusual tree formations known as the Witch Tree and the Ostrich Tree—the latter formed by two trees leaning on each other. At that time, the Chinese fishing community continued in existence despite mounting anti-Chinese sentiment among Monterey residents of European heritage. At roadside stands, Chinese-American girls sold shells and polished pebbles to tourists. In the 1900s, the automobile began replacing horses on 17-Mile Drive, and by 1907 there were only automobiles. Adverse sentiments by local non-Chinese towards the Chinese fisherman and villagers of Pebble Beach was ironic in view of the vital contribution Chinese laborers made to the development of the Central Pacific Railroad, the fundamental fount of capital for the &quot;Big Four,&quot; founders of PIC.

In 1908, architect Lewis P. Hobart was hired by PIC manager A.D. Shepard to design the Pebble Beach Lodge, a rustic log-cabin-style one-story inn completed by 1909. The rambling lodge, featuring private patio nooks and a wide pergola made of local logs, was positioned halfway along 17-Mile Drive, overlooking Pebble Beach. The great hall or assembly room was wide and was flanked by massive fireplaces at each end. A tavern and kitchen supplied food and drink, and later, cottages could be rented for overnight guests. Operated under the same management as the Hotel Del Monte, food service was available at all hours, including fresh local abalone chowder. The lodge was built as the community center for the wealthy residents of the Del Monte Forest, and was popular as a rest stop for 17-Mile Drive motorists. Samuel Finley Brown Morse, a distant cousin to Samuel F. B. Morse known as the inventor of Morse Code, was hired in the 1910s to manage the PIC. In 1916, Morse convinced the PIC to create a golf course at the edge of Pebble Beach and Stillwater Cove. The lodge burned down on December 17, 1917, while the course was under construction, and a completely different structure replaced it: the Del Monte Lodge. PIC decided to dismantle the old El Carmelo Hotel and use the wood to reconstruction Del Monte Lodge. Hobart worked with Clarence Tantau to create a luxurious multi-story hotel, and Hobart designed a signature &quot;Roman Plunge&quot; pool to the east of the hotel. The golf course and the new lodge held a grand opening on February 22, 1919.

Morse formed the Del Monte Properties Company on February 27, 1919, and acquired the extensive holdings of the PIC, which included the Del Monte Forest, the Del Monte Lodge and the Hotel Del Monte. Morse brought his son, John Boit Morse, on board as president in 1948. The lodge was expanded with offices and a shopping arcade. In 1954, Morse&#x27;s son-in-law, Richard Osborne was named president of the Del Monte Properties Company.

Samuel Finley Brown Morse died in 1969. Alfred Gawthrop Jr., served as Chairman of Del Monte Properties through the 1970s. On March 30, 1977, the Del Monte Properties Company was reincorporated as the Pebble Beach Corporation. The Del Monte Lodge was renamed the Lodge at Pebble Beach.

In May 1979, 20th Century Fox, later bought by Marvin Davis, purchased the Pebble Beach Corporation. When the film company was sold to Rupert Murdoch in 1985, Davis kept several company assets not directly related to the film and TV industry, including the Pebble Beach Company and the Aspen Skiing Company.

In 1990 Davis sold the Pebble Beach Company to the Japanese businessman Minoru Isutani, who made it a subsidiary of the Japanese resort company Taiheiyo Club Inc. under a holding company called the Lone Cypress Company. Isutani was investigated by the FBI in the early 1990s for money laundering. Isutani&#x27;s $341M loss taken on the sale of Pebble Beach was cited as an example.

In 1999 the Pebble Beach Company was acquired from Lone Cypress by an investor group led by Clint Eastwood, Arnold Palmer, and Peter Ueberroth. In 2000, the company initiated Measure A, a controversial development proposal. Eastwood appeared in a legal and advertising campaign urging voters to pass MeasureA. In 2006, the plan went before the California Coastal Commission for approval. On June 14, 2007, the plan was submitted again. Commissioner Sara Wan called it &quot;wholesale destruction of the environment,&quot; and Measure A was denied in an 8to4 vote.

The famous landmark, known as the &quot;Witch Tree,&quot; stood for decades at Pescadero Point until it fell during a storm on January 14, 1964. It was sometimes used as scenic background in movies and television. It was displayed as part of the coast of Italy, in the 1951 movie &quot;Mr. Imperium&quot;, with Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Majorie Main and Barry Sullivan. That tree was also part of the background in an early scene from the 1956 movie &quot;Julie&quot;, featuring Doris Day, while she was fleeing from her psychopathic husband, played by Louis Jourdan.

The Pescadero &quot;Ghost Tree&quot; gave its name to an extreme surfing location known to have storm waves as large as high. Effective 2009, the surf break of Ghost Tree became effectively off limits, the result of a decision by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that personal watercraft, which were a virtual necessity for the tow-in only surf spot, were no longer permitted in specified waters of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

==Demographics==
The community has 4,531 residents and is relatively affluent, home to many retirees and well-educated workers in the social service (education and health care), management and finance sectors. Monterey County has a large Hispanic population, accounting for 59% of its population. In contrast, Pebble Beach&#x27;s population is largely of non-Hispanic White ancestry; 91.4% of the population was White, 5.3% Asian, 2.3% Hispanic or Latino, and 0.4% African American. The median household income is $99,788, with 54% with incomes between $50,000 and $150,000 and a little more than a quarter of households, 26.2%, with incomes exceeding $150,000. Household income figures, however, may not accurately reflect the area&#x27;s wealth as 50.8% of households received social security income and 30.8% were retired. Less than half of the population 16 or over, 46.4%, are employed. Of those who work, the plurality (25%) are employed in the social service, education and health care sector, followed by the management (15%) and finance sectors (15%). 2.3% of the population live below the poverty level. The area&#x27;s adult population is fairly well-educated, with 61% having at least a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 98% having a high school diploma, compared to 25% and 80% at the national average, respectively.

==Golf==
Pebble Beach has seven 18-hole golf courses, and one 9-hole course. Pebble Beach Golf Links, The Links at Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill and Peter Hay Golf Course are owned by Pebble Beach Company and are all public courses. Poppy Hills is also a public course. Private courses located at Pebble Beach are Cypress Point Club and the private Monterey Peninsula Country Club&#x27;s two courses, the Dunes Course and the Shore Course. Pebble Beach Company also owns Del Monte Golf Course a few miles away in Monterey, which is the oldest continuously operating course in the Western United States.

Several of these courses are widely celebrated, especially Pebble Beach Golf Links. Designed by Jack Neville and Douglas Grant, it is the most famous course in the Western United States, and along with Augusta National remains one of only two courses to have ever beaten Pine Valley Golf Club to top spot in &quot;Golf Digest&#x27;s&quot; biennial list of America&#x27;s 100 greatest courses. Pebble Beach Golf Links was the site of the US Open in 1972, 1982, 1992, 2000, 2010 and 2019. The course is set to host the tournament again in 2027. It will host the 2023 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open tournament for the first time, July 6-9.

The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am (formerly known as the Crosby Clambake) is held on three of the courses here annually in February. The tournament began in 1937 at Rancho Santa Fe near San Diego, where it was last played in 1942. After World War II, it moved to Pebble Beach in 1947, and has continued annually since.

The Pebble Beach golf resort partnered with IBM in 2017 to use the artificial intelligence Watson as a live concierge embedded in a mobile app. Watson was used to guide visitors around the resort.

==Concours d&#x27;Elegance==
The annual Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance auto show has been held in Pebble Beach since 1950. The event focuses on classic cars, and each year features a particular marque as its focus. In addition to the car competition, there is an auction, a classic car tour, and an automotive art exhibit.

==Geography==
Pebble Beach is in Monterey County on the Monterey Peninsula at . It is bordered by Carmel-by-the-Sea to the south, Pacific Grove to the north, the City of Monterey to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Big Sur is about a drive south on scenic State Route 1. Cypress Point in Pebble Beach is the westernmost landfall in Southern California; the dividing line between the north and south portions of the state coastline is situated at the center of the Monterey Bay shoreline near Moss Landing. Santa Cruz and San Francisco are about 45 and to the north, respectively.

==Geology==
Pebble Beach owes much of its picturesque qualities to the granitic rock outcroppings, stacks and small islets visible along the coast, these comprising the local portion of the federal California Coastal National Monument, which is administered by the Department of Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Land Management. These are characteristic of the Salinian Block, a geologic province which runs from the Baja California Peninsula and up through California west of the San Andreas Fault. The historically inactive Fanshell Beach Fault, which exits land near Fanshell Beach in Pebble Beach, creates a divide between nearby Cypress Point and northerly Spyglass Hill that is visually appreciable. Native Monterey Cypress forest grows on the south-westerly side of Fanshell Beach Fault: a direct relationship between the underlying rock base and soils and the cypress cover type has not been confirmed.

==Environmental issues==
There are several habitat types within Pebble Beach. These include intertidal zones, littoral and supralittoral and closed-cone coniferous forest, that encompasses, e.g., Monterey Pine Forest and Monterey Cypress Forest. The Monterey Pine forest is habitat to numerous rare and endangered species, including Hickman&#x27;s potentilla and Yadon&#x27;s piperia, both of which are federally protected species. Hickman&#x27;s potentilla was first discovered within the Del Monte Forest in present-day Pebble Beach by the botanist, Alice Eastwood in the year 1900. After a survey in 1992 by Earth Metrics Inc., this plant was listed as a protected species by the U.S. Government.

==Schools==
The public schools serving Pebble Beach are Carmel High School, Carmel Middle School, and River School, all located in Carmel, and Forest Grove School, Pacific Grove Middle School, and Pacific Grove High School, all located in Pacific Grove. Pebble Beach is also home to Stevenson School, a co-ed half-boarding, half-day private high-school, located near the prestigious Spyglass golf course. The high school runs alternative radio station KSPB, which broadcasts BBC World Service when students are not operating the station.

==Other features==
The Pebble Beach Authors &amp; Ideas Festival has been held in September each year at Pebble Beach since 2013, after moving from its original venue at Carmel-by-the-Sea.

Pebble Beach has few businessessuch as at-home cottage industriesapart from those owned by the Pebble Beach Company (except the golf courses, a private school, and a deli) and no sidewalks. Most of the very expensive houses are obscured from view behind old-growth trees. It is quiet, secluded, and often experiences foggy weather, which occurs frequently on the Monterey Peninsula in general, but especially there because of the area adjoining the open ocean.

Pebble Beach is a gated community, but differs from most gated communities. There is an entrance fee for which The Pebble Beach Company charges $10.75 (per vehicle) from tourists driving along the 17-Mile Drive. Pebble Beach residents may purchase small license plate badges that are attached near their cars&#x27; license plates or in their windshields to avoid paying the tourist fee. The badges are valid for one year, and their fee varies on the resident&#x27;s property value.

In 2014 (airing 2017), Pebble Beach was the location for the show &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, a drama which showcases relationships between high income status individuals based on the book of the same name.

==In popular culture==
On the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Inside Man&quot;, the doctor (Robert Picardo) lists Pebble Beach as an option to play golf on the holodeck.

On &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Sophia Petrillo claims that she had the chance to marry Bing Crosby, and if she had, she would be a wealthy widow with her own place in Pebble Beach.

On &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; episode &quot;The Terrorist Attack&quot;, Larry David considers going golfing at Pebble Beach to avoid perishing in a potential terrorist attack in Los Angeles.

On the &quot;Modern Family&quot; episode &quot;Planes, Trains and Cars&quot;, Jay, Gloria and Manny try to reach Jay&#x27;s reunion in Pebble Beach.

<doc id="487155" wikidata="Q1173419" url="?curid=487155" title="Daventry District">
<text>Daventry District was a local government district in western Northamptonshire, England, from 1974 to 2021. The district was named after its main town of Daventry, where the council was based.

The district was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the historic municipal borough of Daventry with the Daventry Rural District and most of the Brixworth Rural District. The town of Daventry became an unparished area with Charter Trustees and remained so until 2003 when a civil parish was created, roughly corresponding with the boundaries of the former borough, so allowing Daventry to have its own town council.

==Abolition and replacement==
In March 2018, following suspension of the County Council arising from its becoming insolvent, due to financial and cultural mismanagement by the cabinet and officers, the then Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, sent commissioner Max Caller into the council, who recommended the county council and all district and borough councils in the county be abolished, and replaced by two unitary authorities, one covering the West, and one the North of the county. These proposals were approved in April 2019. It meant that the districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire were merged to form a new unitary authority called West Northamptonshire, whilst the second unitary authority North Northamptonshire consists of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough districts. These new authorities came into being on 1 April 2021. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These elections were later held on 6 May 2021.

== Demography ==
At the 2011 Census, the district had a population of 77,843, a little under a third of whom (25,026) lived in the town of Daventry. Other significant settlements included Brixworth, Long Buckby and Weedon Bec. The rest of the district was predominantly rural.

=== Ethnicity ===
==Housing==
In 2007, the Council housing stock owned by the council was transferred to Daventry &amp; District Housing Ltd., a specially formed registered social landlord, under a Large Scale Voluntary Transfer. A subsequent dispute about the provisions made in the transfer contract for employees&#x27; pensions led to a legal case heard in the England and Wales Court of Appeal concerning the legal doctrines of mutual or unilateral mistake.

<doc id="487161" wikidata="Q3216389" url="?curid=487161" title="Hold up (bridge)">
<text>In the card game of contract bridge, to hold up means to play low to a trick led by the opponents, losing it intentionally in order to sever their communication. The primary purpose is to give as many tricks to opponents as needed to exhaust all the cards in the suit from one of their hands. If that hand regains the lead, it will not be able to put the partner on lead to cash its tricks. Hold up is one of basic techniques in play.

While mechanically identical, a hold up is in a suit played by the opponents while a [[duck (bridge)|duck]] (or ducking) is a manoeuver in one&#x27;s own suit. Nevertheless, the terms are used interchangeably with duck or ducking more common.

==Examples==

===Denying an entry (declarer play)===
 West leads the top of a doubleton against a suit contract, and East plays the queen. Suppose South wins the first trick with the ace and West gets in before trumps are drawn (with the ace of trumps, for example). Now West can lead his remaining card in the suit to East&#x27;s king, and East can return the suit for West to ruff.

Proper procedure is for South to hold up on the first trick, and win the ace on the second round of the suit. Now, when West gets in, he is void in his short suit and cannot lead that suit to get to East&#x27;s hand.

===Denying an entry (defender play)===
 The declarer (South) plays toward dummy&#x27;s long suit. Assuming there are no side entries, on the distribution shown East must duck once to prevent declarer from running the suit.

Note that West must give a proper count signal in this situation. In the distribution shown, West signals an even count; East assumes it shows four and ducks once. (If West has only two, then South has four and ducking neither helps nor hurts.) If West signals an odd count, East will have to decide (possibly from the bidding or previous play in other suits) whether it shows three or five, and win the first or third trick accordingly.

===Rectifying the count===
Often, to set up a squeeze, one or more tricks must be lost in advance. This is known as &quot;rectifying the count&quot;, but it is actually just another instance of ducking.

===Endplay===
Here is a simple endplay situation:
 At no trump, South is on lead with three cards left to play. South ducks the 2 to West, who must now lead spades into South&#x27;s ace-queen tenace and South wins two tricks. If South plays spades first, he wins only one of the last three tricks.
This play is not really a duck, because it does not surrender a trick that could be won.

South is playing a contract of three notrump, and West leads the king of diamonds. There are nine needed tricks: two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs. However, if the declarer wins the ace of diamonds at trick one and drives out the ace of clubs, the defenders will cash four diamond tricks to set the contract.

South can assure the contract (provided the ace of clubs is with East) by holding up the ace of diamonds: he plays low to the first two diamond tricks (known as ducking) and wins the ace of diamonds on the third trick. Now, when East wins the ace of clubs, he has no diamonds left to play. If West holds the ace of clubs, the contract is impossible to make. If, on the other hand, East had a diamond, that would mean that diamonds were originally split 4-4 and defenders could only cash three tricks in the suit, so the contract was not in danger.

===Deception===
 A defender can deceive the declarer by ducking a trick he could win, inducing him to place the defender&#x27;s cards wrongly and adopt a losing line of play. In the position shown, declarer leads a small card from dummy to the queen in trump suit. If West takes the ace, the declarer could easily play the king in second round, dropping East&#x27;s jack. However, if West ducks, the declarer will place the ace with East, and finesse the dummy&#x27;s ten in second round, losing to East&#x27;s now singleton jack.

This kind of duck requires perfect reading of cards and nerve, especially if the suit involved is a side suit in a trump contract. West must duck smoothly, without hesitation, otherwise the declarer could infer the actual layout.

==Rule of seven==
The rule assumes play in a 3NT contract and is as follows:
:&quot;Subtract from seven the total number of cards that declarer and dummy hold in the defenders&#x27; suit and duck their lead of the suit that many times.&quot;

The rule can be generalized for all notrump contracts as follows:
:&quot;In a notrump contract, subtract from &#x27;n&#x27; the total number of cards that declarer and dummy hold in the defenders&#x27; suit and duck their lead of the suit that many times; &#x27;n&#x27; is equal to four plus the level of the contract.&quot;

In the hand above, there are five diamonds in the combined North-South hands, and declarer must duck two tricks (winning the third).

If there were an additional diamond in either the North or South hand, for a total of six, then declarer need only duck one trick (winning the second). This is because if West has five diamonds (and North-South six), then East will have only two and will be out of diamonds after two rounds of the suit. If East does have three diamonds, then West will have only four and the defenders can cash only two additional diamond tricks (for a total of three) upon winning the ace of clubs.

<text>Baron Gisborough, of Cleveland in the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The title was created in 1917 for the Conservative politician Richard Chaloner (1856–1938), who had previously represented Westbury (also known as Wiltshire West) and Abercromby in the House of Commons. Born Richard Long, the son of Richard Penruddocke Long, he had assumed by royal licence the surname of Chaloner in lieu of Long in 1881, as a condition of inheriting the Guisborough estate in North Yorkshire, and Gisborough Hall, from his maternal great-uncle, Admiral Thomas Chaloner. The latter was a descendant through his mother of Robert de Brus, who founded Gisborough Priory in 1119.

Lord Gisborough&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Richard Godolphin Hume Long Chaloner, was accidentally killed in France in 1917 while guarding German prisoners of war, and is buried at Calais. Lord Gisborough was therefore succeeded by his second son, the second Baron. , the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the third Baron, who succeeded in 1951. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Cleveland from 1981 to 1996. The title remains strongly linked with the town of Guisborough.

The prominent Conservative politician Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long (1854–1924) was the elder brother of the first Baron.

==Barons Gisborough (1917)==
*Richard Godolphin Walmesley Chaloner, 1st Baron Gisborough (1856–1938)
*Thomas Weston Peel Long Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough (1889–1951)
*(Thomas) Richard John Long Chaloner, 3rd Baron Gisborough (b. 1927)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son, the Hon. (Thomas) Peregrine Long Chaloner (b. 1961).

<text>The Minister for Defence () is a senior minister in the Government of Ireland and leads the Department of Defence. The current Minister for Defence is Simon Harris, TD. He is also Minister for Foreign Affairs.

The department is responsible for the Irish Defence Forces. The Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924 assigned the minister the additional title of Commander-in-Chief as the Chairman of the Council of Defence. The Defence Act 1954 removed this title, as a result of the reconstitution of the Council of Defence. The President of Ireland, a largely ceremonial role, is considered the Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces. In practice, the Minister acts on the President&#x27;s behalf and reports to the Irish Government. The Minister for Defence is advised by the Council of Defence on the business of the Department of Defence.

The Minister is assisted by a Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Thomas Byrne, TD.

<doc id="487174" wikidata="Q2999019" url="?curid=487174" title="Duck (bridge)">
<text>In the card game of contract bridge, to duck (or ducking) means to play low to a trick to which one has led, losing it intentionally in order to set up a suit or to preserve a control or entry. While mechanically identical, a duck is a manoeuver in one&#x27;s own suit, while a [[hold up (bridge)|hold up]] is in a suit played by the opponents. Nevertheless, the terms are used interchangeably with duck or ducking more common.

==Example==
 There are no side entries to the North hand. South is on lead and if he plays to the ace and then the king and another, East will win the third trick. The remaining two small cards are good, but there is no way to get to them.

Proper procedure is to duck the first (or second) trick. Then, when the lead is regained, playing to the ace (or the king if the ace was taken before ducking) will establish the suit and the remainder of the cards can be cashed.

Note that defenders can benefit by a hold up play. North, as a defender with (A K 4 3 2) and no outside entries, may do well to hold up on the first or second round of the suit, especially in a notrump contract.

<doc id="487179" wikidata="Q1342690" url="?curid=487179" title="One Worldwide Plaza">
<text>One Worldwide Plaza is the largest tower of Worldwide Plaza, a three-building commercial and residential complex in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), One Worldwide Plaza is an office building measuring tall, with an alternative address of 825 Eighth Avenue. It is the easternmost building in the Worldwide Plaza complex, which occupies the entire city block bounded by Eighth Avenue, Ninth Avenue, 49th Street, and 50th Street and is built on the site of New York City&#x27;s third Madison Square Garden. Adjacent to One Worldwide Plaza to the west are a public plaza and two residential buildings.

The classically inspired building contains a three-story granite base, a brick midsection with setbacks, and a pyramidal copper roof with a glass lantern. Inside, there are storefronts and entrances to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 50th Street station, while three double-height lobbies lead to different sets of office floors.

Worldwide Plaza was developed in the late 1980s by a syndicate led by William Zeckendorf Jr. Upon opening, One Worldwide Plaza was nearly fully occupied, with two anchor tenants: advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather and law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. During the mid-1990s, the office space was leased at a very low price. The Blackstone Group acquired the complex in 1996 and sold it to Equity Office Properties in 1998. When Blackstone took over Equity Office in 2007, it sold the office building to Harry Macklowe, who lost the building to foreclosure. George Comfort and Sons took over One Worldwide Plaza in 2009. American Realty Capital New York bought a controlling ownership stake in 2017, selling off a non-controlling stake to RXR Realty and SL Green Realty.

==Site==
One Worldwide Plaza is part of Worldwide Plaza, which occupies the entire city block bounded by Eighth Avenue, Ninth Avenue, 49th Street, and 50th Street in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Worldwide Plaza was developed in the late 1980s by a syndicate led by William Zeckendorf Jr. One Worldwide Plaza, the easternmost structure in the complex, was designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM). To the west are two residential buildings, Two and Three Worldwide Plaza, designed by Frank Williams; they are respectively composed of a 39-story tower and a series of five- and six-story-tall townhouses. In addition, the complex contains of retail space, as well as theaters and a garage. According to Zeckendorf, Worldwide Plaza was intended to be &quot;a self-contained community and also a destination point for other people in the city&quot;.

The Worldwide Plaza complex is built on the site of New York City&#x27;s third Madison Square Garden (MSG). Following the opening of the current Madison Square Garden arena at 34th Street, the former arena was closed in 1968 and demolished. By the 1980s, the surrounding area consisted mostly of lower-income tenements and small retail buildings, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the area as &quot;a neighborhood best known for pornography and cheap bars&quot;.

==Architecture==
One Worldwide Plaza is a 50-story office skyscraper measuring high, with a pyramidal roof at its top. Several architectural details of One Worldwide Plaza were inspired by early-1930s classical designs, specifically the Art Deco style. The building is divided horizontally into three sections: a base, shaft, and capital. The materials used in its construction were sourced from a variety of locations. The brick was manufactured by Glen-Gery at a factory in Pennsylvania, while the windows were made in Wisconsin. By contrast, the roofing and precast concrete were made in Canada, the structural steel was bought in Luxembourg, and the project used Brazilian granite and Italian marble. HRH Construction was the building&#x27;s general construction contractor.

Including the residential buildings, the complex was to cover , more than the maximum size allowed without zoning bonuses. Under normal zoning regulations, the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for any building on Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s site was 10, but the developers received two bonuses of 2 FAR each, bringing the FAR to 14. The developers added a midblock plaza for the first bonus and renovated the adjacent 50th Street station for the second bonus.

=== Facade ===

The base of the building is three stories tall and is designed to relate to the neighboring residential buildings. It is clad with gray-purple granite and contains outwardly curved entrances on all four sides. These curved sections contain Renaissance-inspired colonnades with granite pilasters, behind which is an oval passageway with a vaulted ceiling. The building&#x27;s two original anchor tenants, advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather and law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, had their own entrances. This was because Ogilvy &amp; Mather had requested a private entrance during the building&#x27;s construction. Ogilvy &amp; Mather&#x27;s entrance faced 49th Street; Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore&#x27;s entrance faced Eighth Avenue; and other tenants had an entrance facing west. The entrance on the northern elevation, facing 50th Street, is used for retail rather than as an office lobby.

The rest of the facade is made largely of brick and is designed in a manner reminiscent of the Gothic Revival style. Glen-Gery was hired to manufacture the brick because it was one of the few contractors capable of manufacturing the tinted brick that the developers wanted. The main section of the building is clad with maize-colored brick, but the windows at the center of each elevation are emphasized by vertical strips of rust-colored brick. The facade originally contained single-paned windows, which gave the effect of a flat facade. The building contains several setbacks, which are decorated with white brick that is designed to evoke the appearance of stone. The building&#x27;s shallow setbacks give it a much larger floor area than older Art Deco skyscrapers in New York City, which had deeper setbacks and consequently less interior space.

The tower is topped by a pyramidal copper roof with round dormer windows. The pyramid has eight sides and measures tall. The design of the roof was inspired by the pyramidal roofs of several other New York City office buildings in the early 20th century, such as the New York Life Building and the Helmsley Building. The building is crowned by a pyramidal glass lantern.

=== Interior ===
Childs constructed three lobbies at One Worldwide Plaza, each with a separate entrance. Each lobby was originally decorated with Fiore di Pesco marble. There are storefronts along the ground-level colonnade adjacent to the three lobbies, as well as on both levels of each lobby. In addition, there are restrooms along the western side of the arcade. The two-story-high lobby on Eighth Avenue was used by Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, which installed security checkpoints on both levels of the lobby, reducing the amount of retail space there. On each side, visitors had to take an escalator from ground level to the upper lobby, where they could access the elevators. Each lobby had access to a bank of elevators. There are four elevator banks in total, comprising 22 passenger elevators and two truck elevators. The building&#x27;s base also contained a day-care center sponsored by Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore for its employees&#x27; children. Northwest of the lobbies is a truck elevator on 50th Street.

The building contains a steel superstructure weighing . Each floor slab is made of concrete, which is poured onto a metal deck. The floor slabs measure . The maximum structural load on each column was on average. These loads were carried down into the concrete spread footings at the building&#x27;s foundation. The superstructure was stiffened by moment frames at the building&#x27;s perimeter, which were braced to the elevator core. Concrete masonry units were then installed around the outermost beams of the superstructure, providing waterproofing.

One Worldwide Plaza contains of office space. The upper stories each have of rentable space. Each story has an open plan, and the slab-to-slab height of each story is . The restrooms, staircases, and elevators are clustered near the building&#x27;s core. The banks of elevators taper off at higher levels. For example, the 21st and 28th stories have space for three banks of elevators, although only two elevator banks serve these levels. Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore originally occupied the 38th to 49th stories. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the offices as using of marble and of mahogany.

=== Other features ===

==== Public plaza ====
A mid-block public plaza separates One Worldwide Plaza from Two and Three Worldwide Plaza. The New York City Department of City Planning (DCP) had approved the construction and maintenance of the public plaza in exchange for additional floors in the office tower. The plaza originally covered , but its owner reduced the plaza&#x27;s size by 10 percent in 2002 as part of a lawsuit settlement. During the summer, the plaza hosts the Worldwide Plaza Summer Concert Series. Jerold S. Kayden wrote of the buildings&#x27; plaza: &quot;Its half-acre size, numerous movable chairs, comfortable ledge seating, food service at north and south ends, decorative water fountain, and landscaping of trees and shrubs render it highly functional for the diverse audience.&quot;

The landscaping of the plaza includes over 40 trees, numerous plantings, and seating. The plaza also contains a fountain called &quot;The Seasons&quot;, which was designed by sculptor Sidney Simon. Four bronze statues of standing nude women, each representing a season, hold up a globe. Below the globe are four fountains, each carved in the shape of a man&#x27;s head.

==== Amenities ====
The complex also has a health club measuring . The health club was originally operated by Bally Health and Tennis. Beneath the plaza is a 450-spot parking garage with 450 or 473 parking spaces.

Beneath the public plaza, there was originally a multiplex cinema with six screens, operated by the Cineplex Odeon Corporation. The multiplex&#x27;s lobby was just below ground level, while the auditoriums themselves were in the second basement level. The cinema operated until 2001 and was converted into New World Stages, a complex of five Off-Broadway theaters, in 2004. The multiplex was completely reconstructed as part of that project. The modern theatrical complex contains a double-level lobby, accessed by escalators from 50th Street.

==== Subway entrance ====
One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s basement contains two entrances to the southbound platform of the 50th Street station of the New York City Subway, served by the . There is an elevator entrance on 49th Street and an escalator entrance on 50th Street. The entrances were built in exchange for of additional space. They contain a mezzanine, escalators, elevators, and stairs. The Zeckendorfs also commissioned artist Matt Mullican to create an etched-granite mural for the station, which cost $150,000. The mural, measuring tall, contains black relief panels depicting the site&#x27;s history. A closed stairway on 49th Street was also refurbished as part of the project.

==History==

=== Early proposals ===
After the third Madison Square Garden was demolished in 1968, the site was operated as a parking lot for nearly two decades. Several proposals for redeveloping the site had all failed due to a lack of funding. In 1966, a &quot;Cinema City&quot; with two office towers, two Broadway theaters, four movie theaters, and several film and recording studios was proposed for the site. Three years later, New York City Center proposed developing a four-theater complex, a film production center, and a new home for the American Film Institute on the site. In 1973, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill were hired to study the feasibility of constructing a large commercial showroom complex on the site similar to the Merchandise Mart in Chicago or AmericasMart in Atlanta. The complex would be topped by a tower.

In December 1976, developers Frank Stanton and Victor Elmaleh of the World‐Wide Group proposed Hippodrome Park, an indoor amusement park that would cost $30 million. The name was a homage to the former New York Hippodrome. The amusement park would have been designed by Randall Duell and would have included a variety of rides, restaurants, and films. The structure would have been enclosed in glass, which would have allowed the park to operate year-round; it would also have contained a 500-seat parking lot in the basement. The City of New York was supportive of the project as part of its initiative to clean up nearby Times Square. Ultimately, the developers chose not to spend $12 million on an option for the site.

Conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries acquired control of the site in 1977 as part of its acquisition of the Madison Square Garden Corporation. The company devised plans in 1980 for a mixed-use project on the site, including an office building on Eighth Avenue and apartments on Ninth Avenue, both designed by SOM. Its proposal called for a three-story retail podium supporting a 52-story office building and two 60-story apartment towers; the development would have contained a combined . Gulf and Western operated the site as a parking lot in the meantime. The company had decided to sell the site by 1984, as its long term strategy did not include the redevelopment of the old Madison Square Garden.

=== Development ===

Gulf and Western sold the site to a group led by William Zeckendorf Jr. in December 1984 for $100 million. His partners in the project included Arthur G. Cohen, an independent real-estate investor; Victor Elmaleh and Frank Stanton, the principals of the World Wide Realty Corporation; and KG Land New York Corporation, a subsidiary of Japanese company Kumagai Gumi. The group had to raise a $12.5 million letter of credit and finalize their sale within 18 months. Zeckendorf and his partners announced in January 1985 that they had selected SOM to design the new complex. Zeckendorf hoped that the development would improve the character of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Eighth Avenue, similar to how the construction of Axa Equitable Center four blocks northeast was intended to improve Seventh Avenue. It was one of several development projects planned within Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, which at the time was characterized by physical decay and high crime. Zeckendorf said of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen: &quot;Ten years from now people will look back and marvel at how bad this neighborhood was.&quot;

====Planning====
SOM began designing the project in early 1985. The advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which was negotiating to lease a large amount of space in the building, was involved in the design. Zeckendorf&#x27;s syndicate announced in November 1985 that it would erect a mixed-use complex on the MSG site, costing $500 million. The complex would include a 45-story office building on Eighth Avenue, as well as a 38-story condominium tower and several 6- and 7-story residential buildings to the west. There would also be six underground movie theaters, a health club, and a 450-space parking garage. Ogilvy would occupy in the office building. Ogilvy provided additional funds for the complex&#x27;s construction in exchange for a 17 percent equity stake and some of One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s income. In addition, the complex would receive an eight-year, $60 million tax abatement. The developers obtained two zoning bonuses for the site by adding a midblock plaza and renovating the 50th Street station.

Members of the local Manhattan Community Board 4 opposed Zeckendorf&#x27;s project, citing the buildings&#x27; height and the lack of low- and moderate-income housing. Community members also raised concerns that the development would cause gentrification by pushing out lower-income tenants and family businesses. Some residents protested the project by requesting that Ogilvy &amp; Mather withdraw from the project. Zeckendorf Company officials began negotiating with community board members &quot;the day after&quot; the board announced its opposition, and Zeckendorf announced in early 1986 that he would add affordable housing to the neighborhood. He proposed renovating 132 apartments in other parts of the neighborhood, rather than adding these apartments to his new development. Zeckendorf made six other modifications to the project to improve neighborhood residents&#x27; quality of life, including storefronts for local merchants, a day-care center, and job training.

In July 1986, the New York City Board of Estimate approved Zeckendorf&#x27;s development. Manhattan borough president David Dinkins, a supporter of the project, said the developers could not sell 60 of the complex&#x27;s luxury units until all of the affordable units had been sold. The developers had to acquire another 70 affordable units to provide enough affordable housing for the complex. They ultimately fulfilled this requirement by acquiring six buildings on the block to the south. That October, Gulf and Western finalized its sale of the site to the joint venture of Zeckendorf, Cohen, KG Land, and Worldwide Holdings Corp. Zeckendorf also leased the theatrical complex to the Cineplex Odeon Corporation.

==== Construction ====

A groundbreaking ceremony for the complex was held on November 12, 1986. That month, workers began excavating the site to 17 feet below grade; the excavation was completed by February 1987. &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that the development of Worldwide Plaza would relocate the western boundary of Midtown Manhattan westward to Eighth Avenue. In June 1987, the Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation secured a $545 million construction loan from a syndicate of 15 banks in the United States, Japan, Canada, and Europe. The financing was one of the largest real estate loans in New York City history. In exchange for receiving the loan, the development group provided a letter of credit and personal guarantees worth $100 million. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the loan as part of a trend wherein &quot;the mere mention of a Zeckendorf project had bankers falling over each other to offer financing&quot;.

At the time of Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s development, demand for office space in New York City had declined following Black Monday in 1987. The design of One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s basement and ground level was impacted by the location of the new subway entrances at the base. While the developers negotiated with the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) for a year and a half, contractors started pouring the foundations. The concrete for the foundation was poured by April 1987, and work on the steel superstructure began the following month.

The construction of the complex proceeded as scheduled until July 1987, when ironworkers went on strike for three weeks, delaying the project by approximately one month. By the end of 1987, it was taking longer than expected to install the stonework inside the lobby. Installation of the exterior masonry had fallen three months behind schedule and did not commence until February 1988. The stonework ultimately cost significantly more than HRH Construction&#x27;s original estimate.

==== Completion ====
One Worldwide Plaza was topped-out with a ceremony on May 20, 1988, in which ironworkers inscribed their names on a beam that was then lifted to the roof. Work on the interior finishes began that month. The interior fit-out of Ogilvy&#x27;s offices, originally slated to begin in April 1988, did not begin until that November. The completion of Worldwide Plaza was ultimately delayed by four months and exceeded the original budget by 10 percent.

Most of the space at One Worldwide Plaza was leased even before the building was completed. In August 1988, the law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore leased in exchange for a 7 percent equity stake in Worldwide Plaza. The lease occurred at a time when the offices of all of Manhattan&#x27;s accounting firms and corporate law firms were east of Sixth Avenue. The law firm&#x27;s lease also stipulated that Zeckendorf buy and demolish an adult movie theater just north of One Worldwide Plaza. Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore and Ogilvy &amp; Mather each had their own entrances and elevators, and the developers gave large &quot;work letters&quot; to both firms, compensating for the cost of interior furnishings. These two tenants alone accounted for 55 percent of the space. By early 1989, more than 90 percent of the space at One Worldwide Plaza had been leased. Advertising agency N. W. Ayer &amp; Son agreed to move into at One Worldwide Plaza, and it also took an equity stake in the complex. Record label PolyGram had leased .

=== Opening and early years ===

Worldwide Plaza was completed in 1989, and a temporary certificate of occupancy was issued that February. The Worldwide Cinemas multiplex beneath the complex opened in June 1989, and Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore moved into One Worldwide Plaza that September. Ogilvy&#x27;s offices were completed behind schedule, costing the developers several million dollars. By then, Zeckendorf was developing several additional structures along the midtown section of Eighth Avenue, including two buildings directly next to Worldwide Plaza. Soon after the complex opened, Lifetime Cable Network also leased space at One Worldwide Plaza, as did electronics company Philips. The residences within the complex were not fully sold until 1993, and a quarter of the retail space was still empty in 1996.

Although the offices were fully occupied in the mid-1990s, the office space was not as profitable as Zeckendorf had originally projected. Three of One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s largest tenants had only agreed to rent space in exchange for equity, while other tenants such as PolyGram, Microsoft, and Roberts &amp; Holland paid less rent per square foot compared to other Midtown buildings. In addition, Deutsche Bank held a $600 million mortgage loan on Worldwide Plaza. In the wake of Black Monday, the developers were barely able to make mortgage payments as long as the building&#x27;s original tenants continued to pay rent.

By 1996, Deutsche Bank was looking to sell its mortgage. Zeckendorf&#x27;s syndicate wished to find a partner to help buy the mortgage from Deutsche Bank, with little success. At the time, One Worldwide Plaza was fully occupied by several large tenants with long leases, but the average rent for office space had decreased about one-third since 1990. That October, the Blackstone Group bought the mortgage from Deutsche Bank for $300 million. Blackstone extended PolyGram&#x27;s and Ayer&#x27;s leases. Ogilvy had decided to relocate, though other companies quickly expressed interest in Ogilvy&#x27;s vacant space. In October 1998, Equity Office Properties agreed to acquire the complex for about $310 million, and it also agreed to assume the $268.1 million in debt on the property. As part of a pilot program, Captivate Network installed electronic screens in One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s elevators, and the majority of the building&#x27;s elevators had these screens by late 1999.

=== 2000s and early 2010s ===
The administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani sued the owners of Worldwide Plaza and two other buildings in 2000, alleging that these buildings&#x27; privately owned public spaces violated city laws. At Worldwide Plaza, two restaurants had illegally taken over many movable chairs and tables, which had been installed there as &quot;public amenities&quot;. The suit was settled in mid-2002 after Equity Office applied to convert ten percent of the plaza&#x27;s space into a private dining area for the complex&#x27;s restaurants. Meanwhile, the Loews Cineplex at Worldwide Plaza closed in early 2001 after its operator went bankrupt. The former multiplex temporarily served as office space for accounting firm Deloitte later that year after that firm&#x27;s offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The multiplex then became an Off-Broadway venue, Dodger Stages (now New World Stages), in 2004.

In February 2007, after a bidding war with Vornado Realty Trust, Blackstone acquired Equity Office&#x27;s portfolio, including One Worldwide Plaza and seven other buildings. The firm immediately resold the structures to Harry B. Macklowe as part of a $7 billion transaction; One Worldwide Plaza alone was worth $1.7 billion. Macklowe took out a $7.6 billion loan to fund the acquisitions, which was to come due within twelve months. Macklowe personally pledged $1 billion, as well as interests in twelve other properties, as a guarantee. By February 2008, the Macklowe Organization had no way to refinance the debt from the previous year. As such, Macklowe surrendered One Worldwide Plaza to his lender, Deutsche Bank. After selling Macklowe&#x27;s other buildings, Deutsche Bank announced in June 2009 that it would sell One Worldwide Plaza. The next month, Deutsche Bank agreed to sell the building for $600 million to George Comfort and Sons. One Worldwide Plaza was only 46 percent occupied at the time, and the building still had a 40 percent vacancy rate at the end of the year.

Television station WNET leased space at One Worldwide Plaza in 2010. Japanese investment bank Nomura agreed to lease around in 2011, bringing the building to 95 percent occupancy. The bank beat out law firm Wilmer Hale, which had also been interested in the space. George Comfort &amp; Sons put the building up for sale in August 2012, reportedly hoping for a $1.7 billion valuation, almost triple what the company had paid just three years prior. By October 2012, bids for the building only reached around $1.5 billion. Potential buyers were reportedly worried about the building&#x27;s tenants including Nomura, which had recently had its credit rating downgraded by Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, and Cravath, after the law firm Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf had declared bankruptcy earlier that year. Deutsche Bank provided a $710 million mortgage on the property in February 2013.

===American Realty Capital ownership===

American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, one of several companies owned by New York real estate mogul Nicholas Schorsch, acquired a 48.9 percent interest in the property for $220 million in November 2013, as well as the rights to buy the remaining 51.1%. The move came several months after Scott Rechler&#x27;s RXR Realty had attempted to purchase the building for $1.25 billion. RXR sued American Realty Capital in an attempt to prevent the latter from acquiring ownership of the building. RXR continued its lawsuit even after American Realty Capital had bought the building. During the 2010s, Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore and Nomura Securities each continued to occupy roughly . M. Shanken Communications (owner of Wine Spectator) and CBS-TV both leased space in 2014, followed the next year by Howard J. Rubenstein&#x27;s Rubenstein Associates and Prometheus Global Media. These transactions brought the building to full occupancy.

American Realty Capital placed One Worldwide Plaza for sale in January 2017. The firm exercised its option to purchase an additional 49.9 percent stake in June 2017 for $277 million, bringing the company&#x27;s ownership to 98.8%. While the company had initially hoped to sell its entire stake in the building, bidders were discouraged by the property&#x27;s existing $870 million mortgage, and foreign entities had decreased their investment in New York real estate. American Realty Capital opted to sell only a non-controlling stake in the building and pursue a refinancing. That September, RXR Realty and SL Green Realty agreed to purchase a 48.7 percent stake in One Worldwide Plaza, valuing the building at $1.73 billion. Following the acquisition, American Realty Capital owned 50.1 percent of the building&#x27;s equity and George Comfort &amp; Sons maintained a 1.2 percent stake. At the time, the tenants included Nomura Holdings; Cravath, Swaine and Moore; CBS; and WebMD.

Goldman Sachs agreed to provide a $1.2 billion loan to refinance the property following the acquisition. The commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) loan closed on October 17 and was one of the largest CMBS loans on a New York office building since the financial crisis of 2007–08. Shortly after origination, Goldman Sachs syndicated 25 percent of the loan to Deutsche Bank. The loan consisted of $940 million in senior debt and a $260 million junior loan. At the time, an appraisal valued the property at $1.74 billion since the building was 98.4 percent occupied and generating net cash flows of over $85 million a year. In November 2019, West Monroe Partners leased one floor. 

By 2023, Nomura sought to downsize its space at One Worldwide Plaza, while Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore planned to relocate to Hudson Yards. These two tenants collectively occupied 70 percent of the building, prompting concerns that a $940 million loan on the Worldwide Plaza complex could not be paid off. By January 2024, One Worldwide Plaza was valued at $1.2 billion, a one-third decrease from its 2018 valuation. The $940 million senior loan on the building was sent to special servicing in October 2024 after the loan was placed on a lender watchlist due to lower-than-expected cash flow. In addition, there was a dispute regarding $90 million that had been placed in a reserve account when RXR and SL Green bought a minority stake in the building. In 2025, a state judge ruled that American Realty Capital could keep the money and use the funds to attract tenants.

==Reception==
When One Worldwide Plaza was announced, &quot;New York Times&quot; architecture critic Paul Goldberger criticized the cheapness of the building&#x27;s materials, including the use of brick and the lack of granite, as well as the large massing of the tower and the small size of the driveway. He also noted the building&#x27;s inspiration from the New York Life Building and Crown Building. Nonetheless, Goldberger wrote: &quot;In general, this is the sort of plan the West Side of midtown Manhattan has been waiting for.&quot;

Following Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s completion, Goldberger declared that the project had &quot;turned one of the harshest blocks of midtown Manhattan into a glittering island of corporate luxury.&quot; He did describe One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s lower stories as resembling &quot;stone wallpaper&quot; because the cladding was so thin. Herbert Muschamp, also of the &quot;Times&quot;, regarded the building as one of the city&#x27;s &quot;Art Deco retreads&quot;. Jonathan Yardley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Worldwide within its single city block thus epitomizes the transformation from commercial to residential, and it does so in buildings of singular handsomeness and distinction.&quot; The architect Robert A. M. Stern described One Worldwide Plaza as &quot;the first office building of any importance to be built west of Eighth Avenue&quot; since 330 West 42nd Street was completed in 1931. Ylonda Gault of &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York&quot; wrote that One Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s completion had &quot;catapulted Mr. Childs to celebrity status in architect circles&quot;.

Conversely, Daniel Bluestone wrote for &quot;Design Book Review&quot; in 1992: &quot;For all of its massive display of urbanity, the recoil of the development from its neighborhood is striking.&quot; Nicolai Ouroussoff described One Worldwide Plaza as having a &quot;pointless circular arcade&quot; and said that, like the Hearst Tower several blocks north, the building had a &quot;strained relationship to the streets below&quot;. Brendan Gill, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1990, criticized the project as having &quot;cool reasonableness&quot;, which he saw as &quot;a defect that its designers and builders must have seen as a virtue&quot;. Gill also disliked the fact that the complex&#x27;s largest structure (One Worldwide Plaza) was on Eighth Avenue rather than the middle of the block, and he believed the classical detailing to be excessive. Eric Nash wrote in 2005 that the building &quot;lacks Rockefeller Center&#x27;s sweetly naive spirit, yet still manages to be a distinctive presence on the midtown skyline&quot;.

Worldwide Plaza&#x27;s construction was documented in a five-episode PBS miniseries. In addition, Karl Sabbagh wrote the book &quot;Skyscraper: The Making of a Building&quot; to complement the PBS miniseries. Goldberger wrote that the series was focused largely on the process of actually constructing Worldwide Plaza, rather than &quot;the majesty and ambition of the American skyscraper&quot;, as Childs had intended for One Worldwide Plaza to be.

<doc id="487181" wikidata="Q197257" url="?curid=487181" title="17-Mile Drive">
<text>17-Mile Drive is a scenic road through Pebble Beach and Pacific Grove on the Monterey Peninsula in California, much of which hugs the Pacific coastline and passes famous golf courses, mansions and scenic attractions, including the Lone Cypress, Bird Rock and the Del Monte Forest of Monterey Cypress trees.

The drive serves as the main road through the gated community of Pebble Beach. Inside this community, nonresidents have to pay a toll to use the road. Like the community, the majority of 17-Mile Drive is owned and operated by the Pebble Beach Corporation. The 17-Mile Drive is a -long scenic loop having five primary entrances - the main highway entrance at California State Route 1, and entrances in Carmel and Pacific Grove.

==History==

In 1602 the Monterey Peninsula was mapped by Spanish explorers. By 1840 the area now called Pebble Beach was a rancho left to widow Carmen Garcia Barreto Maderiaga Maria by her husband. She sold the property for $500 in 1846. Ownership passed several times until 1862 when the property was purchased at auction for 12 cents for by David Jacks. At the time, the area was called &quot;Stillwater Cove&quot;. Jacks leased the land to the &quot;China Man Hop Company&quot;, a small village with a population of about 30 Chinese fishermen living in shacks built upon the rocky shoreline.

In 1880, Jacks sold the land to the Pacific Improvement Company (PIC), a consortium of The Big Four railroad barons: Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins, Collis Huntington and Leland Stanford. By 1892, the PIC laid out a scenic road that they called the 17-Mile Drive, meandering along the beaches and among the forested areas between Monterey and Carmel. Within short order, the area became a tourist destination with the building of the Hotel Del Monte.

The hotel was the starting and finishing point for 17-Mile Drive, (originally called the 18-mile Drive by hotel operators). The drive was offered as a pleasure excursion to hotel guests, and was intended to attract wealthy buyers of large and scenic residential plots on PIC land. Sightseers riding horses or carriages along the 17-Mile Drive sometimes stopped at Pebble Beach to pick up agate and other stones polished smooth by the waves, and they commented on a few unusual tree formations known as the Witch Tree and the Ostrich Tree—the latter formed by two trees leaning on each other. At that time, the Chinese fishing community continued in existence despite mounting anti-Chinese sentiment among Monterey residents of European heritage. At roadside stands, Chinese-American girls sold shells and polished pebbles to tourists. In the 1900s, the automobile began replacing horses on 17-Mile Drive, and by 1907 there were only automobiles. The drive featured region&#x27;s historical sites, forests, and on to the coastal scenic attractions in the Hotel Del Monte Park Reservation, as it was known at the time.

Drawn by six bay horses, President Benjamin Harrison took the coach ride through the reservation in 1891. The coach was adorned with the national colors &quot;and the harness on the horses was lined with bunting and roses as far as possible.&quot; In the newspaper &quot;The Monterey Cypress&quot;, President Harrison noted &quot;This is a lovely spot. I only wish I could stay here a week.&quot;
In 1887, the hotel was destroyed by fire and replaced with a new structure. The Del Monte Golf Course was added in 1897 as part of the hotel and is today the oldest operating course west of the Mississippi. In 1919, the Los Angeles Times called the 17-Mile Drive one of the &quot;great wonders of the world.&quot;

On February 27, 1919, Samuel Finley Brown Morse formed the Del Monte Properties Company, and acquired the extensive holdings of the Pacific Improvement Company, which included the Del Monte Forest and the Hotel Del Monte. Another fire destroyed that structure and was replaced by a third hotel. This new hotel was finished in 1926 and requisitioned by the United States government as a training facility in 1942. After World War II, the Hotel del Monte building and surrounding grounds were acquired by the United States Navy for its Naval Postgraduate School and the building was renamed Herrmann Hall. The Del Monte Forest, including the famed 17-Mile Drive, remained under the ownership of Del Monte Properties Company.

On March 30, 1977, the Del Monte Properties Company was reincorporated as the Pebble Beach Corporation. In May 1979, 20th Century Fox, later bought by Marvin Davis, purchased the Pebble Beach Corporation. When the film company was sold to Rupert Murdoch in 1985, Davis kept several company assets not directly related to the film and TV industry, including the Pebble Beach Company. In 1990 Davis sold the company to Japanese businessman Minoru Isutani, who made it a subsidiary of the Japanese resort company Taiheiyo Club Inc. under a holding company called the Lone Cypress Company. In 1999 the Pebble Beach Company was acquired from Cypress by an investor group led by Clint Eastwood, Arnold Palmer, and Peter Ueberroth.

==Route description==
At the north end, a portion of the early route through Pacific Grove begins at the intersection of Del Monte Blvd and Esplanade Street. The famous portion of 17-Mile Drive then begins a few miles south of this point. The crossing of Highway 68 (Holman Highway/Sunset Drive) and 17-Mile Drive marks the entrance to Pebble Beach.

From the Sunset Drive/Pacific Grove gate, the drive runs inland past Spanish Bay, then adjacent to beaches and up into the coastal hills, providing scenic viewpoints. The route allows for self-directed travel and stopping, with frequent turnouts along the roadway in many locations along the route. Without stops, it takes a minimum of 20 minutes to reach Carmel. The numerous turnouts allow stopping to take pictures, or getting out to stroll along the ocean or among the trees. Visitors receive a map that points out some of the more scenic spots. In addition, a red-dashed line is marked in the center of the main road to guide visitors, and help prevent them from venturing into the adjacent neighborhood streets.

==Scenic attractions==

Primary scenic attractions include Cypress Point, Bird Rock, Point Joe, Pescadero Point, Fanshell Beach &amp; Seal Point. The famous &quot;Witch Tree&quot; landmark, often used as scenic background in movies and television, was formerly at Pescadero Point. The tree was blown down by a storm on January 14, 1964. Pescadero Point is also the site of the Ghost Tree, a landmark Monterey Cypress tree. The tree gives its name to a dangerous extreme surfing location known to have storm waves. Currently, the surf break of Ghost Tree is off limits to surfers and watercraft.

Chief among the scenic attractions is the Lone Cypress, a salt-pruned Monterey cypress (macrocarpa) tree which is the official symbol of Pebble Beach and a frequent fixture of television broadcasts from this area. In 1990 the &quot;Monterey Journal&quot; reported that Pebble Beach&#x27;s lawyer, Kerry C. Smith, said &quot;The image of the tree has been trademarked by us,&quot; and that it intended to control any display of the cypress for commercial purposes. The company had warned photographers that &quot;they cannot even use existing pictures of the tree for commercial purposes&quot;.

<text>Ernst Curtius (; 2 September 181411 July 1896) was a German archaeologist, historian and museum director.
==Biography==

He was born in Lübeck. On completing his university studies he was chosen by C. A. Brandis to accompany him on a journey to Greece for the prosecution of archaeological researches. Curtius then became Karl Otfried Müller&#x27;s companion in his exploration of the Peloponnese, and on Müller&#x27;s death in 1840 he returned to Germany. In 1844, he became an extraordinary professor at the University of Berlin, and in the same year he was appointed tutor to Prince Frederick William (afterwards the Emperor Frederick III), a post which he held until 1850.

After holding a professorship at Göttingen and undertaking a further journey to Greece in 1862, Curtius was appointed (in 1863) ordinary professor at Berlin. In 1874, he was sent to Athens by the German government and there concluded an agreement by which the excavations at Olympia were entrusted exclusively to Germany. Curtius was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1876. In 1891 Curtius was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895. Curtius died in Berlin on 11 July 1896.

==Excavation in Olympia==
On 10 June 1852 Ernst Curtius delivered his famous oration on Olympia at the Singakademie in Berlin in the presence of royal family, which marked the first step towards excavations of Olympia, and gave great impetus for the historical archaeological works in Greece. Following the death of Eduard Gerhard in 1867, Curtius succeeded him as professor of classical archaeology at Berlin. At the same time, Curtius served as a director of the Altes Museum and Antiquarium. The Turko-Russian War (1877–78) delayed the process of reaching an agreement between Greek and German governments for undertaking excavation at Olympia.

Curtius&#x27;s imperial connections helped him to convince the government to nationalize the German Archaeological Institute in 1874, and open a branch in Athens. In 1874, the Greek government granted the exclusive right to the German Archaeological Institute to excavate at Olympia. A landmark agreement in the history of archaeology was signed by Curtius on 25 April 1874 at Athens, which mandated the Germans to leave all finds in Greece. A special museum was built on the site for this purpose.

In 1875 Curtius led large-scale expeditions of archeologists to systematically unearth Olympia. The first excavation was begun at Olympic in Elis, the original Olympic site, where for a thousand years, the Olympic Games had been held. Within six years, they cleared the Olympic stadium, with its runner&#x27;s starting blocks and judges’ seat. The excavators also uncovered temple of Zeus’s and Hera.

The findings were published in scientific journals in voluminous throughout Europe between 1890 and 1897. Similarly, the German archaeologists were able to bring to life the knowledge of Olympic with paintings of the Olympic site, and the procedures of the Olympic Games. These helped the western world to understand the importance of reviving the Olympic Games.

==Works==
His best-known work is his &quot;History of Greece&quot; (1857–1867). It presented in an attractive style what were then the latest results of scholarly research, but it was criticized as wanting in erudition. It is now superseded. His other writings are chiefly archaeological. The most important are:
*&quot;Die Akropolis von Athen&quot; (1844)
*&quot;Naxos&quot; (1846)
*&quot;Peloponnesos, eine historisch-geographische Beschreibung der Halbinsel&quot; (1851)
*&quot;Olympia&quot; (1852)
*&quot;Die Ionier vor der ionischen Wanderung&quot; (1855)
*&quot;Attische Studien&quot; (1862–1865)
*&quot;Ephesos&quot; (1874)
*&quot;Die Ausgrabungen zu Olympia&quot; (1877, etc.)
*&quot;Olympia und Umgegend&quot; (edited by Curtius and F. Adler, 1882)
*&quot;Olympia. Die Ergebnisse der von dem deutschen Reich veranstalteten Ausgrabung&quot; (with F. Adler, 1890–1898)
*&quot;Die Stadtgeschichte von Athen&quot; (1891)
*&quot;Gesammelte Abhandlungen&quot; (1894)

His collected speeches and lectures were published under the title of &quot;Altertum und Gegenwart&quot; (5th ed., 1903 foll.), to which a third volume was added under the title of &quot;Unter drei Kaisern&quot; (2nd ed., 1895).

==Family==
His brother, Georg Curtius, was a noted philologist.

<text>Mark George Tobey (December 11, 1890 – April 24, 1976) was an American painter. His densely structured compositions, inspired by Asian calligraphy, resemble Abstract expressionism, although the motives for his compositions differ philosophically from most Abstract Expressionist painters. His work was widely recognized throughout the United States and Europe. Along with Guy Anderson, Kenneth Callahan, Morris Graves, and William Cumming, Tobey was a founder of the Northwest School. Senior in age and experience, he had a strong influence on the others; friend and mentor, Tobey shared their interest in philosophy and Eastern religions. Similar to others of the Northwest School, Tobey was mostly self-taught after early studies at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1921, Tobey founded the art department at The Cornish School in Seattle, Washington.

Tobey was an incessant traveler, visiting Mexico, Europe, Palestine, Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, China , and Japan. After converting to the Baháʼí Faith, it became an important part of his life. Whether Tobey&#x27;s all-over paintings, marked by oriental brushwork and calligraphic strokes, were an influencer on Jackson Pollock&#x27;s drip paintings has been left unanswered. Born in Centerville, Wisconsin, Tobey lived in the Seattle, Washington area for most of his life before moving to Basel, Switzerland in the early 1960s with his companion, Pehr Hallsten; Tobey died there in 1976.

==Early years==
Tobey was the youngest of four children in a Congregationalist family. His parents were George Tobey, a carpenter and house builder, and Emma Cleveland Tobey. The father carved animals from stone and sometimes drew animals for young Mark to cut out with scissors. In 1893, the family settled in Chicago. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1906 to 1908, but, like others of the Northwest School, was mostly self-taught. In 1911, he moved to New York City where he worked as a fashion illustrator for McCall&#x27;s. His first one-man show was held at Knoedler &amp; Company in lower Manhattan, in 1917. The following year, Tobey came in contact with New York portrait artist and Baháʼí Juliet Thompson—an associate of Khalil Gibran—and posed for her. During the session, Tobey read some Baháʼí literature and accepted an invitation to Green Acre where he converted to the Baháʼí Faith. His conversion led him to explore the representation of the spiritual in art. In the following years, Tobey delved into works of Arabian literature and teachings of East Asian philosophy.

==Career==

===Early years===
Tobey&#x27;s arrival in Seattle in 1921 was in part an effort for a new start following a marriage and quick divorce. When his ex-wife found Tobey&#x27;s address, she sent him a box of his clothes topped with a copy of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Light That Failed&quot;. In the following year, Tobey met Teng Kuei, a Chinese painter and student at the University of Washington, who introduced Tobey to Eastern penmanship, beginning Tobey&#x27;s exploration of Chinese calligraphy. The beginning of his lifelong travels occurred in 1925 when he left for Europe, settling in Paris where Tobey met Gertrude Stein. He spent a winter at Châteaudun, and also traveled to Barcelona and Greece. In Constantinople, Beirut and Haifa, he studied Arab and Persian writing.

Upon returning to Seattle in 1927, Tobey shared a studio in a house near the Cornish School (with which he was intermittently associated) with the teenage artist, Robert Bruce Inverarity, who was 20 years younger. Inspired by Inverarity&#x27;s high-school project, Tobey developed interest in three-dimensional form and carved some 100 pieces of soap sculpture. The next year, Tobey co-founded the Free and Creative Art School in Seattle with Edgar Ames, and in autumn, he taught an advanced art course at Emily Carr&#x27;s Victoria studio.

In 1929, he participated in a show that marked a change in his life: a solo exhibition at Romany Marie&#x27;s Cafe Gallery in New York. Alfred H. Barr, Jr., then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), saw the show and selected several pictures from it for inclusion in MoMA&#x27;s 1930 exhibition: Painting and Sculpture by Living Americans. In 1931, Tobey became a resident artist of the Elmhurst Progressive School while teaching at Dartington Hall in Devon and painting frescoes for the school. He became a close friend of Bernard Leach, who was also on the faculty. Introduced by Tobey to the Baháʼí Faith, Leach became a convert. During his stay in Devon, Tobey found time to travel to Mexico (1931), Europe, and Palestine (1932). In 1934, Tobey and Leach traveled together through France and Italy, then sailed from Naples to Hong Kong and Shanghai, where they parted company. Leach went on to Japan, while Tobey remained in Shanghai visiting his old friend, Teng Kuei, before departing for Japan. Japanese authorities confiscated and destroyed an edition of 31 drawings on wet paper that Tobey had brought with him from England to be published in Japan. No explanation for their destruction has been noted; possibly they considered his sketches of nude men pornographic. In early summer, he studied Hai-Ku poetry and calligraphy at a Zen monastery outside Kyoto before returning to Seattle in autumn.

Tobey&#x27;s first solo exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum occurred in 1935; he also traveled to New York, Washington, D.C., Alberta, Canada, as well as Haifa for a Baháʼí pilgrimage. Sometime in November or December, while working at night at Dartington Hall and listening to the horses breathe in the field outside his window, he painted a series of three paintings, &quot;Broadway&quot;, &quot;Welcome Hero&quot;, and &quot;Broadway Norm&quot;, in the style that would become known as &quot;white writing&quot; (an interlacing of fine white lines).

===Mid-career===

Tobey expected to return to teaching in England in 1938, but the mounting tensions of war building in Europe kept him in the US. Instead, he began to work on the Federal Art Project, under the supervision of Inverarity. In June 1939, when Tobey attended a Baháʼí summer program and overstayed his allotted vacation time, Inverarity dropped him from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. Tobey met the Swedish scholar, Pehr Hallsten (died 1965, Basel), in Ballard in 1939 and they became companions, living together from 1940. By 1942, Tobey&#x27;s process of abstractionism was accompanied by a new calligraphic experiment. Marian Willard of the Willard Gallery in New York had seen some of Tobey&#x27;s WPA paintings and gave him a show in 1944, which was considered to be a major success. In 1945, he gave a solo exhibition at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon, and the Arts Club of Chicago held solo shows of his work in 1940 and 1946. He studied the piano and the theory of music with Lockrem Johnson, and, when Johnson was away, with Wesley Wehr, who was introduced to Tobey in 1949 by their pianist friend Berthe Poncy Jacobson. Wehr, an undergraduate at the time, happily accepted the opportunity to serve as a stand-in music composition tutor for Tobey and over time became friends with him and his circle of artists, becoming a painter himself, as well as a chronicler of the group.

Tobey showed at New York&#x27;s Whitney Museum in 1951. He also spent three months as guest critic of graduate students&#x27; work at Yale University on the invitation of Josef Albers, and had his first retrospective show at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. In 1952, the film &quot;Tobey, Mark: Artist&quot; debuted in the Venice and Edinburgh film festivals. Acknowledging &quot;academic responsibility,&quot; Hallsten enrolled in graduate school at the University of Washington&#x27;s department of Scandinavian languages and literature in the early 1950s and, after receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Tobey began referring to him by the honorific, Professor.

On September 28, 1953, &quot;Life&quot; magazine published an article on Tobey, Guy Anderson, Kenneth Callahan, and Morris Graves entitled, &quot;Mystic Painters of the Northwest,&quot; which placed them in the national limelight. The four were considered founders of the Northwest School. He held a solo show at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher in Paris in 1955, and traveled to Basel and Bern. He began his ink wash paintings two years later. In 1958, he became the second American, after James Abbott McNeill Whistler, to win the International Grand Prize at the Venice Biennale.

===Later years===

Tobey and Hallsten emigrated to Basel, Switzerland in the early 1960s. Tobey, who had been an incessant traveler in earlier years , concentrated on his art, while Hallsten felt restless and traveled through Europe, returning to Basel. In 1960, Tobey participated in the Association of Visual Artists Vienna Secession, and in the following year, he became the first American painter to exhibit at the Pavillon de Marsan in Paris. Solo exhibits occurred at MoMa in 1962, and at the Stedelijk Museum in 1966, the same year that he visited the Baháʼí World Center in Haifa. In 1967, he showed again at the Willard Gallery, and held a retrospective show at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts the following year. Another major retrospective of the artist&#x27;s work took place at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Collection of Fine Arts in 1974. Tobey died in Basel in 1976.

In 2017 (from 6 May to 17 September), an important retrospective exhibition of Tobey&#x27;s mature work was mounted in Venice, Italy, sponsored by the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art Philips Academy of Andover, Massachusetts, and curated by Debra Bricker Balken. The exhibition was able to draw crowds from the Venice Biennale, gaining international attention and spurring an international reassessment of Tobey&#x27;s significance before traveling to the Addison Gallery of American Arts, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts and exhibited 4 November 2017 to 11 March 2018.

==Style==

Tobey is most noted for his late &quot;white writing&quot; style, where an overlay of white or light-colored calligraphic brush strokes is painted over an abstract field of muted color, which is itself composed of small, interwoven brush strokes. This method, in turn, gave rise to the type of &quot;all-over&quot; painting style made most famous by Jackson Pollock and later painters.

When unveiling his white writing work at the Willard Gallery, where a lot of the future Abstract Expressionists were then exhibiting, Tobey did not want to confuse people as he was based in Seattle with strong ties to Asian art. Willard hired Sidney Janis (who would in 1948 open his own gallery in New York, pulling the Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, and Philip Guston with him) to write an essay for the Tobey work at Willard to clarify Tobey&#x27;s position. This essay both acknowledged Tobey&#x27;s orientation toward Asia and emphasized an important distinction between his white writing and the automatic writing of the Surrealists which would inspire many of the American Abstract Expressionists. To quote Janis:Nine years ago in 1935, Mark Tobey evolved the technique of white writing, which has distinguished his work. This method, a fusion of the spirit of Chinese writing with morphic characters rooted in twentieth-century painting, derives from Tobey&#x27;s intensely personalized vision. ... It is presumably different from the psychic automation in [that it] is essentially under conscious direction.Janis claimed that Tobey&#x27;s style was &quot;at odds with the latest iterations of modernism,&quot; because &quot;Tobey&#x27;s white writing was more studied and controlled, the outcome of prolonged deliberation.&quot; In this regard, Tobey&#x27;s painting &quot;Threading Light&quot; (1942), which was in the Willard show of 1944, has been compared to Pollocks&#x27;s &quot;Night Mist&quot; of 1945 and André Masson&#x27;s &quot;Automatic Drawing&quot; of 1924, which is an example of work directly influenced by Surrealist automatic writing.

==Influence==
Tobey, the senior of the &#x27;mystical painters&#x27;, was an influence on Graves. Tobey studied piano and music theory with John Cage, and thereafter, it was Tobey who had an influence on Cage.

Elizabeth Bayley Willis showed Tobey&#x27;s painting &quot;Bars and Flails&quot; to Jackson Pollock in 1944. Pollock studied the painting closely and then painted &quot;Blue Poles&quot;, a painting that made history when, in 1973, the Australian government bought it for $2 million. A Pollock biographer wrote: &quot;...[Tobey&#x27;s] dense web of white strokes, as elegant as Oriental calligraphy, impressed Jackson so much that in a letter to Louis Bunce he described Tobey, a West Coast artist, as an &#x27;exception&#x27; to the rule that New York was &#x27;the only real place in America where painting (in the real sense) can come thru.&quot; Pollock went to all of Tobey&#x27;s Willard Gallery shows where Tobey presented small to medium-sized canvases, measuring approximately . After Pollock viewed them, he went back home and blew them up to , pouring paint onto the canvas instead of brushing it on. Pollock was never really concerned with diffused light, but he was very interested in Tobey&#x27;s idea of covering the entire canvas with marks up to and including its edges, something not done previously in American art.

Helmi Juvonen, another Northwest School artist and diagnosed manic-depressive, was obsessed with Tobey, and suffered the delusion that she and Tobey were to be married, even though Tobey was gay.

==Legacy==
At least five of his works are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Northwest Art. Tobey&#x27;s work can also be found in most major museums in the U.S. and internationally, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Tate Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. There have been at least four posthumous individual exhibitions of Tobey&#x27;s work: National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., USA, 1984; Museum Folkwang, Essen, Germany, 1989; Galerie Beyeler, Basel, Switzerland, 1990; and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, Spain, November 11, 1997 – January 12, 1998 where the exhibition brought together about 130 works from some 56 different collections, covering the years from 1924 to 1975. Two of Tobey&#x27;s paintings are in Guggenheim collections. A number of his figurative and abstract works are held by the Dartington Hall Trust. Four of Tobey&#x27;s signed lithographs hang in the reception hall in the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing institution of the Baháʼí Faith, as his work was inspired by Oriental influences and his involvement in the Baháʼí Faith.

&quot;Anatoma tobeyoides&quot;, a species of sea snail, is named in honor of Tobey.

<text>The Rostra () was a large platform built in the city of Rome that stood during the republican and imperial periods. Speakers would stand on the rostra and face the north side of the Comitium towards the senate house and deliver orations to those assembled in between. It is often referred to as a &quot;suggestus&quot; or &quot;tribunal&quot;, the first form of which dates back to the Roman Kingdom, the Vulcanal.

It derives its name from the six &quot;rostra&quot; (plural of &quot;rostrum&quot;, a warship&#x27;s ram) which were captured following the victory which ended the Latin War in the Battle of Antium in 338 BC and mounted to its side. Originally, the term meant a single structure located within the Comitium space near the Roman Forum and usually associated with the Senate Curia. It began to be referred to as the &quot;Rostra Vetera&quot; (&quot;Elder &quot;Rostra&quot;&quot;) in the imperial age to distinguish it from other later platforms designed for similar purposes which took the name &quot;Rostra&quot; along with its builder&#x27;s name or the person it honored.

== History ==

Magistrates, politicians, advocates and other orators spoke to the assembled people of Rome from this highly honored, and elevated spot. Consecrated by the Augurs as a &quot;templum&quot;, the original Rostra was built as early as the 6th century BC. This Rostra was replaced and enlarged a number of times but remained in the same site for centuries. 

In 338 BC the Rostra got its name when, following the defeat of Antium by the consul Gaius Maenius, the Antiate fleet was confiscated by Rome, of which the prows (literally &quot;rostra&quot; in Latin) of six ships were set upon the Rostra. Maenius paid for it out of his share of war booty. He also erected a victory column, the &quot;Columna Maenia&quot;, close to the Rostra. 

Julius Caesar rearranged the Comitium and Forum spaces and repositioned the Senate Curia at the end of the republican period. He moved the Rostra out of the Comitium. This took away the commanding position the curia had held within the whole of the forum, having advanced extremely close to the Rostra during its last restoration. Augustus, his grand-nephew and first Roman emperor, finished what Caesar had begun, as well as expanded on it. This &quot;New Rostra&quot; became known as the Rostra Augusti. What remains in the excavated forum today, next to the Arch of Septimius Severus, has endured several restorations and alterations throughout its historical use. While a few different honorary names are attributed to those restorations, scholars, archeologists and the government of Italy recognise this platform as the &quot;Rostra Vetera&quot; encased inside the &quot;Rostra Augusti&quot;.

The term &quot;&quot;, referring to a podium for a speaker is directly derived from the use of the term &quot;Rostra&quot;. One stands in front of a &quot;Rostrum&quot; and one stands upon the &quot;Rostra&quot;. While, eventually, there were many &quot;rostra&quot; within the city of Rome and its republic and empire, then, as now, &quot;Rostra&quot; alone refers to a specific structure.
Before the Forum Romanum, the Comitium was the first designated spot for all political and judicial activity and the earliest place of public assembly in the city. A succession of earlier shrines and altars is mentioned in early Roman writings as the first &quot;suggestum&quot;. It consisted of a shrine to the god Vulcan, that had two separate altars built at different periods. This early Etruscan mundus altar originally sat in front of a temple that would later be converted into the Curia Hostilia.

During the late Republic the rostra was used as a place to display the heads of defeated political enemies. Gaius Marius and consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna captured Rome in 87 BC and placed the head of the defeated consul, Gnaeus Octavius, on the Rostra. The practice was continued by Sulla and Mark Antony, who ordered that Cicero&#x27;s hands and head be displayed on Caesar&#x27;s Rostra after the orator&#x27;s execution as part of the Proscription of 43 BC.

Caesar spoke from the Rostra in 67 BC in a successful effort to pass, over the opposition of the Senate, a bill proposed by the tribune Aulus Gabinius (the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot;) creating an extraordinary command for Pompey to eliminate piracy in the Mediterranean. Brutus and Cassius spoke from the Rostra to an unenthusiastic crowd in the Forum after the assassination of Caesar in 44 BC. Millar comments that during the late Republic, when violence became a regular feature of public meetings, physical control and occupation of the Rostra became a crucial political objective.

=== Tribal assemblies and tribunals ===
Until about 145 BC, the Comitium was the site for tribal assemblies (comitia tributa) at which important decisions were taken, magistrates were elected and criminal prosecutions were presented and resolved by tribal voting. Before an assembly, the convening magistrate, acting as augur, had to take the auspices in the inaugurated area (&quot;templum&quot;) on the Rostra from which he was to conduct the proceedings. If the omens were favorable and no other magistrate announced unfavorable omens, the magistrate summoned other magistrates and senators and directed a herald to summon the people. Heralds did so from the Rostra and from the City walls. During an assembly, magistrates, senators and private citizens spoke on pending legislation or for or against candidates for office. Before bills were presented for voting, a herald read them to the crowd from the Rostra. At the culmination of the process, the tribes were each called up to the &quot;templum&quot; on the Rostra to deliver their votes. After about 145 BC, the voting population of Rome grew too large for the Comitium, and tribal assemblies were then held at the opposite end of the Forum around the Temple of Castor, the steps of which served as an informal Rostra.
The Rostra was also used for meetings of courts. In Republican Rome, criminal prosecutions took place in the Forum either before a tribal assembly with a magistrate prosecuting (a procedure specified in the Twelve Tables and the normal mode of prosecution in the middle Republic) or in a jury-court (&quot;quaestio de repetundis&quot;) established by statute and presided over by a magistrate with a jury (after 70 BC) of about 50-75 jurors. For trials held in the Comitium, the Rostra served as the tribunal upon which the magistrate sat in his curule chair with a small number of attendants. &quot;This was enough in itself to establish a court, though it was supplemented by benches (&quot;subsellia&quot;) for the jurors, the parties to the case, and their supporters.&quot; The circle of onlookers (&quot;corona&quot;) either stood or sat on nearby steps.

The original structure was built during the middle years of the Roman Republic in approximately 500 BC It subsequently became known as the &quot;Rostra&quot; after the end of the Latin War in 338 BC when it was adorned by Gaius Maenius with naval rams (&quot;rostra&quot;) of ships captured at Antium as war trophies.

The Rostra was located on the south side of the Comitium opposite the Curia Hostilia (the original Senate house), overlooking both the Comitium and the Roman Forum. In addition to the prows of captured ships, the Rostra bore a sundial and, at various times, statues of such important political figures as Camillus, Sulla and Pompey. Private citizens also erected a number of honorary columns and monuments on the Rostra and throughout the forum. At one point, the Senate threatened to have them removed if the donors did not do so themselves.

=== Rostra Vetera ===

In form, the original Rostra may have been a simple raised platform made of wood, similar to the Roman tribunal. The Rostra had a curved form, possibly along the outer south rim of an amphitheatre. The structure was described by Christian Charles Josias Bunsen, based on his examination of two Roman coins depicting the Rostra, as &quot;a circular building, raised on arches, with a stand or platform on the top bordered by a parapet; the access to it being by two flights of steps, one on each side. It fronted towards the Comitium, but later speakers often faced in the opposite direction to address larger audiences in the Forum. The Rostra Vetera&#x27;s form has been in all the main points preserved in the ambones, or circular pulpits, of the most ancient churches, which also had two flights of steps leading up to them, one on the east side, by which the preacher ascended, and another on the west side, for his descent. Specimens of these old churches are still to be seen at Rome in the churches of San Clemente al Laterano and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura.

As part of his reconstruction of the Roman Forum in 44 BC, Julius Caesar is believed to have moved the republican &quot;Rostra Vetera&quot;. This Rostra, referred to as the &quot;Rostra Nova&quot; or &quot;Caesarian Rostra&quot;, reused and incorporated nearly all of the original Rostra. Located on the southwest side of the new Julian Forum (&quot;Forum Iulium&quot;), the new Rostra was no longer subordinated to his new Senate House, the Curia Julia (still standing); Caesar had it placed on the central axis of the Forum, facing toward the open space. Left uncompleted at Caesar&#x27;s death, Augustus finished and extended the new Rostra into a rectangle at the front, the dimensions being long, broad and above the level of the forum pavement. Traces of this Rostra can be seen today.

At the opposite end of the open Forum, the Temple of Caesar, completed by Augustus in 29 BC, included another Rostra at the front of its elevated base, facing the &quot;Caesarian Rostra&quot;. This Rostra was decorated with the rams from the Battle of Actium. John E. Stambaugh, professor of classics at Williams College, described the new arrangement as &quot;a reflection of contemporary taste and the relentless Augustan desire for order.&quot;

== In contemporary news ==
In November 2008 heavy rain damaged the concrete covering that has been protecting the Vulcanal and its monuments located in the Imperial comitium space since the 1950s. This includes the stele accorded the name of &quot;The Black Rock&quot; or Lapis Niger. The marble and cement covering is a mix of the original black marble, said to have been used to cover the site by Sulla, and modern cement used to create the covering and keeping the marble in place.

Professor Angelo Bottini, Superintendent of Archeology in Rome, stated that an awning or tent covering is in place to protect the ancient relics until the covering is repaired, giving tourists of this millennium a look at the original suggestum for the first time in 50 years.

== Other known Rostra ==

In 29 BC Augustus ordered the construction of another Rostra in front of the Temple of Caesar, at the opposite end of the Forum Iulium from Caesar&#x27;s Rostra. This was used as a tribunal and was adorned with the prows of galleys captured at the Battle of Actium.

<text>Georg Curtius (April 16, 1820August 12, 1885) was a German philologist and distinguished comparativist.

==Biography==
Curtius was born in Lübeck, and was the brother of the historian and archeologist Ernst Curtius. After an education at Bonn and Berlin, he was for three years schoolmaster in Dresden, until (in 1845) he returned to Berlin University as a &quot;privatdocent&quot;. In 1849 he was placed in charge of the Philological Seminary at Prague, and two years later was appointed professor of classical philology in Prague University. In 1854, he moved from Prague to a similar appointment at Kiel, and again in 1862 from Kiel to Leipzig. He was teaching lndo-European and the historical grammar of the classical languages at Leipzig. His contributions were focused &quot;to bridge the gulf between classical philology and Aryan linguistics.&quot; As a professor he constantly attempted &quot; to bring Classical Philology and the Science of Language into closer relation with each other.&quot; This is clearly reflected in the works of his pupils, and of his own.

His philological theories exercised a widespread influence. The more important of his publications are:
*&quot;Die Sprachvergleichung in ihrem Verhältniss zur classischen Philologie&quot; (1845; Eng. trans. by FH Trithen, 1851)
*&quot;Sprachvergleichende Beiträge zur griechischen und lateinischen Grammatik&quot; (1846)
*&quot;Grundzüge der griechischen Etymologie&quot; (1858–1862, 5th ed. 1879)
*&quot;Das Verbum der griechischen Sprache&quot; (1873).
The last two works were translated into English by Augustus Samuel Wilkins and Edwin Bourdieu England.

From 1878 until his death Curtius was general editor of the &quot;Leipziger Studien zur classischen Philologie&quot;. His &quot;Griechische Schulgrammatik&quot;, first published in 1852, passed through more than twenty editions and was edited in English. In his last work, &quot;Zur Kritik der neuesten Sprachforschung&quot; (1885), he attacked the views of the emerging Neogrammarian school of philology.

Curtius died in Hermsdorf am Kynast, aged 65, and was succeeded at Leipzig by his studentKarl Brugmann. The &quot;Opuscula&quot; of Georg Curtius were edited after his death by Ernst Windisch (&quot;Kleine Schriften von E. C.&quot;, 1886–1887). He was posthumously elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1886.

<text>Christian August Brandis (13 February 179021 July 1867) was a German philologist and historian of philosophy.

==Biography==
Brandis was born at Hildesheim, and was the son of the physician Joachim Dietrich Brandis. His father moved to Copenhagen in 1810, where he became personal physician to Queen Marie.

He was educated at Kiel University. In 1812 he graduated at Copenhagen, with a thesis &quot;Commentationes Eleaticae&quot; (a collection of fragments from Xenophanes, Parmenides and Melissus). For a time he studied at Göttingen, and in 1815 presented as his inaugural dissertation at Berlin his essay &quot;Von dem Begriff der Geschichte der Philosophie&quot;.

In 1816 he refused an extraordinary professorship at Heidelberg in order to accompany BG Niebuhr to Italy as secretary to the Prussian embassy. Subsequently, he assisted Immanuel Bekker in the preparation of his edition of Aristotle. In 1821 he became professor of philosophy in the newly founded University of Bonn, and in 1823 published his &quot;Aristotelius et Theophrasti Metaphysica&quot;. With Böckh and Niebuhr he edited the &quot;Rheinisches Museum&quot;, to which he contributed important articles on Socrates (1827, 1829). From 1836 to 1839 he was tutor to the young King Otto of Greece. Brandis was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1839.

His great work, the &quot;Handbuch der Geschichte der Griechisch-Römischen Philosophie&quot; (1835-1866; republished in a smaller and more systematic form, &quot;Geschichte der Entwicklungen der griechischen Philosophie und ihrer Nachwirkungen im römischen Reiche&quot;, 1862-1866), is characterized by sound criticism.

Brandis died on 21 July 1867 in Bonn, Germany.

He was the father of the forestry academic and administrator Sir Dietrich Brandis.

<doc id="487220" wikidata="Q456820" url="?curid=487220" title="Thomas Hodgkin">
<text>Thomas Hodgkin  (17 August 1798 – 5 April 1866) was a British physician, considered one of the most prominent pathologists of his time and a pioneer in preventive medicine. He is now best known for the first account of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, a form of lymphoma and blood disease, in 1832. Hodgkin&#x27;s work marked the beginning of times when a pathologist was actively involved in the clinical process. He was a contemporary of Thomas Addison and Richard Bright at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London.

==Early life==

Thomas Hodgkin was born to a Quaker family in Pentonville, St. James Parish, Middlesex, the son of John Hodgkin. He received private education with his brother John Hodgkin, and in 1816 took a position as private secretary to William Allen. His aim was to learn the trade of apothecary, one of the routes into medicine, and Allen, despite prominence in that business, did not make it possible. They parted, and Hodgkin went to an apothecary cousin, John Glaisyer, in Brighton instead. He inherited property from his great-uncle of the same name, meaning that from age 21 he had a degree of financial independence.

==Medical training and travel==
In September 1819 Hodgkin was admitted to St. Thomas&#x27; and Guy&#x27;s Medical School. He &quot;walked the wards&quot; for a year on the rounds of physicians and surgeons, and attended lectures, in particular those by Astley Cooper. He then studied at the University of Edinburgh, where the lecturers who impressed him included Andrew Duncan, the younger, and Robert Jameson in natural history. His first published paper, on the spleen, came from Duncan&#x27;s course, and drew on the veterinary writings of his friend Bracy Clark. During his time as a student, he became a member of the Royal Medical Society.

In 1821, Hodgkin went to France, where he learned to work with the stethoscope, a recent invention of René Laennec. He also took account of the exacting statistical and clinical approach of Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. He associated there with British expatriates including Robert Knox and Helen Maria Williams. In 1823, he qualified for his M.D. at the University of Edinburgh Medical School with a thesis on the physiological mechanisms of absorption in animals.

In Paris Hodgkin met Benjamin Thorpe, a banker for Rothschild&#x27;s at the time, who was suffering from tuberculosis. Hodgkin became his physician for a while, and Thorpe was cured. This contact led to another appointment as physician to Abraham Montefiore, married to Henriette, daughter of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Once graduated at Edinburgh, Hodgkin joined the couple for travel in Italy. Abraham was seriously ill with tuberculosis (he died in 1824) and the position proved unsatisfactory for both sides, with Hodgkin dismissed. But the relationship he built up with Moses Montefiore, Abraham&#x27;s brother, proved a lifelong friendship.

Staying in Paris for an extended period from September 1824 to June 1825, Hodgkin made significant medical contacts. The Edwards brothers, William-Frédéric Edwards and Henri Milne Edwards, were both physiologists with distinctive theories, and Hodgkin looked over their work in the next few years. Achille-Louis Foville was a neurologist, around whom Hodgkin tried unsuccessfully, from 1838, to set up a southern version of the York Retreat.

==Career at Guy&#x27;s==
Hodgkin found a position at Guy&#x27;s, first as a volunteer clerk in 1825, and then in 1826 as the curator of the museum there, also carrying out autopsies. He built up his reputation on the work his posts brought him in morbid anatomy (anatomical pathology as it is now called).

Hodgkin&#x27;s hospital career came to an end, however, in 1837, when he clashed with the autocratic Benjamin Harrison. Harrison disliked Hodgkin&#x27;s progressive views, and support for the new University College, London, and had been personally offended by them in one instance (see below). There were two confrontational interviews in which Harrison went over pretexts for not giving Hodgkin a promotion (to Assistant Physician); Hodgkin had also been ill not long before. His friends pushed the issue to an acrimonious vote of the governors, which was in fact hopeless. The position went to the rival candidate Benjamin Guy Babington, and Hodgkin moved reluctantly into private practice, after a period of convalescence. In 1840 he attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London representing the Aborigines Protection Society.

==Lecturer at St. Thomas&#x27;==
Hodgkin had a further period of involvement with hospital medicine, when in 1842 he was asked to take charge of teaching at St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital. After joint management of Guy&#x27;s and St. Thomas&#x27; had ended in 1825, St. Thomas&#x27; had found itself eclipsed as a medical school by its former partner. Hodgkin was brought in, and found new lecturers in Marshall Hall and George Gregory; he lectured himself, and with Charles Barker the four embarked on a lecture series. He also drew on his experience at Guy&#x27;s to improve the museum and start a Clinical Society for reporting of cases. The outcome, however, was unsatisfactory for him. Hall was much preferred as lecturer, and Gregory, lecturing on skin diseases, gained a reputation for clarity, and wrote a textbook. But Hodgkin was not asked to continue lecturing for another year, ending the relationship.

==Last years==

In around 1847, Hodgkin became guardian to an Aboriginal Australian youth, Warrulan, who had been brought to England in 1845 by Edward John Eyre, arranging for him to be educated at the Quaker Sibford School.

Hodgkin married in 1850 Sarah Frances Scaife, a widow; they had no children. When Lady Montefiore died in 1862, Hodgkin promised her to travel with her husband on future journeys. He accompanied Moses Montefiore to Palestine in 1866. There he contracted dysentery and died on 4 April 1866. He was buried in Jaffa.

==Interests==
Hodgkin like many other Quakers was concerned both with the abolition of slavery and the reduction of the impact of western colonization on indigenous peoples around the world. He stood aside from the Anti-Slavery Society of the 1820s and 1830s, however; the society took a different line on emancipation and colonization in Africa. It refused in the early 1830s to publish his views. Hodgkin began to take multiple initiatives of his own.

===Ethnology===
Hodgkin had an interest in both the physical anthropology and the cultural aspects of what would now be ethnology, before the academic disciplines existed. In his role as keeper of the Museum at Guy&#x27;s, he collected specimens from peoples from around the world. In 1827, in a letter supporting the missionary Hannah Kilham who was working with West African languages, he published for the first time long-held ideas on &quot;civilisation&quot;; a Civilization Society in London had been a Hodgkin family initiative some years earlier. In helping to found the Aborigines Protection Society, he argued that languages constituted philological evidence of man&#x27;s origins, and should therefore be preserved where threatened; he had written a paper on the topic, and proposed a questionnaire, for the Philological Society in 1835.

For Hodgkin, language was a racial trait. In Paris around the end of 1838, he prevailed upon W. F. Edwards to form a French society with the same aims as the Aborigines Protection Society; and in 1839 the Société Ethnologique de Paris was set up in accordance with Edwards&#x27;s own ideas. This development was reflected in 1843 when the Ethnological Society of London was set up, diverging from the Aborigines Protection Society by its scientific and linguistic interests, and disconnecting from missionary work.

===Colonization in Africa===
Hodgkin was a supporter of Liberia in the early days of its foundation; and he compared it favourably to Sierra Leone. In supporting Elliott Cresson and the American Colonization Society, he put himself outside the mainstream of Quaker and abolitionist thinking. When the American abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, toured in England in 1833, Hodgkin tried at first to mediate between Garrison and Cresson. The formation, however, of the British African Colonization Society by Cresson had Hodgkin&#x27;s support, and he found himself isolated from natural allies who were Quakers or physicians. There were personal attacks on Hodgkin from the Garrison camp.

===Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===
Hodgkin became involved in campaigning concerning the Boothia Peninsula and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company around 1836–37, through his friend Richard King. King had been on the expedition of Captain George Back in the north of Canada of 1833–35, and had written an 1836 book, his &quot;Narrative&quot;, on it; he advocated a further expedition in the same area in 1836–37, a cause Hodgkin took up. Sensitive commercial interests were involved, as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s license was due for renewal in 1841. The &quot;Narrative&quot; contained a piece Hodgkin had written on the indifference of the company to the indigenous peoples of western Canada. Hodgkin then took up the behaviour of the company with Benjamin Harrison, Treasurer of Guy&#x27;s, disastrously mixing his professional life with his activism: Harrison was concerned in the management of the company as deputy chairman, and was related by marriage to John Henry Pelly, the chairman, who had crossed swords with King at parliamentary hearings.

Hodgkin&#x27;s concerns over the indigenous peoples in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company territory in western Canada continued. They were pursued both by correspondence with Sir George Simpson, and in the pages of the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; of the Aborigines Protection Society.

==Work in medicine==
Hodgkin collaborated with Joseph Jackson Lister, who in 1830 enunciated design principles for the achromatic microscope. By that time Hodgkin and Lister had already published research on tissue samples, based on observations made with Lister&#x27;s innovative microscope, in particular on the &quot;globule hypothesis&quot; of the time which was held in particular by Henri Milne Edwards. They denied the existence of globules in tissue; Ernst Heinrich Weber in 1830 contradicted them, and the debate continued for a decade. For a while microscopy suffered in its reputation, but by 1840 histology was a recognised discipline, and in time the view of Hodgkin and Lister that &quot;globules&quot; were optical artefacts became accepted. The 1827 paper they published has been called &quot;the foundation of modern histology&quot;.

Hodgkin described the disease that bears his name (Hodgkin lymphoma) in 1832, in a paper titled &quot;On Some Morbid Appearances of the Absorbent Glands and Spleen&quot;. He received 33 years later the eponym through the recognition of British physician Samuel Wilks, who rediscovered the disease. It is a malignancy that produces enlargement of lymphoid tissue, spleen, and liver, with invasion of other tissues. A more benign form is called Hodgkin&#x27;s paragranuloma, while a more invasive form is called Hodgkin&#x27;s sarcoma.

Hodgkin published as a book his &quot;Lectures on Morbid Anatomy&quot; in 1836 and 1840. His major contribution to the teaching of pathology, however, was made in 1829, with his two volumed work entitled &quot;The Morbid Anatomy of Serous and Mucous Membranes&quot;, which became a classic in modern pathology.

Hodgkin was one of the earliest defenders of preventive medicine, having published &quot;On the Means of Promoting and Preserving Health&quot; in book form in 1841. Among other early observations were the first description of acute appendicitis, of the biconcave format of red blood cells and the striation of muscle fibers.

Hodgkin also translated with Thomas Fisher, from the French of William-Frédéric Edwards, &quot;On the Influence of Physical Agents on Life&quot; (London, 1832; Philadelphia 1838). Edwards was a vitalist in physiology, who studied the effect of physical forces on processes in living organisms. The work as it appeared in English was much more than a translation, since it contained an appendix of over 200 pages containing two dozen papers, a compendium of medicine and science tangentially related to themes in Edwards, but related to his general approach. It included early work by Hodgkin and collaboration with Lister, as well as something on electricity and meteorology. He also published &quot;The Means of Promoting and Preserving Health&quot; (London, 1840), of which a second edition appeared in 1841, and an &quot;Address on Medical Reform&quot; (1847).

==Other works==
Other works by Hodgkin were &quot;Biographical Sketches&quot;: of James Cowles Prichard (1849); and of William Stroud (1789–1858), a medical collaborator. He also wrote abolitionist pamphlets and on the British African Colonization Societies (1833–1834).

==Legacy==
There is a blue plaque on his house in Bedford Square, London. The Friends&#x27; School, Hobart named one of the four school houses after him.

The King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine&#x27;s Hodgkin Building is named in honour of Hodgkin.

<text>The China–Cornell–Oxford Project, short for the &quot;China-Oxford-Cornell Study on Dietary, Lifestyle and Disease Mortality Characteristics in 65 Rural Chinese Counties,&quot; was a large observational study conducted throughout the 1980s in rural China, a partnership between Cornell University, the University of Oxford, and the government of China. The study compared the health consequences of diets rich in animal-based foods to diets rich in plant-based foods among people who were genetically similar. In May 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; termed the study &quot;the Grand Prix of epidemiology&quot;.

== Background ==
The idea for the study began in 1980–81 during discussions between T. Colin Campbell at Cornell University and Chen Junshi, Deputy Director of Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. They were later joined by Richard Peto of the University of Oxford—Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology as of 2012—and Li Junyao of the China Cancer Institute.

== Studies ==
In 1983 two villages were chosen at random in each of 65 rural counties in China, and 50 families were chosen at random in each village for a total of 6,500 people. The dietary habits of one adult member of each family were examined—half male, half female—and the results compared to the death rates in those counties from around 48 forms of cancers and other diseases during 1973–1975.

The first two major studies were led by T. Colin Campbell, professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell, who summarized the results in his book, &quot;The China Study&quot; (2005). Other lead researchers were Chen Junshi, Deputy Director of Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine in Beijing, Richard Peto of the University of Oxford, and Li Junyao of the China Cancer Institute.

<doc id="487226" wikidata="Q845675" url="?curid=487226" title="Synchronous motor">
<text>A synchronous electric motor is an AC electric motor in which, at steady state, the rotation of the shaft is synchronized with the frequency of the supply current; the rotation period is exactly equal to an integer number of AC cycles. Synchronous motors use electromagnets as the stator of the motor which create a magnetic field that rotates in time with the oscillations of the current. The rotor with permanent magnets or electromagnets turns in step with the stator field at the same rate and as a result, provides the second synchronized rotating magnet field. Doubly fed synchronous motors use independently-excited multiphase AC electromagnets for both rotor and stator.

Synchronous and induction motors are the most widely used AC motors. Synchronous motors rotate at a rate locked to the line frequency since they do not rely on induction to produce the rotor&#x27;s magnetic field. Induction motors require &quot;slip&quot;: the rotor must rotate at a frequency slightly slower than the AC alternations in order to induce current in the rotor.

Small synchronous motors are used in timing applications such as in synchronous clocks, timers in appliances, tape recorders and precision servomechanisms in which the motor must operate at a precise speed; accuracy depends on the power line frequency, which is carefully controlled in large interconnected grid systems.

Synchronous motors are available in self-excited, fractional to industrial sizes. In the fractional power range, most synchronous motors are used to provide precise constant speed. These machines are commonly used in analog electric clocks, timers and related devices.

In typical industrial sizes, the synchronous motor provides an efficient means of converting AC energy to work (electrical efficiency above 95% is normal for larger sizes) and it can operate at leading or unity power factor and thereby provide power-factor correction.

Synchronous motors fall under the category of &quot;synchronous machines&quot; that also includes synchronous generators. Generator action occurs if the field poles are &quot;driven ahead of the resultant air-gap flux by the forward motion of the prime mover&quot;. Motor action occurs if the field poles are &quot;dragged behind the resultant air-gap flux by the retarding torque of a shaft load&quot;.

==Types==
The two major types of synchronous motors are distinguished by how the rotor is magnetized: non-excited and direct-current excited.

===Non-excited===
In non-excited motors, the rotor is made of steel. It rotates in step with the stator&#x27;s rotating magnetic field, so it has an almost-constant magnetic field through it. The external stator field magnetizes the rotor, inducing the magnetic poles needed to turn it. The rotor is made of a high-retentivity steel such as cobalt steel. These are manufactured in permanent magnet, reluctance and hysteresis designs:

==== Permanent-magnet ====
A permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) uses permanent magnets embedded in the rotor to create a constant magnetic field. The stator carries windings connected to an AC electricity supply to produce a rotating magnetic field (as in an asynchronous motor). At synchronous speed the rotor poles lock to the rotating magnetic field. PMSMs are similar to brushless DC motors. Neodymium magnets are the most common, although rapid fluctuation of neodymium magnet prices triggered research in ferrite magnets. Due to inherent characteristics of ferrite magnets, the magnetic circuit of these machines needs to be able to concentrate the magnetic flux, typically leading to the use of spoke type rotors. Machines that use ferrite magnets have lower power density and torque density when compared with neodymium machines.

PMSMs have been used as gearless elevator motors since 2000.

Most PMSMs require a variable-frequency drive to start them. However, some incorporate a squirrel cage in the rotor for starting—these are known as line-start or self-starting. These are typically used as higher-efficiency replacements for induction motors (owing to the lack of slip), but must ensure that synchronous speed is reached and that the system can withstand torque ripple during starting.

PMSMs are typically controlled using direct torque control and field oriented control.

==== Reluctance ====
Reluctance motors have a solid steel cast rotor with projecting (salient) toothed poles. Typically there are fewer rotor than stator poles to minimize torque ripple and to prevent the poles from all aligning simultaneously—a position that cannot generate torque. The size of the air gap in the magnetic circuit and thus the reluctance is minimum when the poles align with the stator&#x27;s (rotating) magnetic field, and increases with the angle between them. This creates torque that pulls the rotor into alignment with the nearest pole of the stator field. At synchronous speed the rotor is thus &quot;locked&quot; to the rotating stator field. This cannot start the motor, so the rotor poles usually have squirrel-cage windings embedded in them, to provide torque below synchronous speed. The machine thus starts as an induction motor until it approaches synchronous speed, when the rotor &quot;pulls in&quot; and locks to the stator field.

Reluctance motor designs have ratings that range from fractional horsepower (a few watts) to about . Small reluctance motors have low torque, and are generally used for instrumentation applications. Moderate torque, multi-horsepower motors use squirrel cage construction with toothed rotors. When used with an adjustable frequency power supply, all motors in a drive system can operate at exactly the same speed. The power supply frequency determines motor operating speed.

====Hysteresis====
Hysteresis motors have a solid, smooth, cylindrical rotor, cast of a high coercivity magnetically &quot;hard&quot; cobalt steel. This material has a wide hysteresis loop (high coercivity), meaning once it is magnetized in a given direction, it requires a high magnetic field to reverse the magnetization. The rotating stator field causes each small volume of the rotor to experience a reversing magnetic field. Because of hysteresis the phase of the magnetization lags behind the phase of the applied field. Thus the axis of the magnetic field induced in the rotor lags behind the axis of the stator field by a constant angle δ, producing torque as the rotor tries to &quot;catch up&quot; with the stator field. As long as the rotor is below synchronous speed, each particle of the rotor experiences a reversing magnetic field at the &quot;slip&quot; frequency that drives it around its hysteresis loop, causing the rotor field to lag and create torque. The rotor has a 2-pole low reluctance bar structure. As the rotor approaches synchronous speed and slip goes to zero, this magnetizes and aligns with the stator field, causing the rotor to &quot;lock&quot; to the rotating stator field.

A major advantage of the hysteresis motor is that since the lag angle δ is independent of speed, it develops constant torque from startup to synchronous speed. Therefore, it is self-starting and doesn&#x27;t need an induction winding to start it, although many designs embed a squirrel-cage conductive winding structure in the rotor to provide extra torque at start-up. 
Hysteresis motors are manufactured in sub-fractional horsepower ratings, primarily as servomotors and timing motors. More expensive than the reluctance type, hysteresis motors are used where precise constant speed is required.

=== Externally excited motors ===

Usually made in larger sizes (larger than about 1 horsepower or 1 kilowatt) these motors require direct current (DC) to excite (magnetize) the rotor. This is most straightforwardly supplied through slip rings.

A brushless AC induction and rectifier arrangement can also be used.

The power may be supplied from a separate source or from a generator directly connected to the motor shaft.

== Control techniques ==
A permanent magnet synchronous motor and reluctance motor requires a control system for operating (VFD or servo drive).

There is a large number of control methods for synchronous machines, selected depending on the construction of the electric motor and the scope.

Control methods can be divided into:
* Scalar control
** V/f control
* Vector control
** Field oriented control
** Direct torque control, a variant of VC
** Feedback linearization
** Passivity based control

The PMSMs can also operate on open-loop control, which is sometimes used for start-up thus enabling the position sensing operation.

==Synchronous speed==
The synchronous speed of a synchronous motor is given:
in RPM, by:
: formula_1
and in rad·s−1, by:
: formula_2

where:
* formula_3 is the frequency of the AC supply current in Hz,
* formula_4 is the number of magnetic poles,
* formula_5 is the number of pole pairs (rarely, &quot;planes of commutation&quot;), formula_6.

===Examples===
A single-phase, 4-pole (2-pole-pair) synchronous motor is operating at an AC supply frequency of 50 Hz. The number of pole-pairs is 2, so
the synchronous speed is:
:formula_7

A three-phase, 12-pole (6-pole-pair) synchronous motor is operating at an AC supply frequency of 60 Hz. The number of pole-pairs is 6, so the synchronous speed is:
:formula_8

The number of magnetic poles, formula_4, is equal to the number of coil groups per phase. To determine the number of coil groups per phase in a 3-phase motor, count the number of coils, divide by the number of phases, which is 3. The coils may span several slots in the stator core, making it tedious to count them. For a 3-phase motor, if you count a total of 12 coil groups, it has 4 magnetic poles. For a 12-pole 3-phase machine, there will be 36 coils. The number of magnetic poles in the rotor is equal to the number of magnetic poles in the stator.

==Construction==
The principal components of electric motors are the stator and the rotor. Synchronous motor and induction motor stators are similar in construction. The construction of synchronous motor is similar to that of a synchronous alternator. The stator frame contains wrapper plate (except for wound-rotor synchronous doubly fed electric machines). Circumferential ribs and keybars are attached to the wrapper plate. To carry the weight of the machine, frame mounts and footings are required. The synchronous stator winding consists of a 3 phase winding. It is provided with a 3 phase supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply.

DC excited motors require brushes and slip rings to connect to the excitation supply. The field winding can be excited by a brushless exciter. Cylindrical, round rotors, (also known as non-salient pole rotor) are used for up to six poles.

In some machines or when a large number of poles are needed, a salient pole rotor is used.

Most synchronous motor construction uses a stationary armature and rotating field winding. This type of construction has an advantage over DC motor type where the armature used is of rotating type.

==Operation==
Electric motors generate power due to the interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. In synchronous motors, the stator carries 3 phase currents and produces 3 phase rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The rotor eventually locks in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the rotor field locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be synched. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by startup arrangements.

===Amortisseur winding===

Once the motor is in operation, the speed of the motor is dependent only on the supply frequency. When the motor load is increased beyond the breakdown load, the motor falls out of synchronization and the rotor no longer follows the rotating magnetic field.

Since the motor cannot produce torque if it falls out of synchronization, practical synchronous motors have a partial or complete squirrel-cage damper called an &quot;amortisseur&quot; winding to stabilize operation and facilitate starting.

Because this winding is smaller than that of an equivalent induction motor and can overheat on long operation, and because large slip-frequency voltages are induced in the rotor excitation winding, synchronous motor protection devices sense this condition and interrupt the power supply (out of step protection).

==Starting methods==

Above a certain size, synchronous motors cannot self-start. This property is due to rotor inertia; it cannot instantly follow the rotation of the stator&#x27;s magnetic field. Since a synchronous motor produces no inherent average torque at standstill, it cannot accelerate to synchronous speed without a supplemental mechanism.

Large motors operating on commercial power include a squirrel-cage induction winding that provides sufficient torque for acceleration and also serves to damp motor speed oscillations. Once the rotor nears the synchronous speed, the field winding becomes excited and the motor pulls into synchronization. Very large motor systems may include a &quot;pony&quot; motor that accelerates the unloaded synchronous machine before load is applied. Electronically controlled motors can be accelerated from zero speed by changing the frequency of the stator current.

Small synchronous motors are commonly used in line-powered electric mechanical clocks or timers that use the power line frequency to run the gear mechanism at the correct speed. Such small synchronous motors are able to start without assistance if the moment of inertia of the rotor and its mechanical load are sufficiently small. The motor accelerates from slip speed to synchronous speed during an accelerating half cycle of the reluctance torque. Single-phase synchronous motors such as in electric wall clocks can freely rotate in either direction, unlike a shaded-pole type.

Costs are an important parameter for starters. Rotor excitation is a possible way to resolve the issue. In addition, starting methods for large synchronous machines include repetitive polarity inversion of the rotor poles during startup.

==Applications, special properties, and advantages==

===Use as synchronous condenser===

By varying the excitation of a synchronous motor, it can be made to operate at lagging, leading and unity power factor. Excitation at which the power factor is unity is termed &quot;normal excitation voltage&quot;. The magnitude of current at this excitation is minimum. Excitation voltage more than normal excitation is called over excitation voltage, excitation voltage less than normal excitation is called under excitation. When the motor is over excited, the back emf will be greater than the motor terminal voltage. This causes a demagnetizing effect due to armature reaction.

The V curve of a synchronous machine shows armature current as a function of field current. With increasing field current armature current at first decreases, then reaches a minimum, then increases. The minimum point is also the point at which power factor is unity.

This ability to selectively control power factor can be exploited for power factor correction of the power system to which the motor is connected. Since most power systems of any significant size have a net lagging power factor, the presence of overexcited synchronous motors moves the system&#x27;s net power factor closer to unity, improving efficiency. Such power-factor correction is usually a side effect of motors already present in the system to provide mechanical work, although motors can be run without mechanical load simply to provide power-factor correction. In large industrial plants such as factories the interaction between synchronous motors and other, lagging, loads may be an explicit consideration in the plant&#x27;s electrical design.

===Steady-state stability limit===
:formula_10

where,
:formula_11 is the torque
:formula_12 is the torque angle
:formula_13 is the maximum torque

here,
:formula_14

When load is applied, torque angle formula_12 increases. When formula_12 = 90° the torque will be maximum. If load is applied further then the motor will lose its synchronism, since motor torque will be less than load torque. The maximum load torque that can be applied to a motor without losing its synchronism is called steady state stability limit of a synchronous motor.

===Other===
Synchronous motors are especially useful in applications requiring precise speed or position control:
* Speed is independent of the load over the operating range of the motor.
* Speed and position may be accurately controlled using open loop controls (e.g. stepper motors).
* Low-power applications include positioning machines, where high precision is required, and robot actuators.
* They will hold their position when a DC current is applied to both the stator and the rotor windings.
* A clock driven by a synchronous motor is in principle as accurate as the line frequency of its power source. (Although small frequency drifts will occur over any given several hours, grid operators actively adjust line frequency in later periods to compensate, thereby keeping motor-driven clocks accurate; see &quot;&quot;.)
* Record player turntables
* Increased efficiency in low-speed applications (e.g. ball mills).

<doc id="487229" wikidata="Q1420714" url="?curid=487229" title="IRC services">
<text>IRC services is a set of features implemented on many Internet Relay Chat networks. Services are automated bots with special status which are generally used to provide users with access with certain privileges and protection. They usually implement some sort of login system so that only people on the access control list can obtain these services.

== Components ==
The most popular style of services uses a number of fake clients whose names end in &quot;Serv&quot;. The four below are nearly always seen in services of this style.

* &quot;ChanServ&quot;, a channel service bot, is used to protect channel operators and help run the channel. This is convenient for the operators because they do not need to have an operator on the channel all of the time to keep their status.
* &quot;NickServ&quot;, a nickname service bot, is used to register and protect user nicknames.
* &quot;MemoServ&quot;, a memo service bot, is used to record and deliver messages to users who are currently offline.
* &quot;OperServ&quot; is used by IRC operators to perform administrative functions. Also known as AdminServ, RootServ, or OpServ (srvx).

Some others are also seen following this naming convention in some services packages including:

* &quot;BotServ&quot;, a bot which allows channel operators to assign bots to their channels. These bots are mostly a ChanServ representative in the channel.
* &quot;HelpServ&quot;, the help service bot, is used to provide help on a variety of IRC topics.
* &quot;HostServ&quot;, a host service bot, is used to allow general users to register a vhost so that their real IP address on IRC is hidden.
* &quot;RootServ&quot;, used on specific networks, is utilized by Services Root Administrators to perform Root Administrative functions for the IRC Network and Services Program.
* &quot;SpamServ&quot;, used to protect channels against spam.
* &quot;StatServ&quot;, a statistic services bot, is used to perform various statistical analysis on the IRC Network.

Other commonly used services bots:

* &quot;Global&quot;, a message agent, is a specific service that is used to send global messages via services. This agent is usually given a global IRC Operator status as to be able to perform the function. This service must be on a U-lined server so it has the ability to spoof nicknames. This service is often renamed to the name of the network (e.g. &quot;DalNet&quot; or &quot;Xevium&quot;).

== History ==
The original NickServ was written by Armin Gruner at the Technical University of Munich in 1990. The original intention was to give out friendly warnings that somebody else already likes to use a specific nickname, since the IRC protocol has no built-in provision to protect electronic identities.

&quot;NoteServ&quot; and &quot;MsgServ&quot; followed up soon after the introduction of NickServ, and had a similar job to today&#x27;s &quot;MemoServ&quot;.

It was considered acceptable behavior simply to &quot;/ignore&quot; NickServ&#x27;s notices, but an operator decided to &quot;/kill NickServ&quot; and use the nickname &quot;NickServ&quot; himself, subsequently collecting all &quot;identify&quot; passwords from users and being amused by that.
This led to a public debate over the usefulness and safety of services and the discontinuation of NickServ on EFnet, and EFnet&#x27;s current &quot;Nicknames are not owned&quot; policy arose.

In 1995 DALnet invented ChanServ, then re-implemented &quot;NickServ&quot; and &quot;MemoServ&quot;.
Today, EFnet and IRCnet are the last large IRC networks which stick to their policy of living without identity protection. Some debate still remains over the value and benefits of Services on IRC, although they are generally considered essential to providing a pleasant chatting experience. This is proven in the fact that most service-less networks have died out.

Many variants of services have been implemented over time, so each IRC network speaks a different service dialect, making it close to impossible for client developers to implement unified graphical interfaces to the various registration procedures.
Still, most of them are inspired by DALnet&#x27;s and Armin&#x27;s original works, only Undernet and QuakeNet stick out with a completely different approach.

== ChanServ ==
ChanServ, on many IRC networks, is an IRC service which maintains channel registration and access information. If a channel is registered with ChanServ, its owners (and those they have designated) can use ChanServ to obtain control over the channel, gaining channel operator privileges. Most channel service bots also allow other sorts of channel management options, such as topic locks (in addition to +t), mode locks, and providing users automatically with operator status, half-operator status, voice, or other access, as designated by the channel owners. They may also provide some form of automated ban-list management.

There are several implementations of IRC services which have a ChanServ bot; some other services use other names, such as CS. The exact commands and features available depend on the service implementation and the network in question.

=== Access levels ===
* Founder
* Super operator (often written as SOP or SOp)
* Auto operator (often written as AOP or AOp)

== OperServ ==

OperServ is a component of most IRC services packages used to help administer an Internet Relay Chat network. It provides IRC operators with functions to help monitor and maintain the network, manage the other services, and deal with problematic users.

Some of the more infamous functions of OperServ are the &quot;lines&quot;, such as the K-line and G-line. These are used to discipline troublesome network users, however, other network lines are available for use. The exact features available depend upon a particular operator&#x27;s permissions, and the specific implementation in use.

On DALnet a similar concept known as an &quot;AKill&quot; was used instead of a G-line. The term AKill comes from an earlier implementation in which the IRC services would automatically &quot;kill&quot; (disconnect) the user remotely upon login, rather than the individual servers simply denying the connection.

On OpenNap networks, OperServ is a pseudo-user which allows users above a specific permission level to execute server administration commands. Although primarily intended to supplement clients without built-in support for such actions, there are no restrictions on its use.

== IRC services software packages ==
There are several software packages that implement services. Some of the popular ones include srvx, Atheme, DalekIRC Services, ChatServices, Hybserv (developed for use with the Hybrid IRCd software), Epona, Anope, and IRC Services 5 (supporting a wide range of IRC daemons, considered the &quot;original&quot; IRC Services). While some of these packages provide excellent features in the eyes of many users, some network operators decide to write their own services, with the most important reasons being flexibility, customization, and often, mostly on smaller networks, fun also plays an important role. Not all packages implement the above service bots. Also, sometimes the bots have different names, and may or may not implement these functions in the form listed above. Even so, the above form is the most common.

<doc id="487230" wikidata="Q927384" url="?curid=487230" title="Christian Vander (musician)">
<text>Christian Vander (born 21 February 1948) is a French drummer, composer, singer and founder of the progressive rock band Magma.

He was born on 21 February 1948 in Nogent-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, France.

==Career==
Vander is known for his extended compositions, drumming, and shrill falsetto improvisational/scat singing. His music fuses jazz, rock, classical and operatic influences, and draws on the work of musicians as diverse as John Coltrane and Carl Orff.

Vander regards Coltrane as his greatest musical inspiration, and dedicated his 2011 album &quot;John Coltrane L&#x27;Homme Suprême&quot; to him as a tribute.

== Family ==
Christian Vander is the adopted child of famous French jazz piano player Maurice Vander (who was a long time sideman of singer Claude Nougaro). Most of Vander and Magma&#x27;s recorded work is still available through Vander&#x27;s own record label, Seventh Records.

He was married to singer Stella Vander who released many EPs herself in the 1960s and has performed vocal duties for Magma since 1972. They divorced in the 1980s, with speculations that this occurred in the hiatus years. Christian and Stella have a daughter, Julie, who has appeared on several Magma and Offering releases. Vander often appears on Magma albums under his Kobaïan name: &quot;Zebëhn Straïn dë Ğeuštaah&quot;.

<doc id="487233" wikidata="Q5303621" url="?curid=487233" title="Downtown music">
<text>Downtown music is a subdivision of American music, closely related to experimental music, which developed in downtown Manhattan in the 1960s.

==History==
The scene the term describes began in 1960, when Yoko Ono, one of the early Fluxus artists, opened her loft at 112 Chambers Street, in a part of Lower Manhattan later named Tribeca, to be used as a performance space for a series curated by La Monte Young and Richard Maxfield. Prior to this, most classical music performances in New York City occurred &quot;uptown&quot; around the areas that the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center and Columbia University would soon occupy. Ono&#x27;s gesture led to a new performance tradition of informal performances in nontraditional venues such as lofts and converted industrial spaces, involving music much more experimental than that of the more conventional modern classical series Uptown. Spaces in Manhattan that supported Downtown music from the 1960s on include the Judson Memorial Church, The Kitchen, Phill Niblock&#x27;s Experimental Intermedia Foundation, La Monte Youngs Mela Foundation, Dia Art Foundation, Harvestworks, Roulette, the Knitting Factory, ABC No Rio, Dance Theater Workshop, Tonic, the Gas Station, Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine, the Paula Cooper Gallery, and others. Brooklyn Academy of Music has also shown a predilection for composers from the Downtown scene.

==Character==
Downtown music is not distinguished by any particular principle, but rather by what it does not do: it does not confine itself to the ensembles, performance tradition, and musical rhetoric of European classical music, nor to the commercially defined conventions of pop music. The only thing that all Downtown music might be said to have in common is that, at least at the time of its original appearance, it was too unusual – by dint of excessive length, excessive stasis, excessive simplicity, excessive extemporaneity, consonance, noisiness, vernacular reference, or other purported excessive infractions – to have been considered &quot;serious&quot; modern music by proponents of &quot;uptown&quot; music. Another generalization one could point to is an embrace of the creative attitudes of John Cage, though this is not universal. Some Downtown music, particularly that of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Zorn, and Morton Feldman, has subsequently become widely acknowledged within the more mainstream history of music.

== Varieties ==
More than a continuous scene, Downtown music has resembled a battlefield on which, from time to time, various groups have reigned ascendant. In chronological order of dominance, the following movements have been prominent Downtown:
*Conceptualism – starting with the Fluxus artists, who made pieces from brief instructions (&quot;the short form&quot;) or concepts. For instance, La Monte Young&#x27;s &quot;Draw a straight line and follow it&quot;; Robert Watts&#x27; &quot;Trace&quot;, in which the musicians set fire to the music on their music stands; Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Wall Piece&quot;, in which performers bang their heads against the wall; or Nam June Paik&#x27;s classic &quot;Creep into the vagina of a living whale&quot;.
*Minimalism – a style of music that began with the repetition of short motifs, sometimes going out of phase due to slight differences of speed, and crescendoed into a movement of simple diatonic music of clearly defined linear processes. Steve Reich and Philip Glass became the public face of the movement, but the original minimalists (La Monte Young, Tony Conrad, John Cale, Charlemagne Palestine, Phill Niblock) were less characterized by their music&#x27;s prettiness and accessibility than by its tremendous length, volume, and attention-challenging stasis.
*Performance art – starting with the enigmatic solo text/music pieces of Laurie Anderson, which often made innovative (even subversive) use of electronic technology, many Downtown artists developed an often humorous or thought-provoking style of solo performance with conceptualist overtones. This scene coexisted with minimalism, and due to the dearth of funding opportunities for Downtown composers, many of them still pursue genres of solo performance.
*Art rock or experimental rock – this is a term with several different meanings, depending on one&#x27;s milieu, but two are most relevant to Downtown music: 1. originally, music made by visual artists, presumably musical amateurs, often tending toward surreal theater, as in the early performances of Glenn Branca and Jeffrey Lohn; and 2. subsequent to Rhys Chatham&#x27;s influence, a transferral of minimalism to &quot;rock&quot; instruments, resulting in static pieces played on electric guitars, generally with a backbeat. Groups like DNA, Sonic Youth, Live Skull and the Swans arose from this (and the no wave) movement.
*Free improvisation – originating with Terry Riley and Pauline Oliveros, this scene took over Downtown in the early 1980s, under the leadership of John Zorn and Elliott Sharp. This music, celebrating extemporaneity, flourished in a city in which rehearsal space was expensive and difficult to come by, and provided an outlet for many jazz-trained/-centered musicians tired of jazz performance conventions.
*Postminimalism – a style of music based on a steady beat and diatonic harmony, less linear or obvious than minimalism but taking over its ensemble concept of amplified chamber groups. Postminimalism was more a far-flung national movement than anything specific to Manhattan, but William Duckworth and Elodie Lauten are examples of New York-based postminimalists.
*Totalism – another style emerging from minimalism but taking it in the direction of rhythmic complexity and rock-inspired beat momentum. Postminimalism and totalism were both bolstered by the emergence, starting in 1987, of the Bang on a Can festival, curated by Julia Wolfe, David Lang, and Michael Gordon.

The above list of movements and idioms is far from exhaustive – in particular, it omits the continuous history of electronics in Downtown music, which have tended toward process-oriented and interactive music rather than fixed compositions. The history of sound installations should be taken into account, along with the more recent advent of DJing as an art form. Likewise, despite its origin in New York musical politics, &quot;Downtown&quot; music is not solely specific to Manhattan; many major cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, even Birmingham, Alabama have alternative, Downtown music scenes.

== Related terms ==
There is a considerable overlap between Downtown music and what is more generally called experimental music, especially as that term was defined at length by composer Michael Nyman in his influential book &quot;Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond&quot;. Nyman opposes the term to avant-garde, as generally being American/British versus Continental, experimental music being more open to process, surprises, and accidents and less focused on the artistic personality. In this respect, as a general descriptive, and without reference to any particular scene, experimental and Downtown have sometimes been used synonymously. Another, even more coextensive term is new music, which took on currency following the &quot;New Music New York&quot; festival presented by The Kitchen in 1979, which visibly showcased the music referred to as Downtown; the term remained in widespread use during the years of the New Music America festival (1979–1990). Due to its obvious and inconvenient applicability to many types of music, use of &quot;new music&quot; as describing a specific type of contemporary composition has fallen off in recent years.

<text>Hans Gottlieb Leopold Delbrück (; 11 November 1848 – 14 July 1929) was a German historian. Delbrück was one of the first modern military historians, basing his method of research on the critical examination of ancient sources, using auxiliary disciplines, like demography and economics, to complete the analysis and the comparison between epochs, to trace the evolution of military institutions.

Delbrück&#x27;s writings are chiefly concerned with the history of the art of war, his most ambitious work being &quot;Geschichte der Kriegskunst im Rahmen der politischen Geschichte&quot; (&quot;History of Warfare in the Framework of Political History&quot; in four volumes, third edition published in 1920). Other works are &quot;Die Perserkriege und die Burgunderkriege&quot; (The Persian and Burgundian Wars, 1887), &quot;Die Strategie des Perikles erläutert durch die Strategie Friedrichs des Grossen&quot; (The Strategy of Pericles Described Through the Strategy of Frederick the Great, 1890) and &quot;Das Leben des Feldmarschalls Grafen Neithardt von Gneisenau&quot; (Life of Marshal Count Neithardt von Gneisenau, 1894).

== Biography ==

Delbrück was born in Bergen on the island of Rügen; he studied at the universities of Heidelberg and Bonn. As a soldier, he fought in the Franco-Prussian War and in 1874, he became for some years tutor to Prince Waldemar of Prussia (1868–1879) of the German imperial family, a brother of Wilhelm II, heir to the imperial throne. He served in the Reichstag from 1882 to 1883 and in 1883, he became an editor of the &quot;Preussische Jahrbücher&quot;, a noted political magazine. He assumed charge of this publication in 1889 and kept working on it in that capacity until 1920.

In 1885, he became professor of modern history in the University of Berlin, where his lectures were very popular. He was a member of the German Reichstag from 1884 to 1890. Delbrück vigorously opposed the policy of the Prussian government in dealing with the Danes and the Poles, with the result that he was twice subjected to disciplinary penalties as a professor and a civil servant in Prussia. One of his American students Arthur L. Conger became a senior military historian at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, where he modelled American military historiography after Delbrück&#x27;s approaches. 

His role as editor of &quot;Preussen Jahrbücher&quot; provided a platform for a growing interest in Germany&#x27;s diplomatic relationship with Russia. This took the form of a roving commission to Herr Paul Rohrbacher to enquire about German opinion. The findings from the 1890s tours formed a racial policy of dismemberment of Russia by seizing Slavic territory that belonged to them. The Fritz Fischer argued that they were socialists forcing extremists into the hands of revolutionaries. At an early stage of the First World War, he became pessimistic regarding the possibility of victory, except by a military and political strategy and tactics of a purely defensive character. He was, on tactical rather than on moral grounds, a strenuous opponent of intensified submarine warfare and did not conceal his conviction that it would bring America into the war. He was a member of the German Delegation during the Versailles Peace Conference that ended the war, where he mainly endeavoured to prove that Germany could not be made solely responsible for the outbreak of war. He died in Berlin. He was the father of Max Delbrück, who did pioneering work in physics and also won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969. His daughter Emmi was married to German resistance fighter Klaus Bonhoeffer and thus she was the sister-in-law of theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. 

== Hypotheses ==

Delbrück&#x27;s works tried to place military history in the framework of general history. He regarded warfare as a cultural feature of societies, subject to evolution and influenced by the economy and the political system. His works were not translated into English for some time, hence his reputation among professional military theorists in English-speaking countries is not held in the same esteem or significance as Clausewitz.

=== Ancient warfare ===

Singular conclusions on ancient warfare challenged historiography in so far as he tried to show that the figures for armies in antiquity were inflated in the original sources, and that, contrary to what is stated in most writings, the winner in a battle usually had more troops than the loser. Consequently, he gave completely different interpretations to some of the most famous battles in history, like Marathon, Gaugamela, and Zama by concluding that Rome&#x27;s vaunted advantage over &quot;barbarians&quot; rested, not so much in their discipline and refined tactics, but rather in their superior logistical support. The Romans were able to raise and maintain huge armies on the field, while the &quot;barbarians&quot; were unable to match their numbers.

=== Medieval warfare ===

Regarding medieval warfare, Delbrück&#x27;s findings were more controversial. He made a distinction between knights, mounted warriors, and cavalry, an organized mass of mounted troops. He regarded the medieval warrior as an independent fighter, unable to join others and form units with any decisive tactical significance. His conclusions were tested by later scholars, in particular the Belgian historian J. F. Verbruggen.

=== Modern warfare ===

About modern warfare, Delbrück showed his intellectual origins in Clausewitz by making a distinction between two possible strategies respectively: exhausting the enemy and throwing down the enemy (German: &quot;Ermattungsstrategie&quot; and &quot;Niederwerfungsstrategie&quot;, often mistakenly translated as &quot;attrition&quot; and &quot;annihilation&quot;). They were derived from Clausewitz&#x27;s distinctions between strategies seeking limited objectives and strategies aimed at rendering one&#x27;s opponent militarily helpless, the latter being often confused with the concept of &quot;total war&quot; advocated by Ludendorff and rejected by Delbrück during wartime. The choice depended on the nature of the political objectives, the existing political and economic limitations and the correlation of force numbers. He applied the analytical tool to the wars of Frederick the Great and concluded that their numerical inferiority made the Prussians pursue a strategy of exhaustion.

His overall treatment of the era, however, partially overlooked the Spanish wars. He was very critical of his country&#x27;s strategic thinking, and he averred it would have been preferable to seek victory in the East, gain minor objectives in the West and then sue for peace. That was one example of the general principle that he maintained: military and political manoeuvres should be integrated.

== In fiction ==

In Mel Brooks&#x27;s comedy &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, Doctor Frankenstein sends his assistant, Igor, to retrieve the brain of Hans Delbrück for transplant into Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. The tag on the beaker containing the brain reads &quot;scientist and saint,&quot; so it is debatable whether Brooks intended the actual historian or a fictional Delbrück.

In a clearer reference to the historical figure, in Mel Brooks&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Producers&quot;, Hans Delbrück is the name of the man to whom Franz Liebkind sends a letter by carrier pigeon.

In Victor Serge’s novel &quot;Unforgiving Years (Les Années sans pardon)&quot; the character Herr Schiff—an old German professor loyal to the Nazi regime, demoralized and disoriented in war-ravaged Berlin in the closing days of the Second World War—rereads Hans Delbrück’s &quot;The History of Warfare&quot;: &quot;Lately, it was true, the sense of most of what he read escaped him; but being incapable of inattention, the mechanical act of reading acted upon him like a sedative. His cheek cupped in his hand, he reread the works he admired out of duty.&quot; Hans Delbrück appears in the professor&#x27;s thoughts again while contemplating the meaning of the war as American soldiers overtake Berlin: &quot;The Second World War was already down as a great historical tragedy—a quasi-mythological one—which neither Mommsen, Hans Delbrück, Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Oswald Spengler, or &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; could elucidate entirely...&quot;

== Works ==
Other works of Delbrück, besides those mentioned above, are the following:

In his book &quot;Regierung und Volkswille&quot; (1914), Delbrück attempted a defence of the old system of government in Germany and Prussia with particular reference to its &quot;dualism,&quot; parliamentary representation and simultaneously a certain degree of autocracy on the part of the sovereign in Prussia and of the federated government in the empire. A succinct statement of Delbrück&#x27;s views on Germany&#x27;s responsibility for World War I and an English reply can be found in articles by Delbrück and J. W. Headlam-Morley in the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; (March 1921).

<doc id="487237" wikidata="Q5067965" url="?curid=487237" title="Chain shift">
<text>In historical linguistics, a chain shift is a set of sound changes in which the change in pronunciation of one speech sound (typically, a phoneme) is linked to, and presumably causes, a change in pronunciation of other sounds. The sounds involved in a chain shift can be ordered into a &quot;chain&quot; in such a way that after the change is complete, each phoneme ends up sounding like what the phoneme before it in the chain sounded like &quot;before&quot; the change. The changes making up a chain shift, interpreted as rules of phonology, are in what is termed &quot;counterfeeding order&quot;.

A well-known example is the Great Vowel Shift, which was a chain shift that affected all of the long vowels in Middle English. The changes to the front vowels may be summarized as follows:

A drag chain or pull chain is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the &quot;leading&quot; edge of the chain changes first. In the example above, the chain shift would be a pull chain if changed to first, opening up a space at the position of , which then moved to fill. A push chain is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the &quot;end&quot; of the chain moves first: in this example, if moved toward , a &quot;crowding&quot; effect would be created and would thus move toward , and so forth. It is not known which phonemes changed first during the Great Vowel Shift; many scholars believe the high vowels such as started the shift, but some suggest that the low vowels, such as , may have shifted first.

==Examples==

During the Great Vowel Shift in the 15th and 16th centuries, all of the long vowels of Middle English, which correspond to tense vowels in Modern English, shifted pronunciation. The changes can be summarized as follows:

Most vowels shifted to a higher place of articulation, so that the pronunciation of &quot;geese&quot; changed from to and &quot;broken&quot; from to . The high vowels and became diphthongs (for example, &quot;mice&quot; changed from to ), and the low back vowel was fronted, causing &quot;name&quot; to change from to .

The Great Vowel Shift occurred over centuries, and not all varieties of English were affected in the same ways. For example, some speakers in Scotland still pronounce &quot;house&quot; similarly to its sound in Middle English before the shift, as .

A chain shift may affect only one regional dialect of a language, or it may begin in a particular regional dialect and then expand beyond the region in which it originated. A number of recent regional chain shifts have occurred in English. Perhaps the most well-known is the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, which is largely confined to the &quot;Inland North&quot; region of the United States. Other examples in North America are the Pittsburgh vowel shift, Southern vowel shift (in the Southern United States), the California vowel shift and the Canadian Shift (though the last two may be the same). In England, the Cockney vowel shift among working-class Londoners is familiar from its prominence in plays such as George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (and the related musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;):

Many chain shifts are vowel shifts, because many sets of vowels are naturally arranged on a multi-value scale (e.g. vowel height or frontness). However, chain shifts can also occur in consonants. A famous example of such a shift is the well-known First Germanic Sound Shift or Grimm&#x27;s Law, in which the Proto-Indo-European voiceless stop consonants became fricatives, the plain voiced stops became voiceless, and the breathy voiced stops became plain voiced:
: → → → 

Another is the High German consonant shift which separated Old High German from other West Germanic dialects such as Old English, Old Frisian, and Old Saxon:

The Romance languages to the north and west of central Italy (e.g. French, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and various northern Italian languages) are known for a set of chain shifts collectively termed &quot;lenition&quot;, which affected stop consonants between vowels:
: → → → (or vanishes)
: → → → , (or vanishes)
In this case, each sound became weaker (or more &quot;lenited&quot;).

==Synchronic shifts==

It is also possible for chain shifts to occur synchronically, within the phonology of a language as it exists at a single point in time.

Nzebi (or Njebi), a Bantu language of Gabon, has the following chain shift, triggered morphophonologically by certain tense/aspect suffixes:

Examples follow:

Another example of a chain from Bedouin Hijazi Arabic involves vowel raising and deletion:

In nonfinal open syllables, raises to while in the same position is deleted.

Synchronic chain shifts may be circular. An example of this is Xiamen tone or Taiwanese tone sandhi:

The contour tones are lowered to a lower tone, and the lowest tone (21) circles back to the highest tone (53).

Synchronic chain shifts are an example of the theoretical problem of phonological opacity. Although easily accounted for in a derivational rule-based phonology, its analysis in standard parallel Optimality Theory is problematic.

<text>Espeland Falls () is a tall waterfall located in the Espeland Valley () in Voss Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The falls are located just above large Lake Espeland (), near the border of Voss and neighboring municipality of Ulvik.

Due to an urban legend, Espeland Falls is sometimes erroneously claimed to be tall. One theory is that the erroneous information may have originated from a misunderstanding of the concept meters of head in relation to the development of the Espeland River () for hydropower. Another theory is that there may have been a mixup with &quot;Skrikjofossen&quot; in Lofthus, Ullensvang, a tall waterfall located about south of Espeland Falls.

<doc id="487247" wikidata="Q3458214" url="?curid=487247" title="Reuse of bottles">
<text>A reusable bottle is a bottle that can be reused, as in the case as by the original bottler or by end-use consumers. Reusable bottles have grown in popularity by consumers for both environmental and health safety reasons. Reusable bottles are one example of reusable packaging.

==History==

Early glass bottles were often reused, such as for milk, water, beer, soft drinks, yogurt, and other uses. Mason jars, for example, were developed and reused for home canning purposes.

With returnable bottles, a retailer would often collect empty bottles or would accept empty bottles returned by customers. Bottles would be stored and returned to the bottler in reusable cases or crates. Glass milk bottles were transported in milk crates and would be picked up by a milkman. At the bottler, the bottles would be inspected for damage, cleaned, sanitized, and refilled.

Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, many bottles were designed for single-use, eliminating the cost of collection. This often allows for thinner glass bottles and less expensive plastic bottles and aluminum beverage cans.

Though Sweden has had a standard glass bottle recycling system since 1884, in response to the increased litter from single-use containers, container deposit laws have been adopted in many developed countries (sometimes by provincial and municipal governments) starting in the 1970s. These laws mandate that retailers must charge a deposit on certain types of containers or for certain products; retailers are then required to accept empty bottles or cans for recycling and refund the deposit. A government fund mediates any imbalances caused by buying containers at one retailer and returning them to another, and also retains the profit from unreturned containers. Reverse vending machines are often used to automate this process. The machines scan the bar code on cans and bottles to verify that a deposit was paid, shred or crush the container for compact storage, and dispense cash or a voucher that can be redeemed at the store&#x27;s checkout registers.

In Germany, reusable glass or plastic (PET) bottles are available for many drinks, especially beer and carbonated water as well as soft drinks (). The deposit per bottle (&quot;&quot;) is €0.08–0.15, compared to €0.25 for recyclable but not reusable plastic bottles. There is no deposit for glass bottles which do not get refilled, but there are many glass bottles that do get refilled – best known is the &quot;Normbrunnenflasche&quot;, a 0.7l bottle used for carbonated drinks with a deposit of €0.15. It was introduced after a 1969 decision by the German mineral water industry, and more than five billion bottles have been produced used for an estimated quarter of a trillion refillings since then.

==Environmental consequences==

The reuse of containers is often thought of as being a step toward more sustainable packaging. Reuse sits high on the waste hierarchy. When a container is used multiple times, the material required per use or per filling cycle is reduced. 

Many potential factors are involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs. non-returnable systems. Researchers have often used life cycle analysis methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations. Some comparisons show no clear winner but rather show a realistic view of a complex subject.

Arguments in favor of reusing bottles, or recycling them into other products, are compelling. It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, consumers use 1,500 plastic water bottles every single second. But only about 23% of PET plastic, which is the plastic used in disposable plastic water bottles, gets recycled. Thus, about 38 billion water bottles are thrown away annually, equating to roughly $1 billion worth of plastic. The average American spends $242 per year per person on disposable, single use plastic water bottles. The environmental and cost consequences associated with disposable plastic water bottles are a strong argument for reusing bottles.

==Bottles intended for reuse by households==
Reusable drinking bottles for water, coffee, salad dressing, soup, baby formula, and other beverages have gained in popularity by consumers in recent years, due to the costs and environmental problems associated with single use plastic bottles. Common materials used to make reusable drinking bottles include glass, aluminum, stainless steel, and plastic. Reusable bottles include both single and double wall insulated bottles. Some baby bottles have an inner bag or bladder that can be replaced after each use.

<text>Marguerite de Valois, la demoiselle de Belleville, also known as Marguerite, bâtarde de France (1407 – January 1458), was the illegitimate daughter of Charles VI of France and his mistress Odette de Champdivers.

Marguerite was legitimated in January 1428 by Charles VII of France, her half-brother. He gave her a very ample dowry and married her June/July 1443 in Poitou to Jean III de Harpedenne (also spelled &quot;Harpedanne&quot;, &quot;Harpedane&quot;, &quot;Harpedène&quot;, etc.), Seigneur of Belleville and Montaigu, son of Jean II de Harpedenne and his wife Jeanne de Mussidan. Some sources claim that she was married under the name of &quot;Marguerite de Falots&quot;.

<text>Provincetown Harbor is a large natural harbor located in the town of Provincetown, Massachusetts. The harbor is mostly deep and stretches roughly from northwest to southeast and from northeast to southwest – one large, deep basin with no dredged channel necessary for boats to enter and exit.

A tall green buoy east of Long Point (i.e., the tip of Cape Cod) marks the entrance to Provincetown Harbor from Cape Cod Bay.

==Geology==

Most of Cape Cod was created by the Laurentide Glacier between 18,000 and 15,000 years ago. However, the Provincetown Spit, i.e., the land surrounding Provincetown Harbor from High Head in North Truro through all of Provincetown, consists largely of marine deposits transported from farther up the shore during the last 6,000 years.

==History==
A stone wall discovered in Provincetown in 1805 is thought to have been built by Viking Thorvald Eiriksson about AD 1007, when according to Norse sagas, the keel of Ericson&#x27;s ship was repaired in the harbor.

Bartholomew Gosnold explored the harbor in 1602, and his mate Gabriel Archer wrote: &quot;The fifteenth day of May we had again sight of the land, which made ahead, being as we thought an island, by reason of a large sound that appeared westward between it and the main, for coming to the west end thereof, we did perceive a large opening, we called it Shoal Hope. Near this cape we came to anchor in fifteen fathoms, where we took great store of codfish, for which we altered the name, and called it Cape Cod. Here we saw sculls of herring, mackerel, and other small fish, in great abundance. This is a low sandy shoal, but without danger...&quot;

John Smith explored the harbor in 1614 and wrote: &quot;Cape Cod... is only a headland of high hills of sand, overgrown with shrubby pines, hurts, and such trash, but an excellent harbor for all weathers. This Cape is made by the main sea on the one side, and a great bay on the other, in form of a sickle...&quot;
===Pilgrims&#x27; first landing===

Provincetown Harbor was the initial anchoring place of the Pilgrims traveling on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620, before they proceeded to Plymouth, Massachusetts. Thoreau later observed that Smith&#x27;s description of the harbor may have been less colored by the hardships of transoceanic troubles than the Pilgrims&#x27;. Mourt&#x27;s Relation describes the harbor as:
The &quot;Mayflower&quot; held several different passengers in addition to the Pilgrims on its first transoceanic voyage. Before coming ashore at the extreme northwest corner of the harbor, the Pilgrims and other settlers signed the Mayflower Compact in the harbor on November 11, 1620. Dorothy Bradford, the first wife of William Bradford, was one of the first adult Pilgrims to die in the New World. According to the only known written description of her death from close to when it actually occurred, she fell overboard from the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in Provincetown Harbor on December 17, 1620 and drowned. Peregrine White, the first child born to the Pilgrims in New England, was born while they were in Provincetown Harbor.

=== Village of Long Point===

From 1818 until the 1850s a fishing village existed at Long Point, complete with a post office, schoolhouse, 6 windmills for saltworks, and 38 homes for about 200 adults and 60 children. When the families left in the 1850s, they floated their homes a mile across the harbor, where many still stand today.

During the American Civil War, the military established defensive artillery battery positions at this location. The Long Point Battery would come to be known as &quot;Fort Useless&quot; and &quot;Fort Ridiculous&quot; by the local residents.

Today, Long Point is a ghost village, and nothing remains save for the Long Point Light, which had been replaced by a new light in 1875.

===East Harbor===
For the better part of modern history, the eastern part of Provincetown harbor was connected to yet another harbor, historically known as East Harbor. East Harbor was the most protected mooring place in the outer Cape for boats using Cape Cod Bay and the Gulf of Maine. East Harbor had a inlet from Provincetown Harbor, as shown in the adjacent map from 1836.

Until the late 19th century, there was not a single road leading in or out of Provincetown – the only land route connecting Provincetown to points beyond was along a thin stretch of beach along the shore to the north (locally called the &quot;backshore&quot;). A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later. Although the bridge was replaced the following year, a traveler using it still had to traverse several miles over a sand route, which, along with the backshore route, would occasionally be washed out by storms. This made Provincetown much like an island, in that it relied almost entirely upon its harbor for its communication, travel, and commerce needs.

In 1868 the mouth of the East Harbor was diked, to facilitate the laying of track for the arrival of the railroad; the wooden bridge and sand road were finally replaced by a formal roadway in 1877, as shown in the accompanying map from 1887. The East Harbor thus became a lake, connected to Provincetown Harbor only through a culvert in the dike, and in 1910, the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) officially renamed it Pilgrim Lake.

In the ensuing years, the dike became clogged with vegetation, beginning a trend of desalination and oxygen-depletion that resulted in the demise of native wildlife populations, occasionally in the form of fish kills. In 2004, tidal flow was successfully restored by the National Park Service, working together with other local, state, and federal agencies. In the following year, for the first time since Abraham Lincoln was president, legal-size clams were found in East Harbor. In 2008, the USGS officially renamed Pilgrim Lake, restoring the original appellation of East Harbor.

===Other history===
The Portland gale of 1898 destroyed several wharves and fishing vessels within the harbor.

In 2002, Provincetown Harbor Beach was selected by the US Environmental Protection Agency as one of three Flagship beaches for the state of Massachusetts that serve as models for beach managers in water quality monitoring and pollution assessments and because of its health.

The harbor is the southern boundary of the Provincetown historic district, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Landmarks==
Two main parallel wharves dominated the center of the harbor in the late 19th century: Railroad Wharf and Steamboat Wharf. President Grant visited Provincetown for the opening of the railroad in 1874. Today, the wharves have been replaced by piers. Although rail and steamboat service to Provincetown both ended long ago, ferry service continues.


MacMillan Pier, the town pier of Provincetown, was significantly renovated and expanded during 2003-2005 with the help of a $1.95 million low interest loan from the Rural Development program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The pier primarily serves tourists and high-speed ferries to Boston and Plymouth that charge their passengers up to $44 per one-way trip. The Provincetown Public Pier Corporation (PPPC) entered into a 20-year lease agreement for MacMillan Pier operations in 2005. The pier is named after arctic explorer Donald B. MacMillan, a Provincetown native who retired to Provincetown and died there in 1970.
Immediately parallel to MacMillan Pier is Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, also known to locals as Cabral&#x27;s Pier. &quot;They Also Faced the Sea&quot; is an outdoor art installation of five large portraits of local Portuguese-American women photographed by Norma Holt hanging since 2003 on one side and one end of the old fish-packing plant on Cabral Pier.

In both 1907 and 1910, when the Pilgrim Monument began construction and when it was dedicated, the entire Atlantic fleet of the U.S. Navy was inside the harbor for large ceremonies led by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, respectively.

In addition to a panoramic view of the whole town, the harbor affords views of three working lighthouses: Long Point Light, Wood End Light, and Highland (or Cape Cod) Light. All three are on land within the Cape Cod National Seashore. The harbor serves as the southern boundary of the nationally registered Provincetown historic district, which consists of some , 1127 buildings, three structures, and five objects.

On the East End of Provincetown, Lewis Wharf was purchased by Mary Heaton Vorse, and its old fish shack converted into a theater which became the home of the Provincetown Players. Eugene O&#x27;Neill debuted his first play, Bound East for Cardiff, there in 1916.

Captain Jack&#x27;s Wharf is on the West End of Provincetown. 

U.S. Coast Guard has administrative buildings and barracks at the base of a concrete pier on the harbor. The current station opened in 1979 and is responsible for safety and law enforcement in over of Cape Cod Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Noteworthy past disasters within this station&#x27;s area include the wreck of the submarine S-4 in 1927. This station includes the first federal building to receive solar power. A frequent sight in the harbor is the station&#x27;s 47-foot Motor Lifeboat.

The West End Breakwater, built in 1911 by the US Army Corps of Engineers, is open to the public for walking and exploring. Technically speaking, it is more of a dike than a breakwater. The harbor also has a &quot;true&quot; breakwater built between 1970 and 1972 and located from the end of MacMillan Pier.

==Marine life==
Provincetown Harbor supports a wide variety of marine life from algae, seagrasses and plankton through bryozoa, hydroids, echinoderms, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other animals.

The harbor is an amazingly diverse and productive habitat. The following tables list in no particular order 94 examples of marine life that are regularly observed within the harbor. A few landbirds are included that are common around MacMillan Pier, on the beaches, and on the breakwater.





==Historic annual events==
The Great Provincetown Schooner Regatta each September preserves the harbor&#x27;s history as a great sailing port.

A Blessing of the Fleet ceremony is held at the end of MacMillan Pier in late June, when all the boats operating in the harbor are blessed by a visiting bishop as part of the Provincetown Portuguese Festival.

The Swim for Life occurs each September since 1988, which is a swim across the harbor to raise funds and awareness of HIV/AIDS, women&#x27;s health and community health.

==Commercial use==
Roughly a dozen fishing trawlers (locally known as &quot;draggers&quot;), ferries to Boston and Plymouth, Massachusetts, several different sportfishing boats, boat rentals, and other commercial boats also use the harbor today.

East Coast whale watching on Stellwagen Bank originated as a joint effort of the Dolphin Fleet and the Center for Coastal Studies leaving from MacMillan Pier in 1975. In addition, other tour boat operators offer a variety of tours of and from the harbor, including historical sightseeing tours, harbor marine life tours, sunset cruises and more.

<text>The Atlas Oryx (named after the Oryx antelope) is a medium-sized utility helicopter ostensibly developed and manufactured by the Atlas Aircraft Corporation (now Denel Aeronautics) of South Africa. Its largest operator is the South African Air Force (SAAF), having been originally developed to fulfil their needs.

Development of the Oryx commenced during the early 1980s, largely in response to the wartime demands of the Border War and the imposition of an arms embargo upon South Africa, which prevented the importing of foreign transport helicopters such as the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. Seeking to improve and augment the SAAF&#x27;s existing fleet of rotorcraft, domestic industries examined means of improving the Puma helicopter. The Oryx is closely connected to the Denel Rooivalk attack helicopter, both rotorcraft being based on the Puma and development having been worked on in parallel around roughly the same time period. Following the conversion of a single Puma to the Oryx configuration, quantity production of the Oryx was authorised during the late 1980s.

Allegedly, the Oryx&#x27;s development was greatly facilitated by the French helicopter firm Aérospatiale, the Puma&#x27;s original manufacturer, who produced kits that were supplied to South Africa; Atlas Aviation had denied this involvement and claimed that the Oryx was an entirely indigenous programme. The existence of the Oryx became public knowledge during 1991, by which point it was in service with the SAAF. In the early 2000s, the SAAF opted to reduce the size of the Oryx fleet and upgrade the remainder; the scope of these upgrades was largely limited to airframe life extensions. The Oryx had been repeatedly deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in support of UN-led peacekeeping operations in the country.

==Development==
===Background===
The South African Air Force (SAAF) was a particularly prolific user of the French-sourced Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma, a medium-sized military transport helicopter. However, the nation&#x27;s ability to procure further Pumas, along with many other items of military apparatus, had been greatly constrained following the enactment of an arms embargo upon South Africa under United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 due to its policy of apartheid. The inability to import new foreign military helicopters coincided with a long running military conflict between South Africa and neighbouring Angola, commonly referred to as the Border War or the &quot;Bush War&quot;. The need for capable attack helicopters beyond that of the gunship-configured Alouette series of helicopters was recognised by SAAF officials, leading to Atlas Aircraft producing an experimental attack helicopter, the XH-1 Alpha, and subsequently the more powerful XTP-1, the latter being created via the conversion of two existing Puma J airframes.

The development of an entirely new helicopter from scratch would have involved designing and developing many accompanying subsystems and components, such as the turboshaft engines and the dynamic systems, such as the main and tail rotor systems and the gearboxes. Due to the great difficulty posed by the prospects of designing and manufacturing a clean-design helicopter, which would have substantially increased the cost and timescale of the project, it was decided to base the attack helicopter upon an existing design. During this era, the SAAF operated two principal helicopter types – the Aérospatiale Alouette III and the Puma. While the Alouette III was a compact helicopter whose design originated in the 1960s, lacking in engine power and being relatively early amongst production rotorcraft and thus not a favourable candidate for further development work, the Puma was substantially larger and was equipped with more powerful engines; both factors provided a broader basis for the accommodation of additional equipment and for potential growth.

Officials became keen advocates for the improvement of the SAAF&#x27;s existing rotorcraft via domestic upgrade programmes. One such initiative was the development of a dedicated attack helicopter based upon the dynamic systems of the Puma, which became the Denel Rooivalk. Atlas recognised the value of, in parallel to the Rooivalk&#x27;s development, a localised and improved model of the Puma, an initiative which became the Oryx. In comparison to the Puma, the Oryx would possess an increased power-to-weight ratio and yield improved performance in the high temperature climate that the rotorcraft was typically being operated in; in comparison to the Rooivalk, development of the Oryx could proceed at a far quicker pace as it was an essentially more straightforward programme. Furthermore, the supply of spare parts for the Puma was a notable exception in the sanctions, making them plentiful in a circumstance where most counterparts would be blocked.

===Production and alleged international involvement===
While the foreign supply of most military equipment to South Africa was in violation of Resolution 418 at that time, deterring the majority of organisations from doing so, this did not render external assistance entirely beyond the realm of possibility. According to the author Hennie Van Vuuren, South African military planners arranged for the purchase of 66 Aérospatiale AS332 Super Pumas, an improved model of the Puma already in SAAF service; following their production in France, they would be disassembled for transit and transferred to the Portuguese Air Force, who officially were to be the end recipient, but would in fact transfer the disassembled rotorcraft onto South Africa via a Portuguese intermediary, where they would be reassembled by Atlas under the Oryx name.

During the 1990s, legal action was launched by the Portuguese firm Beverley Securities Incorporated (BSI) against the multinational helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter, the successor to Aérospatiale, over allegations related to the Oryx&#x27;s development and its relation to the Puma helicopter. Allegedly, from 1986, South Africa had been supplied with 50 kits for the Oryx programme from Eurocopter via BSI under a $3 billion contract; BSI claimed that the Oryx was actually developed primarily by Aérospatiale, and that the kits had been described as spares for South Africa&#x27;s existing fleet of Pumas. Atlas Aviation has consistently claimed that the Oryx was an indigenous programme that was developed by Atlas itself. During the 2010s, legal action on the matter between various parties, in which political involvement was alleged by Van Vuuren, was still ongoing.

A single Puma, &quot;no. 177&quot;, was converted to the Oryx configuration and served as a prototype; reportedly the results collected were in excess of all expectations, contributing to the launch of the Oryx programme. The presence of sanctions had encouraged both the South African government and domestic industries to pursue self-sufficiency wherever possible, and this principle was particularly apparent in the production of aircraft components and, with the knowledge to assemble pre-manufactured helicopters, led to the technical skill for producing complete Puma helicopters, should the need arise. This included complete airframes and dynamic components such as gearboxes, rotor blades and turbines and hot section parts. Wherever it was feasible to do so, commonality with the Rooivalk&#x27;s systems was pursued in order to simplify logistics and reduce maintenance costs for both fleets.

==Design==
The Oryx is an upgraded and remanufactured version of the Puma, being basically equivalent to the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma, and offers a performance improvement over the original model, in addition to reducing the operating costs by 25 to 30%. Early examples were fitted with the latest dust filters, as were then in use on the SAAF Puma, along with a moveable auxiliary air intake directly ahead of the engine. A newly designed dust filter was subsequently fitted, facilitating the removal of this auxiliary air intake. Should one of the engines be rendered inoperable, the remaining powerplant has sufficient power for the Oryx to complete its mission. If an engine fails in flight, the management system automatically advances the power setting on the remaining engine, ensuring the Oryx sustains flight with relatively little crew input, during such an emergency.

The basic airframe is still that of the original Puma, but the structure was modernized by extensive use of locally produced carbon-composite materials. These materials result in an airframe that is lighter and more rugged, which increases the Oryx&#x27;s endurance and maneuverability. The obvious external difference is the new modified tailboom which is slightly longer (50 cm), than the Puma. Most Oryx are equipped with a 50m hydraulic hoist, rated for up to 2 personnel, for use in rescue operations. Additionally a large metal A-frame structure can be fitted in the cargo bay which allows up to four personnel to rappel or abseil from the aircraft simultaneously. Oryx operating from coastal squadrons are fitted with emergency flotation gear on the sponsons and nose.

Throughout the 1990s, Atlas representatives routinely marketed the Oryx to potential export customers, focusing particularly upon existing operators of the Puma within the African sub-continent; this sales effort included the provision of an upgrade package for existing Pumas into an Oryx-equivalent configuration.

==Operational service==
During mid-1991, the SAAF publicly acknowledged that the Oryx was in service and that its purpose was to replace its aging fleets of Pumas and Aérospatiale Super Frelons alike. It was displayed for the first time at an open day at Potchefstroom in August 1991.

Since 2003, the South African Air Force has dispatched multiple Oryx into the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in support of UN-led peacekeeping operations in the country. In 2003, a pair of Oryx were stationed in the Ituri/Bunia area as part of a bilateral agreement with France, being briefly used to facilitate troop movements and medium-grade transport duties. A two-year long deployment started in 2007, with two Oryx deployed at a forward operating base in Kamina for transportation purposes in the unstable Goma region; the element was subsequently relocated to a site within Goma itself and strengthened with three additional Oryx and three Rooivalk attack helicopters. By 2015, the South African Aviation Unit in the DRC involved around 140 personnel and five Oryx, amongst other assets.

Being a multirole helicopter, the Oryx&#x27;s primary missions within the SAAF have included medium to heavy transport duties, communications flights, task force rapid deployment operations, fire fighting, and search &amp; rescue missions. Each one can reportedly carry up to 20 fully equipped troops, or up to six wounded personnel on stretchers with four attendants; in terms of freight, it can carry a maximum payload of 3,000 kg within the cabin, or transport up to 4,500 kg freight on an external sling. Tasks performed for the South African Navy include general transportation, at-sea replenishment, force multiplication, reconnaissance, and search &amp; rescue operations.

During 2003, it was announced that, as a part of a major modernisation and reequipment programme, the SAAF had declared ten of its Oryx helicopters to be surplus to requirements and would be made available for re-sale. At the time, the service was in the process of inducting several new types, including the Saab JAS 39 Gripen multirole fighter, the BAE Systems Hawk trainer/ground attack aircraft, and the AgustaWestland AW109 rotorcraft, the latter being the SAAF&#x27;s modern rotary-wing component.

In 2006, the SAAF initiated a mid life upgrade for its remaining inventory of 35 Oryx; one stated aim of this work was to extend the type&#x27;s service life through to the 2015 - 2020 timeframe. In large part due to ongoing budgetary restrictions, the mid-life upgrade was limited in scope to life extensions to the air frame, although limited updates were performed to both the communications and navigation suites as well. Early ambitions had reportedly involved a more comprehensive modernisation of the Oryx, which included the integration of a glass cockpit.

Oryx have been routinely deployed to perform humanitarian relief operations, such as after floods and other natural disasters.

==Variants==
In its basic platform the design of the Oryx offers a number of advantages and this was further developed from an early stage in the program. With the Denel Rooivalk now in service, this combat helicopter will escort the Oryx in a high threat environment. However, as an interim measure an Oryx with door mounted machine guns did appear. Oryx helicopters are constantly refined and updated. A full glass cockpit is planned for a future update. The latest addition is the fitting of flare dispensers and the update of the Threat Warning Receivers.

There is an electronic warfare (stand-off communications jamming/radar jamming) version of the Oryx that is equipped with the Grinaker Systems Technologies (GST) GSY 1501 jamming system, among others. The first Oryx variant with a large log periodic antenna on the starboard side was regarded as quite an effective EW platform. This platform is capable of disrupting key communications during various stages of modern, air-, land-, and sea battles. In addition it is used as an effective training aid to the SANDF, to test their function as an effective fighting force, despite any EW methods employed against the SA Forces. A further advantage is, EW equipment in use by the SA Forces can be effectively evaluated and calibrated under simulated battlefield scenarios. One variant has its main cabin doors replaced by dome shaped antennas.

The Oryx Mk. 2 contains such a number of differences, that a different model number is used, to distinguish the type. Although, operated and flown by 22 Squadron SAAF, these helicopters were specifically built for use by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, as part of the South African National Antarctic Programme.
Two Oryx helicopters have been modified for operations in the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic, for which they have been painted in the red and white colour scheme. Highly effective, de-icing equipment, of up rated specification, was the central requirement of the Mk. 2 program. The project received the go-ahead on 15 March 1996, with Lt Col K. Viljoen as project leader. The project was completed three weeks ahead of schedule and the two helicopters delivered to 22 Sqdn, during October 1997. One of the Mk. 2 Oryx helicopters was written off subsequent to a crash landing in July 2004.

<text>World Vision United States is a member and founding organization of World Vision International. Founded in the United States in 1950, it is an evangelical relief and development organization. It is one of the largest relief and development organizations in the US with a 1.6 billion dollar budget (2007).

== History ==
World Vision was founded in 1950 by Dr. Robert Pierce (&quot;Bob&quot;), a young American evangelist minister whom the Youth for Christ missionary movement had first sent to China and South Korea in 1947. Pierce served for almost two decades at the helm of World Vision, but retired in 1967 from the organization.

During his journey he was moved by one little girl&#x27;s suffering to promise to the local church of the child a monthly sum to guarantee her protection. It has created the concept of funding for children and World Vision.

At first the organization focused on orphans and other children in need, beginning in South Korea, then expanding throughout Asia. The program soon spread throughout Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In the 1960s, the group started providing food, clothing, and medical care to citizens of impoverished countries after natural disasters by soliciting donations from major corporations.

From 1966 onward, the organization used in business also the name &quot;World Vision International&quot; but from 1977 on this name was reserved for the umbrella organisation World Vision International. and the founding organization as a member of World Vision International is called World Vision United States whenever a distinction is necessary.

Later, Richard Stearns became president of World Vision US. On January 9, 2018, it was announced that Stearns would be retiring from the organization after nearly 20 years as President.

On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Edgar Sandoval would replace Stearns as World Vision&#x27;s new President and CEO beginning October 1, 2018.

==Organizational structure==

World Vision US is an independently registered interdependent national member office of the federal umbrella organization World Vision International. The relationship with the central organization is governed by the &quot;Covenant of Partnership&quot;, that all national members sign. It provides that the national organizations must accept policies and decisions of the umbrella organization. and must not establish an office or program outside the US without the consent of the central group and the host country. Furthermore, except for direct project founding, all funds used outside the US have to be remitted through the central organization, and its financial and budget principles must be accepted. Additionally, the national group must also subscribes to the core values, the mission statement, and the Statement of Faith of World Vision.

==Spirituality==
World Vision aims to incorporate Christian belief into their development work as well as their organization. US president Richard Stearns (retired) stated that the group has a strict policy against proselytizing, which he describes as &quot;... - using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone.&quot; Like all other national members of the World Vision Partnership, World Vision US is committed to the concept of transformational development, which is cast in a biblical framework and in which evangelization is an inseparable integral part of development work.

Stearns stated that &quot;hope&quot; is World Vision&#x27;s most lasting impression. He believes that if hope can be restored in a community it is more beneficial than adding a water well. He emphasizes that everyone lives in a religious world where more than 90% of the population believes in some faith. He claims that World Vision&#x27;s understanding of faith is essential for development.

==Funding==
World Vision uses the Sponsor a Child method of fundraising. Individuals, families, churches, schools, and other groups sponsor specific children or specific community projects in their own country or abroad. Sponsors send funds each month, to provide support for the sponsored children or projects.

According to its annual report, in 2008 87% of its funding was spent on programs, 8% on fundraising and 5% on management and general overhead.

==Activities==

World Vision provides emergency relief to people whose lives are endangered by disasters or conflict and who need immediate assistance. It attempts to respond to all major emergencies around the world themselves or in cooperation with partner agencies. For example, World Vision responded to famine in Ethiopia and North Korea, hurricanes in Central America, the tsunami in the Indian Ocean nations, earthquakes in El Salvador, India, Taiwan, Turkey and the Sichuan earthquake in China, Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar and war refugees in Kosovo, Chechnya, Sierra Leone, Angola, and East Timor.

The organization encourages public awareness about the needs of others, the causes of poverty, and the nature of compassionate response. These efforts include collaboration with media and community participation in fundraising.

The organization devotes considerable effort to advocating to the US government. On March 1, 2011, along with 29 other faith-based groups, it sent a letter to the senate petitioning for the restoration of cuts made to foreign disaster assistance, global health, and food aid in the 2011 budget.

World Vision is a leading member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a Washington D.C.–based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger international affairs budget, which funds American diplomatic and development efforts abroad. World Vision is also a member of the Global Coalition Against Pneumonia and supports World Pneumonia Day on November 2, 2009.

== Criticism ==
In 1999, the academic journal &quot;Development in Practice&quot; published an overview of World Vision&#x27;s history focusing on the evolution of its global architecture. The document, &quot;Pursuing Partnership: World Vision and the Ideology of Development&quot; was written by then World Vision staff person Alan Whaites, who went on to become a political scientist concerned with international development. He offered a picture of an organization that was often spurred to innovate and change as a result of internal reflection on external criticism.

===Discrimination in hiring===
In August 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that &quot;World Vision is a &#x27;religious corporation&#x27; and therefore exempt from federal law barring faith-based discrimination, and thus was permitted to dismiss two employees who were fired because they did not believe in the &quot;divinity of Jesus or the doctrine of the Trinity.&quot; Judge Marsha Berzon of that circuit dissented, arguing that &quot;Congress did not intend to allow all religiously motivated nonprofits to be exempt from the law.&quot; She believes that the decision discriminates against employees who have the ability to do the assigned work just because of their religious views.

===Same-sex marriage===

On March 24, 2014, the World Vision US announced that it would hire what it defined as Christians in same-sex marriages. Facing protests from donors and the larger evangelical community after the announcement, World Vision reversed the policy change two days later.

<doc id="487270" wikidata="Q7738276" url="?curid=487270" title="The Grey King">
<text>The Grey King is a contemporary fantasy novel by Susan Cooper, published almost simultaneously by Chatto &amp; Windus and Atheneum in 1975. It is the fourth of five books in her Arthurian fantasy series &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot;.

&quot;The Grey King&quot; won the inaugural Tir na n-Og Award from the Welsh Books Council as the year&#x27;s best English-language children&#x27;s book with an &quot;authentic &quot;. It is set in Wales and incorporates Welsh folklore as well as Arthurian material, especially that of the Brenin Llwyd (). It also won the annual Newbery Medal recognizing the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American children&#x27;s literature&quot;.

==Characters==
* Will Stanton is a primary character in the series. Here he is recovering from hepatitis with physician&#x27;s orders to remain out of school for at least a month, so his mother sends him to his uncle David Evans in Wales. There he meets Bran and their adventures begin.
* Bran Davies (the raven boy) is an albino boy with golden eyes, near Will&#x27;s age. He is a loner, without friends at school, and he is not permitted to be out after school. He has a white dog, Cafall, who is able to see the wind (Cafall was the name of King Arthur&#x27;s dog). He is revealed to be the son of King Arthur, brought forward in time by his mother, Guinevere.
*: &quot;Bran&quot; is Welsh for &#x27;crow&#x27;. He may be named after King Bran Fendigaid (&quot;Bran the Blessed&quot;), a Celtic god known from both Welsh and Irish mythology, who was as a monarch of North Wales
* Owen Davies is Bran&#x27;s adoptive father. He had admitted a mother and her baby who appeared at his farm, cared for them, and proposed marriage. She was gone the next day, leaving the baby in his care. Owen doesn&#x27;t want to lose Bran, so he is very protective.
* The Brenin Llwyd, or the Grey King, is the evil lord opposing the Light in this novel. He is said to be the most powerful (and perhaps the oldest) lord of the Dark, but he has limitations. He is not allowed to break the laws of The High Magic. He may be forced to remain at his home Cader Idris.
*: &quot;The Breath of the Grey King&quot; is spoken of with dread in the mountains near his home. A thick fog that descends in the space of a few heartbeats, it drives unwary travelers to their deaths by hiding the edges of precipices and scree slopes.
* Milgwn are huge grey foxes that the Grey King has bent to his will. It is said they can walk through his fog in secret and leave no track. They are not of this world, although they walk upon it, and they are known to attack when no ordinary fox would do so. Most mortals cannot see the Milgwn. Bran, however, is privileged and can see them. Will is an Old One (or &quot;Dewin&quot;, in Welsh) and so he too can see them.
*: &quot;Milgwn&quot; (singular: &quot;milgi&quot;) is Welsh for &#x27;greyhounds&#x27;.
* Caradog Prichard is a bitter and corrupt man whom the Grey King is able to manipulate, not a willing agent. According to legend, someone who spends the night on Cader Idris becomes either a poet or a madman. Caradog hoped to be a poet and spent the night on the mountain; he is not a poet and often acts as if insane.
*: He may be named after the Welsh poet Caradog Prichard.

==Geography==
The geography described in the book is based very closely on the real geography in and around the Dysynni Valley in Gwynedd in north-west Wales. References include the town of Tywyn, Cader Idris and Bird Rock (Craig yr Aderyn).

==Critical reception==
At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said, &quot;Cooper is clearly building towards a thumping conclusion in the fifth and next volume and even those of us who have doubts about the significance of all this thunderous moral absolutism will want to get in on the action.&quot;

In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1976 to 1985, literary critic Zena Sutherland wrote, &quot;While &quot;The Grey King&quot; can be read profitably on its own, it gains stature when read in sequence, and it is masterful in the meshing of the fantastic elements and their realistic matrix... It has the classic form of the quest, and its intricate yet cohesive plot is developed with a high sense of drama—and even a bit of the inevitability of a Greek tragedy. It is no small thing to make a character believable both as a mortal child and as an immortal and a powerful magician.&quot;

Karen Patricia Smith has written, &quot;Will is assisted in his quest for a golden harp by several people, including Bran, son of King Arthur, brought forward in time. Cooper continues her exploration of the many guises of evil and reiterates the theme that the Dark is a wily foe, capable of taking many forms.&quot;

Mary Corran said that &quot;in &quot;The Grey King&quot;, it is human emotions which are the danger—jealousy, anger and hate, which open mortal minds to the invasion of the Dark. The fourth book is strongly Arthurian in content ... Cooper deals with the innate antagonism between mortals and immortals impressively, and in &quot;The Grey King&quot; reaches great heights as she mingles the worlds and peoples of legend and the present day.&quot;

<doc id="487275" wikidata="Q316775" url="?curid=487275" title="Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus">
<text>Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus ( – 48 BC) was a politician of the Roman Republic. He was a conservative and upholder of the established social order who served in several magisterial positions alongside Julius Caesar and conceived a lifelong enmity towards him. In 59 BC, he was consul alongside Julius Caesar. Their partnership was contentious to the extent that Caesar&#x27;s supporters assaulted Bibulus in Rome&#x27;s main forum on the eve of an important vote. Bibulus withdrew from public politics for the rest of his term.

Between 51 and 50 BC, he was governor of Syria, where he was effective but alienated the army by taking too much personal credit for the repulse of the Parthians. In 49, after Caesar&#x27;s civil war broke out, Bibulus aligned himself with Pompey and was in charge of the fleet tasked with preventing Caesar from shipping his army across the Adriatic. He failed to stop Caesar&#x27;s first fleet but was successful in delaying Caesarian reinforcements from landing in Greece. While in command of the blockade in 48 BC, he died of illness.

==Early years==

Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus was a member of the plebeian Calpurnia gens. His cognomen is not previously attested within the gens so he appears to have been the first of the name to reach curule office, but it is unlikely he was a &quot;novus homo&quot;, based on the connections he had. He may have descended from the senatorial Pisonian branch of the Calpurnia gens.

He has been described as &quot;earnest and somewhat plodding&quot;. He served as curule aedile alongside Julius Caesar in 65 BC. Two curule aediles were appointed each year and they were responsible for maintenance of public buildings (aedēs) and the regulation of public festivals. They also had powers to enforce public order. Caesar overshadowed Bibulus throughout his year in office, particularly in the provision of the ludi Romani, a religious festival involving multiple ceremonies and secular entertainments. He again served alongside Caesar in 62 BC when both were elected praetors, judicial magisterial positions. Bibulus opposed Caesar at every opportunity. Shortly before they took office, Rome was racked by the Catilinarian conspiracy, an attempt by a number of senior aristocrats to overthrow the Republic. During his term in office, Bibulus was called upon to suppress supporters of the Catilinarian conspiracy among the Paeligni, an Italic confederation from what is now Abruzzo.

 Becoming a consul was considered the highest honour of the Roman Republic. Cato and the rest of the &quot;boni&quot; feared Caesar to be a radical who would destroy the way of the ancestors, the &quot;mores&quot;. Bibulus was already implacably opposed to Caesar and was married to Porcia, Cato&#x27;s daughter. The &quot;boni&quot; bribed the electors heavily in order to ensure that Bibulus would be Caesar&#x27;s consular colleague. They succeeded; Bibulus narrowly defeated Caesar&#x27;s preferred consular candidate, Lucius Lucceius.

==Consul==
Caesar began his term as consul by &quot;presenting a moderate and carefully reasoned bill&quot; to purchase land in order to discharge and settle Pompey&#x27;s soldiers who had returned from the east some years previously. The &quot;Boni&quot;, led by Cato, walked out of the Senate &quot;en masse&quot; to prevent it being heard. Caesar took the bill to the Centuriate Assembly, largely made up of ex-soldiers. Large numbers of Pompey&#x27;s veterans came to Rome to participate in the expected vote. Bibulus lost popularity by treating them with aristocratic contempt, telling them that he did not care what they wanted. Bibulus was able to secure the support of three plebeian tribunes to block the passage of the bill. However, Pompey and Crassus publicly supported Caesar&#x27;s bill, and the opposition to Bibulus was such that the tribunes were unwilling to exercise their veto. Immediately before the vote Bibulus ordered it suspended for religious reasons. Caesar, who was also pontifex maximus, the most significant religious official in Rome, ignored this and continued with the vote. Bibulus and two of his tribunes mounted the steps of the Temple of Castor and Pollux and attempted to denounce the bill. The crowd turned on him and his entourage, breaking his &quot;fasces&quot; (the symbols of his consulship), pushing him to the ground and pouring feces on him. Getting up, Bibulus uncovered his neck and shouted to the crowd to kill him to end his embarrassment. His fellow senators persuaded him to leave and regroup at a nearby temple, as the assembly proceeded to pass the bill.

The following day, Bibulus entered the Senate where he made a formal complaint about the treatment which he had suffered, and appealed to the Senate to annul the law, but this was not acted upon. He then resisted swearing an oath to uphold the new law, but was eventually convinced to take the oath. After this humiliation, in March 59 BC, Bibulus stopped attending meetings of the Senate, leaving Caesar with complete control over the consulship. He occasionally issued complaints against Caesar and Pompey, which led to attacks on his house from Caesar and Pompey&#x27;s supporters. For the rest of the year supporters of the First Triumvirate mocked Bibulus by declaring that the two consuls were really &quot;Julius and Caesar&quot;. Bibulus returned the insult by referring to his co-consul as the &quot;Queen of Bithynia,&quot; an allusion to Caesar&#x27;s alleged love affair with the King of Bithynia. He also alleged that Caesar had been involved in the first conspiracy of Catiline. Bibulus spent the remainder of his term sequestered in his house where he claimed he was watching for omens, an act that purported to invalidate all legislation passed that year.

By the middle of his consulship Caesar&#x27;s popularity began to wane, whilst Bibulus&#x27;s popularity was, according to Cicero, on the rise, mostly due to his vitriolic attacks on Caesar. Seeking to further cause trouble for Caesar and Pompey, in July he directed that the consular elections for 58 BC were to be postponed until 18October. However, in August Lucius Vettius accused Bibulus and one of the consular candidates for 58 BC, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus, of being involved in a plot to assassinate Pompey. Bibulus responded by declaring that he had warned Pompey of the possibility of an assassination attempt on 13May. Vettius was then murdered the day before Bibulus was to be questioned about his alleged involvement in the plot. Lentulus was unsuccessful when the delayed elections finally took place. Aulus Gabinius and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus won the election.

Bibulus attempted to block Caesar&#x27;s five-year appointment as governor of the provinces of Cisalpine Gaul and Transalpine Gaul by declaring that no public business could be conducted whilst he observed the sky for omens, but was again rebuffed by Pompey and one of the consul-designates who supported Caesar&#x27;s appointment. At the end of the year Bibulus emerged from his self-enforced retirement and presented himself before the Senate. He took the traditional oath declaring he had done his duty in his consulship. He was then about to justify his actions as consul when the new tribune of the plebs, Publius Clodius Pulcher, used his veto to prevent Bibulus from speaking further.

Throughout the 50s Bibulus continued to attack Pompey in the Senate, blaming him for the fighting between Publius Clodius and Titus Annius Milo in 56 BC, to the point that Pompey was convinced that Bibulus was in league with plotters who were intent on assassinating him. He also voted against Pompey being granted permission to go to Egypt in person to restore Ptolemy XII Auletes to his throne. Nevertheless, by the end of the 50s, Pompey had been cynically embraced by the &quot;boni&quot;, who saw in him a champion to bring down Caesar. In 52 BC as a consular senator Bibulus proposed an unconstitutional and illegal resolution, which the Senate accepted, allowing Pompey to serve as sole consul to deal with the breakdown of order in Rome after the murder of Publius Clodius.

As a result of a law passed by Pompey during his sole consulship, proscribing that governorships could not be held by persons who had served as praetor or consul within five years of leaving office, Bibulus was not appointed to a post-consular governorship until 51 BC. He then became governor of Syria. He severely offended the soldiery in Syria by claiming much of the credit due to their commander Gaius Cassius Longinus, whom he outranked. Two years before, Crassus had led the Roman army of the east to a calamitous defeat at Carrhae. Longinus had advised Crassus against his misguided actions and when Crassus was killed had taken command and led the survivors in a successful retreat. He then saved the province of Syria by beating the Parthians at Antioch. For this he became the darling of the army. Bibulus arrived to a situation already stabilising. He sent the Senate a report of his pursuit and mopping up of the Parthians and his reorganisation of Syria&#x27;s defences. The Senate granted Bibulus a thanksgiving of twenty days. With the Parthian threat still present, Bibulus sent two of his sons to Egypt in 50 BC to demand the recall of Roman soldiers who had settled there, but they were killed by the soldiers, who refused to march. When Cleopatra sent him the murderers to be punished, he returned them saying it was up to the Senate to punish them.

==Civil war and death==

Completing his governorship, Bibulus returned to the west in 49 BC to find that civil war had erupted between Caesar and Pompey. Aligning himself with Pompey, he was placed in charge of Pompey&#x27;s fleet in the Adriatic, to ensure that Caesar and his troops could not cross from Brundisium in Italy to Epirus to challenge Pompey&#x27;s army. Having only assembled half the necessary ships, Caesar decided to take seven legions across the Adriatic, and to have the ships return and transport the remaining legions once they arrived at Brindisi. Transporting seven legions across the Adriatic Sea to Greece would ordinarily be difficult due to the winter season. But because Caesar knew that the calendar was out of step with the astronomical seasons due to his responsibilities as pontifex maximus, he had the advantage of knowing the crossing would be easier than expected. This assisted Caesar to an extent as the Adriatic was sufficiently treacherous to deter Bibulus&#x27; war galleys from venturing far from their base at Corfu.

Bibulus was caught by surprise when on the evening of 6November Caesar and his fleet successfully crossed the Adriatic, landing at Palaeste. Although Bibulus was stationed only south of Palaeste, he had not sent out scouts and his ships were not ready to put to sea to intercept Caesar&#x27;s transports. When he heard of Caesar&#x27;s crossing, he ordered his crews to return to their ships, and sailed northward, hoping to capture the ships carrying Caesar&#x27;s reinforcements. Again too slow, he only managed to arrive for their return journey to Italy, capturing and burning 30 of Caesar&#x27;s transports. He then maneuvered to prevent any further ships crossing to reinforce or supply Caesar. He only captured one transport, which had been chartered by some private individuals and had refused to obey Bibulus&#x27;s orders. Enraged, he ordered the entire crew killed.

Bibulus then blockaded all the harbors along the coast, hoping to prevent any further crossings from Italy, and leaving Caesar stranded in Epirus. He found that he could not resupply his ships without abandoning the blockade, and so he attempted to bluff Caesar&#x27;s legates at Oricum into persuading Caesar to agree to a temporary truce so that he could resupply. When Bibulus refused to guarantee the safety of the envoys Caesar wished to send to discuss a peaceful settlement with Pompey, Caesar realised it was a ploy and pulled out of negotiations. Determined to continue with the blockade, Bibulus pushed himself too hard; he fell ill in early 48 BC and died near Corcyra before the end of winter.

==Family==
Bibulus was the son of Gaius Calpurnius. Bibulus married twice. From his first marriage he had three sons, including the later statesman Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus. His two eldest sons Marcus and Gaius were killed in Egypt by soldiers whom Aulus Gabinius had left there after restoring Ptolemy Auletes to the throne. He may have had a daughter called Calpurnia, who was the first wife of Roman senator Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. His second wife was Cato&#x27;s daughter Porcia, whom he married sometime between 58 and 53 BC, by her he had two more children, at least one of them a son who lived to adulthood. The other may have been a daughter but it is not certain. After Bibulus&#x27; death Porcia married Brutus, who was to be a ringleader of Caesar&#x27;s assassins.

<doc id="487293" wikidata="Q3324411" url="?curid=487293" title="Zarahemla">
<text>Zarahemla () is a land in the Book of Mormon that for much of the narrative functions as the capital of the Nephites, their political and religious center. Zarahemla has been the namesake of multiple communities in the United States, has been alluded to in literature that references Mormonism, and has been portrayed in artwork depicting Book of Mormon content.

Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement regard the Book of Mormon as a translation of a genuinely historical text from the ancient Americas (a belief that mainstream academic archaeology does not corroborate). Some adherents have speculated about where Zarahemla would have been located or attempted to find archaeological evidence of it. Such attempts have been unsuccessful.

== Background ==
The Book of Mormon, published in 1830, is one of the central scriptures of Mormonism, also called the Latter Day Saint movement. Founder Joseph Smith said that an angel of the Christian God directed him to uncover metal plates inscribed with the history of a Christian people in the ancient Americas and that by miraculous means he translated them, producing the Book of Mormon. Most in the Latter Day Saint movement regard the Book of Mormon as being genuinely ancient and historical. Mainstream academic archaeology considers Book of Mormon historicity implausible and unproven.

== Setting ==
In the Book of Mormon, the &quot;land of Zarahemla&quot; is populated by the &quot;people of Zarahemla&quot;, so called for Zarahemla, their ruler at the time of the Nephites&#x27; encounter with them. Zarahemla is identified as a descendant of Mulek, who according to the Book of Mormon is a son of the biblical king Zedekiah. 350 years earlier, around the same time as the Nephites&#x27; ancestor Lehi&#x27;s flight from Jerusalem, Mulek had led a group from Jerusalem, guided by God, to the same new continent as the Nephites.

When the Nephite king Mosiah leads a group of Nephite refugees, in response to divine direction, out from the land of Nephi and into the land of Zarahemla, encountering the people of Zarahemla, they and the Nephites unite their societies, and Mosiah becomes king of them all. Zarahemla becomes the second capital city of the Nephites. Literary scholar Jared Hickman calls it &quot;the Nephite home base for the rest of the narrative&quot; after the Nephites migrate there. The Nephites who remain in the land of Nephi, rather than follow Mosiah to the land of Zarahemla, never reappear in the Book of Mormon, and the land of Nephi becomes Lamanite territory.

A temple features in the narrative as the apparent geographic, ceremonial, and societal center of Zarahemla.

==Narrative==

When the Nephite king Mosiah leads Nephite refugees, in response to divine direction, out from the land of Nephi, they encounter a city inhabited by a people called the &quot;people of Zarahemla&quot;, the name of their ruler, in a place called the &quot;land of Zarahemla&quot;. Zarahemla is identified as a descendant of Mulek, narrated to be a son of the biblical king Zedekiah; Mulek

According to the Book of Mormon, the Nephite Mosiah and his followers &quot;discovered that the people of Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon&quot; (about 587 B.C.). The people descended from a group led by Mulek, a son of the biblical king Zedekiah, who left Jerusalem at the time of the Babylonian conquest and also crossed the ocean and arrived at the same continent as the party led by Lehi. The book of Omni in the Book of Mormon tells how Zarahemla and his people came to settle the land of Zarahemla in the New World. Mosiah and his refugee people presumably united with the people of Zarahemla sometime between 279 and 130 B.C. &quot;Mosiah was appointed to be their king.&quot; Mosiah thereafter presided in the land of Zarahemla over a people called collectively &quot;the Nephites&quot;. The Land of Zarahemla was the Nephite capital for many years.

Notable Book of Mormon descendants of the leader Zarahemla include Ammon the venturer and Coriantumr the dissenter. Ammon led a quest in search of a colony that had left the land of Zarahemla in order to resettle a city named Lehi-Nephi. The dissenter Coriantumr led the Lamanites in battle against the Nephites in the first century B.C.

At some point before Mosiah discovered Zarahemla, the people of Zarahemla had discovered Coriantumr (not to be confused with the later Nephite dissenter of the same name). According to the Book of Mormon, Coriantumr was the last of a destroyed nation called the Jaredites. Coriantumr stayed with the people of Zarahemla &quot;for the space of nine moons&quot; () before dying and being buried by them ().

Benjamin succeeded his father Mosiah as the second Nephite king of Zarahemla. King Benjamin was victorious in driving Lamanites enemies from the Zarahemla region.

At the time of the crucifixion of Christ, the Book of Mormon records that &quot;there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land. And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.&quot; &quot;And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the inhabitants of the earth ... &#x27;because of their iniquity and abominations ... that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof ... I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&#x27;&quot; (3 Nephi, 9: 1, 2, 3, 15.) The Book of Mormon indicates that &quot;the great city of Zarahemla&quot; was rebuilt sometime in the first century A.D. As his doomed nation retreated northward from their enemies, the 4th century prophet and historian Mormon recorded that Nephite &quot;towns, and villages, and cities were burned with fire.&quot; The Book of Mormon does not indicate whether the city of Zarahemla survived to be occupied by Lamanites after the destruction of the Nephite nation.

==Cultural reception==
=== Namesakes ===
In 1841, Joseph Smith dictated a revelation instructing Latter-day Saints in Iowa to establish a city across the Mississippi River from Nauvoo, Illinois and name it after Zarahemla. A settlement of Latter-day Saints, located across the Mississippi River from Nauvoo and south of Montrose, Iowa, was called &quot;Zarahemla&quot;. The Zarahemla Stake in Iowa was abandoned in 1842. In the nineteenth century, Blanchardville, Wisconsin was called Zarahemla. In 1850, under the direction of Zenas H. Gurley, Latter Day Saints who lived there and were unaffiliated with Brigham Young&#x27;s Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints organized into the Yellowstone Branch. Zarahemla was the location of the Reorganization&#x27;s first or second conference, held in 1853. The congregation at Zarahemla dissolved in 1860.

Zarahemla, Utah is named after the city from the Book of Mormon. The second book in author Gary Stewart&#x27;s Gabe Utley detective series, published in 1986, is titled &quot;The Zarahemla Vision&quot;. Its narrative is set in Salt Lake City and involves the apparent kidnapping of the LDS Church president. As part of appropriating Mormon themes of revelation and ideas about indigenous resurgence, Kanaka Maoli author Matthew Kaopio&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Written in the Sky&quot; invokes the name Zarahemla to allude to the Book of Mormon. One of the novel&#x27;s characters, Dr. Owlfeathers, is from the nonexistent Zarahemla University.

=== Speculating locations ===
Responding to their belief in the Book of Mormon&#x27;s ancient historicity, Latter-day Saints throughout the nineteenth century believed archaeological evidence would emerge to corroborate the Book of Mormon; many regarded scholarship on the ancient Americas as vindication of the book. There has been no actual archaeological discovery of Zarahemla.

In 1842, Latter-day Saint newspaper the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; associated Zarahemla with the ruins of Quiriguá. Artist George M. Ottinger opined that the Maya city-state Palenque was one and the same as Zarahemla. In an elaborate geography constructed from the Book of Mormon&#x27;s text, Latter-day Saints George Reynolds and Janne M. Sjödahl supposed Zarahemla was located along the Magdalena River in Colombia. Classically trained, Sjödahl followed the &quot;signature style of biblical archaeology&quot;, in the words of religious studies scholar Matthew Bowman, trying to corroborate Book of Mormon text with archaeological data, to draw his conclusions for associating Zarahemla with the Maya.

Benjamin Cluff, then president of Brigham Young Academy, from 1900 to 1901 led an expedition, mostly comprising students, to try to discover evidence of the city of Zarahemla in Colombia, in accord with Reynolds and Sjödahl&#x27;s proposed geography. Six of the group reached the Magdalena, but they turned back after learning that civil conflict had destabilized the region, ending their expedition.

Margarito Bautista in his 1936 &quot;La evolución de Mexico: sus verdaderos progenitores y su origen: el destino de America y Europa&quot; expressed his belief that Book of Mormon peoples were the ancestors of indigenous Mexicans, and he superimposed Zarahemla onto the region north of Panama, somewhere in Guatemala, Honduras, or southern Mexico.

In 2021, a group of Mormons called the Heartland Research Group believed they had found the location of Zarahemla outside Montrose, Iowa and searched the soil for evidence of human habitation using lidar. They also took core samples with the aim of using carbon dating to identify evidence of fires. The Heartland Research Group holds to what has been called the &quot;Heartland model&quot;, a belief among certain Mormons that the events of the Book of Mormon took place specifically in the Heartland of the United States, the emergence of which coincided with growth in LDS Church membership in Central and South America. &quot;Religion Dispatches&quot; reports that the Heartland model movement rests on American nationalism and espouses white supremacy and Euro-American colonialism.
=== Visual art ===
George M. Ottinger&#x27;s oil painting &quot;Destruction of Zarahemla&quot; took cues for its composition from Benjamin West&#x27;s &quot;Death on a Pale Horse&quot; and for its visualization of Zarahemla from archaeological illustrations, including a Maya stelae resembling one from Quiriguála. The horses, chariot, clouds, and fleeing crowd also resemble those of Nicolas Poussin&#x27;s paintings &quot;The Conversion of St. Paul&quot; and &quot;The Death of Hippolytus&quot;. It was published in December 1888 as an illustration in &quot;The Story of the Book of Mormon&quot;.

<text>Maria Amalia Teresa of Naples and Sicily (26 April 1782 – 24 March 1866) was Queen of the French by marriage to Louis Philippe I, King of the French. She was the last queen of France.

Among her grandchildren were the monarchs Leopold II of Belgium, Empress Carlota of Mexico, with whom Maria Amalia regularly corresponded while she was in Mexico, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and Queen Mercedes of Spain.

==Early years==

Maria Amalia was born on 26 April 1782 at the Caserta Palace just outside Naples. She was the tenth of eighteen children of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria.

As a young Italian princess, she was educated in the Catholic tradition, which she appears to have taken to heart. Maria Carolina, like her mother, Maria Theresa, made an effort to be a part of her daughter&#x27;s life, though she was cared for daily by her governess, Vincenza Rizzi. As a child, Maria Amalia&#x27;s mother and her aunt, Marie Antoinette, arranged for her engagement to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s son, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, her cousin, the future king of France. Her young fiancé died in 1789.

Maria Amalia faced chaos and upheaval from a young age. The death of her aunt Marie Antoinette during the French Revolution and her mother&#x27;s subsequent dramatic actions emblazoned the event in her memory. During the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, the Neapolitan court was not hostile to the movement. When the French monarchy was abolished and her aunt Marie Antoinette and uncle Louis XVI were executed, Maria Amalia&#x27;s parents joined the First Coalition against France in 1793. Although peace was made with France in 1796, by 1798 conflict again erupted and the royal family fled to the Kingdom of Sicily, leaving Naples on 21 December 1798 aboard , a British Royal Navy vessel protected by two Neapolitan warships. Maria Amalia spent the years 1800 to 1802 with her mother in Austria. In 1802, she finally returned to Naples with her mother. After the invasion of Naples by Napoleon in 1806, the royal family was once more forced to flee to Sicily, where they again settled in Palermo under the protection of British troops.

While in exile, Maria Amalia encountered her future husband, Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, also forced from his home in France due to political complications of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon. Louis-Philippe&#x27;s father, the previous Duke of Orléans, had been guillotined during the French Revolution, though he had advocated it in the early years.

The two were married in 1809, three years after they met in Italy, whereupon Marie-Amelie became Duchess of Orléans. The ceremony was celebrated in Palermo 25 November 1809. The marriage was considered controversial, because she was the niece of Marie Antoinette, while he was the son of a man who was considered to have played a part in the execution of her aunt. Her mother was skeptical to the match for the same reason, but she had given her consent after he had convinced her that he was determined to compensate for the mistakes of his father, and after having agreed to answer all her questions regarding his father.

==Duchess of Orléans==

During the first years of her marriage, Marie-Amelie and Louis Philippe lived under British protection in Palermo, in a palace given to them by her father, the Palazzo Orléans.

Marie-Amelie went to France with her new husband in 1814, where she attempted to make a home with her growing family, but with Napoleon&#x27;s brief return, she was forced to flee yet again. Prior to her husband&#x27;s rise to power, Marie-Amelie and her husband had to cope with a persistent money problem due to the fact that they had no income aside from that which they were given by the British crown. The family was given permission to return to France again in 1817.

During the Orléans&#x27; time in France prior to Louis-Philippe&#x27;s accession, the family lived in the Palais-Royal, which had been the home of her father-in-law, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. Despite the monetary worries of the family, the house was returned to its original splendor at a cost to the couple of eleven million francs. During their tenure as Duke and Duchess of Orléans, her spouse made Palais-Royal a center of high society in Paris when the aristocracy found the royal court, which was organized according to revived l&#x27;ancien regime-etiquette, too stiff. However, it was rather her sister-in-law Madame Adelaide who was regarded the hostess at Palais-Royal, while Marie-Amelie was described as dignified but silent and withdrawn. In 1825, the Duke and Duchess met with her sister and brother-in-law, the King and Queen of Sardinia in Chambéry, and in May 1830, they hosted her brother and sister-in-law, the King and Queen of the Two Sicilies, at Palais-Royal.

==Tenure as queen==

In 1830, following what is known as the July Revolution, Louis-Philippe became king of the French, with Maria Amalia as queen of the July Monarchy. Maria Amalia did not approve of Louis-Philippe&#x27;s acceptance of the crown and reportedly described it as a catastrophe.

When tumult followed the publication of the Ordinances in 1830 and erupted in the July revolution in Paris, the Orléans family was at the country estate Neuilly. Her sister in-law, Adélaïde, convinced Louis-Philippe that the moment was right for him to place himself as the leader of the opposition against the absolute monarchy of Charles X, and present himself as the candidate of a constitutional monarchy, in between the unpopular absolute monarchy and the republicanism. In this, she defeated the view of her sister in-law, Maria Amalia, who was loyal to the reigning older branch. When rumors arrived that the royalists were going to arrest Louis-Philippe, he evacuated to Raincy and the children were sent to Villers-Cotterêts, but Adélaïde and Maria Amalia remained at Neuilly. When a delegation reached Neuilly and offered Louis-Philippe the crown, Maria Amalia refused the offer on behalf of herself and her spouse, reproaching Ary Scheffer and Adolphe Thiers for insulting them by having made it. Adélaïde, however, accepted it with the argument that her brother would do anything to prevent the country he loved from anarchy. Thiers accepted the answer of Adélaïde rather than the one from Maria Amalia with the words: &quot;Madame, you have given the crown to your family&quot;. After this, several other visits followed from people asking Louis-Philippe to accept the crown: to all, Maria Amalia answered that Louis-Philippe was an honest man and thus could not do it, while Adélaïde contradicted her by stating, that the offer should be made to Louis-Philippe by the chamber of deputies; and if he should hesitate, she would herself go to Paris and accept the crown for him. Soon after, the Chamber of Deputies called Louis-Philippe to Paris to formally present him their offer. It has been estimated that he accepted the crown largely because of Adélaïde.

When the news arrived that Louis-Philippe had accepted the crown, Maria Amalia reportedly cried and sobbed: &quot;What a catastrophe! They will call my husband an usurper!&quot; She refused to return to Paris with her children in an open state carriage, as this would give an impression of triumph. When she did arrive to the Palais-Royal, which was at that time wide open to the public, it was noticed that she looked as if she had been crying, which attracted attention. She and her sister-in-law visited those who had been wounded during the revolution, and supported them financially.

Maria Amalia was to say that she could see no advantages of the crown, only the destruction of a peaceful family life and an insecurity for the lives of her family. However, she concluded, as God has given them the crown, they must do the best of the matter: &quot;Since by God&#x27;s will this Crown of Thorns has been placed upon our heads, we must accept it and the duties it entails&quot;. At 6 August 1830, she and her sister-in-law were present at the tribune on the ceremony at the chambers when Louis-Philippe were declared King of the French. She herself was never honored with any form of official ceremony, though she was automatically given the honorary title Queen of the French.

Maria Amalia did not play an active role in politics and in fact made a concentrated effort to remove herself from it. In 1832, after the failed coup of Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchess de Berry, Marie-Caroline appealed to her from her prison at Blaye, as did one of Marie-Caroline&#x27;s followers, Mesnard; however Maria Amalia refused to even receive the petition of the first nor to promise anything to the second, despite being personally attached to the Duchess de Berry. It was with his sister rather than with his wife that the King discussed state affairs.

As Queen, Maria Amalia became foremost known for her simple personal life style and her charity. For political reasons, King Louis-Philippe did not wish to have any representation or court life of the more elaborate kind but, rather wished to give the impression of his family living a life of the burgher class, and during her tenure as Queen, the royal court was relatively subdued to its outward appearance.
The court etiquette at the Tuileries was therefore simplified, and the royal family lived a life which was to be modeled after the ideal life of a wealthy burgher class family of the time, with few state occasions, though they did regularly host smaller gala dinners for the representatives of the people. This domestic life did suit Maria Amalia, who was already devoted to this life style. The household included her lady-in-waiting, the Marquise de Dolomieu.

The Queen&#x27;s daily routine centered around family dinners, religious duties and charitable work: she kept a strict guard over her daughters and later her daughters-in-law, sewing with them in the drawing room when she was not occupied with her charitable work. After having heard Mass and received private audiences, she worked with her secretaries receiving, personally reading and attending to petitions from the poor. Reportedly, Maria Amalia received a personal allowance of 500.000 franc, and spent 400.000 franc of that sum on charity. 
In one instance, she responded to a request from French missionary sister Saint Mother Theodore Guerin of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods by saying, &quot;Ah, yes, sisters, let us save souls!&quot; She gave Guerin and her fellow Sister of Providence Mary Cecilia Bailly funds for their schools in the United States, as well as covered their travel expenses. Reportedly, however, she did give contributions to the needing regardless of their political or religious convictions. As queen she was named Protector of several charity organizations, notably the Société de Charité Maternelle.

She was regarded to have performed her representational duties with dignity. In 1843, she hosted British Queen Victoria at the Château d&#x27;Eu in Normandy. She did not, however, follow Louis-Philippe on his visit to England in 1844.

While Maria Amalia had accepted the crown unwillingly, she regarded it her duty to keep it after it had once been given to her by God. During the Revolution of 1848, Maria Amalia made an attempt to get Louis-Philippe to take control of the troops, rally the National Guard, subdue the riots on the streets and defend his crown with his life. Reportedly, he did not answer her, but only asked her to trust his judgement. When a mob marched toward the Tuileries, Louis Philippe was convinced by his ministers to flee, and he signed his abdication in favor of his grandson against the consent of Maria Amalia. When the family left the palace, Maria Amalia reportedly turned to minister Thiers and commented: &quot;Ah Monsieur, you were not worthy of such a good king!&quot; 
The family left under somewhat chaotic circumstances, and Maria Amalia reportedly fainted and had to be lifted into her carriage. The couple were accompanied by their son Antoine, Duke of Montpensier; their daughter-in-law the Duchess of Nemours; their daughter Princess Clementine and her spouse, as well as six grandchildren. Their eldest son&#x27;s widow the Duchess of Orléans and her sons were left at the palace in the company of their son the Duke of Nemours to fight for the right to the crown of their grandson, the Count of Paris.

The family left Paris for Saint-Cloud and from there to Dreux, where they parted and made their way to England in different groups. Maria Amalia and Louis Philippe lived for a while in the cottage of a friend in Honfleur, before they left in secret by Le Havre for Newhaven in England.

==Exile and death==

In England, Louis Philippe and Maria Amalia were well received by Queen Victoria, who let them live in Claremont House in Surrey for life. As the French state had decided not to confiscate their property, they did not have money problems.

Louis Philippe died two years later. After the death of her husband, Maria Amalia continued to live in England where she attended daily Mass and was well known to Queen Victoria. She spent her remaining years living a private family life, and was joined by most of her children with the exception of the Duke of Montpensier. Maria Amalia regarded the elder branch of the Bourbon to have superior right to the French throne, and she supported her son the Duke of Nemours when he reconciled with the head of the elder Bourbon line, Henri, Count of Chambord, on behalf of the Orléans line. At her death, she also asked to be called Duchess of Orléans on her grave stone rather than Queen of the French.

Maria Amalia died on 24 March 1866, aged 83. She was the last surviving grandchild of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. After her death, the dress she had kept since 1848 when her husband had left France was put on her, according to her last wishes.

<doc id="487299" wikidata="Q253898" url="?curid=487299" title="Driving band">
<text>A driving band or rotating band is a band of soft metal near the base of an artillery shell, often made of gilding metal, copper, or lead. When the shell is fired, the pressure of the propellant swages the metal into the rifling of the barrel and forms a seal; this seal prevents the gases from blowing past the shell and engages the barrel&#x27;s rifling to spin-stabilize the shell.

== Purpose ==
The rotating band has three essential functions:
* Center the rear end of the projectile in the gun barrel. 
* Seal the bore to prevent burning powder gas from moving through the rifling grooves past the projectile.
* Engage with the rifling of the barrel to spin the projectile and stabilize its flight.

== Characteristics ==
The shell is stabilized for yaw in the barrel by a smaller bourrelet band near the front of the projectile. This band keeps the projectile travelling straight in the bore supported by the lands between the rifling grooves, but doesn&#x27;t engage the rifling. 

As shell weight increases, it becomes more difficult to engineer a driving band that prevents propellant gases from either blowing past it, or blowing it off the shell. Tougher alloys like cupronickel may be used on major-caliber projectiles. Rotating band width of about one-third of the projectile caliber provides superior performance, but two narrower bands, separated by a short distance, have been used to conserve strategic metals in wartime. Each band is secured in a dovetailed notch machined into the projectile. Waved ridges, longitudinal nicks, or knurling is machined into the bottom of the notch to prevent the band from slipping around the projectile as the projectile accelerates down the gun barrel. The rotating band is made of a ring of slightly greater diameter than the projectile, slipped into position while thermally expanded, and pressed radially into place with a powerful hydraulic banding press.

The forward edge of the band may be conically tapered to fit into a coned seat at the start of the gun barrel rifling. The central portion of the band is roughly cylindrical with a diameter slightly larger than the groove diameter of the gun barrel to ensure a tight fit in gun barrels worn by firing previous projectiles. The rear portion of the band may include a flared skirt of even larger diameter in front of a groove to hold the skirt as it is compressed by barrel dimensions. The skirt is intended to provide a gas seal in the most heavily eroded portion of the bore near the powder chamber.

== Variations ==

Driving bands pre-cut for the rifling have been used for muzzle loaded weapons, e.g. some mortars.
Freely rotating bands can be used to reduce the spin imparted to the round as is preferable for HEAT warheads or fin-stabilised projectiles fired from general-purpose rifled barrels.

Gerald Bull worked extensively on ways to eliminate the driving band, leading to the development of his Extended Range, Full Bore ammunition using an inversion of the pre-cut rifling for his GC-45 howitzer.

Some weapons that operate at high rates of fire, such as the GAU-8 Avenger Gatling cannon, use plastic driving bands instead of soft metal. Using plastic as a swage material reduces wear on the barrel&#x27;s rifling, and extends the life and average accuracy of the weapon.

In a small-arms rifle, the entire bullet is typically covered in copper or another soft alloy, making the entire bullet its own driving band.

During World War II, German ammunition sometimes used iron driving bands instead of copper due to material shortages. Porous iron bands were favored over solid ones.

<doc id="487300" wikidata="Q165651" url="?curid=487300" title="Fanny and Alexander">
<text>Fanny and Alexander () is a 1982 period drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden during the first decade of the twentieth century. Following the death of the children&#x27;s father (Allan Edwall), their mother (Ewa Fröling) remarries a prominent bishop (Jan Malmsjö) who becomes abusive towards Alexander for his vivid imagination.

Bergman intended &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; to be his final picture before retiring, and his script is semi-autobiographical. The characters Alexander, Fanny and stepfather Edvard are based on himself, his sister Margareta and his father Erik Bergman, respectively. Many of the scenes were filmed on location in Uppsala. The documentary film &quot;The Making of Fanny and Alexander&quot; was made simultaneously with the feature and chronicles its production.

The production was originally conceived as a television miniseries and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The television version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut is one of the longest cinematic films in history.

The theatrical version was released to universal critical acclaim. It won four Academy Awards, including for Best Foreign Language Film; three Guldbagge Awards, including Best Film; and other honours. &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; was followed by stage adaptations and further semi-autobiographical screenplays by Bergman, released as films in 1992: &quot;The Best Intentions&quot;, directed by Bille August, and &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Children&quot;, directed by Daniel Bergman. On both review websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic it is the highest-rated film of the 1980s, and has since then been regarded as one of Bergman&#x27;s finest works, one of the greatest works of Swedish cinema, and of all time.

==Plot==
In 1907, young Alexander, his sister Fanny, and their well-to-do family, the Ekdahls, live in a Swedish town, running a moderately profitable theatre. At Christmastime, the Ekdahls hold a Nativity play and later a large Christmas party. The siblings&#x27; parents, Emilie and Oscar, are happily married until Oscar suddenly dies from a stroke. Shortly thereafter, Emilie marries Edvard Vergérus, the local bishop and a widower, and moves into his home where he lives with his mother, sister, aunt, and maids. The siblings&#x27; womanizing uncle, Gustav Adolf, carries on with the nursemaid, Maj, while the siblings&#x27; other uncle, Carl, bemoans himself as a failure.

It quickly becomes evident that the children&#x27;s stepfather, the bishop Edvard, is a strict and controlling authoritarian. The relationship between the bishop and Alexander is especially cold, as Alexander invents stories, for which Edvard punishes him severely. As a result, Emilie asks for a divorce, which Edvard will not consent to; though she may leave the marriage, this would be legally considered desertion, placing the children in his custody. Meanwhile, the rest of the Ekdahl family has begun to worry about their condition, and Emilie secretly visits her former mother-in-law, Helena, revealing she is pregnant.

During Emilie&#x27;s absence, Edvard confines the children to their bedroom, ostensibly for their safety. There, Alexander shares a story, claiming he was visited by the ghosts of the Vergérus family, who revealed the bishop was responsible for their deaths. The maid Justina reports the story to Edvard, who responds with corporal punishment. After Emilie returns, the Ekdahl family friend Isak Jacobi helps smuggle the children from the house. They live temporarily with Isak and his nephews in their store.

Emilie&#x27;s former brothers-in-law confront Edvard to negotiate a divorce, using the children, the bishop&#x27;s debts, and the threat of a public scandal for leverage, but Edvard is unmoved.

Emilie, now in the later stages of her pregnancy, refuses to restore the children to Edvard&#x27;s home. Emilie allows Edvard to drink a large dosage of her bromide sedative. She explains to him, as the medication takes effect, that she intends to flee the home as he sleeps. He threatens to follow her family and ruin their lives, but falls unconscious. After she escapes, Edvard&#x27;s dying Aunt Elsa accidentally overturns a gas lamp, setting her bedclothes, nightgown, and hair on fire. Engulfed in flames, she runs through the house, seeking Edvard&#x27;s help, but he, too, is set aflame. Although partially incapacitated by the sedative, he is able to disentangle himself from Aunt Elsa, but is badly burned and dies shortly thereafter.

Alexander had fantasised about his stepfather&#x27;s death while living with Isak and his nephews Aron and Ismael Retzinsky. The mysterious Ismael explains that fantasy can become true as he dreams it.

The Ekdahl family reunites for the christening celebration of Emilie&#x27;s and the late bishop&#x27;s daughter as well as the extra-marital daughter of Alexander&#x27;s uncle, Gustav Adolf, and the maid, Maj. Alexander encounters the ghost of the bishop who knocks him to the floor, and tells him, &quot;You can never escape me.&quot; Emilie, having inherited the theatre, hands Helena a copy of August Strindberg&#x27;s play &quot;A Dream Play&quot; to read and tells her that they should perform it together onstage. Initially scoffing at the idea and declaring Strindberg a &quot;misogynist,&quot; Helena takes to the idea and begins reading it to a sleeping Alexander.

==Production==
===Development===

Director Ingmar Bergman conceived of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; while working on his 1980 film &quot;From the Life of the Marionettes&quot;, and wrote the screenplay at Fårö in summer 1979. Bergman intended &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; to be his last feature film, but he wrote several screenplays afterwards and directed for television. He told the press he decided to retire, because, &quot;I don&#x27;t have the strength any more, neither psychologically nor physically&quot;. The screenplay was semi-autobiographical, attempting to portray Bergman&#x27;s fondest memories in what he called a &quot;happy and privileged&quot; childhood; Alexander himself was meant as a representation of the young Ingmar. His recollections of his grandmother&#x27;s home were a particular inspiration. He commented on his boyhood:

Bergman also recalled receiving his own magic lantern at age 10, from his aunt; in his autobiography, he described it as personally significant, and previously depicted a magic lantern in his 1972 &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;.

However, the Ekdahls do not entirely match the Bergmans. Ingmar&#x27;s relationship with his sister Margareta during their shared childhood is depicted through the character Fanny, who is included in the title though she is not as large a character as Alexander. Bergman had previously modeled characters after his mother, Karin Åkerblom, as simultaneously &quot;virgin and seductress&quot;: Emilie also fits that self-contradictory design.

Margareta and Ingmar&#x27;s father was the strict Erik Bergman, a Lutheran pastor. Edvard is based on Erik, and like Edvard, Erik was raised in a family almost completely made up of women. Erik and Ingmar also often conflicted over &quot;truth&quot; and honesty, much as Edvard and Alexander do. The story Alexander tells of being sold to a circus resembles one Ingmar had told as a boy, and he was accosted by Erik much as Edvard lectures Alexander. However, Bergman also stated that &quot;It has been suggested ... that 12-year-old Alexander is my alter-ego. But this is not quite true. &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; is a story, the chronicle of a middle-class, perhaps upper-middle-class family sticking closely together ... There&#x27;s a lot of me in the Bishop, rather than in Alexander. He is haunted by his own devils&quot;.

Bergman proposed the project to producer Jörn Donner, who said he could provide the budget if all production and costume design crew would be Swedish. Bergman initially doubted that Sweden alone had the manpower, but eventually caved, Donner said. The estimated budget of 40 million SEK made it the most costly Swedish film ever. To raise the $6 million, Donner and the Swedish Film Institute partnered with the French company Gaumont and West German TV. Bergman completed the screenplay by October 1980 and assembled a budget of $7 million, according to &quot;New York&quot;.

===Casting===

The project was announced in October 1980 with Liv Ullmann, Max von Sydow and Erland Josephson in lead roles; von Sydow was cast as Edvard, the bishop who Ingmar told the press resembled Erik Bergman. However, negotiations to secure von Sydow became troubled as he continued to act more in productions beyond Sweden, and as his agent demanded a larger salary. Edvard was recast with Jan Malmsjö, whom Bergman had worked with before in &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;. In 1981, Ullmann also rejected the role of Emilie, due to a scheduling conflict, though in 2013 she remarked &quot;I still don&#x27;t know why I did that&quot;.

Bertil Guve was 10 when cast as Alexander. Bergman had seen Guve in a television film by Lasse Hallström and called for an audition with Guve, though the boy did not know who Bergman was. Bergman ultimately cast Guve, without sharing the story of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; with him, recognising his imagination when he told a story about killing his own grandfather during the audition. Guve also said, &quot;I asked Ingmar later why he chose me. He said it was because I acted with my eyes&quot;. Child actress Pernilla Allwin was cast as Fanny, and she and Guve regarded each other as rivals when they first met and began working; Bergman identified with this sibling rivalry.

Other actors, like Harriet Andersson, Gunnar Björnstrand, and Jarl Kulle, had previously appeared in Bergman&#x27;s filmography. Björnstrand was developing Alzheimer&#x27;s syndrome, making it difficult for him to memorise his dialogue, but he was still awarded a small role. Veteran actress Gunn Wållgren was cast as Helena, despite the fact that she was suffering from cancer, often concealing her pain during shots. &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; marked the final film appearances of both Björnstrand and Wållgren.

Pernilla Wallgren (later August) was cast, out of a state school where she was studying the stage, for what became her breakthrough role. August later explained she received a message inviting her to read the screenplay, and she did not know how the filmmakers knew of her. She had developed an interest in acting after seeing Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, and wanted a part like Kari Sylwan&#x27;s in a film one day. Bergman also cast some of his real-life children, including Mats Bergman as Isak&#x27;s nephew Aron, and Anna Bergman as Hanna Schwartz; Linn Ullmann was to play Alexander&#x27;s older sister Amanda, but when Linn&#x27;s school refused to give her a break for production, her father cut the character. His ex-wife Käbi Laretei was cast as an aunt. In total, there were 60 characters with lines, and over 1,200 extras.

===Pre-production===
Art director Anna Asp was given six months before production to prepare, and started by building miniature models and drawing sets. In creating the Ekdahl home, Bergman envisioned his real-life grandmother&#x27;s Uppsala residence as a model. She had one apartment in the residence, whereas the other apartment belonged to Erik Bergman and his family. Asp designed Oscar and Emilie&#x27;s apartment with an Art Nouveau style. For the bishop&#x27;s house, Asp sought a design that would be frightening while still being a plausible home for a man of the church, and found inspiration from a photograph of a castle in a magazine. In designing Isak&#x27;s residence, Asp worked from Bergman&#x27;s memory of a Jewish antiques shop owner, looking for a labyrinth-style.

Costume designer Marik Vos oversaw a project requiring 250 costumes for the principal actors, along with over 1,000 costumes for the extras. She allowed the testing of the vast majority of fabric samples to determine how they appeared in photography, with Bergman demanding to see as many of the test shots as he could. Vos also co-ordinated colours with Asp.

===Filming===

Principal photography began in Uppsala, Sweden, lasting from 7 September 1981 to 22 March 1982. The filmmakers began shooting around Uppsala streets, which municipal leaders allowed the crew to redecorate. Scenes were shot in chronological order, and Guve only learned the thrust of the story was his conflict with his stepfather during production. On the first day of photography, Bergman decided to stage a pillow fight, which the apprehensive Wallgren credited for putting her at ease. It also endeared the director to the child actors. Guve developed a generally amiable relationship with Bergman and later Pernilla Allwin, and Allwin and Guve&#x27;s habit of playing on bicycles between filming would dirty their costumes and cause the crew to rush to clean them. Guve also conflicted with Bergman when he laughed during a shoot, at which point Bergman reprimanded him and said that it was &quot;the most outrageous, the most unprofessional behaviour&quot; he had ever seen. While production meant full-time days during the workweek, Guve remained in school by spending the weekend on homework.

Scenes were shot outside of Uppsala Cathedral, with the crew conflicting with the dean over whether an antenna could be removed. For Edvard&#x27;s house, shooting moved to Upplandsmuseet, Uppsala County&#x27;s museum. For interiors, the same sets in Uppsala and the Swedish Film Institute were used to portray multiple places.

With Bergman suffering from influenza, his colleagues substituted for him in shooting Oscar&#x27;s funeral scene with 500 extras and a brass band. At one point during production, a crossbeam fell over in the studio and nearly hit Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Other crew were injured in workplace accidents. One injury took place when a male stunt performer portraying the burning Aunt Elsa was actually burned by spilled napalm. Much of the production was recorded by Bergman and Arne Carlsson for the 1984 documentary, &quot;The Making of Fanny and Alexander&quot;.

==Themes and interpretations==
Critic Michiko Kakutani identified &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; as sharing marriage-drama and domestic themes as his &quot;Thirst&quot; (1949), &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973) and &quot;From the Life of the Marionettes&quot;. In contrast, academic Linda Haverty expressed surprise at Bergman, including his use of fantastical elements such as ghosts and telepathy as they were a departure from the psychological horror of his work in the 1960s and 1970s, for this &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; story. Professor Frank Gado argued in his 1986 book &quot;The Passion of Ingmar Bergman&quot; that &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; is &quot;actually two films, which, except that they concern members of the same family, are dramatically separate entities. The glow that warmed audiences radiates from only an outer layer; its core is as chilling as any of Bergman&#x27;s fictions&quot;.

===Magic and reality===

Academic Egil Törnqvist identified the character Gustav Adolf with secular merriment, while Alexander and Isak inhabit a world filled with the supernatural and evil. Critic Dave Kehr interpreted the fairy tale style as a product of the story being told from Alexander&#x27;s perspective, coloured with &quot;myth and legend&quot;. Alexander experiences &quot;visions of ghosts or dream visions alongside everyday reality&quot;, author Laura Hubner wrote. The sequence these visions are seen in may be significant. After being punished by Edvard for telling a story about how the Vergérus family died, Alexander is haunted by the ghosts of the family who deny Edvard&#x27;s culpability, suggesting Edvard frightened Alexander into seeing this new vision. Writer Mas&#x27;ud Zavarzadeh rationalised Alexander&#x27;s visions as a product of the character being &quot;an artist in the making&quot;. Zavarzadeh further noted, &quot;He is involved in the construction of a more genuine and stable reality than the one that surrounds him&quot;.

As indicated by Gustav Adolf&#x27;s final speech, most of the Ekdahls do not spend much time grappling with the meaning of life. Zavarzadeh also contrasted Alexander to another of his uncles, Carl, a scholar who relies on logic but who is reduced to an absurdity, at one point entertaining the children with his flatulence. Törnqvist considered the surname of the characters to be inspired by Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s 1884 play &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, and that it made the name Ekdal synonymous with characters who cope with illusions about reality. &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; adds an H to Ekdal, giving it an aristocratic air, Törnqvist added.

Huber cited academics Marilyn Johns Blackwell and Törnqvist in support of the point that, despite the title, Alexander is the lead role and Fanny is a minor character; Blackwell added that imagination is &quot;largely gendered as male&quot;. Concurring that Fanny is a minor character, Kehr further argued that Alexander influences the plot to a lesser degree than the adult characters, but remains the focus in the storytelling.

On Alexander&#x27;s visions and their reality, critic Roger Ebert argued:
In the end, Helena reads from August Strindberg&#x27;s 1902 play &quot;A Dream Play&quot;: &quot;Anything can happen, all is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist. On an insignificant foundation of reality, imagination spins out and weaves new patterns&quot;. As with &quot;A Dream Play&quot;, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; explores &quot;the unreality of life itself&quot;. Gado suggested the quote refers to memories and imagination, and that all of Bergman&#x27;s filmography could be dreams forming parts of one dream.

===Family conflict===

&quot;Film Quarterly&quot; essayist Jarrod Hayes concluded the conflict between Alexander and Edvard is a &quot;clash of two Titans&quot;, as Edvard summons &quot;the power of &quot;an&quot; image, God, Alexander has the power of &quot;the&quot; Image&quot;. Törnqvist observed Alexander&#x27;s father Oscar wears white while his stepfather Edvard wears black, signifying they represent good and evil. Academic Amir Cohen-Shalev also observed contrasts between Oscar and Edvard, Oscar as &quot;well-meaning, loving but passive&quot;, and Edvard, as a far more strict man of the church, in the mold of Erik Bergman. Cohen-Shalev argued Edvard disguises his emotional shortcomings with his bourgeois veneer and &quot;glib, affected piety&quot;. While espousing his devotion, Edvard personally may have secretly lost his belief, and he conflicts with Alexander with &quot;doublethink&quot;: using &quot;love&quot; to mean &quot;hate&quot;. Following Oscar&#x27;s death, Cohen-Shalev argued Emilie chooses to marry Edvard because she is frightened as to how empty she is: &quot;I could not understand why nothing really happened, why I never felt really happy&quot;.

The story makes multiple references to William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;; According to Scott-Douglas, Alexander observes Oscar playing &quot;Hamlet&quot;&#x27;s Ghost before he dies, and afterward appears as a ghost, while Alexander acquires a new abusive stepfather. This made &quot;theatre and reality seem indistinguishable&quot;. Cohen-Shalev argued Oscar being reduced to a ghost is his punishment for never truly living, and losing his life. Törnqvist wrote the &quot;triangle&quot; of Alexander, Emilie and Edvard is explicitly explained with Emilie&#x27;s reference to &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and the characters Hamlet, Queen Gertrude and King Claudius: &quot;Don&#x27;t act Hamlet, my son. I&#x27;m not Queen Gertrude, your kind stepfather is no king of Denmark, and this is not Elsinore Castle, even if it does look gloomy&quot;. Emilie, like Gertrude, is also portrayed as unfaithful, with Bergman&#x27;s screenplay suggesting Oscar is not Alexander&#x27;s biological father: in the Nativity play, Oscar plays Joseph. According to Helena, Oscar fell impotent after Fanny&#x27;s birth, and Emilie afterward conducted circumspect affairs.

By framing Edvard as &quot;stepfather-king&quot;, the story becomes a battle between &quot;infanticide and parricide&quot;, where killing Edvard is associated with Alexander&#x27;s &quot;artistic/sexual emancipation&quot;, scholar Arnold L. Weinstein wrote. Törnqvist wrote Alexander displays an &quot;erotic attraction to his mother&quot;, combined with a hatred for his stepfather, referencing the Oedipus complex. Author Viveka Nyberg identified Oedipal themes as pervasive, suggesting Alexander believes he may have killed both his father and stepfather in competition for his mother&#x27;s love. Nyberg described Emilie as &quot;beautiful and aloof in equal measure&quot;, and she cares for her children but concerns herself more with other things. Alexander&#x27;s story of being sold to the circus reflects his feelings of his mother forsaking him. While Alexander appears to admire Oscar and his imagination, Alexander also listens in on his parents&#x27; interactions, and sleeps in Maj&#x27;s bed, with Maj acting as stand-in mother and an object of sexual desire.

Cohen-Shalev described cyclical patterns in the story: the family endures seasons of distinct &quot;symbols, myths, and moods&quot;, including death in winter and resurrections in the spring; or, a trip to which the protagonist experiences a test in the &quot;Valley of Tears&quot; before achieving &quot;blissful family unification&quot;. Edvard is also forgiven with &quot;a kind of humanity&quot;, Cohen-Shalev wrote, as Edvard confesses his faith is a mask, and his burning death mirrors his analogy of a mask that cannot be removed unless the flesh is removed as well.

===Christianity and Judaism===
The story opens with exploring celebrations of the Swedish Christmas, which is expressed through &quot;colors, sounds, movements, music&quot; that &quot;Cineaste&quot; critic Royal Brown called &quot;life-affirming, pagan Christianity&quot;. This is starkly contrasted with Edvard&#x27;s Christianity, which is dictated by asceticism, authoritarianism and concern with death, with Alexander finding his new home a bare, cold prison. Professor Freddie Rokem wrote that, in contrast to Edvard&#x27;s &quot;rigorous and sterile&quot; Protestantism, the Ekdahl Christmas party can include the Jewish Isak, as he is a dear friend of matriarch Helena Ekdahl, and this friendship is &quot;utopian&quot;. While at Isak&#x27;s, his nephew Aron Retzinsky brings out a puppet of God, or &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to which Alexander reacts with terror; he then tries to play down that fear, and is left to wonder how seriously to take the supernatural. Author Harry Perridon argued that when Alexander declares God &quot;is a shit&quot;, he means God in Christianity, associating the deity with suffering in the world. After this point, true miracles in Bergman&#x27;s universe have to come from a different source, Perridon wrote.

The depiction of Jews in Sweden revolves around Isak, which academic Rochelle Wright argues is &quot;far more nuanced&quot; than in Bergman&#x27;s previous &quot;The Touch&quot; (1971). Isak is not completely assimilated, but his presence in Sweden is presented as positive, as he stands for imagination, &quot;magic and mystery&quot;, Wright wrote. Erland Josephson, who played Isak, described his performance as a stereotyped portrayal of a Jew, but with mystical and tragic elements, drawing on Jewish people and their history. Hayes argued that with its take on &quot;time and space&quot;, the story hinted at Jewish mysticism and the Kabbalah. The light that engulfs Isak when he screams after being beaten by Edvard calls on the light of the Kabbalah to vanquish evil, Hayes hypothesised. The scream may have invited &quot;spiritual intervention&quot;, allowing the children&#x27;s escape by rendering them invisible in Isak&#x27;s trunk, while the children seemingly appear lying on the floor to Edvard. Törnqvist hypothesised that Jewish pantheism replaces Christian belief in &quot;grace and punishment&quot; in the story. Royal Brown argued that Isak&#x27;s &quot;cabbalistic magic and animism&quot; is closer to the Ekdahls&#x27; Christianity than to Edvard&#x27;s.
Törnqvist identified Ismael as &quot;one of the more enigmatic features&quot; of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, commenting on the character as a fusion of elements. Ismael speaks the Finno-Swedish language, and he is androgynous, being a male character played by a woman, Stina Ekblad. Ismael also says to Alexander, &quot;Perhaps we are the same person&quot;. Author Daniel Humphrey also commented in Ismael&#x27;s androgyny, conveying &quot;queerness and foreignness&quot; but presented as spiritually identical to Alexander. Additionally, Humphrey commented on the name, with Ishmael of the Bible being a bastard son of Abraham and progenitor of the Arab people, considered &quot;paradigmatic&quot; by Christians and Jews alike. &quot;A Dream Play&quot; author Strindberg had taken interest in the Ishmael character. Törnqvist also identified Ismael as matching Hamlet in education, intelligence, real or feigned insanity and anti-social nature.

Hayes commented on the way Ismael holds Alexander, remarking it was &quot;Alexander&#x27;s erotic encounter with a man/a woman/himself&quot;. Critic Robin Wood and Richard Lippe argued Ismael directly replaces Oscar, dismissed by Alexander as not serving a purpose; Ismael instead brings danger and sexual ambiguity: Wood and Lippe observed Ismael touching Alexander and kissing Aron. The role of Ismael and Alexander&#x27;s ritual in Edvard&#x27;s death is uncertain: Ismael speaks of what will happen in the future in describing Edvard&#x27;s death, but it can all be logically explained, with a police officer informing Emilie the death is legally accidental.

==Release==

While cinematic film stock was used in production, Bergman conceived of the presentation as a television miniseries, and there are different versions, presented as a miniseries and film. The longer version intended for television was the original. After completing production, Bergman had to edit the complete cut to 188 minutes for screenings in theatres, regretting losing much of the fantasy material. He remarked, &quot;This was extremely troublesome, as I had to cut into the nerves and lifeblood of the film&quot;. The film premiered in Stockholm on 17 December 1982 in its 188-minute theatrical cut. Distribution rights were sold to 30 other countries in 1982. It subsequently opened in France on 9 March 1983, West Germany on 8 October 1983, and the United States on 17 June 1983.

The complete version runs 312 minutes. It was released in Swedish theatres in 1983, and screened at the 40th Venice International Film Festival in September 1983. It subsequently aired as a miniseries on Sveriges Television in four segments, and five episodes of unequal length at Bergman&#x27;s demand. They ran 92, 40, 37, 60 and 90 minutes, beginning 25 December 1984. After debuting at the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September 1984, &quot;The Making of Fanny and Alexander&quot; aired with a television repeat of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; in Sweden on 18 August 1986. In 1991, the Guinness Book of World Records listed the five-hour version as among the longest films in history. The entire miniseries ran on SVT1 in Sweden on 2 August 2007, with 10-minute newscast interruption, rendering it a two-part version. The screenplay was also published as a book and translated into English in 1983.

In Region 2, Artificial Eye released the five-hour version on DVD in 2002. In 2011 in Region A, The Criterion Collection published a Blu-ray edition including the theatrical version, the television version, and &quot;The Making of Fanny and Alexander&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
There were large audiences in Sweden at showings of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, including at the five-hour cut, making it the most popular box-office film Bergman had in his native country. It had 374,208 admissions in France and 165,146 in Germany. This amounted to minimal presence in the French box-office.

&quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; finished its run grossing $6,783,304 in North America. According to critic Vincent Canby&#x27;s analysis, the film did &quot;extremely well&quot; and had its niche audience, but could not match summer blockbuster competition which dominated the top 15 spots in the box office, particularly &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In 1992, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked it the 21st highest grossing foreign film in U.S. box office history, and the fifth-highest grossing Swedish film after 1967&#x27;s &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot; and &quot;Elvira Madigan&quot;, &quot;Dear John&quot; (1964) and &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot; (1985).

===Critical reception===
Upon release in Sweden, the film received generally positive reviews, with &quot;Expressen&quot; critic Lasse Bergström approving of the portrayal of the Oscarian era. Critic Stig Larsson assessed it as Bergman&#x27;s ironic take on his past filmography. &quot;Jönköpings-Posten&quot; posted a positive review on 7 February 1983, followed by a second critic in the same paper accusing the film of creating false joy on 21 February. The film ranked 10th on Cahiers du Cinéma&#x27;s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1983.

Vincent Canby&#x27;s contemporary review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it a &quot;big, dark, beautiful, generous family chronicle&quot;; Canby also praised the cast as &quot;uniformly excellent&quot;. Roger Ebert awarded it four stars, assessing it as &quot;a big, exciting, ambitious film&quot;, relatable to audiences though more specific in its story than Bergman&#x27;s prior studies of faith and sex, and named it the 4th best film of 1983. &quot;Variety&quot; staff called it &quot;a sumptuously produced period piece&quot; blending &quot;elegance with intimacy&quot;. For &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley found the story more cheerful than past Bergman productions, highlighting Ewa Fröling and comparing her to Liv Ullmann. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani compared the film&#x27;s &quot;generosity of vision&quot; to the comedies of William Shakespeare. &quot;The Nation&quot; critic Robert Hatch compared it to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; as a final life-affirming work, featuring &quot;magic with the casual authority of Prospero himself&quot;. Kerry Brougher denied it was Bergman&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, but still said it was &quot;a thoughtful, graceful, beautifully filmed work&quot;. &quot;National Review&quot; critic John Simon wrote a negative review, calling it &quot;overstuffed&quot;, and expressing lack of interest in Fröling and Guve as newcomers to Bergman&#x27;s filmography.

Ebert added it to his Great Movies list in 2004, hailing it as &quot;astonishingly beautiful&quot;, crediting Sven Nykvist for &quot;color and warmth&quot;. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the film eighth in its list of 25 greatest arthouse films. Reviewing The Criterion Collection Blu-ray, Andre Dellamorte wrote that despite the five-hour runtime, the story was uncomplicated but always interesting. &quot;The Observer&quot; quoted actor Matthew Macfadyen as saying the film &quot;featured just the most extraordinary acting I&#x27;d ever seen&quot;. Macfadyen added that as a RADA student, the film was shown as &quot;an example to follow – an example of people acting with each other&quot;. Polish film director Agnieszka Holland also praised it in 2012, saying both children and intellectuals could enjoy it and that it gives a very vivid portrait of another era. In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave it four stars, identifying its emotions as &quot;exquisitely expressed&quot;.

Pauline Kael wrote a more mixed review, enjoying the merry atmosphere but writing the &quot;conventionality&quot; is &quot;rather shocking&quot;, suggesting Bergman had moved to Victorian times to escape his usual eccentric viewpoints. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Alex Cox wrote a negative review in 2006, claiming there was no story for the first two of three hours, and that the analogy to &quot;Hamlet&quot; did not hold up as Alexander knows Edvard is evil, whereas Hamlet is uncertain if the Ghost is a demon and Claudius is innocent. Cox had not seen the longer version, but considered it might be better.

In 1990, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; was named the best film of the 1980s by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; by Sheila Benson, who called it &quot;generous, ribald, reflective and radiantly life-affirming&quot;, and Michael Wilmington, and the third best by &quot;Newsweek&quot; critic David Ansen. In 1996, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; was ranked at No. 36 in Movieline Magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Foreign Films&quot;. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; also included the film on its list of &quot;the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. Xan Brooks, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Film Season, chose the film as the eighth &quot;best arthouse film of all time&quot;. He described it as &quot;an opulent family saga, by turns bawdy, stark and strange&quot; with a rare abundance of &quot;indelible supporting characters&quot;. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 23 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s readers&#x27; poll on its list of &quot;40 greatest foreign films of all time&quot;. The film was Voted at No. 44 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; was 84th among critics and 16th among directors. In the earlier 2002 version of the list, the film ranked 35th among critics and 19th among directors. Also in 2002, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine invited several critics to make a list of the best films of last 25 years and &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; was ranked at number three. In 2012 the film was voted at number five on the 25 best Swedish films of all-time list by a poll of 50 film critics and academics conducted by film magazine FLM. In 2018, the film was ranked 28th in BBC&#x27;s list of The 100 greatest foreign language films. In 2022 edition of Sight &amp; Sound&#x27;s &quot;Greatest films of all time&quot; list the film ranked 53rd in the director&#x27;s poll.

&quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 45 reviews, with a weighted average of 9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Ingmar Bergman conveys the sweep of childhood with a fastidious attention to detail and sumptuous insight into human frailty in &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, a masterwork that crystalizes many of the directors&#x27; preoccupations into a familial epic&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 100 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film received six Academy Award nominations, winning four, including Best Foreign Language Film. It also received the third highest number of nominations of 1984, after &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; and &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (both released in 1983). The four wins was the most any foreign-language film had received at the Academy Awards to date until it tied the record with &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon &quot; (2000), &quot;Parasite&quot; (2019) and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (2022). &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; marked the third and final time Bergman won Best Foreign Language Film, after &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (1960) and &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (1961). Bergman did not personally attend the ceremony, while working on a stage production in Munich, so his award was accepted by his wife Ingrid von Rosen and Jörn Donner. The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at 1983 Venice Film Festival. It also won the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics Award for Best Foreign Film.

==Legacy==
After ostensibly retiring from directing, Bergman completed &quot;After the Rehearsal&quot; in 1984. Bergman also conceived of a biographical project following his parents Erik and Karin Åkerblom, and in a press conference in August 1989, announced he planned a production that could be considered a follow-up to &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; and his 1987 autobiography &quot;The Magic Lantern&quot;. The resulting 1991–92 miniseries and film &quot;The Best Intentions&quot; was directed by Bille August and won the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. Bergman selected Bille August as director on condition that &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; actress Pernilla Wallgren star as Bergman&#x27;s mother; she did under the name Pernilla August. Critic Vincent Canby also identified Ingmar&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Children&quot;, directed by Daniel Bergman and released in 1992, as &quot;a continuation&quot; of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; and &quot;The Best Intentions&quot;, and questioned if Ingmar had truly retired. Whereas Ingmar&#x27;s recollections of Erik Bergman are damning in &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, his study of his father is &quot;far more forgiving&quot; in &quot;The Best Intentions&quot; and &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Children&quot;. After &quot;The Best Intentions&quot;, Pernilla August played Ingmar&#x27;s mother twice more, in the 1996 &quot;Private Confessions&quot; and 1997 &quot;In the Presence of a Clown&quot;.

Following Bergman&#x27;s death in 2007, PostNord Sverige decided to honour the director with a postage stamp depicting him directing &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;. In the two decades following the release, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; decorations were also common in Swedish businesses at Jul. In 2017, Hallwyl Museum also exhibited costumes from &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; and other Bergman films.

Stefan Larsson directed a stage adaptation of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; for the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which traveled to Uppsala City Theater in 2012. It played at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., in 2013. In 2010, stage adaptations also played in Finland, directed by Maria Lundström and Tiina Puumalainen, and Norway, where it was the biggest box office success in the National Theatre&#x27;s history. Later, Stephen Beresford wrote an adaptation for The Old Vic in London, directed by Max Webster and starring Penelope Wilton. It was scheduled to debut February 2018.

The film has exercised considerable influence on subsequent filmmaking, not only in Sweden. South Korean director Bong Joon-ho has listed it as one of his favourite films, and stated that it has &quot;the most beautiful ending to a feature film career in the history of cinema&quot;. French director Arnaud Desplechin frequently cites &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; as a critical touchstone for his own career, and has labelled his own &quot;La Vie des Morts&quot; as &quot;a complete rip-off of that film&quot;. He noted that &quot;I saw Fanny and Alexander and then I became a director. Before, I was a technician, and after that film, I became a director.&quot; &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; is also listed as a favourite by filmmakers Barry Jenkins and Akira Kurosawa.

<text>Newton Wesley Rowell, (November 1, 1867 – November 22, 1941) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, judge, and lay leader in the Methodist Church. Rowell led the Ontario Liberal Party from 1911 to 1917 and put forward a platform advocating temperance. Rowell&#x27;s Liberals failed to oppose the Whitney government&#x27;s passage of Regulation 17 which restricted the teaching of the French language in schools and alienated the province&#x27;s French-Canadian minority.

==Life and career==
Rowell was born in London Township, Ontario. He ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1900 federal election but was defeated in York East. Returning to his law practice, Rowell was made King&#x27;s Counsel in 1902. He became senior partner in his law firm (Rowell, Reid, and Wood) and had a prominent legal career.

He returned to politics in 1911. Though not a candidate, he was a prominent campaigner supporting the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier during the 1911 federal election. Rowell spoke across Ontario to promote both Laurier&#x27;s plan for a Canadian Navy and the trade reciprocity agreement that had been negotiated between the federal government and the United States against the opposition of prominent Liberal business leaders, who feared that free trade would be extended to manufacturing.

Later that year, Rowell was chosen to lead the Ontario Liberal Party, despite not having a seat in the legislature, after the incumbent leader, Alexander Grant MacKay, was forced to resign shortly before the beginning of that year&#x27;s election campaign. He was elected to the legislature in the 1911 provincial election (representing Oxford North) and became Leader of the Opposition.

In 1917, Rowell, a supporter of conscription during World War I, left the Ontario legislature and broke with Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberal Party of Canada to join the national Unionist government of Sir Robert Borden as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. He was appointed to Borden&#x27;s government as President of the Privy Council of Canada in October 1917 and was also made vice-chairman of the government&#x27;s War Committee, which gave him primary responsibility for organizing the war effort and enforcing conscription. He went on to win a seat in the House of Commons as the Unionist MP for Durham in the December 1917 federal election.

Rowell attended meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet in London, England, along with other senior Canadian ministers. In 1919, he was given added responsibilities as Canada&#x27;s first Minister of Health. Rowell declined to join the government of Borden&#x27;s successor, Arthur Meighen, in 1920, and he did not run for re-election to parliament in 1921.

After the war, Rowell served as a Canadian delegate to the League of Nations and became involved in international affairs. He also helped lead the Methodists into a merger with Presbyterians to form the United Church of Canada.

As a lawyer, Rowell had one of the strongest litigation practices in Toronto, arguing many cases before the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including &quot;Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot;, better known as the Persons Case. In 1903, he had founded the firm that is now known as McMillan LLP. In 1929, he argued and won the Persons Case, concerning whether women were eligible for appointment to the Canadian Senate. The Supreme Court of Canada said that they were not, but Rowell successfully appealed the case to the Privy Council in London in a landmark decision for female equality in Canada.

Rowell served as president of the Ontario Bar Association from 1927 to 1930 and as national president of the Canadian Bar Association from 1932 to 1934. In 1936, he was appointed Chief Justice of Ontario.

He is also noted for being the first chair of the 1937 Rowell–Sirois Commission into Dominion-Provincial economic relations and for being a founding leader of the United Church of Canada. Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; it had &quot;ow&quot; as in &quot;now&quot; – row-ELL.

His daughter Mary wed Harry Jackman in 1930. As a result, Rowell was the maternal grandfather of former Lieutenant Governor of Ontario Hal Jackman and former Senator Nancy Ruth.

<doc id="487303" wikidata="Q115124801" url="?curid=487303" title="User-Agent header">
<text>In computing, the User-Agent header is an HTTP header intended to identify the user agent responsible for making a given HTTP request. Whereas the character sequence codice_1 comprises the name of the header itself, the header value that a given user agent uses to identify itself is colloquially known as its user agent string. The user agent for the operator of a computer used to access the Web has encoded within the rules that govern its behavior the knowledge of how to negotiate its half of a request-response transaction; the user agent thus plays the role of the client in a client–server system. Often considered useful in networks is the ability to identify and distinguish the software facilitating a network session. For this reason, the User-Agent HTTP header exists to identify the client software to the responding server.

== Use in client requests== 

When a software agent operates in a network protocol, it often identifies itself, its application type, operating system, device model, software vendor, or software revision, by submitting a characteristic identification string to its operating peer. In HTTP, SIP, and NNTP protocols, this identification is transmitted in a header field &quot;User-Agent&quot;. Bots, such as Web crawlers, often also include a URL and/or e-mail address so that the Webmaster can contact the operator of the bot.

In HTTP, the &quot;user agent string&quot; is often used for content negotiation, where the origin server selects suitable content or operating parameters for the response. For example, the user agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. The concept of content tailoring is built into the HTTP standard in RFC 1945 &quot;for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations&quot;.

The user agent string is one of the criteria by which Web crawlers may be excluded from accessing certain parts of a website using the Robots Exclusion Standard (&quot;robots.txt&quot; file).

As with many other HTTP request headers, the information in the user agent string contributes to the information that the client sends to the server, since the string can vary considerably from user to user.

=== Format for human-operated web browsers ===

The user agent string format is currently specified by section 10.1.5 of HTTP Semantics. The format of the user agent string in HTTP is a list of product tokens (keywords) with optional comments. For example, if a user&#x27;s product were called WikiBrowser, their user agent string might be &quot;WikiBrowser/1.0 Gecko/1.0&quot;. The &quot;most important&quot; product component is listed first.

The parts of this string are as follows:

* product name and version (&quot;WikiBrowser/1.0&quot;)
* layout engine and version (&quot;Gecko/1.0&quot;)

During the first browser war, many web servers were configured to send web pages that required advanced features, including frames, to clients that were identified as some version of Mozilla only. Other browsers were considered to be older products such as Mosaic, Cello, or Samba, and would be sent a bare bones HTML document.

For this reason, most Web browsers use a user agent string value as follows:

For example, Safari on the iPad has used the following:

 Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405

The components of this string are as follows:

* &quot;Mozilla/5.0&quot;: Previously used to indicate compatibility with the Mozilla rendering engine.
* &quot;(iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us)&quot;: Details of the system in which the browser is running.
* &quot;AppleWebKit/531.21.10&quot;: The platform the browser uses.
* &quot;(KHTML, like Gecko)&quot;: Browser platform details.
* &quot;Mobile/7B405&quot;: This is used by the browser to indicate specific enhancements that are available directly in the browser or through third parties. An example of this is Microsoft Live Meeting which registers an extension so that the Live Meeting service knows if the software is already installed, which means it can provide a streamlined experience to joining meetings.

Before migrating to the Chromium code base, Opera was the most widely used web browser that did not have the user agent string with &quot;Mozilla&quot; (instead beginning it with &quot;Opera&quot;). Since July 15, 2013, Opera&#x27;s user agent string begins with &quot;Mozilla/5.0&quot; and, to avoid encountering legacy server rules, no longer includes the word &quot;Opera&quot; (instead using the string &quot;OPR&quot; to denote the Opera version).

=== Format for automated agents (bots) ===

Automated web crawling tools can use a simplified form, where an important field is contact information in case of problems. By convention the word &quot;bot&quot; is included in the name of the agent. For example:

 Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)

Automated agents are expected to follow rules in a special file called &quot;robots.txt&quot;.

=== Encryption strength notations ===

Web browsers created in the United States, such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, previously used the letters U, I, and N to specify the encryption strength in the user agent string. Until 1996, when the United States government allowed encryption with keys longer than 40 bits to be exported, vendors shipped various browser versions with different encryption strengths. &quot;U&quot; stands for &quot;USA&quot; (for the version with 128-bit encryption), &quot;I&quot; stands for &quot;International&quot; the browser has 40-bit encryption and can be used anywhere in the world and &quot;N&quot; stands (&quot;de facto&quot;) for &quot;None&quot; (no encryption). Following the lifting of export restrictions, most vendors supported 256-bit encryption.

== User agent spoofing == 
The popularity of various Web browser products has varied throughout the Web&#x27;s history, and this has influenced the design of websites in such a way that websites are sometimes designed to work well only with particular browsers, rather than according to uniform standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Websites often include code to detect browser version to adjust the page design sent according to the user agent string received. This may mean that less-popular browsers are not sent complex content (even though they might be able to deal with it correctly) or, in extreme cases, refused all content. Thus, various browsers have a feature to &quot;cloak&quot; or &quot;spoof&quot; their identification to force certain server-side content. For example, the Android browser identifies itself as Safari (among other things) in order to aid compatibility.

Other HTTP client programs, like download managers and offline browsers, often have the ability to change the user agent string.

A result of user agent spoofing may be that collected statistics of Web browser usage are inaccurate.

== User agent sniffing ==
&quot;User agent sniffing&quot; is the practice of websites showing different or adjusted content when viewed with certain user agents. An example of this is Microsoft Exchange Server 2003&#x27;s Outlook Web Access feature. When viewed with Internet Explorer 6 or newer, more functionality is displayed compared to the same page in any other browsers. User agent sniffing is considered poor practice, since it encourages browser-specific design and penalizes new browsers with unrecognized user agent identifications. Instead, the W3C recommends creating standard HTML markup, allowing correct rendering in as many browsers as possible, and to test for specific browser features rather than particular browser versions or brands.

Websites intended for display by mobile phones often rely on user agent sniffing, since mobile browsers often differ greatly from each other.

== Deprecation of User-Agent header ==

In 2020, Google announced that they would be freezing parts of the User-Agent header in their Chrome browser since it was no longer being used to determine browser capabilities and instead mainly being used for passive browser fingerprinting. Google stated that a new feature called Client Hints would replace the functionality of the user agent string.

Starting with Chrome 113, released in April 2023, the User-Agent header was partially frozen. The user-agent in newer version of Chrome would remain static except for the digits that represented the major version of the browser being used.

=== Browser misidentification ===
Starting with Firefox 110 released in February 2023, Mozilla announced it would temporarily freeze portions of the browser&#x27;s user agent string at version 109. This was done due to several websites incorrectly recognizing a development version of the browser (which identified itself by the string codice_2) as the deprecated Internet Explorer 11 (which reports codice_3). This version spoofing was stopped for Firefox 120 onwards, as only browsers identifying themselves as 110 through 119 were observed to be affected by the issue.

<text>Information geometry is an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of differential geometry to study probability theory and statistics. It studies statistical manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds whose points correspond to probability distributions.

== Introduction ==

Historically, information geometry can be traced back to the work of C. R. Rao, who was the first to treat the Fisher matrix as a Riemannian metric. The modern theory is largely due to Shun&#x27;ichi Amari, whose work has been greatly influential on the development of the field.

Classically, information geometry considered a parametrized statistical model as a Riemannian, conjugate connection, statistical, and dually flat manifolds. Unlike usual smooth manifolds with tensor metric and Levi-Civita connection, these take into account conjugate connection, torsion, and Amari-Chentsov metric. All presented above geometric structures find application in information theory and machine learning. For such models, there is a natural choice of Riemannian metric, known as the Fisher information metric. In the special case that the statistical model is an exponential family, it is possible to induce the statistical manifold with a Hessian metric (i.e a Riemannian metric given by the potential of a convex function). In this case, the manifold naturally inherits two flat affine connections, as well as a canonical Bregman divergence. Historically, much of the work was devoted to studying the associated geometry of these examples. In the modern setting, information geometry applies to a much wider context, including non-exponential families, nonparametric statistics, and even abstract statistical manifolds not induced from a known statistical model. The results combine techniques from information theory, affine differential geometry, convex analysis and many other fields. One of the most perspective information geometry approaches find applications in machine learning. For example, the developing of information-geometric optimization methods (mirror descent and natural gradient descent). 

The standard references in the field are Shun’ichi Amari and Hiroshi Nagaoka&#x27;s book, &quot;Methods of Information Geometry&quot;, and the more recent book by Nihat Ay and others. A gentle introduction is given in the survey by Frank Nielsen. In 2018, the journal &quot;Information Geometry&quot; was released, which is devoted to the field.

<text>A weak base is a base that, upon dissolution in water, does not dissociate completely, so that the resulting aqueous solution contains only a small proportion of hydroxide ions and the concerned basic radical, and a large proportion of undissociated molecules of the base.

==pH, Kb, and Kw==
Bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the solution is said to have a pH greater than 7.0 at standard conditions, potentially as high as 14 (and even greater than 14 for some bases). The formula for pH is:
:formula_1
Bases are proton acceptors; a base will receive a hydrogen ion from water, H2O, and the remaining H+ concentration in the solution determines pH. A weak base will have a higher H+ concentration than a stronger base because it is less completely protonated than a stronger base and, therefore, more hydrogen ions remain in its solution. Given its greater H+ concentration, the formula yields a lower pH value for the weak base. However, pH of bases is usually calculated in terms of the OH− concentration. This is done because the H+ concentration is not a part of the reaction, whereas the OH− concentration is. The pOH is defined as:

:formula_2

If we multiply the equilibrium constants of a conjugate acid (such as NH4+) and a conjugate base (such as NH3) we obtain:

:formula_3

As formula_4 is just the self-ionization constant of water, we have formula_5

Taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation yields:

:formula_6

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1, we obtain:

:formula_7

With pOH obtained from the pOH formula given above, the pH of the base can then be calculated from formula_8, where pKw = 14.00.

A weak base persists in chemical equilibrium in much the same way as a weak acid does, with a base dissociation constant (Kb) indicating the strength of the base. For example, when ammonia is put in water, the following equilibrium is set up:

:formula_9

A base that has a large Kb will ionize more completely and is thus a stronger base. As shown above, the pH of the solution, which depends on the H+ concentration, increases with increasing OH− concentration; a greater OH− concentration means a smaller H+ concentration, therefore a greater pH. Strong bases have smaller H+ concentrations because they are more fully protonated, leaving fewer hydrogen ions in the solution. A &quot;smaller&quot; H+ concentration means a &quot;greater&quot; OH− concentration and, therefore, a greater Kb and a greater pH.

NaOH (s) (sodium hydroxide) is a stronger base than (CH3CH2)2NH (l) (diethylamine) which is a stronger base than NH3 (g) (ammonia). As the bases get weaker, the smaller the Kb values become.
==Percentage protonated==
As seen above, the strength of a base depends primarily on pH. To help describe the strengths of weak bases, it is helpful to know the percentage protonated-the percentage of base molecules that have been protonated. A lower percentage will correspond with a lower pH because both numbers result from the amount of protonation. A weak base is less protonated, leading to a lower pH and a lower percentage protonated.

The typical proton transfer equilibrium appears as such:

:formula_10

B represents the base.

:formula_11

In this formula, [B]initial is the initial molar concentration of the base, assuming that no protonation has occurred.

==A typical pH problem==
Calculate the pH and percentage protonation of a .20 M aqueous solution of pyridine, C5H5N. The Kb for C5H5N is 1.8 x 10−9.

First, write the proton transfer equilibrium:

:formula_12

:formula_13

The equilibrium table, with all concentrations in moles per liter, is

This means .0095% of the pyridine is in the protonated form of C5H5NH+.

==Examples==
* Alanine
* Ammonia, NH3
* Methylamine, CH3NH2
* Ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH

==Simple Facts==
*An example of a weak base is ammonia. It does not contain hydroxide ions, but it reacts with water to produce ammonium ions and hydroxide ions.
*The position of equilibrium varies from base to base when a weak base reacts with water. The further to the left it is, the weaker the base.
*When there is a hydrogen ion gradient between two sides of the biological membrane, the concentration of some weak bases are focused on only one side of the membrane. Weak bases tend to build up in acidic fluids. Acid gastric contains a higher concentration of weak base than plasma. Acid urine, compared to alkaline urine, excretes weak bases at a faster rate.

<doc id="487318" wikidata="Q567712" url="?curid=487318" title="League of the Three Emperors">
<text>The League of the Three Emperors or Union of the Three Emperors () was an alliance between the German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires, from 1873 to 1887. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took full charge of German foreign policy from 1870 to his dismissal in 1890. His goal was a peaceful Europe, based on the balance of power. Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria-Hungary, France, and Russia would crush Germany. If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands. The solution was to ally with two of the three. In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance of the Kaisers of Germany and Austria-Hungary and the Tsar of Russia. Together they would control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control. It aimed at neutralizing the rivalry between Germany&#x27;s two neighbors by an agreement over their respective spheres of influence in the Balkans and at isolating Germany&#x27;s enemy, France. The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck&#x27;s solution was to give Austria predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas.

The first League of the Three Emperors was in effect from 1873 to 1878. A second one was established June 18, 1881, and lasted for three years. It was renewed in 1884 but lapsed in 1887. Both alliances ended because of continued strong conflicts of interest between Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. The second treaty provided that no territorial changes should take place in the Balkans without prior agreement and that Austria could annex Bosnia and Herzegovina when it wished; in the event of war between one party and a great power not party to the treaty, the other two parties were to maintain friendly neutrality.

Bismarck was able to temporarily preserve ties with Russia in the Reinsurance Treaty of 1887; but, after his dismissal, this treaty was not renewed, and a Franco-Russian alliance developed.

== First agreement (1873) ==

On 22 October 1873, Bismarck negotiated an agreement between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. The alliance sought to resurrect the Holy Alliance of 1815 and act as a bulwark against radical sentiments that the rulers found unsettling. It was preceded by the Schönbrunn Convention, signed by Russia and Austria–Hungary on 6 June 1873.

== Policy ==

Bismarck often led the League as it assessed challenges, centred on maintaining the balance of power among the states involved and Europe at large. The cornerstone of his political philosophy included preserving the status quo and avoiding war. Despite German victory in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, violence remained fresh in the new state&#x27;s memory and made Germany reluctant to antagonize France but keen as ever to limit its power.

According to the coalition, radical socialist bodies like the First International represented one of the other key threats to regional stability and dominance. The League actively opposed the expansion of its influence.

The League also met crisis in the Eastern Europe, where Bulgarian unrest elicited violent reaction from the Ottoman forces there, which, in turn, met with horror from observing states. The account of the insurrection from an Englishman, Sir Edwin Pears, describes the gruesome atrocities and reveals British surprise at their extent.

== First dissolution (1878) ==

The collective initially disbanded in 1878 over territorial disputes in the Balkans as Austria-Hungary feared that Russian support for Serbia might ultimately ignite irredentist passions in the Slav populations. Russian authorities, likewise, feared insurrection if a Pan-Slavist movement gained too much power.

The body&#x27;s first conclusion in 1879 gave way to the defensive Dual Alliance between Austria-Hungary and Germany to counter potential Russian aggression. In 1882, Italy was included in a second agreement, the Triple Alliance, but the Triple Alliance never replaced the Dual Alliance, which remained in effect.

==Revival (1881–1887)==

The Treaty of Berlin (1878) made Russia feel cheated of its gains in the Russo-Turkish War. Its key role in European diplomacy was not, however, forgotten by Bismarck. A more formal Three Emperors&#x27; Alliance was concluded on 18 June 1881. It lasted for three years, and was renewed at Skierniewice in 1884, but lapsed in 1887. Both alliances ended because of conflicts between Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. To preserve a common understanding with Russia, Germany signed the mutual Reinsurance Treaty in 1887.

Although the Russians considered it humiliating and prevented them using their Black Sea Fleet elsewhere, the closure of the Straits to foreign warships, included in the treaties of 1881 and 1884, meant there was little reason to maintain their fleet in the Black Sea.

<text>Dravograd (; ) is a small town in northern Slovenia, close to the border with Austria. It is the seat of the Municipality of Dravograd. It lies on the Drava River at the confluence with the Meža and the Mislinja. It is part of the traditional Slovenian provinces of Carinthia and the larger Carinthia Statistical Region.

==History==

From 976 onwards the Dravograd area was part of the Duchy of Carinthia. The German name &quot;Unterdrauburg&quot; denoted the place where the Drava River left Carinthia and flowed into the neighbouring Duchy of Styria. It corresponded with Oberdrauburg up the river at Carinthia&#x27;s western border with the County of Tyrol. The name Dravograd was invented during the Slovene national revival in the 19th century and was inspired by the Serbo-Croatian language, as the term &#x27;grad&#x27; does not mean &#x27;city, town&#x27; in Slovene, but &#x27;castle&#x27;. Previously, the local Slovene name of the town was &quot;Traberk&quot;, a derivative of the German name &quot;Drauburg&quot;. The 19th century was a period of national awakening of the Carinthian Slovenes, and also of the rise of competing nationalisms: Slovene and German.

After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918, the whole area south of Dravograd was occupied by the Slovene volunteer forces of Major Franjo Malgaj, acting in the name of the newly established State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The town of Dravograd itself however remained in the hands of the volunteers acting in the name of the German-Austrian rump state. In mid-December 1918, Dravograd was seized by the volunteer forces of Slovene General Rudolf Maister. Per the 1919 Treaty of Saint Germain, Dravograd became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (the later Yugoslavia).

In the interwar period, the area of Dravograd witnessed an important process of industrialization. In the 1930s, social tensions grew as the consequence of the world economic crisis, as did the tensions between the small ethnic German minority and the Slovene-speaking majority. In the late 1930s, the Nazi movement started penetrating the German community in Dravograd, triggering the reaction of the Slovene majority. Physical violence between the pro-Nazi organization and the local section of the Sokol movement were common. In 1939 and in 1940, two mass anti-Nazi rallies were held in the municipality of Dravograd, organized by patriotic and nationalist Slovene organizations, mostly of left-wing orientation.

In April 1941, after the Invasion of Yugoslavia, Dravograd was occupied by Wehrmacht forces and incorporated into the Carinthian &quot;Reichsgau&quot; of Nazi Germany. The use of the Slovene language was prohibited, all Slovene organizations were abolished, and numerous Slovenes were deported to central Germany or to the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia. Local Slovene political activists were either executed or deported to Nazi concentration camps. In July 1941, the local artist Franjo Golob organized an underground anti-Nazi resistance cell, which was however soon discovered. Violent repression followed, which hindered the further development of anti-German resistance in this area. In mid-1943, the Yugoslav Partisans resistance movement started taking roots in the Dravograd area, which grew stronger by 1944, despite the brutal repressions of the Nazi authorities. Upon the German Instrument of Surrender and the nearby Battle of Poljana on 14/15 May 1945, the whole area was controlled by the Partisans.

In the communist period, the Dravograd area further developed its industrial capacities. During the Ten Day War of Slovenian independence in June and July 1991, some fighting took place in the Dravograd area.

==Sights==

Ruins of the old Dravograd castle (also referred to as &quot;Castrum Trahburck&quot;) overlook the town from the hill above the area of old market town. The castle was built in 1161 and in possession of Ortlof Trušenjski and his heirs until 1278. Afterwards, owners of the castle frequently changed (e.g., the Habsburgs in 1355, the Counts of Celje in 1387, and again the Habsburgs in 1456).

The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to the late 14th century. It was rebuilt in 1520 and in 1621. The current church is Baroque with a characteristic onion dome on its belfry. A second church in the town is dedicated to Saint Vitus and is a late 12th-century Romanesque building.

Lake Dravograd () is a reservoir upstream from the hydroelectric power plant, between Dravograd and Črneče. It is an important natural habitat included in Natura 2000.

==Transportation==
The Dravograd railway station is on the &quot;Drautalbahn&quot; railway line from Maribor to Innichen (San Candido) in Italy, opened in 1863. Highway No. 3 leading from Maribor to the Austrian border runs through the town, where highway No. 10-10 to Celje branches off.

==Dravograd Hydroelectric Power Plant==

The power plant on the Drava River was built by the Germans during the Second World War, between 1941 and 1944. It started operating in 1944 with two vertical Kaplan turbines. It was the first pier-type power plant in Europe (along with a similar plant in Lavamünd, built in the same period). In April 1945, the plant was bombed and damaged by Allied air strikes. Renovation started after the war, with the first turbine becoming operational in December 1945 and the second in January the next year. Renovation ended in 1955, when the third turbine was added.

Refurbishment commenced in 1994, increasing the net capacity to 26.2 MW. Today the power plant can generate 142 million kWh of electricity annually, with an 8.9 m available head. Four 24 m wide spillways have a total spilling capacity of up to 5400 m3/s of water. For comparison, the highest water flows since construction of the power plant, measured during the 2012 floods, were 2570 m3/s. Three turbine piers are placed among the spillways. The plant reservoir is 10.2 km long and stretches up to the higher power plant at Lavamünd, Austria. It contains 5.6 million m3 of water.

The power plant is one of eight power plants on the Drava River in Slovenia and is managed by the company Dravske Elektrarne Maribor.

<doc id="487329" wikidata="Q4390851" url="?curid=487329" title="IBM 7950 Harvest">
<text>The IBM 7950, also known as Harvest, was a one-of-a-kind adjunct to the Stretch computer which was installed at the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Built by IBM, it was delivered in 1962 and operated until 1976, when it was decommissioned. Harvest was designed to be used for cryptanalysis.

==Development==
In April 1958, the final design for the NSA-customized version of IBM&#x27;s Stretch computer had been approved, and the machine was installed in February 1962. The design engineer was James H. Pomerene, and it was built by IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York. Its electronics (fabricated of the same kind of discrete transistors used for Stretch) were physically about twice as big as the Stretch to which it was attached. Harvest added a small number of instructions to Stretch, and could not operate independently.

An evaluation conducted by the NSA found that Harvest was more powerful than the best commercially available machine by a factor of 50 to 200, depending on the task.

==Architecture==

The equipment added to the Stretch computer consisted of the following special peripherals:
* IBM 7951 — Stream coprocessor
* IBM 7952 — High-performance core storage
* IBM 7955 — Magnetic tape system, also known as TRACTOR
* IBM 7959 — High-speed I/O exchange

With the stream processing unit, Harvest was able to process 3 million characters a second.

The TRACTOR tape system, part of the HARVEST system, was unique for its time. It included six tape drives, which handled tape in cartridges, along with a library mechanism that could fetch a cartridge from a library, mount it on a drive, and return it to the library. The transfer rates and library mechanism were balanced in performance such that the system could read two streams of data from tape, and write a third, for the entire capacity of the library, without any time wasted for tape handling.

==Programming==
Harvest&#x27;s most important mode of operation was called &quot;setup&quot; mode, in which the processor was configured with several hundred bits of information and the processor then operated by streaming data from memory — possibly taking two streams from memory — and writing a separate stream back to memory. The two streams could be combined, used to find data in tables, or counted to determine the frequency of various values. A value could be anything from one to sixteen contiguous bits, without regard to alignment, and the streams could be as simple as data laid out in memory, or data read repeatedly, under the control of multiple nested &quot;do&quot;-loop descriptors, which were interpreted by the hardware.

Two programming languages, Alpha and Beta (not be confused with Simula-inspired BETA programming language) were designed for programming it, and IBM provided a compiler for the former around the time the machine was delivered.

==Usage==
One purpose of the machine was to search text for key words from a watchlist. From a single foreign cipher system, Harvest was able to scan over seven million decrypts for any occurrences of over 7,000 key words in under four hours.

The computer was also used for codebreaking, and this was enhanced by an early distributed networking system codenamed Rye, which allowed remote access to Harvest. According to a 1965 NSA report, &quot;RYE has made it possible for the agency to locate many more potentially exploitable cryptographic systems and &#x27;bust&#x27; situations. Many messages that would have taken hours or days to read by hand methods, if indeed the process were feasible at all, can now be &#x27;set&#x27; and machine decrypted in a matter of minutes&quot;. Harvest was also used for decipherment of solved systems; the report goes on to say that, &quot;Decrypting a large batch of messages in a solved system [is] also being routinely handled by this system&quot;. The Harvest-RYE system became an influential example for computer security; a 1972 review identified NSA’s RYE as one of two “examples of early attempts at achieving ‘multi-level’ security.”

Harvest remained in use until 1976, having been in operation at the NSA for fourteen years. Part of the reason for its retirement was that some of the mechanical components of TRACTOR had worn beyond use, and there was no practical way to replace them. IBM declined to re-implement the architecture in a more modern technology.

<doc id="487333" wikidata="Q4761392" url="?curid=487333" title="Andy Thompson (Canadian politician)">
<text>Andrew Ernest Joseph Thompson (14 December 1924 – 3 February 2016) was a Canadian politician. Thompson was leader of the Ontario Liberal Party and later served as a Senator. He was elected as the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the west-end Toronto Dovercourt electoral district in 1959. He was elected the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s leader in 1964. His physical health began to fail in late 1966 forcing him to retire as the Liberal leader. He was appointed to the Canadian Senate in 1967, forcing him to resign his provincial seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He attracted media attention in 1997 and 1998 for making few appearances in the Senate over the past decade. His health issues never really went away, and gave that as his explanation for his truancy. He became the first Senator ever stripped of his office staff, salary and expense account for truancy, in 1998. A month later he resigned in order to receive his pension.

==Early life and career==
Andrew was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1924, the fourth child of Joseph Stanley Thompson and his wife Edith Florence Magill. Andrew and his two older brothers, Robert and Hudson, were educated at Monkton Combe School in England from 1936 to 1939, with Andrew first attending Monkton Combe Junior School from 1936 to 1938. After emigrating to Canada, he attended Oakwood Collegiate in Toronto. He was a student at the University of Toronto from 1942 to 1943 until he joined the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II as a Sub-Lieutenant, serving aboard minesweepers. He was discharged after the war in 1946 with the rank of Lieutenant. He completed his education at Queen&#x27;s University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947. He received a Master of Social Work from the University of British Columbia in 1949. He worked in the federal civil service, becoming Regional Liaison Officer for the Prairie Provinces, Canadian Federal Department of Citizenship &amp; Immigration and serving as a special assistant to federal Liberal leader Lester B. Pearson. In 1959, he married Amy Riisna whom he met at a Liberal conference in Couchiching. They lived in downtown Toronto on St. George Street and raised one daughter.

==Provincial politics==
Thompson was first elected as a Member of Provincial Parliament in the 1959 Ontario election as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party in the Toronto riding of Dovercourt. Thompson was close friends with federal Liberal cabinet minister Walter Gordon having organized his federal candidacy in the federal equivalent of Thompson&#x27;s Dovercourt constituency.

He made his name in the Ontario legislature in March 1964 when he assailed Attorney-General Fred Cass over Bill 99, which would have amended the Police Act to allow the Ontario Police Commission to interrogate individuals in secret leading to it being derisively referred to as the &quot;Police State Bill&quot;. The scandal forced Cass to resign and enhanced Thompson&#x27;s reputation considerably. He was elected leader of the party in the fall of 1964 when he defeated Charles Templeton on the sixth ballot.

Thompson suffered a physical breakdown in late 1966 as a result of his involvement in an automobile accident in which two elderly women were seriously injured. He also had existing health problems, specifically a heart murmur, combined with exhaustion, high blood pressure and a lengthy bout of influenza. On the advice of doctors, Thompson resigned as leader in November 1966 without ever having led his party in an election. He was succeeded as Liberal leader by Robert Nixon.

==Senator==
Thompson was named to the Senate of Canada on 6 April 1967. His time in the Senate was relatively uneventful. He kept a low profile but in 1997 was exposed as having the worst attendance of any currently sitting Senator. Thompson claimed he was unable to attend Senate sessions due to illness, but continued to draw his salary by showing up for a few days at the beginning of each session. At the time Senate rules stated that as long as a Senator did not miss two complete consecutive sittings and proper medical certificates were provided for absences, they would be in good standing.

With growing media attention on Thompson&#x27;s absences from the red chamber, the Reform Party made Thompson&#x27;s absence a &quot;cause celebre&quot;, repeatedly pointing to the fact that he was living in Mexico. Reform Members of Parliament hired a Mariachi band and served burritos in the lobby of the Senate to draw attention to the issue. Thompson was held up as an example of why the Senate needed to be reformed.

The resulting furore led to Thompson being expelled from the Liberal caucus on 19 November 1997. On 12 December 1997, Senator Colin Kenny moved that he be commanded to appear before the Senate to explain his absence. On 16 December they voted in favour of the Kenny motion. A subcommittee reported on 19 February recommending that Thompson be found in contempt and that he be suspended for the remainder of the session. The Senate voted to strip him of his privileges and other benefits. Later they found Thompson in contempt of the upper chamber for not complying with orders to return to Ottawa to explain his attendance record, resulting in the suspension of his salary and tax-free expense allowance. In December 1997, Thompson lost his Senate office and other privileges. Some Senators disagreed with the suspension, arguing that it was too lenient and that he should have been expelled from the chamber instead. He resigned on 23 March 1998, 20 months ahead of his scheduled retirement but was still able to collect a pension.

The media&#x27;s exposure of Thompson&#x27;s attendance and his colleagues&#x27; tolerance of it led the Senate to toughen the rules governing its members and sick leave while also increasing the financial penalties for missing too many sittings during a session. Thompson died on 3 February 2016, at the age of 91 after years of declining health.

<text>African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is the variety of English natively spoken, particularly in urban communities, by most working- and middle-class African Americans and some Black Canadians. Having its own unique grammatical, vocabulary, and accent features, AAVE is employed by middle-class Black Americans as the more informal and casual end of a sociolinguistic continuum. However, in formal speaking contexts, speakers tend to switch to more standard English grammar and vocabulary, usually while retaining elements of the vernacular (non-standard) accent. AAVE is widespread throughout the United States, but is not the native dialect of all African Americans, nor are all of its speakers African American.

Like most varieties of African-American English, African-American Vernacular English shares a large portion of its grammar and phonology with the regional dialects of the Southern United States, and especially older Southern American English, due to the historical enslavement of African Americans primarily in that region.

Mainstream linguists see only minor parallels between AAVE, West African languages, and English-based creole languages, instead most directly tracing back AAVE to diverse non-standard dialects of English as spoken by the English-speaking settlers in the Southern Colonies and later the Southern United States. However, a minority of linguists argue that the vernacular shares so many characteristics with African creole languages spoken around the world that it could have originated as a creole or semi-creole language, distinct from the English language, before undergoing decreolization.

== Origins ==
African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) may be considered a dialect, ethnolect, and sociolect. While it is clear that there is a strong historical relationship between AAVE and earlier Southern U.S. dialects, the origins of AAVE are still a matter of debate.

The presiding theory among linguists is that AAVE has always been a dialect of English, meaning that it originated from earlier English dialects rather than from English-based creole languages that &quot;decreolized&quot; back into English. In the early 2000s, Shana Poplack provided corpus-based evidence (evidence from a body of writing) from isolated enclaves in Samaná and Nova Scotia peopled by descendants of migrations of early AAVE-speaking groups (see Samaná English) that suggests that the grammar of early AAVE was closer to that of contemporary British dialects than modern urban AAVE is to other current American dialects, suggesting that the modern language is a result of divergence from mainstream varieties, rather than the result of decreolization from a widespread American creole.

Linguist John McWhorter maintains that the contribution of West African languages to AAVE is minimal. In an interview on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, McWhorter characterized AAVE as a &quot;hybrid of regional dialects of Great Britain that slaves in America were exposed to because they often worked alongside the indentured servants who spoke those dialects...&quot; According to McWhorter, virtually all linguists who have carefully studied the origins of AAVE &quot;agree that the West African connection is quite minor.&quot;

However, a creole theory, less accepted among linguists, posits that AAVE arose from one or more creole languages used by African captives of the Atlantic slave trade, due to the captives speaking many different native languages and therefore needing a new way to communicate among themselves and with their captors. According to this theory, these captives first developed what are called pidgins: simplified mixtures of languages. Since pidgins form from close contact between speakers of different languages, the slave trade would have been exactly such a situation. Creolist John Dillard quotes, for example, slave ship captain William Smith describing the sheer diversity of mutually unintelligible languages just in The Gambia. By 1715, an African pidgin was reproduced in novels by Daniel Defoe, in particular, &quot;The Life of Colonel Jacque&quot;. In 1721, Cotton Mather conducted the first attempt at recording the speech of slaves in his interviews regarding the practice of smallpox inoculation. By the time of the American Revolution, varieties among slave creoles were not quite mutually intelligible. Dillard quotes a recollection of &quot;slave language&quot; toward the latter part of the 18th century: &quot;Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; but me fall asleep, massa, and no wake &#x27;til you come...&quot; Not until the time of the American Civil War did the language of the slaves become familiar to a large number of educated Whites. The abolitionist papers before the war form a rich corpus of examples of plantation creole. In &quot;Army Life in a Black Regiment&quot; (1870), Thomas Wentworth Higginson detailed many features of his Black soldiers&#x27; language. Opponents of the creole theory suggest that such pidgins or creoles existed but simply died out without directly contributing to modern AAVE.

== Phonology ==

Many pronunciation features distinctly set AAVE apart from other forms of American English (particularly, General American). McWhorter argues that what truly unites all AAVE accents is a uniquely wide-ranging intonation pattern or &quot;melody&quot;, which characterizes even the most &quot;neutral&quot; or light African-American accent. A handful of multisyllabic words in AAVE differ from General American in their stress placement so that, for example, &quot;police&quot;, &quot;guitar&quot;, and &quot;Detroit&quot; are pronounced with initial stress instead of ultimate stress. The following are phonological differences in AAVE vowel and consonant sounds.

Final consonant groups or clusters in AAVE have been examined as evidence of the systematic nature of this language variety, governed by specific rules. Additionally, such analyses have been utilized to bolster arguments concerning the historical origins of AAVE. Consonant cluster reduction is a phonological process where a final consonant group or cluster, consisting of two consonant sounds, is simplified or reduced to a single consonant sound. The analysis of consonant cluster reduction in AAVE assumes that, initially, final clusters are present and intact in the language. For example, the word &quot;tes&quot; in AAVE originates from &quot;test&quot;, with the final &quot;t&quot; of the &quot;st&quot; consonant cluster being deleted in word-final position.

===Vowels===

*Cot-caught merger: AAVE accents have traditionally resisted the cot-caught merger spreading nationwide, with pronounced and traditionally pronounced , though now often or , with the latter pronunciation most prominent in the Northeastern U.S. However, there is evidence of AAVE speakers exhibiting the cot-caught merger in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Charleston, South Carolina; Florida and Georgia; and in parts of California. 
**African American Vowel Shift: Early 2000s research has shown that the resistance to the cot-caught merger may continue to be reinforced by the fronting of , linked through a chain shift of vowels to the raising of the , , and perhaps vowels. This chain shift of vowels is called the &quot;African American Shift&quot;. However, this shift is not universal to all AAVE speakers; it is mostly exhibited by speakers who live in all the states along the Mississippi River and in North Carolina.
*Reduction of certain diphthong forms to monophthongs, in particular, the vowel is monophthongized to except before voiceless consonants (this is also found in most White Southern dialects). The vowel sound in ( in General American) is also monophthongized, especially before , making &quot;boil&quot; indistinguishable from &quot;ball&quot;.
*Pin–pen merger: Before nasal consonants (, , and ), and are both pronounced like , making &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;pin&quot; homophones. This is also present in other dialects, particularly of the South. The pin-pen merger is not universal in AAVE, and there is evidence for unmerged speakers in California, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
* The distinction between the and vowels before liquid consonants is frequently reduced or absent, making &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;fill&quot; homophones (&quot;fill&quot;–&quot;feel&quot; merger). and also merge, making &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;pour&quot; homophones (&quot;cure&quot;–&quot;force&quot; merger).

===Consonants===
* Word-final devoicing of , , and , whereby, for example, &quot;cub&quot; sounds similar to &quot;cup&quot;, though these words may retain the longer vowel pronunciations that typically precede voiced consonants, and devoicing may be realized with debuccalization (where is realized as , for instance)
* AAVE speakers may not use the fricatives (the &quot;th&quot; in &quot;&quot;th&quot;in&quot;) and (the &quot;th&quot; of &quot;&quot;th&quot;en&quot;) that are present in other varieties of English. The phoneme&#x27;s position in a word determines its exact sound.
** Word-initially, is normally the same as in other English dialects (so &quot;thin&quot; is ); in other situations, it may move forward in the mouth to (Th-fronting).
** Word-initially, is (so &quot;this&quot; may be ). In other situations, may move forward to .
* Realization of final &quot;ng&quot; , the velar nasal, as the alveolar nasal (assibilation, alveolarization) in function morphemes and content morphemes with two or more syllables like &quot;-ing&quot;, e.g. &quot;tripping&quot; is pronounced as (&quot;trippin&quot;) instead of the standard . This change does not occur in one-syllable content morphemes such as &quot;sing&quot;, which is and not . However, &quot;singing&quot; is . Other examples include &quot;wedding&quot; → , &quot;morning&quot; → , &quot;nothing&quot; → . Realization of as in these contexts is commonly found in many other English dialects.
* A marked feature of AAVE is final consonant cluster reduction. This is a process by which the pronunciations of consonant clusters at the end of certain words are reduced to pronouncing only the first consonant of that cluster. There are several phenomena that are similar but are governed by different grammatical rules. This tendency has been used by creolists to compare AAVE to West African languages since such languages do not have final clusters.
** Final consonant clusters that are homorganic (have the same place of articulation) and share the same voicing are reduced. For instance, &quot;test&quot; is pronounced since and are both voiceless; &quot;hand&quot; is pronounced (alternatively or ), since and are both voiced; but &quot;pant&quot; is unchanged, as it contains both a voiced and a voiceless consonant in the cluster. It is the plosive ( and ) in these examples that is lost rather than the fricative; the nasal is also either preserved completely or lost with preservation of nasality on the preceding consonant. Speakers may carry this declustered pronunciation when pluralizing so that the plural of test is rather than . The clusters , are also affected.
** More often, word-final , , and are reduced, again with the final element being deleted rather than the former.
** For younger speakers, also occurs in words that other varieties of English have so that, for example, &quot;street&quot; is pronounced .
** Clusters ending in or exhibit variation in whether the first or second element is deleted.
* Similarly, final consonants may be deleted (although there is a great deal of variation between speakers in this regard). Most often, and are deleted. As with other dialects of English, final and may reduce to a glottal stop. Nasal consonants may be lost while nasalization of the vowel is retained (e.g., &quot;find&quot; may be pronounced ). More rarely, and may also be deleted.
* Use of metathesized forms like &quot;aks&quot; for &quot;ask&quot; or &quot;graps&quot; for &quot;grasp&quot;.
* General non-rhotic behavior, in which the rhotic consonant is typically dropped when not followed by a vowel; it may also manifest as an unstressed or the lengthening of the preceding vowel. Intervocalic may also be dropped, e.g. General American &quot;story&quot; () can be pronounced , though this doesn&#x27;t occur across morpheme boundaries. may also be deleted between a consonant and a back rounded vowel, especially in words like &quot;throw&quot;, &quot;throat&quot;, and &quot;through&quot;.
**The level of AAVE rhoticity is likely somewhat correlated with the rhoticity of White speakers in a given region; in 1960s research, AAVE accents tended to be mostly non-rhotic in Detroit, whose White speakers are rhotic, but completely non-rhotic in New York City, whose White speakers are also often non-rhotic.
* is often vocalized in patterns similar to that of (though never between vowels) and, in combination with cluster simplification (see above), can make homophones of &quot;toll&quot; and &quot;toe&quot;, &quot;fault&quot; and &quot;fought&quot;, and &quot;tool&quot; and &quot;too&quot;. Homonymy may be reduced by vowel lengthening and by an off-glide .

=== &quot;Deep&quot; phonology ===
McWhorter discusses an accent continuum from &quot;a &#x27;deep&#x27; Black English through a &#x27;light&#x27; Black English to standard English,&quot; saying the sounds on this continuum may vary from one African American speaker to the next or even in a single speaker from one situational context to the next. McWhorter regards the following as rarer features, characteristic only of a deep Black English but which speakers of light Black English may occasionally &quot;dip into for humorous or emotive effect&quot;:
* Lowering of before , causing pronunciations such as for &quot;thing&quot; (sounding something like &quot;thang&quot;).
* Word-medially and word-finally, pronouncing as (so for &quot;month&quot; and for &quot;mouth&quot;), and as (so for &quot;smooth&quot; and for &quot;rather&quot;. This is called &quot;th&quot;-fronting. Word-initially, is (so &quot;those&quot; and &quot;doze&quot; sound nearly identical). This is called &quot;th&quot;-stopping. In other words, the tongue fully touches the top teeth.
*Glide deletion (monophthongization) of all instances of , universally, resulting in (so that, for example, even &quot;rice&quot; may sound like &quot;rahss&quot;.)
*Full gliding (diphthongization) of , resulting in (so that &quot;win&quot; may sound like &quot;wee-un&quot;).
*Raising and fronting of the vowel of words like &quot;strut, mud, tough&quot;, etc. to something like .

==Grammar==
=== Tense and aspect ===
Although AAVE does not necessarily have the simple past-tense marker of other English varieties (that is, the &quot;-ed&quot; of &quot;work&quot;ed&quot;&quot;), it does have an optional tense system with at least four aspects of the past tense and two aspects of the future tense. The dialect uses several &quot;Tense-Aspect-Mood markers&quot; integrated into the predicate phrase, including &quot;gon&quot; or &quot;gonna&quot; (future tense), &quot;done&quot; (completive aspect), &quot;be&quot; (habitual aspect, state of being), and &quot;been&quot; (durative aspect). These can function separately or in conjunction.
Syntactically, &quot;I bought it&quot; is grammatical, but &quot;done&quot; (always unstressed, pronounced as ) is used to emphasize the completed nature of the action.

&quot;I&#x27;ma&quot;, also commonly spelled &quot;Imma&quot;, is pronounced as . Harvard professor Sunn m&#x27;Cheaux claims &quot;I&#x27;ma&quot; originated in the Gullah language (an English creole), which uses &quot;a-&quot; instead of &quot;-ing&quot; for this type of verb inflection. Alternatively, other sources suggest it is a further shortening of &quot;I&#x27;m gonna&quot;.

As phase auxiliary verbs, &quot;been&quot; and &quot;done&quot; must occur as the first auxiliary; when they occur as the second, they carry additional aspects:
: &quot;He been done working&quot; means &quot;he finished work a long time ago&quot;.
: &quot;He done been working&quot; means &quot;until recently, he worked over a long period of time&quot;.

The latter example shows one of the most distinctive features of AAVE: the use of &quot;be&quot; to indicate that performance of the verb is of a habitual nature. In most other American English dialects, this can only be expressed unambiguously by using adverbs such as &quot;usually&quot;.

This aspect-marking form of &quot;been&quot; or BIN is stressed and semantically distinct from the unstressed form: &quot;She BIN running&quot; (&#x27;She has been running for a long time&#x27;) and &quot;She been running&quot; (&#x27;She has been running&#x27;). This aspect has been given several names, including &quot;perfect phase&quot;, &quot;remote past&quot;, and &quot;remote phase&quot; (this article uses the third). As shown above, &quot;been&quot; places action in the distant past. However, when &quot;been&quot; is used with stative verbs or gerund forms, &quot;been&quot; shows that the action began in the distant past and that it is continuing now. suggests that a better translation when used with stative verbs is &quot;for a long time&quot;. For instance, in response to &quot;I like your new dress&quot;, one might hear &quot;Oh, I been had this dress&quot;, meaning that the speaker has had the dress for a long time and that it isn&#x27;t new.

To see the difference between the simple past and the gerund when used with &quot;been&quot;, consider the following expressions:
: &quot;I been bought her clothes&quot; means &quot;I bought her clothes a long time ago&quot;.
: &quot;I been buying her clothes&quot; means &quot;I&#x27;ve been buying her clothes for a long time&quot;.

Auxiliaries in African American Vernacular English are related in a typical pattern. They can be grouped into negative forms and affirmative forms for each of the words. For example, &quot;had&quot; is an affirmative form, while &quot;hatn&quot; is the corresponding negative form. These same auxiliaries can be used to mark sentences for the anterior aspect. As another example, &quot;was&quot; marks type 1 sentences, which by default are present tense, and transforms them to a time before the present. Take, for instance, &quot;She at home&quot;: the word &quot;was&quot; can be inserted to mark this sentence, making the marked equivalent &quot;She was at home&quot;. Auxiliaries such as these also have opposing negative and affirmative forms. In its negative form the auxiliary verb &quot;wadn&quot; is used to convey the opposing affirmative form.
* &quot;Finna&quot; corresponds to &quot;fixing to&quot; in other varieties. It is also written &quot;fixina&quot;, &quot;fixna&quot;, &quot;fitna&quot;, and &quot;finta&quot;.
In addition to these, &quot;come&quot; (which may or may not be an auxiliary) may be used to indicate speaker indignation, such as in &quot;Don&#x27;t come acting like you don&#x27;t know what happened and you started the whole thing&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t try to act as if you don&#x27;t know what happened, because you started the whole thing&quot;).

The irrealis mood marker &quot;be&quot;, having no intrinsic tense refers to a current or future event that may be less than real.

Modals

The dialect uses double modals, such as &quot;might could&quot;, which can function in various ways, including as adverbs.

=== Negation ===
Negatives are formed differently from most other varieties of English:

* Use of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; as a general negative marker. As in other English dialects, it can be used instead of &quot;am not&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot;, and &quot;hasn&#x27;t.&quot; However, some speakers of AAVE distinctively use &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; instead of &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot;, or &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; (e.g., &quot;I ain&#x27;t know that&quot;). &quot;Ain&#x27;t&quot; had its origins in common English but became increasingly stigmatized since the 19th century. See also &quot;amn&#x27;t&quot;.
* Negative concord, also called &quot;double negation&quot;, as in &quot;I didn&#x27;t go nowhere&quot;; if the sentence is negative, all negatable forms are negated. This contrasts with standard written English convention, which interprets a double negative to mean a positive (although this was not always so; see double negative).
* In a negative construction, an indefinite pronoun such as &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot; can be inverted with the negative verb particle for emphasis (e.g., &quot;Don&#x27;t nobody know the answer&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t nothing going on&quot;.)

While AAVE shares these with Creole languages, use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Samaná English, and the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that negation was inherited from nonstandard colonial English.

=== Other grammatical characteristics ===
* The copula &quot;be&quot; in the present tense is often dropped, as in Russian, Hungarian, Arabic, and other languages. For example: &quot;You crazy&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re crazy&quot;) or &quot;She my sister&quot; (&quot;She&#x27;s my sister&quot;). This extends to questions: &quot;Who you?&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;re you?&quot;) and &quot;Where you at?&quot; (&quot;Where are you (at)?&quot;). This has been sometimes considered a Southern U.S. regionalism, though it is most frequent in Black speech. On the other hand, &quot;is&quot; can be included for emphasis: &quot;Yes, she &quot;is&quot; my sister&quot;. The general rules are:
** Only the forms &quot;is&quot; and &quot;are&quot; (of which the latter is often replaced by &quot;is&quot;) can be omitted; &quot;am&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, and &quot;were&quot; are not deleted.
** These forms cannot be omitted when they would be pronounced with stress in Standard American (whether or not the stress serves specifically to impart an emphatic sense to the verb&#x27;s meaning).
** These forms can be omitted only when the corresponding form in standard English can be contracted. For example, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where he is&quot; cannot be reduced to *&quot;I don&#x27;t know where he,&quot; and correspondingly Standard English forbids the contraction *&quot;I don&#x27;t know where he&#x27;s&quot;. Compare the acceptable forms &quot;I don&#x27;t know where he at&quot; in AAVE, paralleling &quot;I don&#x27;t know where he&#x27;s at&quot; in Standard English.
** Other minor conditions also apply.
* Verbs are uninflected for number and person: there is no &quot;-s&quot; ending in the present-tense third-person singular. Example: &quot;She write poetry&quot; (&quot;She writes poetry&quot;). AAVE &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; for standard English &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; comes from this, unlike in some other dialects which use &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; for standard English &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; but &quot;does&quot; when not in the negative. Similarly, AAVE &quot;was&quot; is used for standard English &quot;was&quot; and &quot;were.&quot;
* The genitive -&#x27;s ending may or may not be used. Genitive case is inferrable from adjacency. This is similar to many creoles throughout the Caribbean. Many language forms throughout the world use an unmarked possessive; it may here result from a simplification of grammatical structures. Example: &quot;my momma sister&quot; (&quot;my mother&#x27;s sister&quot;).
* The words &quot;it&quot; and &quot;they&quot; denote existence of something, equivalent to standard English&#x27;s &quot;there is&quot; or &quot;there are&quot;.
* Word order in questions: &quot;Why they ain&#x27;t growing?&quot; (&quot;Why aren&#x27;t they growing?&quot;) and &quot;Who the hell she think she is?&quot; (&quot;Who the hell does she think she is?&quot;) lack the inversion of most other forms of English. Because of this, there is also no need for the &quot;auxiliary &quot;do&quot;&quot;.
* Relative clauses which modify a noun in the object or predicate nominative position are not obligatorily introduced by a relative pronoun.

== Vocabulary ==
AAVE shares most of its lexicon with other varieties of English, particularly that of informal and Southern dialects; for example, the relatively recent use of &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;. As statistically shown by Algeo (1991: 3–14), the main sources for new words are combining, shifting, shortening, blending, borrowing, and creating. However, it has also been suggested that some of the vocabulary unique to AAVE has its origin in West African languages, but etymology is often difficult to trace, and without a trail of recorded usage, the suggestions below cannot be considered proven.

Early AAVE and Gullah contributed a number of words of African origin to the American English mainstream, including &quot;gumbo&quot;, &quot;goober&quot;, &quot;yam&quot;, and &quot;banjo&quot;.

Compounding in AAVE is a very common method in creating new vocabulary. The most common type of compounding is the noun–noun combination. There is also the adjective–noun combination, which is the second most commonly occurring type of combination found in AAVE slang. AAVE also combines adjectives with other adjectives, less frequently, but more so than in standard American English.

AAVE has also contributed slang expressions such as &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;hip&quot;. In many cases, the postulated etymologies are not recognized by linguists or the Oxford English Dictionary, such as &quot;to dig&quot;, &quot;jazz&quot;, &quot;tote&quot;, and &quot;bad-mouth&quot;, a calque from Mandinka. African American slang is formed by words and phrases that are regarded as informal. It involves combining, shifting, shortening, blending, borrowing, and creating new words. African American slang possess all of the same lexical qualities and linguistic mechanisms as any other language. AAVE slang is more common in speech than it is in writing.

AAVE also has words that either are not part of most other American English dialects or have strikingly different meanings. For example, there are several words in AAVE referring to White people that are not part of mainstream American English; these include &quot;gray&quot; as an adjective for Whites (as in &quot;gray dude&quot;), possibly from the color of Confederate uniforms; and &quot;paddy&quot;, an extension of the slang use for &quot;Irish&quot;. &quot;Red bone&quot; is another example of this, usually referring to light skinned African Americans.

&quot;Ofay&quot;, which is pejorative, is another general term for a White person; it might derive from the Ibibio word &quot;afia&quot;, which means &quot;light-colored&quot;, from the Yoruba word &quot;ofe&quot;, spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger. However, most dictionaries simply say its etymology is unknown.

&quot;Kitchen&quot; refers to the particularly curly or kinky hair at the nape of the neck, and &quot;siditty&quot; or &quot;seddity&quot; means &quot;snobbish&quot; or &quot;bourgeois&quot;.

AAVE has also contributed many words and phrases to other varieties of English, including &quot;chill out&quot;, &quot;main squeeze&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;funky&quot;, and &quot;threads&quot;.

==Influence on other dialects==
African-American Vernacular English has influenced the development of other dialects of English. The AAVE accent, New York accent, and Spanish-language accents have together yielded the sound of New York Latino English, some of whose speakers use an accent indistinguishable from an AAVE one. AAVE has also influenced certain Chicano accents and Liberian Settler English, directly derived from the AAVE of the original 16,000 African Americans who migrated to Liberia in the 1800s. In the United States, urban youth participating in hip-hop culture or marginalized as ethnic minorities are also well-studied in adopting African-American Vernacular English, or prominent elements of it: for example, Southeast-Asian Americans embracing hip-hop identities.

== Variation ==
===Urban versus rural variations===
The first studies on the African-American Vernacular English took place in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, to name a few. These studies concluded that the AAVE was homogeneous, which means that it was spoken roughly the same way everywhere around the country. Later, sociolinguists would realize that these cities lacked the influence of the rural south; the early studies had not considered the representation of the Southern United States, which caused AAVE studies to change. To make those changes, newer studies took into consideration new areas of the country, including the rural South.

AAVE began as mostly rural and Southern, yet today is mostly urban and nationally widespread, and its more recent urban features are now even diffusing into rural areas. Urban AAVE alone is intensifying with the grammatical features exemplified in these sentences: &quot;He be the best&quot; (intensified equative &quot;be&quot;), &quot;She be done had her baby&quot; (resultative &quot;be done&quot;), and &quot;They come hollerin&quot; (indignant &quot;come&quot;). On the other hand, rural AAVE alone shows certain features too, such as: &quot;I was a-huntin&quot; (&quot;a&quot;-prefixing); &quot;It riz above us&quot; (different irregular forms); and &quot;I want for to eat it&quot; (&quot;for to&quot; complement). Using the word &quot;bees&quot; even in place of &quot;be&quot; to mean &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot; in standard English, as in the sentence &quot;That&#x27;s the way it bees&quot; is also one of the rarest of all deep AAVE features today, and most middle-class AAVE speakers would recognize the verb &quot;bees&quot; as part of only a deep &quot;Southern&quot; or &quot;country&quot; speaker&#x27;s vocabulary.

===Local variations===
There are at least 10 distinct regional accents in AAVE, and regional patterns of pronunciation and word choice appear on social media.

Regional variation in AAVE does not pattern with other regional variation in North American English, which broadly follows East-to-West migration patterns, but instead patterns with the population movements during the Great Migration, resulting in a broadly South-to-North pattern, albeit with founder effects in cities that already had existing African American populations at the beginning of the Great Migration.
There is no vowel for which the geographic variation in AAVE patterns with that of White American English.

New York City AAVE incorporates some local features of the New York accent, including its high vowel; meanwhile, conversely, Pittsburgh AAVE may merge this same vowel with the vowel, matching the cot-caught merger of White Pittsburgh accents, though AAVE accents traditionally do not have the cot-caught merger. Memphis, Atlanta, and Research Triangle AAVE incorporates the vowel raising and vowel lowering associated with White Southern accents. Memphis and St. Louis AAVE are developing, since the mid-twentieth century, an iconic merger of the vowels in and, making &quot;there&quot; sound like &quot;thurr&quot;.
Californian AAVE often lacks a cot-caught merger, especially before nasals.

== Social perception and context ==
African-American Vernacular suffers from persistent stigma and negative social evaluation in American culture. By definition, as a vernacular dialect of English, AAVE has not received the social prestige of a standard dialect, leading to widespread and long-standing misconceptions that it is a grammatically inferior form of English, which linguistics research of the twentieth century has debunked. However, educators and social commentators traditionally have advocated for eliminating AAVE usage through the public-education system for a variety of reasons, ranging from a continued belief that AAVE is intrinsically deficient to arguments that its use, by being stigmatized in certain social contexts, is socially limiting. Some of the harshest criticism of AAVE or its use has come from African Americans themselves. A conspicuous example was the &quot;Pound Cake speech&quot;, in which Bill Cosby criticized some African Americans for various social behaviors, including the way they talked.

Educators traditionally have attempted to eliminate AAVE usage through the public education system, perceiving the dialect as grammatically defective. In 1974, the teacher-led Conference on College Composition and Communication issued a position statement affirming students&#x27; rights to their own dialects and the validity of all dialects. Mainstream linguistics has long agreed with this view about dialects. In 1979, a judge ordered the Ann Arbor School District to find a way to identify AAVE speakers in the schools and to &quot;use that knowledge in teaching such students how to read standard English.&quot; In 1996, Oakland Unified School District made a controversial resolution for AAVE, which was later called &quot;Ebonics&quot;. The Oakland School board approved that Ebonics be recognized as a language independent from English (though this particular view is not endorsed by linguists), that teachers would participate in recognizing this language, and that it would be used in theory to support the transition from Ebonics to Standard American English in schools. This program lasted three years and then died off.

Although the distinction between AAVE and General American dialects is clear to most English speakers, some characteristics, notably double negatives and the omission of certain auxiliaries (see below) such as the &quot;has&quot; in &quot;has been&quot; are also characteristic of many colloquial dialects of American English. There is general uniformity of AAVE grammar, despite its vast geographic spread across the whole country. This may be due in part to relatively recent migrations of some African Americans out of the American South (see Great Migration and Second Great Migration) as well as to long-term racial segregation that kept these speakers living together in largely homogeneous communities.

<text>The FN P90 is a personal defense weapon chambered for the 5.7×28mm cartridge, also classified as a submachine gun, designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. Created in response to NATO requests for a replacement for 9×19mm Parabellum firearms, the P90 was designed as a compact but powerful firearm for vehicle crews, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces, and counter-terrorist groups.

Designed in conjunction with the FN Five-seven pistol and FN 5.7×28mm NATO ammunition, development of the weapon began in 1986, and production commenced in 1990, when it was known as the &quot;Project 9.0&quot; (from which the &quot;90&quot; in its name is derived), whereupon the 5.7×28mm ammunition was redesigned and shortened. A modified version of the P90 with a magazine adapted to use the new ammunition was introduced in 1993, and the Five-seven pistol was subsequently introduced as a companion weapon using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition.

Featuring a compact bullpup design with an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls, the P90 is an unconventional weapon with a futuristic appearance. Its design incorporates several innovations, such as a unique top-mounted magazine and FN&#x27;s small-caliber, high-velocity 5.7×28mm ammunition. Additional integrated features include interchangeable visible or infrared laser and tritium light sources.

The P90 is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, such as Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Greece, India, Malaysia, Poland, and the United States. In the United States, the P90 is in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. In the United States, the standard selective fire P90 is restricted to the military, law enforcement, or holders of certain Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs) with the Special Occupational Tax (SOT). Since 2005, a semi-automatic version with a longer barrel has been offered to civilian users as the &quot;PS90&quot;.

==History==
===Development===
The P90 and its 5.7×28mm ammunition were developed by the Belgian company FN Herstal in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and associated pistols and submachine guns. NATO called for two types of weapons chambered for a new cartridge—one a shoulder-fired weapon, and the other a handheld weapon. According to NATO, these new weapons, termed personal defense weapons (PDWs), were to provide &quot;personal protection in last-resort situations when the user is directly endangered by the enemy [...].&quot; In 1989, NATO published document &quot;D/296&quot;, outlining a number of preliminary specifications for these weapons:
* The new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, it was to be capable of penetrating body armor.
* The shoulder-fired personal defense weapon was to weigh less than , with a magazine capacity of at least 20 rounds.
* The handheld personal defense weapon (pistol) was to weigh less than , although a weight of was deemed desirable; it was to have a magazine capacity of at least 20 rounds.
* Both weapons were to be sufficiently compact to be carried hands-free on the user&#x27;s person at all times, whether in the cab of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft, and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.

FN Herstal was the first small arms manufacturer to respond to NATO&#x27;s requirement; FN started by developing a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, the P90, along with a small caliber, high velocity 5.7×28mm cartridge type. The original 5.7×28mm cartridge, called the &quot;SS90&quot;, went into production with the P90 in 1990. The SS90 propelled a 1.5 g (23 grain) plastic-core projectile from the P90 at a muzzle velocity of roughly .

Following the P90&#x27;s introduction, FN revised the 5.7×28mm ammunition. The new variation, designated the &quot;SS190&quot;, used a projectile shorter in length than that of the SS90. This allowed it to be used more conveniently in the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol, which was under development at that time. The SS190 projectile had a greater weight, and a more conventional construction with an aluminium and steel core. The first prototypes of the SS190 were created in 1992, and the design was finalized in 1993, replacing the SS90. A modified version of the P90, with a magazine adapted to use the shortened ammunition, was then introduced in the same year. Several special cartridge variations were developed, such as the L191 tracer round and the SB193 subsonic round for use with a sound-suppressed P90.

===NATO evolution===
In 2002 and 2003, NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge and the HK 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by German small arms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The results of the NATO tests were analyzed by a group formed of experts from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the group&#x27;s conclusion was that the 5.7×28mm was &quot;undoubtedly&quot; the more efficient cartridge; However, the German delegation and others rejected the NATO recommendation that 5.7×28mm be standardized, halting the standardization process indefinitely. As a result, both the 4.6×30mm and 5.7×28mm cartridges (and the associated weapons) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries, according to preference; the P90 is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 countries throughout the world. The 5.7x28mm was finally standardized by NATO in February 2021.

===Present===
Further development of the P90 led to the creation of the &quot;P90 TR&quot; model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) triple rail interface for mounting accessories. This model was introduced in late 1999 and continues to be offered alongside the standard P90. More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian shooters as the &quot;PS90&quot;, a semi-automatic carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.

==Design==
The P90 is a selective fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic rate of fire of around 850–1,100 rounds per minute. The weapon is chambered for FN&#x27;s 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped by means of a thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter&#x27;s support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing empty, or with a loaded 50-round magazine.

The P90 is notable for being fully ambidextrous—it can be operated by right or left-handed shooters with equal ease, and without making any modifications to the weapon. FN Herstal has described it as the &quot;first fully ambidextrous individual automatic weapon.&quot; The charging handle, magazine release and backup iron sights are symmetrically distributed on both sides of the weapon, and the firing selector is located directly at the foot of the trigger, where it can be operated from either side by the shooter&#x27;s trigger finger or support hand thumb. When fired, the P90 ejects spent cartridge casings downward through a chute located behind the grip, so spent cases are kept out of the shooter&#x27;s line of sight.
The P90 can be fitted with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a collapsing or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon&#x27;s smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter&#x27;s clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at the front end of the weapon&#x27;s frame to prevent the shooter&#x27;s hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon&#x27;s frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for storage of a cleaning kit.

The P90 was designed to have a length no greater than a man&#x27;s shoulder width, to allow it to be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon&#x27;s design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the trigger and alongside the shooter&#x27;s face so that there is no wasted space in the stock. The P90&#x27;s dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon&#x27;s frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of , a height of , and a width of .
The P90 requires minimal maintenance, and it can be disassembled quickly and easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90&#x27;s barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of . The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231 mm (1:9.1 in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.

The P90 uses an internal hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, located at the foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: &quot;S&quot; – safe, &quot;1&quot; – semi-automatic fire, and &quot;A&quot; – fully automatic fire. When set on &quot;A&quot;, the P90&#x27;s fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.

===Ammunition===


Particularly significant to the design of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0 g (93 grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory, compared to typical pistol ammunition.

One of the design intents for the standard 5.7×28mm cartridge type, the &quot;SS190&quot;, was that it has the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests that stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the P90, the 5.7×28mm SS190 has a muzzle velocity of roughly 716 m/s (2,350 ft/s, Mach 2) and can penetrate the NATO CRISAT vest or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at a range of . FN states an effective range of and a maximum range of for the 5.7×28mm cartridge when fired from the P90.

In testing conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 at a distance of exhibited an average penetration depth of in ballistic gelatin covered with a Level II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin, in tests conducted by Houston Police Department SWAT. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point (&quot;tumble&quot;) as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet&#x27;s terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.

The 5.7×28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, as well as the risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only , whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond , posing greater risk of collateral damage in the event of a miss. This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge&#x27;s intended applications, so the cartridge&#x27;s limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous. Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm weapons) is considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.

===Feeding===
The P90 uses a unique horizontally mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that contributes to the weapon&#x27;s compact profile and unusual appearance. &quot;U.S. Patent 4,905,394&quot; (&quot;Top mounted longitudinal magazine&quot;) was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90&#x27;s barrel, fitting flush with the top of the weapon&#x27;s frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is translucent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.

===Sights and accessories===

The P90 was originally equipped with the Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open &quot;T&quot; that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, and it can be used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided on each side of the reflex sight housing. The newest MC-10-80, designated as the MC-10-80 Electronic, no longer uses tritium for its night reticle. Instead, the normal reticle can be illuminated in green powered by a CR2032 battery, with eight different brightness settings. The illuminated reticle makes the sight more versatile in a variety of different conditions.

The P90 has provisions for mounting a number of different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech &quot;SP90&quot;, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of , a diameter of and a weight of . When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33 dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.

==Variants==
===P90===
====P90 TR====

The &quot;P90 TR&quot; (Triple Rail) model, also known as the &quot;flat-top,&quot; was introduced in late 1999. It features a receiver-mounted triple MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) rail interface system, or &quot;Triple Rail,&quot; for mounting accessories. Also, instead of the integrated reflex sight, this model uses standard tritium iron sights. There is one full-length accessory rail integrated into the top of the receiver, and two rail stumps are included on the sides of the receiver. The top rail will accept various optical sights with no tools or additional mounting hardware required, and the side rails serve to mount secondary accessories, such as tactical lights or laser aiming devices.

====P90 USG====
The &quot;P90 USG&quot; (United States Government) model is similar to the standard P90, except the reflex sight housing is aluminium, and the sight has a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) rail mount for attaching a different sight.

====P90 Laserex models====
The &quot;P90 LV&quot; (Laser Visible) and &quot;P90 IR&quot; (InfraRed) models, both of which were introduced in late 1995, have an integrated laser sight manufactured by Laserex Technologies in Australia. The &quot;P90 LV&quot; model projects an 8 mW visible laser intended to be used as a low-light shooting aid or for dissuasive effect, while the &quot;P90 IR&quot; model projects a 4.5 mW infrared laser that can only be seen with night vision equipment. Both laser systems are compact, consisting of a small, flat panel integrated into the front end of the weapon&#x27;s frame.

The Laserex P90 laser systems have a weight of , and they are activated by means of a green pressure switch located on the underside of the weapon&#x27;s pistol grip. The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: &quot;Off&quot; – disabled to prevent accidental activation, &quot;Training&quot; – low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or &quot;Combat&quot; – high intensity for maximum visibility. The Laserex P90 laser systems have a battery life of 250 hours when used on the &quot;Training&quot; setting, or a life of 50 hours when used on the &quot;Combat&quot; setting.

===PS90===
The PS90 is a semi-automatic carbine variant of the P90, intended for civilian shooters for personal protection and sporting use; it was introduced in 2005, and continues to be offered in several configurations. The PS90 will accept the standard 50-round P90 magazines, but the gun is supplied with a magazine that is blocked to a capacity of 10 or 30 rounds, allowing it to be sold in jurisdictions where magazine capacities are restricted by law.

In order to be legal for purchase by civilians without obtaining a tax stamp for a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR) as defined by the United States National Firearms Act, the PS90 carbine has an extended barrel and is semi-automatic, with a trigger pull of approximately . The lengthened barrel has eight rifling grooves, with a right-hand twist rate of 1:229 mm (1:9 in) and a rifled length of ; the muzzle is equipped with a fixed &quot;birdcage&quot; type flash suppressor.

Despite the added barrel length, the PS90 is relatively compact and lightweight, with an overall length of , and a weight of with a fully loaded 50-round magazine. Due to the added barrel length, the PS90 can achieve a muzzle velocity of up to with SS195LF ammunition, or up to with third-party ammunition.

====PS90 Standard====
The &quot;PS90 Standard&quot; is the current model of the PS90 offered by FN Herstal. It features a MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) rail fitted to the top of the receiver, which allows the shooter to mount their preferred optical sight. The rail includes a set of integrated iron sights, as backup in case the primary sight is damaged. As of 2019 the PS90 Standard is available with a black frame.

====PS90 SBR====
The &quot;PS90 SBR&quot; variant is functionally identical to the “PS90 Standard”, but instead of the extended 16 inch barrel, this variant retains the standard 10.5 inch barrel of its selective-fire counterpart, thus making it the ballistic equivalent, in semi-automatic only form. The PS90 SBR is not usually listed on FN Herstal&#x27;s website, but is offered commercially through third-party extensions. These are made either through factory standard layouts, or conversions made by swapping the barrel. This renders the weapon a “short barreled rifle”, and thus the required tax stamp is necessary in order to purchase and/or transfer it. The weapon is regulated as “Title II”, and special certification is required in most states. As with all factory standard PS90 receivers special welding is in place to complicate full auto conversion.

====PS90 TR====
The &quot;PS90 TR&quot; is now discontinued. It featured a &quot;Triple Rail&quot; receiver assembly identical to that of the P90 TR. The top of the receiver consisted of an MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) rail, allowing the shooter to mount their preferred optical sight. Two polymer side rails—one on each side of the receiver—were included for mounting secondary accessories, such as lasers or tactical lights. Like the PS90 Standard, the PS90 TR was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2013, the PS90 TR model is no longer listed by FNH USA.

====PS90 USG====

The &quot;PS90 USG&quot; is now discontinued. In the same fashion as the P90 USG, this model had an aluminium reflex sight housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle consisted of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which was joined by three posts that glowed red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight could be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame.

As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.

==Users==

Despite being originally intended as a defensive weapon for military personnel whose primary role is not fighting with small arms (such as vehicle drivers), most sales of the P90 have been to special forces and counter-terrorist groups who use it for offensive roles.

In 1997, suppressed P90s were used in combat by the Peruvian special forces group (&quot;Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales&quot;) in Operation Chavín de Huantar, the hostage rescue siege that ended the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. The operation was a success: all 14 MRTA revolutionaries were killed, and 71 hostages were rescued. The MRTA revolutionaries who had taken the hostages were equipped with body armor, but it was defeated by the Peruvian special forces&#x27; P90s. In 2011, P90s were used by Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war, and some of these examples were captured and used in the war by Libyan rebel forces.

By 2009, the P90 was in service with military and police forces in over 40 countries. In the United States, Houston Police Department was the first local law enforcement agency to adopt the P90, acquiring it for their SWAT team in 1999. In 2003, the Houston SWAT team became one of the first agencies in the country to use the weapon in a shootout. By 2009, the P90 was in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies in the United States, including the Secret Service and Federal Protective Service. In response, the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) added the P90 and PS90 to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law enforcement agencies to compete in the event using either weapon.

<text>5-Bromouracil (5-BrU, 5BrUra, or br5Ura) is a brominated derivative of uracil that acts as an antimetabolite or base analog, substituting for thymine in DNA, and can induce DNA mutation in the same way as 2-aminopurine. It is used mainly as an experimental mutagen, but its deoxyriboside derivative (5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine) is used to treat neoplasms.

5-BrU exists in three tautomeric forms that have different base pairing properties. The keto form (shown in the infobox) is complementary to adenine, so it can be incorporated into DNA by aligning opposite adenine residues during DNA replication (see below left). Alternatively, the enol (below right) and ion forms are complementary to guanine. This means that 5-BrU can be present in DNA either opposite adenine or guanine.

The three forms frequently interchange so base-pairing properties can become altered at any time. The result of this is that during a subsequent round of replication a different base is aligned opposite the 5-BrU residue. Further rounds of replication &#x27;fix&#x27; the change by incorporating a normal nitrogen base into the complementary strand.

Thus 5-BrU induces a point mutation via base substitution. This base pair will change from an A-T to a G-C or from a G-C to an A-T after a number of replication cycles, depending on whether 5-BrU is within the DNA molecule or is an incoming base when it is enolized or ionized.

<doc id="487354" wikidata="Q16959201" url="?curid=487354" title="Cover (telecommunications)">
<text>In telecommunications and tradecraft, cover is the technique of concealing or altering the characteristics of communications patterns for the purpose of denying an unauthorized receiver information that would be of value.

The purpose of cover is not to make the communication secure, but to make it look like noise, rendering it uninteresting and not worth analysis. Even if an attacker recognizes the communication as interesting, cover makes traffic analysis more difficult since he must crack the cover before he can find out to whom it is addressed.

Usually, the covered communication is also encrypted. In this way, enemies have no idea you sent a message; friends know you sent a message, but don&#x27;t know what you said; the intended recipient knows what you said. 

Technically, cover sometimes refers to the specific process of modulo two additions of a pseudorandom bit stream generated by a cryptographic device with bits from the control message.

<doc id="487356" wikidata="Q2306554" url="?curid=487356" title="Crevasse rescue">
<text>Crevasse rescue (or crevasse-extraction) is a set of techniques in mountaineering where climbers use their equipment to pull a climber, who has just fallen into a crevasse, to safety. Crevasse rescue is considered a core skill set in alpine climbing, but difficult to do efficiently. It is typically encountered by rope teams on glaciers.

When a climber falls into a crevasse, ideally the other rope team member(s) react quickly and self-arrest using their ice axes so they are not also dragged into the crevasse. After arresting, their first major task is to transfer some or all of the weight of the fallen climber—who is hanging in the crevasse—to a snow anchor (or other fixed anchor such as a deadman anchor or a snow bollard), which they do by using prussik knots or progress capture devices (PCDs) to transfer the rope from them onto the new fixed anchor.

Having transferred some or all of the weight of the fallen climber, the other team member(s) will assess the situation and try to communicate with the fallen climber. Even if the fallen climber is largely unharmed with no broken limbs, the narrow walls of the crevasse are very cold and hypothermia can develop quickly. They will also assess the level of force that the lip of the crevasse can withstand for any hauling, and they may reinforce the lip with clothing or spare equipment (e.g. an ice axe or ski poles) if needed. If the rope team had been using friction knots in the rope to help absorb any crevasse fall — they grab the lip — they must now decide how to get around these knots when hauling upwards (e.g. use a separate rope).

If the fallen climber can move and has prussik knots and/or ascenders, then they can jumar up the now fixed rope and effectively perform a self-rescue to the surface. Where the fallen climber is unable to do this due to injury, being constrained by the crevasse walls, or lack of skill and equipment, then the other climber(s) will have to haul the fallen climber up from the crevasse. For smaller teams, the other climber(s) may try to set up a pulley system using prussik knots, snow anchors, and climbing pulleys, to reduce the hauling effort, and ideally, a Z-pulley system that will give them a 3:1 mechanical advantage, however, there are many variations depending on the specific equipment and skill-level of the members. In very developed areas, such as the Mont Blanc Massif, rescue helicopters have mechanical winches to directly haul climbers — or skiers — from deep crevasses.

<doc id="487361" wikidata="Q12409417" url="?curid=487361" title="Military citadels under London">
<text>A number of military citadels are known to have been constructed underground in central London, dating mostly from the Second World War and the Cold War. Unlike traditional above-ground citadels, these sites are primarily secure centres for defence coordination.

A large network of tunnels exists below London for a variety of communications, civil defence and military purposes; however, it is unclear how these tunnels, and the various facilities linked to them, fit together, if at all. Even the number and nature of these facilities is unclear; only a few have been officially admitted to.

==Pindar==
The most important military citadel in central London is Pindar, or the Defence Crisis Management Centre. The bunker is located five floors underneath the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Main Building in Whitehall, in the space of an older bunker named the South Citadel. Construction took ten years and cost £126.3 million. Pindar became operational in 1992, two years before construction was complete. Computer equipment was much more expensive to install than originally estimated as there was very little physical access to the site. Pindar can house a maximum of 400 personnel and provides protection against conventional bombing, sabotage, biological and chemical attack, flooding, and the effects of blast, radiation, and the electromagnetic pulse from &quot;all but a direct hit or very near miss&quot; by nuclear weapons.

Pindar has two floors; the lower floor contains the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Joint Operations Centre, and the upper floor consists of:

* Government Emergency Rooms (comprising the Prime Minister, Secretaries of State, the Cabinet Secretary, and some Permanent Secretaries)
* An element of the Joint Intelligence Organisation
* A telecommunications secretariat and a Cabinet Office Communications Centre (COMCEN) element

Pindar is connected to Downing Street and the Cabinet Office by a tunnel under Whitehall; the tunnel predated the bunker and was already used as a conduit between the Cabinet Office and the MOD Main Building, with Downing Street access being added during Pindar&#x27;s construction. The tunnel can be used by government ministers to enter Pindar without risking the press attention, and subsequent damage to national morale, that would ensue if the bunker was openly entered and, as was the case when the bunker was used for meetings on the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, without the risk of encountering hostile demonstrations. When answering written questions about Pindar, which included a question on the extent of lift and staircase access to the bunker and on whether there was any connection to transport systems, then-Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley would say only that there were &quot;sufficient means of access and egress&quot; and denied that the bunker was connected to any transport system; he also said that there were means of leaving Pindar should the MOD Main Building collapse on top of it, but did not state the details of these.

Although Pindar is not open to the public, it has had some public exposure. Between September 2006 and April 2007, the British photographer David Moore carried out an extensive photographic survey of an underground facility that was widely believed (and strongly hinted) to be Pindar, with Moore stating in later years that Pindar was indeed the facility depicted in the photographs. The photographs, which were published as &quot;The Last Things&quot; in 2008 as well as being exhibited in 2008 and in 2009, show that the facility is stocked with items ranging from CBRN equipment to personal hygiene products. It has bunks for up to 100 military officers, politicians and civilians as well as communication facilities, a medical centre, and maps.

The bunker is named after the ancient Greek poet Pindar whose house was the only one left standing in Thebes following the city&#x27;s destruction in 335 BC.

==Admiralty Citadel==

The Admiralty Citadel, London&#x27;s most visible military citadel, is located just behind the Admiralty building on Horse Guards Parade. It was constructed in 1939 by the Ministry of Works with the architect W. A. Forsyth as a consultant. It was designed as a bomb-proof operations centre for the Admiralty, with foundations deep and a thick concrete roof. It is also linked by tunnels to government buildings in Whitehall.

Its brutal functionality speaks of a very practical purpose; in the event of a German invasion, it was intended that the building would become a fortress, with loopholed firing positions provided to fend off attackers. Sir Winston Churchill described it in his memoirs as a &quot;vast monstrosity which weighs upon the Horse Guards Parade&quot;. In 1955, a question was asked in the House of Commons about mitigating its harsh appearance. The Minister of Works, Nigel Birch, describing it as &quot;a hideous building&quot;, announced that the heavy gun positions were to be removed and that planting Virginia creeper (some sources identify the plants as Boston ivy) would help to mask the concrete walls. In the same debate, a suggestion by MP John Tilney that a variety of plants be used was rejected by the minister on the grounds that it would &quot;make it like an old-world tea garden&quot;. It became a Grade II listed building in December 1987.

In 1992 the Admiralty communications centre was established here as the stone frigate HMS &quot;St Vincent&quot;, which became MARCOMM COMCEN (St Vincent) in 1998. The Admiralty Citadel is still used today by the Ministry of Defence.

==Cabinet War Rooms==

The only central London citadel currently open to the public is the Cabinet War Rooms, located in Horse Guards Road in the basement of what is now HM Treasury. This was not a purpose-built citadel but was instead a reinforced adaptation of an existing basement built many years before.

The War Rooms were constructed in 1938 and were regularly used by Winston Churchill during World War II. However, the Cabinet War Rooms were vulnerable to a direct hit and were abandoned not long after the war. The Cabinet War Rooms were a secret to all civilians until their opening to the public in 1984. They are now a popular tourist attraction maintained by the Imperial War Museum.

The section of the War Rooms open to the public is in fact only a portion of a much larger facility. They originally covered three acres (1.2 hectares) and housed a staff of up to 528 people, with facilities including a canteen, hospital, shooting range and dormitories. The centrepiece of the War Rooms is the Cabinet Room itself, where Churchill&#x27;s War Cabinet met.

The Map Room is adjacent, from where the course of the war was directed. It is still in much the same condition as when it was abandoned, with the original maps still on the walls and telephones and other original artefacts on the desks. Churchill slept in a small bedroom nearby. There is a small telephone room (disguised as a toilet) down the corridor that provided a direct line to the White House in Washington DC, via a special scrambler in an annexe basement of Selfridges department store in Oxford Street.

An standby facility known as &quot;Paddock&quot; was also built but was only used for two War Cabinet meetings, and then only on an exercise basis, and was abandoned in 1944.

==Q-Whitehall and tunnel network==
Q-Whitehall is the name given to a communications facility under Whitehall.

The facility was built in a 12 ft (3.7 m) diameter tunnel during World War II, and extends under Whitehall. A similar facility was constructed in a tunnel that ran parallel to the Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly Line and was known as Trunks Kingsway (Kingsway Telephone Exchange). The project was known as &#x27;Post Office scheme 2845&#x27;. A detailed description, with photographs, was published just after the war in the January 1946 edition of &quot;The Post Office Electrical Engineers&#x27; Journal&quot;.

Sites equipped with unusual amounts of GPO/BT telecommunications plant are given a BT site engineering code. This site&#x27;s code was L/QWHI.

The site provided protected accommodation for the lines and terminal equipment serving the most important government departments, civil and military, to ensure the command and control of the war could continue despite heavy bombing of London.

At the northern end, a tunnel connects to a shaft up to the former Trafalgar Square tube station (now merged with Charing Cross station), and to the BT deep level cable tunnels which were built under much of London during the Cold War. At the southern end, an 8 ft (2.4 m) diameter extension (Scheme 2845A) connects to a shaft under Court 6 of the Treasury Building: this provided the protected route from the Cabinet War Room. This was known as Y-Whitehall. The tunnel was further extended (Scheme 2845B) to the Marsham Street Rotundas. This extension housed the &#x27;Federal&#x27; telephone exchange which had a dialling code of 333 from the public network. In the 1980s it housed Horseferry Tandem which provided a unified communications system for all government departments as well as the Palace of Westminster.

Access to the tunnel is gained via an 8 ft (2.4 m) lateral tunnel and a lift shaft in the nearby Whitehall telephone exchange in Craig&#x27;s Court. A further entrance is via the deep level portion of the Admiralty.

Spur tunnels, 5 ft (1.5 m) in diameter, were built to provide protected cable routes to the major service buildings either side of Whitehall.

The Whitehall tunnels appear to have been extended in the early 1950s. Some official documents refer to a Scheme 3245: this is the only numbered tunnel scheme that has never been officially revealed or located by researchers. Files in the National Archives which may relate to this have been closed for 75 years and will not be opened until the 2020s. The excavation work for Scheme 3245 was nearly exposed when Prudential Assurance sued the General Post Office in 1952 for damage to their Staple Inn premises; Prudential&#x27;s lawyers and experts visited the tunnels and received copies of the technical drawings, but secrecy around the excavation was otherwise maintained. Two years after the Prudential lawsuit, a D-Notice was issued for the tunnels.

The journalist Duncan Campbell managed to get into the tunnel network and described his exploration in the 19-26 December 1980 issue of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. He found more than thirty access shafts for the network as well as entrances to Q-Whitehall (below Trafalgar Square), various government department buildings (including Downing Street, the Cabinet Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Old War Office, the Admiralty, the Treasury, and the Department of the Environment), the old Cabinet War Rooms, and various telephone exchanges, and created a map of both this network and the deep level cable network based on his investigation. Those access shafts that could be readily entered by unauthorised individuals were promptly sealed up following the publication of Campbell&#x27;s article.

<doc id="487366" wikidata="Q827026" url="?curid=487366" title="Cover (philately)">
<text>In philately, the term cover pertains to the outside of an envelope or package with an address, typically with postage stamps that have been cancelled and is a term generally used among stamp and postal history collectors. The term does not include the contents of the letter or package, although they may add interest to the item if still present. Cover collecting plays an important role in postal history as many covers bear stamps, postmarks and other markings along with names and addresses all of which help to place a cover at a given time and place in history.

== History ==

The term originates from the practice of covering a letter by folding a separate sheet about it to physically protect it and prevent infringement of confidentiality. In the first half of the 19th century it became the fashion to cut the cover into a diamond or lozenge shape. This was the precursor of the version of the envelope known today. Its convenience and popularity led to the lozenge design being adopted for the special pre-paid postage envelopes and covers issued in 1840 after postal reforms were introduced by Rowland Hill and others.

A philatelic cover is an envelope or post card prepared with a stamp(s) and address and sent through the mail delivery system for the purpose of creating a collectible item.

==Categories==
There are several different basic categories for covers. Names for cover types is also terminology usually used by collectors of stamps and postal history. There exist a wide variety of covers that can fit into several basic categories. The categories begin with the most common types of collectible covers, such as first day covers or first flight covers. Sometimes there will be an area of overlap in the subject of categories. For example, there are &quot;First day covers&quot; that were also sent with mail aboard airplanes on &quot;First flight&quot; mail runs. &quot;Event&quot; covers can also include, &quot;First flights&quot;, or other types of covers. A military cover sent to a head of state can also be referred to as a &quot;Historic cover&quot;.

*A first day cover is typically an envelope with a postage stamp canceled on its first day of issue. The design or theme of the stamp may be printed on the cover to enhance its appeal to the philatelic community.
* An event cover celebrates an event or notes an anniversary.
* Stamp on cover. This is a cover that is collected as an example of a given stamp postally used on a cover, however older stamps with recent cancellations are usually philatelic (mailed with the intention of recovering and collecting the item).
* A pre-stamped cover is a cover that already has an imprinted stamp.
* First flight covers are those carried on an aircraft, usually authorized by a government or postal administration, for the first time on a particular route.
* A stampless cover is an envelope or folded outer sheet bearing an address and manuscript or ink-stamped postal markings without prepaid adhesive postage stamps, normally from the period before adhesive postage stamps became available or common in the mid-to-late 19th Century.
* Military covers can include a wide variety of subjects that may include first flight covers, and prisoner of war covers. Mail sent from an Army Post Office (APO) or a Navy Post Office (Fleet Post Office, FPO) are common types of military covers.
* Railroad covers is mail that was processed aboard special rail cars outfitted with an official post office where mail is processed en route to its general destination.
* Historical covers are those that have special historical significance above and beyond that of the average collectible cover. These can include mail sent by Kings, Presidents or other heads of state. If the historical cover is i.e. to or from a General in an Army the cover then can also be classified as a military cover. Names for cover categories are usually used as general reference in philately. If aspects of a cover (date+postmark, name+address) are referenced in a historical capacity the category of the cover may not even be mentioned.
* Cover fronts are covers where, for some known or unknown reason, only the front side of the cover is kept. These covers are fully collectable, but when selling them or describing them, it must be mentioned they are fronts only.
* Postage meter covers are typically commercial envelopes with postage meter prints. Besides collecting them by country, they can be collected by manufacturer of the metering machine and by topic of the advertisement slogans of the meter clichés.

Other specialty types of covers include &quot;Censored covers&quot; along with &quot;Blockade mail&quot;, &quot;Pony Express&quot; covers, &quot;Prisoner of war covers&quot; and Patriotic covers, among others.

==Availability==
The availability of the different types of covers varies considerably and is something that often adds perspective to the historical and philatelic significance of the cover. For example, &quot;First Day&quot; covers and &quot;First Flight&quot; covers are generally common because the events that inspired the creation of these covers were somewhat common. In other examples, various types of military and historical covers are often scarce or rare because the circumstances or events that prompted the creation of these covers were conversely uncommon. While covers sent in recent decades tend to be common, they can also prove to be scarce simply because the circumstance that created these covers were (sometimes very) uncommon, as are the various examples of historical covers i.e. sent by a head of state to another officially prominent individual. At the same time there exist covers that are quite old but are still common and not very difficult to find, as are various types of post cards or commercial covers. Patriotic covers are generally common because the practice of sending these was popular, especially during periods of war. Patriotic cover availability here can vary also depending on the country and time period in question. Covers collected for the &quot;stamp on cover&quot; can vary greatly in availability and generally depends on the availability of the stamp issue itself along with the demand for the use of a particular denomination. The denomination of a stamp often determines the availability of the issue on cover as the use of some, usually higher, denominations was uncommon because of the low demand for a particular postage rate. There are a number of circumstances that can affect the availability of a given cover type and which often contribute to a cover&#x27;s historical and philatelic value.

<doc id="487371" wikidata="Q1762817" url="?curid=487371" title="Long sword dance">
<text>The long sword dance (or longsword dance) is a hilt-and-point sword dance recorded mainly in Yorkshire, England. The dances are usually performed around Christmas time and were believed to derive from a rite performed to enable a fruitful harvest.

==History==
The long sword dance is related to the rapper sword dance of Northumbria, but the character is fundamentally different as it uses rigid metal or wooden swords, rather than the flexible spring steel rappers used by its northern relation.

Cecil Sharp and other 20th Century folklorists believed that the dances originated from a religious or magical ceremony that was performed around Plough Monday to promote fertile soil; later researchers have cast doubt on such findings. They were banned under Oliver Cromwell, but revived when the monarchy was restored under Charles II.

==Location==
Long sword dances are most commonly found in Yorkshire and the southern part of County Durham, with particular concentrations of dances in East Cleveland, the northern part of the North York Moors and around Sheffield. Outliers were also recorded in the East Midlands and elsewhere in Northeastern England.

==Performances==
Unlike many traditional dances in England, which are mainly performed by revival teams, long sword dances are often still performed by their own village teams, such as Grenoside Sword Dancers, the Goathland Plough Stots and Flamborough Sword Dancers. These teams generally maintain the traditions of their dances, such as traditional performances on Boxing Day or Plough Monday.

Long sword dances vary in the way they are performed, with some being slow and militaristic, such as the Grenoside or performed with pace and speed like Handsworth dances from near Sheffield. Others have different features including variations of numbers of dancers and distinctive movements.

In addition to performances by traditional long sword teams in their own location, long sword teams also appear at folk festivals such as the Sidmouth Folk Festival and the Beverley Folk Festival.

Dedicated long sword festivals have also been held in the UK. The International Sword Spectacular took place in Whitby, England, in May 2004 and was held again in York in May 2008.

<doc id="487379" wikidata="Q285185" url="?curid=487379" title="Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya">
<text> (, &quot;Assembly of Islam&quot;) is an Egyptian Sunni Islamist movement, and is considered a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom and the European Union, but was removed from the United States list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in May 2022. The group was dedicated to the overthrow of the Egyptian government and replacing it with an Islamic state. Following the coup that toppled Mohamed Morsi, the group has committed to peaceful activities.

From 1992 to 1998, fought an insurgency against the Egyptian government during which at least 796 Egyptian policemen and soldiers, fighters, and civilians including dozens of tourists were killed. During the fighting was given support by the governments of Iran and Sudan, as well as from al-Qaeda. The Egyptian government received support during that time from the United States.

The group(s) is said to have constituted &quot;the Islamist movement&#x27;s only genuine mass organizations&quot; in Egypt. While the assassination of the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981 is generally thought to have been carried out by another Islamist group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, some have suggested was responsible for or at least related to the assassination. In 2003, the imprisoned leadership of the group renounced bloodshed, and a series of high-ranking members were released, and the group was allowed to resume semi-legal peaceful activities. Then again some of its members were released in 2011. The imprisoned cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman was a spiritual leader of the movement, and the group actively campaigned for his release until his death in 2017.

Following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, the movement formed a political party, the Building and Development Party, which gained 13 seats in the 2011–2012 elections to the lower house of the Egyptian Parliament.

== History ==
=== Origins in universities ===
 began as an umbrella organization for Egyptian militant student groups, formed, like the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, after the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood renounced violence in the 1970s.

In its early days, the group was primarily active on university campuses, and was mainly composed of university students. Originally they were a minority in the Egyptian student movement which was dominated by leftist Nasserists and Marxists. The leftists were strongly critical of the new Sadat government, and urged Egypt to fight a war of revenge against Israel, while President Sadat wanted to wait and rebuild the military. However, with some &quot;discrete, tactical collaboration&quot; with the government, who sought a &quot;useful counterweight&quot; to its leftist opponents, the group(s) began to grow in influence in 1973.

The Jama&#x27;at spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the segregation of classes by gender. Secular university administrators opposed these goals.
By March 1976, they were &quot;dominant force&quot; in the student movement and by 1977 &quot;they were in complete control of the universities and had driven the left organizations underground.&quot;

=== Expansion ===
Having once been favored by the Egyptian government of Anwar Sadat they now threatened it, passionately opposing what they believed was a &quot;shameful peace with the Jews,&quot; aka the Camp David Accords with Israel. By 1979, they began to be harassed by the government but their numbers grew steadily. In 1979, Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At Assiut University, which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, secularists, and Copts), the president and other top administrators – who were Islamists – supported Jama&#x27;at demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment. In other universities Jama&#x27;at also forbade the mixing of genders, films, concerts, and dances, and enforced their bans with clubs and iron bars. From the universities the groups reached out to make new recruits, preaching in poor neighbourhoods of cities, and to rural areas. and after a crackdown against them, inmates of Egyptian jails.

In April 1981, the group became involved in what was probably started as a clan feud/vendetta about livestock or property lines between Coptic and Muslim Egyptians in the vicinity of Minya, Egypt. The group believed in the position of tributary or dhimmi for Christians in Egypt and opposed any signs of Coptic &quot;arrogance&quot; (istikbar), such as Christian cultural identity and opposition to an Islamic state. The group distributed a leaflet accusing Egypt&#x27;s one Christian provincial governor (appointed by the government) of providing automatic weapons to Christians to attack Muslims, and the Sadat administration of following orders given by the United States.

=== Crackdown ===
In June 1981, a brutal sectarian Muslim-Copt fight broke out in the poor al-Zawaiyya Al Hamra district of Cairo. Over three days of fighting, 17 people were killed, 112 injured, and 171 public and private buildings were damaged. &quot;Men and women were slaughtered; babies thrown from windows, their bodies crushed on the pavement below; there was looting, killing and arson.&quot; Islamic Group(s) were accused of participating in the incident and in September 1981, one month before the assassination of Sadat, the were dissolved by the state (although they had never been legally registered in the first place), their infrastructure was destroyed and their leaders arrested.

=== Assassination of president Anwar Sadat ===

In 1980, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad under the leadership of Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj, formed a coalition with the Jama&#x27;at under the leadership of Karam Zuhdi, with both agreeing to follow the guidance of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman. One of Faraj&#x27;s groups was responsible for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Members in Asyut launched a rapidly suppressed uprising two days after the assassination. Following the assassination, Karam Zuhdi expressed regret for conspiring with Egyptian Islamic Jihad in the assassination, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Zuhdi was among the 900 militants who were set free in April 2006 by the Egyptian government.

=== Omar Abdel-Rahman ===
The cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman was the spiritual leader of the movement. He was accused of participating in the World Trade Center 1993 bombings conspiracy, and was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his espousal of a subsequent conspiracy to bomb New York City landmarks, including the United Nations and FBI offices. The Islamic Group had publicly threatened to retaliate against the United States if Rahman was not released from prison. However, the group later renounced violence and their leaders and members were released from prison in Egypt. Abdel-Rahman died on 18 February 2017.

=== 1990s terrorism campaign ===
While the Islamic group had originally been an amorphous movement of local groups centered in mosques without offices or membership roll, by the late 1980s it became more organized and &quot;even adopted an official logo: an upright sword standing on an open Qur&#x27;an with an orange sun rising in the background,&quot; encircled by the Qur&#x27;anic verse that Abdel Rahman had quoted at his trials while trying to explain his interpretation of jihad to the judges:
وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلّهِ فَإِنِ انتَهَواْ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ إِلاَّ عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ

Fight them on until there is no more Tumult, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression.

This became the official motto of the group.

The 1990s saw engage in an extended campaign of violence, from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals, to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners. Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt&#x27;s economy – tourism – and in turn to the government, but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depends for support.

Victims of campaign against the Egyptian state from 1992 to 1997 totaled more than 1200 and included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a speaker of parliament (Rifaat al-Mahgoub), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.

The 1991 killing of the group&#x27;s leader, Ala Mohieddin, presumably by security forces, led Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya to murder Egypt&#x27;s speaker of parliament in retaliation. In June 1995, working together with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the group staged a carefully planned attempt on the life of President Mubarak, led by Mustafa Hamza, a senior Egyptian member of the Al-Qaeda and commander of the military branch of the Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya. Mubarak escaped unharmed and retaliated with a massive and ruthless crackdown on GI members and their families in Egypt.

Tal&#x27;at Fu&#x27;ad Qasim was arrested in Croatia in 1995.

==== Failed nonviolence initiative ====
By 1997, the movement had become paralyzed. 20,000 Islamists were in custody in Egypt and thousands more had been killed by the security forces. In July of that year, Islamist lawyer Montassir al-Zayyat brokered a deal between the and the Egyptian government, called the Nonviolence Initiative, whereby the movement formally renounced violence. The next year the government released 2,000 members of the Islamic Group. After the initiative was declared Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman also gave his approval from his prison cell in the United States, though he later withdrew it.

The initiative divided the Islamic Group between members in Egypt who supported it and those in exile who wanted the attacks to continue. Leading the opposition was EIJ leader Ayman Zawahiri who termed it &quot;surrender&quot; in angry letters to the London newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat.

==== Temple of Hatshepsut attack ====
Zawahiri enlisted Ahmed Refai Taha, both exiles in Afghanistan with him, to sabotage the initiative with a massive terrorism attack that would provoke the government into repression. So on 17 November 1997 killing campaign climaxed with the attack at the Temple of Hatshepsut (Deir el-Bahri) in Luxor, in which a band of six men dressed in police uniforms machine-gunned and hacked to death with knives 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians. &quot;The killing went on for 45 minutes, until the floors streamed with blood. The dead included a five-year-old British child and four Japanese couples on their honeymoons.&quot; Altogether 71 people were killed. The attack stunned Egyptian society, devastated the tourist industry for a number of years, and consequently sapped a large segment of popular support for violent Islamism in Egypt.

The revulsion of Egyptians and rejection of jihadi terrorism was so complete, the attack&#x27;s supporters backpedaled. The day after the attack, Refai Taha claimed the attackers intended only to take the tourists hostage, despite the evidence of the systematic nature of the slaughter. Others denied Islamist involvement completely. Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman blamed Israelis for the killings, and Zawahiri maintaining the Egyptian police had done it.

When Refai Taha signed the al-Qaeda fatwa &quot;International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders&quot; to kill Crusaders and Jews on behalf of the Islamic Group, he was &quot;forced to withdraw his name&quot; from the fatwa, explaining to fellow members ... than he had &quot;only been asked over the telephone to join in a statement of support for the Iraqi people.&quot;

==== Attacks ====
Major attacks by :
*8 June 1992 – assassination of Farag Foda.
*26 June 1995 – attempt to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
*20 October 1995 – Car bomb attack on police station in Rijeka, Croatia.
*28 April 1996 – a mass shooting outside the Europa Hotel, Cairo, killing 17 Greek tourists mistaken for Israelis.
*17 November 1997 – Luxor massacre at Deir el-Bahri, Luxor, Egypt. 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians killed.

It was also responsible for a spate of tourist shootings (trains and cruise ships sprayed with bullets) in middle and upper Egypt during the early 1990s. As a result of those attacks, cruise ships ceased sailing between Cairo and Luxor.

=== Renouncing terrorism ===

After spending more than two decades in prison and after intense debates and discussions with Al-Azhar scholars, most of the leaders of have written several books renouncing their ideology of violence and some of them went as far as calling ex-Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, whom they assassinated, a martyr.

 renounced bloodshed in 2003, and in September 2003 Egypt freed more than 1,000 members, citing what Interior Minister Habib el-Adli called the group&#x27;s stated &quot;commitment to rejecting violence.&quot;

Harsh repressive measures by the Egyptian government and the unpopularity of the killing of foreign tourists have reduced the group&#x27;s profile in recent years but the movement retains popular support among Egyptian Islamists who disapprove of the secular nature of Egypt&#x27;s society and peace treaty with Israel.

In April 2006, the Egyptian government released approximately 1,200 members from prison, including a founder, Nageh Ibrahim.

Reportedly, there have been &quot;only two instances where members showed signs of returning to their former violent ways, and in both cases they were betrayed by informants within their own group.&quot;

=== 2011 revolution ===
Following the 2011 Revolution, established a political party, the Building and Development Party. In August 2011, it presented 6,700 proxies (signatures) to the Egyptian political parties&#x27; committee on behalf of its party. In a statement the Jama&#x27;at said that any legislation drafted in Egypt after the revolution must refer to the sharia of God, &quot;who blessed us with this revolution. We believe that the suffering we endured during the past years was due to neglecting religion and putting those who don&#x27;t fear [God] in power.&quot; It also stated that &quot;Islam can contain everyone and respects the freedom of followers of other religions to refer to their own sharia in private affairs.&quot;

The Building and Development Party contested the 2011–2012 elections to the People&#x27;s Council, the lower house of the Egyptian parliament, as part of the Islamic Alliance which was led by the salafi Al-Nour Party. It gained 13 seats: 12 in Upper Egypt and one in Suez.

In June 2013, Egypt&#x27;s president Mohammed Morsi appointed Adel el-Khayat, a member of the group, as governor of Luxor. el-Khayat resigned within a week of his appointment due to public unrest related to the group&#x27;s commission of the 1997 massacre in Luxor.

== Beliefs ==
One scholar studying the group, Gilles Kepel, found that the group repeatedly used the name of radical Islamist theorist Sayyid Qutb, and often quoted from his manifesto, &quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi al-Tariq&quot; (Milestones), in their leaflets and newsletters. They emphasized the right to legislate belongs to God alone; and that divine unity (tawhid) in Islam signifies liberation (tahrir) from all that is corrupt in thought – including the liberation of all that is inherited or conventional, like customs and traditions.

There was a scant supply of any writing by the group&#x27;s members, but some issues leading writer(s) of the Jama&#x27;at thought worth mentioning included:
* Youth must be taught that Islam was &quot;nizam kamil wa shamil&quot; (a complete and perfect system) and must regulate government and war, the judicial system and the economy.
* Egypt&#x27;s disastrous 1967 War was the result of following Arab nationalism rather than Islam.
* Signs of the growth of an Islamic movement were the wearing of the veil by women and the white gallabieh and untrimmed beard by men, early marriage, and attendance at public prayers on the major Muslim festivals, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-adha.

While secularist social analyses of Egypt&#x27;s socioeconomic problems maintained that poverty was caused by overpopulation or high defense expenditures, saw the cause in the populace&#x27;s spiritual failures – laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life.

== Members allegedly allying with al-Qaeda ==
Deputy leader of al-Qaeda Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a new alliance with a faction of Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya. In a video released on the internet on 5 August 2006. Zawahiri said &quot;We bring good tidings to the Muslim nation about a big faction of the knights of uniting with Al-Qaeda,&quot; and the move aimed to help &quot;rally the Muslim nation&#x27;s capabilities in a unified rank in the face of the most severe crusader campaign against Islam in its history.&quot; An leader, Muhammad al-Hukaymah, appeared in the video and confirmed the unity move. However, Hukaymah acknowledged that other members had &quot;backslid&quot; from the militant course he was keeping to, and some representatives also denied that they were joining forces with the international Al-Qaeda network. Sheikh Abdel Akhar Hammad, a former leader, told Al-Jazeera: &quot;If [some] brothers have joined, then this is their own personal view and I don&#x27;t think that most members share that same opinion.&quot;

<text>Robert Bruce Avakian (born March 7, 1943) is an American political activist and Maoist philosopher who is the founder and chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA (RCP). Coming out of the New Left of the 1960s, he has authored the organization’s ideological framework, &quot;the New Synthesis&quot; or &quot;New Communism&quot;.

==Early life==
Avakian was born on March 7, 1943, in Washington, D.C., to Ruth and Spurgeon &quot;Sparky&quot; Avakian. His father was an Armenian American lawyer, civil rights activist, and later as an Alameda County Superior Court judge. After spending his first three years in the Washington metropolitan area, he spent the rest of his childhood and adolescence in Berkeley, California.

==Political activities==
As a student at UC Berkeley, Avakian became involved with Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Free Speech Movement and the Black Panther Party. In 1968, he wrote articles for the Peace and Freedom Party&#x27;s publications and in July 1969, he spoke at the Black Panther Party conference in Oakland, California. Avakian was a member of the SDS Revolutionary Youth Movement II faction, and ran as the RYM II candidate for National Secretary at the 1969 SDS National Convention. Avakian was defeated by Mark Rudd of the faction later known as the Weather Underground. During that period, Avakian was a founding member of the Bay Area Revolutionary Union alongside Leibel Bergman.

In the early 1970s, Avakian served a prison sentence for desecrating the American flag during a demonstration. He was charged with assaulting a police officer in January 1979 at a demonstration in Washington, D.C. to protest Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s meeting with Jimmy Carter. After receiving an arrest warrant, Avakian went to France and applied for political refugee status. In 1980, he gave a speech to 200 protestors in downtown Oakland and his police assault charges were dropped a few years later.

 He has been the Revolutionary Communist Party&#x27;s central committee chairman and national leader since 1979. In 2016, the RCP USA and others helped form the organization Refuse Fascism, which called for the removal of Donald Trump.

In August 2020, Avakian urged his supporters in a statement to vote out Donald Trump, claiming that opposing the rising tide of fascism in the united states is a top priority.

==Legacy==
Avakian is a controversial figure. Supporters see him as a revolutionary leader and claim his body of work has advanced communist theory and represents a &quot;pathway to human emancipation&quot; from the capitalist system. Detractors criticize the RCP as a cult of personality around him, which the party has called &quot;lies and slander&quot;.

<text>The Capital District, also known as the Capital Region, is the metropolitan area surrounding Albany, the capital of the U.S. state of New York. The Capital District was first settled by the Dutch in the early 17th century and came under English control in 1664. Albany has been the permanent capital of the state of New York since 1797. The Capital District is notable for many historical events that predate the independence of the United States, including the Albany Plan of Union and the Battles of Saratoga.

== Etymology ==
The earliest known reference to the name &quot;Capital District&quot; stems from a Capital Police District that was created in the Albany area in the late 1860s.

In the 1910s, several economic and government organizations covering the area used &quot;Capital District&quot; in their name, such as the Capital District Conference of Charities and Corrections in 1913, the Capital District Life Underwriters Association also in 1913, and the Capital District Recreation League. The Capital District Recreation League, formed in 1916, proposed to create a Capital District Park in the area of the Shaker settlement.

=== Nicknames ===
Capitaland, Metroland, the Tri-City Area, and Tech Valley are nicknames sometimes used to refer to the Capital District. The region is often also called the 518 after the telephone area code that serves the Capital District.

The Capital District is a part of the area marketed under the name &quot;Tech Valley&quot; in recognition of the technology companies that have moved to the region. The 19-county Tech Valley region, which extends from the Canada–US border south to Orange County, is marketed by organizations such as the Tech Valley Chamber Coalition, the Albany-Colonie Regional Chamber of Commerce, and the Albany-based Center for Economic Growth. In 2011, New York launched a Regional Council initiative under which the &quot;Capital Region&quot; became the state&#x27;s official name for the eight-county region consisting of 1.1 million people in Albany, Columbia, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren and Washington counties.

== History ==

=== First settlements ===

Permanent European claims and settlement began in 1609, when Henry Hudson sailed north up the Hudson River in the name of the Dutch. During the same year, Samuel Champlain explored south down Lake Champlain and Lake George in the name of France. Conflict soon ensued between the French and Dutch for control of the fur trade and both made alliances with different Native American tribes. In 1630, Kiliaen van Rensselaer founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, a Dutch patroonship in the area, which encompassed much of the area that is now the Capital District. In 1664, the English successfully conquered the Dutch while rivalry with the French continued. The Dutch, and then the English, maintained focus on settlement and farming while the French incursion into this area was limited to hunting for furs, trading with the natives, and building a few forts. Conflict arose when the French-built Fort Carillon and the British-built Fort William Henry near each other, both in order to control the route between the Hudson River Valley and the Champlain Valley.

Through the Dongan Charter, Governor Thomas Dongan granted Albany the right to purchase in &quot;Schaahtecogue&quot; (today Schaghticoke, in Rensselaer County) and at &quot;Tionnondoroge&quot; (today Fort Hunter, in Montgomery County). Arent van Curler founded Schenectady in 1662; Fort Saratoga was built at present-day Schuylerville in 1691; and Greenbush (present-day city of Rensselaer) was settled in the 1620s. South of Albany, settlement occurred quickly at first, but slowed as growth on the frontier pushed people north and west of Albany and left the southern reaches of the Capital District behind. Hudson, in Columbia County, was purchased from the natives in 1662 by Dutch farmers and speculators but did not see actual settlement and growth until 1783 when New Englanders, mainly from southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, arrived. It was chartered as a city in 1785, becoming only the third city in the state.

The French and Indian War saw several major battles in the Capital District, including at the aforementioned forts. In the end, the French were defeated, freeing the land for further settlement to the west and north of Albany. During the American Revolution the area again saw fighting and Fort Ticonderoga experienced notable action. The Battle of Saratoga, which took place in the present-day town of Stillwater, is considered the turning point of the war. In 1776, General Philip Schuyler built a small fleet of ships at Whitehall. They were used by Benedict Arnold in the Battle of Valcour Island. The event led to Whitehall&#x27;s modern-day claim to be the birthplace of the United States Navy.

After the Revolution, settlements continued to proliferate west and north of the Albany area. North of Albany, along the river, settlements grew quickly: Waterford (oldest continuously incorporated village in the US, incorporated in 1794), Troy (settled in 1787, chartered as a village 1801, city in 1816), Lansingburgh (a village in 1763, annexed to Troy in 1900), and Watervliet (settled in 1643 and incorporated as a village in 1836 as West Troy, city in 1897). West from Schenectady, land purchases in the 1750s led to settlements at Fonda and Fultonville in Montgomery County, but land purchases elsewhere, such as at Gloversville in Fulton County did not see settlement until the end of the 18th century when the Iroquois threat had been eliminated by the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, which came as retaliation for the Cherry Valley Massacre in nearby Otsego County.

=== Creation of the counties ===

The entire area of the Capital District was within the original boundaries of Albany County as established by the Province of New York on November 1, 1683; it was one of the original 12 counties. In 1772, Charlotte County and Tryon County were both formed from parts of Albany County. Charlotte County was renamed Washington County in 1784, and from part of that, Warren County was created in 1813. Tryon County was renamed Montgomery County in 1784, and from part of that, Fulton County was created in 1838. Tryon County was large: it encompassed the lands from five miles (8 km) west of Schenectady to the western indeterminate boundary of the Province of New York.

What remained of Albany County in 1774 became the most populated county in the state with a population of 42,921 and it continued to be the most populous county until at least 1790, when the population was 75,921. Albany lost population as new counties were created from within: Columbia County was created in 1786; Rensselaer and Saratoga counties were formed in 1791; Schoharie County was created in 1795 from parts of both Albany and Otsego counties (Otsego having been created from part of Montgomery County in 1791); Greene County was formed in 1800 from parts of both Albany and Ulster counties; Schenectady County was created in 1809; and Warren County was formed in 1813 from Washington County. Fulton County was the last county in the Capital District to be formed. A graphical representation of the county breakup timeline can be seen below.

=== Urbanization and transportation ===

The Champlain and Erie canals were opened in 1823, and 1825, respectively. Their completion connected the area to the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, leading to a large influx in industrialization and immigration. Shortly after the completion of the canals, in 1831, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company (M&amp;H) built the Albany and Schenectady Railroad between those two cities. This was the first railway in the state. Railroads, like the plank/post roads and canals before them, made Albany an even more important transportation hub. In 1853 Erastus Corning consolidated 10 railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo as the New York Central Railroad, headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt took over in 1867 and moved the company to New York City.

Industry consequently became prominent in the area. Gloversville was labeled the &quot;headquarters of the glove and mitten industry&quot; and became the preeminent glove-manufacturing and leather-working region in New York. Cohoes became known as the &quot;Spindle City&quot; for its large cotton mills, due mainly to Harmony Mills, the largest cotton mill complex in the world when it opened in 1872. Troy became famous for its iron works due to Burden Iron Works, though later Troy would earn the nickname of &quot;Collar City&quot; due to Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., which made Arrow brand shirts at the largest collar, cuff, and shirt factory in the world at the time. In 1887 Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady, and in 1892 Schenectady became the headquarters of the General Electric Company (GE). Schenectady Locomotive Works, along with seven other locomotive manufacturers, merged in 1901 and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed and headquartered in Schenectady. Due to the dominance of GE and ALCO in their respective industries, Schenectady would gain the nicknames of &quot;Electric City&quot; and &quot;The City that Lights and Hauls the World&quot;. The nature of this industry lent itself to the creation of many labor-saving inventions, such as the horseshoe machine of Henry Burden, the pre-shrinking fabric machines of Sanford Cluett, the power knitting loom of Timothy Bailey, the railroad air-brake of George Westinghouse, and the hundreds of electricity-related improvements of General Electric Company scientists.

=== Rise of the suburbs and urban decline and renewal ===
Starting with the 1980 U.S. Census, Albany posted a decline in population until the 2000 U.S. Census. Meanwhile, the suburbs saw an influx in population and grew at the expense of the city of Albany. There were many causes to this, including the building of interstates and other highways allowing for more commuting, lack of available suitable land within the urban centers, and the subsequent location of shopping centers following the people to the suburbs.

The decline of exporting from the United States contributed to a general decline as well. Watervliet, Cohoes, and especially Troy lost a competitive edge that came with being at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers: the location no longer meant better access to markets, waterfalls no longer made the cheapest power, and cheap labor in the southern and western parts of the nation became important to companies. General Electric moved part of their headquarters to Connecticut from Schenectady in the mid-1980s. Within the Capital District focus shifted to the suburbs. The suburbs had large open spaces for office parks and homes while the cities were constrained in available land. Albany International, with their headquarters and factory straddling the Menands and Albany border, built a new headquarters in 1987 in suburban East Greenbush, as did Garden Way, headquartered in Troy. The region&#x27;s first technology park was built in the 1980s in North Greenbush by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).
Not only was there a shift in population to the suburbs, a shift in retail shopping occurred as well. Retail sales in the cities declined a percent between 1972 and 1987, while having increased 63 percent in the suburbs. Although it was, and still is, within the city limits of Albany, Westgate Plaza opened in 1957 as the area&#x27;s first &quot;suburban&quot;-style shopping center. Two years later, Stuyvesant Plaza was built outside Albany, in the neighboring town of Guilderland. 1966 saw the opening of the area&#x27;s first enclosed shopping mall, Colonie Center in Colonie, which drew shoppers from hundreds of miles away. Both Macy&#x27;s, which up until this time only had locations in the New York City area, and Sears originally wanted to build stores in downtown Albany, but chose to move into suburban Colonie Center after having encountered interference from Albany&#x27;s Mayor Corning.

Several more enclosed malls were built in the area after Colonie Center&#x27;s debut, all outside Albany limits: Mohawk Mall in Niskayuna in 1970, Aviation Mall in Queensbury in 1975, Clifton Park Center in Clifton Park in 1976 (originally known as Clifton Country Mall), Rotterdam Square outside Schenectady in 1988, and the Wilton Mall at Saratoga in Wilton, in 1990. The first mall built within a downtown area was completed in 1977 as the Amsterdam Mall in Amsterdam. In 1979, the Uncle Sam Atrium opened in downtown Troy and, in 1986 Cohoes Commons opened in Cohoes, but by 2000 was nearly empty and is now office space. Crossgates Mall, a large upscale mall built in Guilderland in 1984, is now the fourth-largest mall in New York state. A modern expansion of Crossgates Mall in 1994 attracted luxury retailer Lord &amp; Taylor as an anchor, as well as another Macy&#x27;s to the area.

Capitalizing on young professionals’ growing interest in living in walkable urban downtowns, the City of Albany has countered the shift to the suburbs with an apartment building boom. The effort to bring more residents to downtown Albany began gaining momentum in 1996 through the creation of the Albany Business Improvement District. Since 2002, the Capitalize Albany Corp. has been fueling the downtown residential strategy by allocating resources to building owners, developers and investors. In the early 2000s, the effort started with a series of small luxury apartment projects on Albany&#x27;s North Pearl and State Streets and later expanded to several major developments both in downtown and just beyond it. Those major projects include: the conversion of a vacant industrial building into the 42-unit Monroe Apartments in 2012; the redevelopment of the former arcade building on Broadway into a 60-unit complex; and the $80 million redevelopment of the former Knickerbocker News building into The Knick, a 132-apartment complex in 2019. By 2020, more than $110 million in downtown investments had supported the completion of 650 residential units had been completed in Albany and 400 more were in development.

Other Capital Region cities have also similarly pursued downtown revitalization efforts. In the 20 years since its creation in 1998, Schenectady&#x27;s Metroplex Development Authority leveraged $249 million in sales tax revenues and grants to support 700 projects with a value of $1.3 billion and 8,000 jobs. Glens Falls was the winner of the Capital Region city to be awarded $10 million through Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) in 2017. Subsequent $10 million DRI winners have included Hudson and Albany. In the city of Saratoga Springs, there was a 1,352, or 11.7 percent, increase in housing units between 2000 and 2010.

== Geography ==


According to the Albany &quot;Times Union&quot;, the Capital District includes 11 counties: Albany, Columbia, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren, and Washington. The lower part of the Capital District is sometimes considered to be part of the Hudson Valley. The map in the infobox at the top of this page highlights those 11 counties. However, the Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) asserts that the Capital District consists of only eight counties (the counties of Fulton, Montgomery, and Schoharie are not included). The ESDC&#x27;s definition of the Capital District is reflected in the map below the infobox, which is marked &quot;Regions of New York&quot;. This page will utilize the &quot;Times Union&#x27;s&quot; definition unless otherwise indicated.

The 11 counties of the Capital District are divided into 13 cities and 143 towns, with 62 villages that are inside one or more towns. One village, Green Island, is coterminous with its town.

The Capital District encompasses parts of the southern and southeastern Adirondacks to the northern parts of its limits.

=== Location ===
== Climate ==

The Capital District has a humid continental climate, with cold, snowy winters, and hot, wet summers. The region stands at a temperate sweet spot in New York State, annually receiving on average much less snow than other upstate metro areas and much less precipitation than downstate cities. For example, between 1980 and 2010, the 25-mile area around Albany on average received 60.3 inches of snow. That was 105 percent less snow than the same sized area around Syracuse received, 65 percent less than the Rochester area, 57 percent less than the Buffalo area and 38 percent less than the Binghamton area. During the same period, the Albany area averaged received 39.35 inches of rain. That was 18 percent less rain than the Poughkeepsie area, 25 percent less rain than the Westchester area and 18 percent less rain than the Islip area.

Albany receives around 36.2 inches of rain per year, with 135 days of at least .01 inches of precipitation. Snowfall is significant, totaling about 63 inches annually, but with less accumulation than the lake-effect areas to the north and west, being far enough from Lake Ontario. The core of the region is however, close enough to the coast to receive heavy snow from Nor&#x27;easters, and the region gets the bulk of its yearly snowfall from these types of storms. The region also occasionally receives Alberta clippers. Mohawk–Hudson convergence occasionally prolongs snowfall events in the Capital District, where precipitation has ended elsewhere across the region.

Albany receives on average per year 69 sunny days, 111 partly cloudy days, and 185 cloudy days; and an average, over the course of a year, of less than four hours of sunshine per day, with just over an average of 2.5 hours per day over the course of the winter. The chance during daylight hours of sunshine is 53%, with the highest percentage of sunny daylight hours being in July with 64%, and the lowest month is November with 37%.

== Cityscape ==
=== Architecture ===

The Capital District, having a history of settlement stretching back 400 years, has had many different architectural styles built over the years. Early Dutch farmhouses are still standing in the rural towns, especially west of Albany, such as the Mabee House. The Van Ostrande-Radliff House (1728) in Albany and the Rosa House in Schenectady (before 1700) are the oldest houses in each city. In 1885 &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot;, a magazine with national circulation, polled its readers asking what the nation&#x27;s Top Ten most beautiful buildings were. Two buildings in the city of Albany made the list: Albany City Hall and the New York State Capitol; both finished in 1883 and designed by Henry Hobson Richardson.

Troy has many distinctive features in architecture that sets it apart, such as its ornamental ironwork, cast-iron storefronts such as the Arts Center of the Capital Region, and the abundance of windows by Tiffany such as St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Troy Public Library, and St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The Capital District also has a large selection of brownstone buildings especially in the Center Square neighborhood of Albany and the Washington Park neighborhood in Troy. Washington Park in Troy is one of only two privately owned urban ornamental parks in the state.

Schenectady&#x27;s Stockade neighborhood has representations of residential architecture from all periods in its 300-year history including Dutch, Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and Victorian. Also in Schenectady is the GE Realty Plot built by General Electric as homes for their employees, the houses are in revival styles such as Tudor, Georgian, Queen Anne, Dutch Colonial, and Spanish Colonial. The first all electric house was built by GE in the Realty Plot to showcase its products. In Albany&#x27;s Pine Hills neighborhood is a style of residential architecture that is rare in the rest of the Capital District, bungalows in the Spanish revival style, with red tile roofs and stucco walls, only 27 still exist and are the remnants of the Winchester Gables development.

=== Festivals ===

One of the largest events in the Capital District is the Tulip Fest held in Albany every spring at Washington Park. The tradition stems from when Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd got a city ordinance passed declaring the tulip as Albany&#x27;s official flower on July 1, 1948. In addition, he sent a request to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to name a variety as Albany&#x27;s tulip. On July 11, 1948, her reply was &quot;Her Majesty gladly accepts the invitation to designate a tulip as the official flower of Albany.&quot; She picked the variety &quot;Orange Wonder&quot;, a bronzy orange shaded scarlet. The first Tulip Fest was celebrated the next year on May 14, 1949, with opening ceremonies still carried on today as tradition, such as the sweeping of State Street and the crowning of a Tulip Queen. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest. Attendance to the festival in 2010 was approximately 80,000.

The largest Flag Day parade in the United States had been held every year in Troy until 2017. The 42nd annual parade in 2009 is along a two-mile (3 km) long route. First Night celebrations are held in Saratoga Springs, while in 2006 Albany decided to eliminate its First Night celebrations in favor of a new &quot;Albany WinterFestival&quot; (WinterFest).

Other major festivals in the Capital District include ethnic festivals. The Albany LatinFest, which has been held since 1996, drew 10,000 people to Washington Park in 2008. In Schenectady the growing Guyanese community has celebrated the Guyanese Family Fun Day for several years in that city&#x27;s Central Park. PolishFest is a three-day celebration of Polish culture in the Capital District, held in the town of Colonie for the past eight years.

=== Entertainment ===

The Capital District has many enclosed malls that are regional malls (malls over ), and two that are classified as super-regional malls (malls with over ). Crossgates Mall in Guilderland and Colonie Center in Colonie are the two super-regional malls.

During the winter months the Capital District has many places to go for such cold-weather activities as skiing, snowboarding, tubing, ice fishing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice climbing. Some downhill ski centers include West Mountain and Gore Mountain in Warren County, Maple Ski Ridge in Schenectady County, Willard Mountain in Washington County, Windham Mountain and Hunter Mountain in Greene County. In addition to downhill skiing most also have cross-country skiing trails as well. There are also cross-country trails at the state parks in the area, the Schenectady County Forest in Duanesburg and Pine Ridge XC Ski Area in Rensselaer County. There are over of official trails for snowshoeing at the Albany Pine Bush Preserve.

Lake George also has an annual winter carnival every weekend in February.

== Culture and contemporary life ==

=== Culture ===
Albany consistently ranks high on lists of top cities/metro areas for culture, such as being 23rd in the book &quot;Cities Ranked &amp; Rated&quot;. Albany ranked 12th among large metro areas and Glens Falls ranked 12th among the small metro areas in Sperling&#x27;s Best Places; and Expansion Management (a monthly business magazine) gave the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area five Stars, its highest ranking, for quality of life features. The Capital District has many museums, historical sites, art galleries, and festivals that stretch back to the 17th century. The Capital District has been pivotal in the history of Santa Claus in the United States, including the first written reference to Santa (Sinterclaas) in 1675 and the first publishing of &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night before Christmas&quot; in 1823.

=== Cuisine ===

The Capital District has been the birthplace of several important foods in American food culture. Potato chips were invented by African-American/Native American chef George Crum, at the Moon Lake Lodge&#x27;s restaurant in Saratoga Springs. The club sandwich was also invented in Saratoga Springs, at the Saratoga Club-house, today the Canfield Casino, in 1894. Pie à la Mode was first made at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, Washington County in the 1890s.

Sturgeon in the Hudson River was once so plentiful that the fish was referred to as &quot;Albany beef&quot;.

Since 1988, the Siena College men&#x27;s basketball team (the Siena Saints) have appeared in six NCAA Tournaments (1989, 1999, 2002, 2008, 2009, and 2010), while their crosstown rivals, the Great Danes of the University at Albany (SUNY) have appeared five times 2006, 2007, 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Union College won the NCAA Division 1 National Championship in 2014 in men’s college hockey, while its rival, RPI, brought home the title in 1985 and 1954.

== Economy ==

The economy of the Capital District is heavily anchored by the state government. There have traditionally been three legs holding up the region&#x27;s economy: State government, health care, and education. Albany has the fourth-highest amount of lawyers in its employment pool (7.5 lawyers per 1,000 jobs) in the nation, behind Washington, D.C.; Trenton, New Jersey; and New York City, respectively. Many important regional and national banks are headquartered in the area.

===Tech Valley===
Since the 2000s, the economy of the Capital District has been redirected toward high technology. Tech Valley is a marketing name for the eastern part of New York State, encompassing the Capital District and the Hudson Valley. Originated in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston, it has since grown to represent the counties in the Capital District and extending to IBM&#x27;s Westchester County plants in the south and the Canada–US border to the north. The area&#x27;s high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute. Tech Valley encompasses 19 counties straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway, and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing. In April 2021, GlobalFoundries, a company specializing in the semiconductor industry, moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley, California to its most advanced semiconductor-chip manufacturing facility in Saratoga County, New York near a section of the Adirondack Northway, in Malta, New York.

Fueled by its urban counties (Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, Saratoga), the region is one of only 51 metros in the nation where businesses annually spend more than $1 billion on R&amp;D. A substantial amount of those expenditures are in the field of semiconductor research, so much so that 1,404 semiconductor device-related patents awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2019 listed an inventor in the eight-county Capital Region – more than any other state in the nation except California and excluding the whole of New York.

== Demographics ==
The Capital District is New York&#x27;s most affluent metro area outside the New York City metropolitan area. Median household income was roughly $86,787 in 1999 and its educational attainment profile, with 28 percent of adults having a college degree, is slightly above state average and well-above the national average.

=== Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas ===

The Albany-Schenectady-Troy NY Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget. The MSA includes Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, and Schoharie counties; this area makes up a large portion of the Capital District. As of the 2020 census, the Albany-Schenectady-Troy MSA had a population of 899,262.

=== Combined Statistical Area ===
The Albany-Schenectady NY Combined Statistical Area (CSA) includes 10 of the 11 counties in the Capital District (excluding only Greene County). The Albany-Schenectady-Troy NY Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) combines with the Glens Falls MSA (consisting of Warren and Washington counties) and three Micropolitan Statistical Areas to make up the Albany-Schenectady NY Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The three Micropolitan Statistical Areas within the CSA are the Gloversville (μSA) (formed in 1990), which consists of Fulton County; the Amsterdam μSA (also formed in 1990), which consists of Montgomery County; and the Hudson μSA (also formed in 1990), which consists of Columbia County.

As of the 2020 U.S. census, the Albany-Schenectady NY Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,190,727. Adding the 2020 population of Greene County (47,931) to the population of the CSA (1,190,727) yields a total 2020 Capital District population of 1,238,658.

== Congressional representation ==

The Capital District contains portions of three congressional districts: New York&#x27;s 19th, 20th, and 21st congressional districts. As of 2023, those three districts are represented by Marc Molinaro (R) (19th district), Paul Tonko (D) (20th district) and Elise Stefanik (R) (21st district), respectively.

== Education ==

=== School districts ===

In Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties there are 54 public school districts, each of which is under the umbrella of one of four Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) in the area: Capital Region BOCES, Questar III (Rensselaer-Columbia-Greene BOCES), Washington-Saratoga-Warren-Hamilton-Essex BOCES, or Hamilton-Fulton-Montgomery BOCES. Some of these districts cross county borders since school district boundaries are independent of town and county borders. The smallest district by student enrollment is North Greenbush Common School District, with 20 students in 2006 and the largest school district is Shenendehowa Central School District, with 9,745 students in the end of the 2008 school year. According to Niche.com and U.S. News &amp; World Report, Shaker High School in Latham, Niskayuna Central High School in Schenectady, Columbia High School in East Greenbush, and Bethlehem Central Senior High School in Delmar are the highest ranked public high schools in the Capital District.

=== Colleges and universities ===
The largest educational institution in the Capital District is the University at Albany, one of the four major university centers of the State University of New York.

Founded in 1795, Union College was the alma mater of President Chester A. Arthur.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy is the oldest continuously existing technical university in the English-speaking world.

== Transportation ==

Albany has long been at the forefront of transportation technology from the days of turnpikes and plank roads to the Erie Canal, from the first passenger railroad in the state to the oldest municipal airport in the nation. Today, Interstates, Amtrak, and the Albany International Airport continue to make the Capital District a major crossroads of the Northeastern United States.

=== Interstate and other major highways ===

East-west Interstate 90 (I-90) and north–south Interstate 87 (I-87) meet at Exit 24 of the Thomas E. Dewey New York State Thruway in the Capital District. Exit 24 is the busiest exit on the Thruway. I-87 parallels the much older US Route 9W south of Albany and US Route 9 north and I-90 parallels New York State Route 5 west from Albany; all three highways are still important for local and regional traffic despite the proximity of the Interstates.

=== Mass transit ===

The four core counties of the Capital District are served by buses of the Capital District Transportation Authority, which has transit hubs in the three principal cities of Albany, Schenectady, and Troy. There is also express bus service between Saratoga Springs and Albany. The CDTA serves a large part of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady counties. The city of Mechanicville, Saratoga County runs a public transit service on four routes which cover the city and the surrounding suburbs in the towns of Stillwater and Halfmoon in Saratoga County and the hamlet of Hemstreet Park in the town of Schaghticoke, Rensselaer County. CDTA also serves Bolton Landing (May to October), Glens Falls, Hudson Falls, Fort Edward, Lake George, Queensbury, and South Glens Falls. Gloversville Transit System (GTS) serves Gloversville, Johnstown, and Amsterdam.

=== Cities with intercity bus service to outside the region ===

* Albany: Greyhound Lines, Trailways, and Peter Pan Bus Lines buses all serve a downtown terminal. Chinatown bus lines leave from Central Avenue with service to Chinatown, Manhattan.
* Schenectady: Greyhound and Trailways serve a downtown terminal on State Street.
* Glens Falls: Greyhound and Trailways serve a downtown terminal.
* Gloversville: Greyhound and Trailway serve a downtown terminal on West Fulton Street.

=== Airports ===
Nine of the 11 counties in the Capital District make up the Upper Hudson Region as defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In 1978 the FAA assigned the Capital District Regional Planning Commission to be responsible for this region&#x27;s aviation system planning and to provide technical assistance. The Upper Hudson Region has 26 airports open to public use, with 13 designated as system airports. Those 13 airports are:

* Albany International Airport in Colonie, Albany County, the only commercial service airport;
* Schenectady County Airport in Glenville, Schenectady County;
* Saratoga County Airport in Milton, Saratoga County;
* Columbia County Airport in Columbia County;
* Fulton County Airport in Johnstown, Fulton County;

* Duanesburg Airport in Duanesburg, Schenectady County;
* Burello-Mechanicville Airport in Schaghticoke, Rensselaer County;
* Plateau Sky Ranch in Edinburg, Saratoga County;
* Sharon Airport in Sharon, Schoharie County;
* Maben Airport in Prattsville, Greene County.

=== Rail ===

The Adirondack (north to Montreal, Quebec and south to the city of New York), Empire Service (west to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, south to New York), Ethan Allen Express (northeast to Burlington, Vermont and south to New York), Maple Leaf (west to Toronto and south to New York), Berkshire Flyer (east to Pittsfield and south to New York), and the Lake Shore Limited (at Albany-Rensselaer separate routes from Boston and New York merge to one train west to Chicago, on way east one train splits to two, one east to Boston another south to New York). Amtrak stations in the region are:

* Albany-Rensselaer station in Rensselaer County
* Schenectady station in Schenectady County

<text>Humphry Fortescue Osmond (1 July 1917 – 6 February 2004) was an English psychiatrist who moved to Canada and later the United States. He is known for inventing the word &quot;&quot; and for his research into interesting and useful applications for psychedelic drugs. Osmond also explored aspects of the psychology of social environments, in particular how they influenced welfare or recovery in mental institutions.

==Biography==
Osmond was born in Surrey, England, and educated at Haileybury. As a young man, he worked for an architect and attended Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School at King&#x27;s College London. Following service as a surgeon-lieutenant in the Navy during World War II, Osmond trained to become a psychiatrist.

===Work with psychedelics ===

After the war, Osmond joined the psychiatric unit at St George&#x27;s Hospital, London, where he rose to become senior registrar. His time at the hospital proved pivotal in three respects: it was where he met his wife Amy &quot;Jane&quot; Roffey, who was working there as a nurse; he met John Smythies, who became one of his major collaborators; and he first encountered the drugs that became associated with his name, LSD and mescaline. While researching the drugs at St George&#x27;s, Osmond noticed that they produced similar effects to schizophrenia and became convinced that the disease was caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. These ideas were not well received amongst the psychiatric community in London at the time. In 1951, Osmond and Smythies moved to Saskatchewan, Canada, to join the staff of the Weyburn Mental Hospital.

At Weyburn, Osmond recruited a group of research psychologists to turn the hospital into a design-research laboratory. There, he conducted a wide variety of patient studies and observations using hallucinogenic drugs, collaborating with Abram Hoffer and others. In 1952, Osmond related the similarity of mescaline to adrenaline molecules, in a theory that implied that schizophrenia might be a form of self-intoxication caused by one&#x27;s own body. He collected the biographies of recovered schizophrenics and held that psychiatrists can understand the schizophrenic only by understanding the rational way the mind makes sense of distorted perceptions. He pursued this idea with passion, exploring all avenues to gain insight into the shattered perceptions of schizophrenia, holding that the illness arises primarily from distortions of perception. Yet during the same period, Osmond became interested in the potential of psychedelics to foster mind-expanding and mystical experiences.

In 1953, Aldous Huxley was a renowned poet and playwright who, in his twenties, had gone on to achieve success and acclaim as a novelist and widely published essayist. He had lived in the U.S. for well over a decade and gained some experience screenwriting for Hollywood films. Huxley had initiated a correspondence with Osmond. In one letter, Huxley lamented that contemporary education seemed typically to have the unintended consequence of constricting the minds of the educated, closing students&#x27; minds to inspiration and many things other than material success and consumerism. In a letter, Huxley asked Osmond whether he would be kind enough to supply a dose of mescaline.

In May of that year, Osmond travelled to the US for a conference and, while there, gave Huxley the requested mescaline and supervised the ensuing experience in Huxley&#x27;s neighborhood. As a result of his experience, Huxley wrote the book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; in the months following his first mescaline encounter. Huxley was disappointed that the effects that he had expected and hoped for following his correspendence with Osmond did not occur. In the book, he attributed this to aphantasia—the inability to picture something in one&#x27;s mind. Instead, he re-experienced his everyday surroundings, describing his heightened &#x27;objective&#x27; awareness of the folds in his trousers, the drapes in the room, artwork, a drugstore, and the look of the Hollywood Hills while under the influence of mescaline. Osmond&#x27;s name appears in four footnotes in the book&#x27;s early pages (in references to articles he wrote about medicinal use of hallucinogenic drugs).

Osmond was respected and trusted enough that in 1955 he was approached by Christopher Mayhew, a politician, and guided Mayhew through a mescaline trip that was filmed for broadcast by the BBC. Though the recording was deemed too controversial and ultimately omitted from the show, Mayhew praised the experience, calling it &quot;the most interesting thing I ever did&quot;. Part of the footage was included in the 1986 BBC documentary &quot;LSD – The Beyond Within&quot;.

Osmond and Abram Hoffer were taught a way to &quot;maximize the LSD experience&quot; by the influential layman Al Hubbard, who came to Weyburn. Thereafter they adopted some of Hubbard&#x27;s methods.

Osmond first proposed the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; at a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1956. He said the word meant &quot;mind-manifesting&quot; (from &quot;mind&quot;, ψυχή (psyche), and &quot;manifest&quot;, δήλος (delos)) and called it &quot;clear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations.&quot; Huxley had sent Osmond a rhyme containing his own suggested invented word: &quot;To make this mundane world sublime, just half a gram of phanerothyme&quot; (θυμός (thymos) meaning &#x27;spiritedness&#x27; in Ancient Greek.) Osmond countered with &quot;To fall in Hell or soar Angelic, you&#x27;ll need a pinch of psychedelic&quot; (Alternative version: &quot;To fathom Hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic&quot;

Osmond is also known for a study in the late 1950s in which he attempted to cure alcoholics with LSD. He claimed to have achieved a 50% success rate. Osmond noticed that some drinkers were only able to give up drinking after an episode of delirium tremens and tried to replicate this state in patients by giving them high doses of the drug. This came to be known as the psychedelic treatment model, contrasted to the psycholytic model that used low doses to help release repressed material from the mind which it was hoped would help the psychotherapeutic process. One of Osmond&#x27;s patients during this time was Bill W., co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. But with psychedelics&#x27; growing reputation for enabling spiritual insight, Bill W. hoped to recapture a mystical state of consciousness that he had experienced, years earlier, without a drug.

===Involvement with the Native American Church===
Osmond participated in a Native American Church ceremony in which he ingested peyote, regarded by the Native Americans as sacred. His hosts were Plains Indians, members of the Red Pheasant Band. The all-night ceremony took place at Cando, Saskatchewan, near North Battleford (in the region of the South Saskatchewan River). Osmond published his report on the experience in &quot;Tomorrow&quot; magazine, Spring 1961. He reported details of the ceremony, the environment in which it took place, the peyote&#x27;s effects, his hosts&#x27; courtesy, and his conjectures about the experience&#x27;s meaning for them and for the Native American Church.

===Other interests===
Peripherally related to his interest in drug-assisted therapeutics, Osmond conducted research on the long-term effects of institutionalization. He had interpreted and described the peyote ceremony he had experienced, with its tepee setting and its particular social pattern, in terms that drew attention to its contrast with the psychiatric institutions of his day. Osmond began a line of research into what he called &quot;socio-architecture&quot; to improve patient settings, coining the terms &quot;sociofugal&quot; and &quot;sociopetal&quot;, starting Robert Sommer&#x27;s career, and contributing to environmental psychology. (&quot;&quot; refers to a grouping of people arranged so that each can maintain some privacy from the others, while &quot;&quot; refers to a grouping of people arranged so that each can see and interact with the others.)

Osmond&#x27;s interests included the application of Jung&#x27;s Typology of personality to group dynamics. He and Richard Smoke developed refinements of Jung&#x27;s typology and applied them to analysis of the presidents and other world figures. Osmond also studied parapsychology.

Later, Osmond became director of the Bureau of Research in Neurology and Psychiatry at the New Jersey Neuro Psychiatric Institute (NJNPI) in Princeton, where he collaborated with Bernard Aaronson in hypnosis experiments. Still later, he became a professor of psychology at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. Osmond co-wrote 11 books and was widely published throughout his career.

Osmond died of cardiac arrhythmia in 2004.
