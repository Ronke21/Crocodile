<text>Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Needles Hallowell (November 3, 1836 – July 26, 1871) was an officer in the Union Army in the duration of the American Civil War, commanding the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry following the death of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner in 1863.

==Early life==
Edward grew up in a well-to-do Quaker family in Philadelphia. His father Morris was part owner and operator of Hallowell &amp; Company of 33 South Third Street, Philadelphia. The firm predominantly imported and sold silk from India and China. Edward&#x27;s father was also a passionate abolitionist. The Hallowell family was far more than passive meeting attenders. The family&#x27;s summer home was employed as a stop on the Underground Railroad.

Edward and the other children of Morris and Hannah shared the abolitionist views of their parents. His brother Richard Price Hallowell was one of the members of the &quot;Black Committee&quot; that Governor Andrew of Massachusetts selected to inquire of the willingness of prospective candidates to serve in officer positions in the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.

He had two children, Charlott and Emily Hallowell, with his wife, Charlotte Bartlett Wilhelmina Swett. Hallowell was a stockbroker before the war and became a wool commission merchant after the war.

==Civil War service==
In early 1862 Edward joined his brother Norwood Penrose &quot;Pen&quot; Hallowell, who was already serving in the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He served as a lieutenant. While he was in the 20th, the regiment saw considerable action including the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days, Antietam and Fredericksburg.

Lt. Edward Hallowell then accepted an appointment in the 54th Massachusetts, which was to be led by Robert Gould Shaw as colonel and his brother Norwood as lieutenant colonel. The regiment was to be made up of white and black abolitionists fighting together for black freedom. Edward recruited African-American soldiers in Philadelphia and was actually the first officer to occupy the barracks set aside for the 54th at Camp Meigs in Reedville. Recruiting for the regiment proved so successful that a second regiment, the 55th, was formed. Norwood Hallowell was designated as the 55th&#x27;s colonel and Edward was promoted to major and was second-in-command to Shaw.

By the time of the famous assault by the 54th on Fort Wagner Hallowell was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In the assault on Fort Wagner he commanded the left wing with half the regiment&#x27;s companies. Because of the narrow defile through which the 54th had to pass the left wing was deployed directly behind Shaw and the right wing. Hallowell suffered three wounds in the assault and went home to recuperate. Upon returning he commanded the 54th as a full colonel for the rest of the war, except when he was in temporary command of a brigade.

The 54th and Hallowell continued to serve with distinction during the war. He fought at the Battle of Olustee, the Battle of Honey Hill and the Battle of Boykin&#x27;s Mill. At Boykin&#x27;s Mill, Hallowell was in command of Major General Potter&#x27;s 3rd Brigade. When the fortifications around Charleston fell along with the city it was the 54th under Hallowell that occupied various former Confederate posts including Fort Sumter and Fort Wagner. Additionally, the 54th guarded Confederate prisoners of war during this time, including some whom they had faced at Fort Wagner.

==Post War years==
Hallowell was mustered out of the Union Army volunteer service on August 20, 1865. Hallowell marched with the Massachusetts members of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment at a post-war victory review held in Boston in December 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Hallowell for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from June 27, 1865 for &quot;meritorious services&quot; during the war. The United States Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866.

After the war Edward returned to Medford and became a wool commission merchant. His wounds from the war undoubtedly cut his life short and he died in 1871. He is buried with his wife Charlotte at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.

==Legacy==
The character of Major Cabot Forbes in the film &quot;Glory&quot; is based somewhat on Edward Hallowell and his brother. Little lasting recognition of either Edward or his brother Norwood exists. One exception is at the famous Union Club off of Boston Common which has meeting rooms dedicated to Edward and Norwood as well as Robert Gould Shaw.

<doc id="495855" wikidata="Q7822730" url="?curid=495855" title="Tony Kornheiser">
<text>Anthony Irwin Kornheiser (; born July 13, 1948) is an American television sports talk show host and former sportswriter and columnist. Kornheiser is best known for his endeavors in three forms of media: as a writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 1979 to 2008, as a co-host of ESPN&#x27;s Emmy Award-winning sports debate show &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; since 2001, and as the host of &quot;The Tony Kornheiser Show&quot;, a radio show and podcast. Longtime ESPN executive John Walsh once declared that &quot;in the history of sports media, [Kornheiser] is the most multitalented person ever.&quot;

==Early life==
Kornheiser was born in New York City and raised in nearby Lynbrook. He was the only child of Estelle (&quot;née&quot; Rosenthal; 1915–1978) and Ira Kornheiser (1910–2000). His father was a dress cutter. During his youth, Kornheiser spent his summers at Camp Keeyumah in Pennsylvania. One of his counselors was future NCAA and NBA basketball coach Larry Brown. Kornheiser attended George W. Hewlett High School, where he was the sports editor of the school newspaper. He graduated in 1965.

After high school, Kornheiser went to Harpur College (now Binghamton University), where he majored in English literature and began his journalism career at the &quot;Colonial News&quot; (now called &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;). He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1970. Kornheiser has frequently spoken positively of his college years. For a brief period of time after college, he worked with children with disabilities.

==Print career==
=== Early writing career ===
Kornheiser began his career in New York City, where he wrote for &quot;Newsday&quot; between 1970 and 1976. His first work at &quot;Newsday&quot; consisted of covering high school sports. Kornheiser then moved to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where he wrote between 1976 and 1979.

In 1979, George Solomon recruited Kornheiser to join &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a general assignment reporter in Style and Sports. In 1980, Kornheiser also authored a profile of Nolan Ryan that served as the cover story for the charter issue of &quot;Inside Sports&quot;. He became a full-time sports columnist at the &quot;Post&quot; in 1984. He also began writing columns for the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s Style Section on November 12, 1989.

In the 1990s, Kornheiser usually wrote three columns per week, which were a Tuesday column and a Thursday column in the Sports Section and a Sunday column (written for a more general audience) in the Style Section. He also started working for ESPN Radio in 1997 and kept his column at the &quot;Post&quot;. As part of his ESPN Radio contract, Kornheiser wrote columns called &quot;Parting Shots&quot; for &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; between 1998 and 2000.

=== Writing style ===
Kornheiser&#x27;s columns were usually sarcastic with touches of humor. The most distinct style of his columns was that he often used an alter ego in italics to question his points of views for self-deprecation, like &quot;Excuse me, Tony...&quot; At times, he would also use exaggeration for the sake of humor. According to Stephanie Mansfield of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Kornheiser was regarded by many as &quot;the wittiest columnist&quot; in American newspapers. Robert Weintraub of the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; praised him, in retrospect, for his &quot;blend of beauty and precision.&quot; Kornheiser was also capable of being &quot;deadly serious&quot; when need be.

=== The Bandwagon columns ===
In 1991, Kornheiser created a string of now-famous Bandwagon columns to describe the Washington Redskins&#x27; Super Bowl run that year. He first came up with the idea when the Redskins trounced the Detroit Lions, 45–0, in the opening game of the season. He officially unveiled the first &quot;Bandwagon&quot; column when the team had an undefeated 4–0 record. From then on, the Bandwagon column appeared every Tuesday, celebrating &quot;the fun and hilarity of sports.&quot; As the season progressed and the team&#x27;s performances improved, a growing number of fans read the Bandwagon column in earnest.

When the Redskins advanced to Super Bowl XXVI, Kornheiser and his &quot;Post&quot; colleagues Jeanne McManus and Norman Chad drove in a 38-foot recreational vehicle decorated as the Bandwagon for a 1,200-mile journey to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Kornheiser later described the Bandwagon columns as &quot;the most fun I ever had as a writer.&quot;

=== Late writing career ===
In the early 2000s – because of his work on both radio and &quot;Pardon the Interruption –&quot; Kornheiser stopped writing Style Section columns and only wrote one column a week. His last Style Section column was published on September 30, 2001. Three of his books – &quot;Pumping Irony&quot;, &quot;Bald as I Wanna Be&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Back for More Cash –&quot; are compilations of his Style Section columns.

In 2005, Kornheiser started to write short columns called &quot;A Few Choice Words&quot; with his photo in the Post&#x27;s Sports Section. These short, sports-related columns appeared on the second page of the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s Sports section and were much shorter than the full-length columns Kornheiser used to write for the paper. This was the first time that the &quot;Post&quot; displayed a columnist&#x27;s photo beside his column. He called these short columns &quot;columnettes,&quot; writing three per week unless he had other duties. He did not write columns between April 26, 2006, and August 7, 2006, to prepare as an analyst of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Starting August 8, 2006, he wrote columns called &quot;Monday Night Diary&quot; to describe his adventures on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. His short-column space was later replaced by Dan Steinberg&#x27;s &quot;D.C. Sports Bog&quot;.

On May 14, 2008, it was announced that Kornheiser had accepted a buyout from the &quot;Post&quot;. &quot;I love the paper. They were great to me every day that I was there,&quot; he told &quot;Reuters&quot;. &quot;But I don&#x27;t do much for the paper anymore.&quot; Kornheiser had not written a regular column for the paper&#x27;s print edition since 2006. However, Kornheiser and Wilbon continued to tape a &quot;Talking Points&quot; mini online TV feature for the &quot;Washington Post&quot; until June 2, 2009, when an installment termed the final one was posted on the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s site. In it Wilbon says he thinks there will be further installments while Kornheiser seems certain it is a permanent decision management has made.

On May 20, 2010, Kornheiser said on his radio show that in fact he was fired by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, saying &quot;they fired me in a despicable way.&quot; On September 11, 2013, Kornheiser repeated his account: &quot;Raju Narisetti fired me from the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and I hate his guts.&quot;

==Radio and podcast career==
=== Radio era ===
Kornheiser hosted &quot;The Tony Kornheiser Show&quot; first locally on WTEM – known as Sports Radio 570 – in Washington, D.C. between May 25, 1992, and November 14, 1997. The Kornheiser-led show was part of WTEM&#x27;s original lineup. The show was then syndicated by ESPN Radio between January 5, 1998, and March 26, 2004. He was back on WTEM locally between November 10, 2004, and April 28, 2006, after which point Kornheiser put the show on hiatus in order to prepare for his duties with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. His show was also carried for a short while by XM Satellite Radio, airing between February 28, 2005, and April 28, 2006.

After completing the 2006 season on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Kornheiser signed with WTWP, Washington Post Radio, to relaunch his radio show on February 20, 2007. The show aired live from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and was then replayed from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. XM Radio carried his show on a thirty-minute delay, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., beginning March 5, 2007, on XM Sports Nation, Channel 144. Kornheiser went on hiatus from the show following the June 28, 2007, broadcast because of his &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; duties. The show was hosted by David Burd and included the same supporting cast. The show was called &quot;The Tony Kornheiser Show Starring David Burd&quot; during the hiatus.

Kornheiser returned to the show as the full-time host from January 21, 2008, to June 27, 2008, after which point WWWT – the successor to WTWP – declined to renew his contract due to declining ratings. The show aired live from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and was replayed from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m on WWWT, as well as on XM Sports Nation, XM channel 144 from 8:15 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. He announced during this period in 2008 that he would not be back on the radio until he was done with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

&quot;The Tony Kornheiser Show&quot; was on the air daily Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to noon on Washington, D.C. radio station WTEM and streamed live on the station&#x27;s website, ESPN980.com, until June 2016. The show was also available as a podcast. There was originally a 24-hour &quot;podcast delay,&quot; a source of many jokes amongst fans and show members alike. The delay ended in 2015, allowing listeners to download episodes a few minutes after the live broadcast.

=== Podcast era ===
On June 2, 2016, Kornheiser announced that his show will be relaunched as a podcast-only show. According to Kornheiser, the reason to do a podcast-only show was to own his content and do the podcast a little closer to his home. However, the show format would still be the same as the radio show, albeit slightly shorter in length. Kornheiser&#x27;s son, Michael, handled the social media for the podcast and launched a website with information about how to subscribe.

On September 6, 2016, Kornheiser returned from his summer vacation with the first full episode of the new podcast. The first episode was titled &quot;We&#x27;re Back!!! The Tony Kornheiser Show Returns&quot; and ran for 1 hour and four minutes. Most parts of the old show – including &quot;Old Guy Radio&quot; and the Mailbag – were retained. Gary Braun and Chris Cillizza joined Kornheiser in studio. Michael Wilbon of &quot;ESPN&quot; and Steve Sands of the Golf Channel were the first guests joining by phone.

The podcast-only show is produced in partnership with sports talent agency IMG and on-demand audio company DGital Media. The podcast is available at 11 a.m. ET via iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher, and TuneIn.

Throughout its many iterations, a central quality of the show has been its eagerness to discuss issues other than sports, including news, politics, entertainment, and the idiosyncrasies of modern life. In its early years, the show amassed a large and loyal following that remains to this day. The fans – who refer to themselves as &quot;littles&quot; – have an annual musical convention and use &quot;La Cheeserie&quot; as a catch phrase (in reference to a cheese counter at D.C.-area liquor store Calvert Woodley).

==Television career==
Kornheiser appeared on a local weekly Washington Redskins TV show during the NFL football season on Washington&#x27;s Channel 50 in the early 1980s with Pete Wysocki, a popular former Redskins linebacker and local hero, which was televised from a local restaurant/bar in Washington, D.C. called &quot;Champions.&quot;

He appeared on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; beginning in 1988 and continuing during the 1990s. He sometimes guest-hosted the program when the then-host of the show, Dick Schaap, was away. He was also a panelist on &quot;Full Court Press&quot; hosted by George Michael on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. during the NFL off-season until that show was canceled in December 2008 due to budget cuts. He also made a number of appearances on &quot;Redskins Report&quot; on WRC. He has appeared on numerous other ESPN productions, including &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Number One?&quot;, and multiple player&#x27;s/sportspeople&#x27;s profiles for &quot;SportsCentury&quot;.

===Pardon the Interruption===

&quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; (abbreviated &quot;PTI&quot;) is a sports television show that airs weekdays on various ESPN TV channels, TSN, BT Sport ESPN, XM, and Sirius satellite radio services, and as a downloadable podcast. On &quot;PTI&quot;, Kornheiser and co-host Michael Wilbon discuss, and frequently argue over, the top stories of the day in &quot;sports... and other stuff&quot; (as Kornheiser put it in the show&#x27;s original promo).

Kornheiser&#x27;s lively segments with Wilbon on the radio and on &quot;Full Court Press –&quot; which mirrored their actual discussions in the newsroom of &quot;The Washington Post –&quot; sparked the idea for &quot;PTI&quot; well before the end of his run at ESPN Radio. The show won a Sports Emmy Award for best Daily Outstanding Studio Show in 2010, 2017, and 2019.

===Monday Night Football===

When &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; moved from ABC to ESPN, Kornheiser received and accepted an offer to be a color analyst on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in early 2006. He was originally passed over in favor of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; commentator Joe Theismann; however, when play-by-play man Al Michaels left ABC to call &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; for NBC, Kornheiser was brought in alongside Theismann and new play-by-play announcer Mike Tirico. As such, Kornheiser was part of the broadcast team covering the New Orleans Saints&#x27; 23–3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the Saints&#x27; first game in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina.

Unlike Wilbon, Kornheiser does most episodes of &quot;PTI&quot; in-studio due to his self-admitted fear of flying. Prior to joining &quot;MNF&quot;, his last trips outside of the studio were to cover Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans and to attend the NFL owners meetings in Orlando in 2006; Kornheiser both times traveled via train, though returned from the Orlando trip via airplane. On the April 6, 2006 edition of &quot;PTI&quot;, he expressed his dismay at the amount of travel required for &quot;MNF&quot;. Though he has mentioned on his radio program that he is taking steps to overcome his aviophobia, he in fact spent a five-week period on the road traveling to mainly western &quot;MNF&quot; sites, doing &quot;PTI&quot; via satellite.

Kornheiser returned for a second season of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. On January 9, 2007, Kornheiser told &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;If they would like to have me back, my inclination is that I would like to do it again.&quot;

On May 18, 2009, ESPN announced that Kornheiser would be leaving &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; due to fear of flying. Former Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Jon Gruden replaced Kornheiser in the &quot;MNF&quot; booth.

==Entertainment==
The 2004–2005 sitcom &quot;Listen Up&quot;, which aired on CBS, was loosely based on Kornheiser&#x27;s life. It featured Jason Alexander as Tony Kleinman. The sitcom&#x27;s material mostly came from Kornheiser&#x27;s columns (collected in &quot;I&#x27;m Back for More Cash&quot;) that he contributed to the &quot;Style&quot; section of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, which took a humorous view of his family life.

Kornheiser had a cameo appearance as a bar patron in a 2015 episode of &quot;The Americans&quot;.

In June 2016, Kornheiser participated in the roast of political commentator and strategist James Carville.

==Restaurant==
In January 2017, it was announced that Kornheiser was part of a new ownership group for Chad&#x27;s (formerly Chadwick&#x27;s), a bar and restaurant located in the Friendship Heights area of Washington, D.C. The group also included former Maryland basketball coach Gary Williams, TV host Maury Povich, and D.C. businessman and socialite Alan Bubes. Kornheiser is quoted as saying: &quot;Did I always want to be part of a restaurant? No. But now with a podcast and trying to own my own content, the ability to put it on during the mornings or during the day and to have other people use it, that would be fun for me.&quot;

In April 2017, Kornheiser announced that Chad&#x27;s would be renamed Chatter. The new owners made several improvements, including remodeling the interior and adding a podcast studio. Kornheiser began recording episodes of &quot;The Tony Kornheiser Show&quot; at Chatter on May 1, 2017. Many fans of the show visited the restaurant to listen live.

On June 28, 2019, Kornheiser announced that the podcast would move to a new location after the summer break due to the closure of Chatter.

== Personal life ==
Kornheiser currently resides in the Chevy Chase neighborhood of Washington, D.C., as well as Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with his wife Karril. They have two children, Michael and Elizabeth. Kornheiser is Jewish.

Kornheiser was a member of the Young Democrats club while in high school. As of 1990, Kornheiser was a registered Republican, although he did so because his wife was a registered Democrat and the couple wanted to &quot;receive mailings from both sides.&quot; Later, he referred to the decision to register as a Republican as a &quot;mistake.&quot; Kornheiser voted for Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. During a podcast episode released on January 31, 2017, Kornheiser stated: &quot;I land on the liberal side of the fence almost all the time, certainly on social issues.&quot;

Kornheiser has a pronounced fear of flying. He regularly goes to bed early. He can name all fifty U.S. states and their capitals in alphabetical order.

In 2006, Kornheiser revealed that he had skin cancer and had received treatment.

==Criticism==
=== General ===
While earning a name as a critic of many people and organizations, he has appeared sensitive to criticism directed toward his own work.

Stephen Rodrick wrote for &quot;Slate&quot; that Kornheiser was allowed by ESPN to argue aimlessly on television and that his &quot;Washington Post&quot; column was being used to plug side projects rather than gather news from cited sources. Kornheiser called on Slate, owned by the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; parent company, to fire Rodrick.

After Kornheiser&#x27;s first game on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Paul Farhi wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Kornheiser had emphasized the obvious, played third fiddle, and was reminiscent of Dennis Miller &quot;in a bad way.&quot; Kornheiser responded during an interview on &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; on August 15, 2006, saying that Farhi was a &quot;two-bit weasel slug&quot; and his own newspaper had back-stabbed him. His response generated more criticism from media outlets, including the &quot;Post&quot;. Other criticism came from Toronto Argonauts play-by-play commentator Mike Hogan, who said, &quot;The thing that really bothers me is that Kornheiser doesn&#x27;t seem to know his place. If you&#x27;re there for comic relief, that&#x27;s one thing. But for God&#x27;s sake, leave the football analysis to guys who actually played the game.&quot; Former NFL offensive lineman Mike Schad also criticized Kornheiser, saying that &quot;when people watch a game, they want to learn something. I don&#x27;t need a guy who&#x27;s sarcastic or trying to be funny. I love listening to Ron Jaworski on Monday Nights. He played the game and has lots of good insight and Kornheiser just gets in his way.&quot;

Mike Golic – an ESPN colleague of Kornheiser&#x27;s who had expressed skepticism regarding the latter&#x27;s prospects as an on-air analyst because he was never an athlete – said that Kornheiser&#x27;s performance on &quot;MNF&quot; was &quot;fine.&quot; Kornheiser&#x27;s response was, &quot;I just want to wring Golic&#x27;s neck and hang him up over the back of a shower rod like a duck.&quot;

=== Controversial remarks ===
During a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; telecast on September 15, 2008, Kornheiser made a comment about a clip of the ESPN Deportes crew&#x27;s call of a Felix Jones touchdown, saying, “I took high-school Spanish, and that either means ‘nobody is going to touch him’ or ‘could you pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.’” Later in the broadcast, Kornheiser apologized on-air for the remark.

On February 23, 2010, it emerged that ESPN had suspended Kornheiser for two weeks for comments he made on his radio show about fellow high-profile ESPN personality Hannah Storm&#x27;s wardrobe that day.
In March 2010, Kornheiser commented: &quot;The last time I looked, the roads were made for automobiles...We&#x27;re going to be dominated as if this was Beijing by hundreds of thousands of bicyclists... They all wear... my God... with the little water bottle in the back and the stupid hats and their shiny shorts. They are the same disgusting poseurs that in the middle of a snowstorm come out with cross-country skiing on your block. Run &#x27;em down... Let them use the right, I’m okay with that. I don’t take my car and ride on the sidewalk because I understand that’s not for my car... Why do these people think that these roads were built for bicycles?... They dare you to run them down.&quot; Cyclist Lance Armstrong replied. &quot;Disgusting, ignorant, foolish. What a complete f-ing idiot.&quot; Kornheiser later apologized to Armstrong on-air and offered to go on a bike ride with him.

In June 2010, Green Bay Packer quarterback Aaron Rodgers criticized Kornheiser&#x27;s performance on Monday Night Football, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s terrible... I don’t think he’s funny. I don’t think he’s insightful. I don’t think he knows, really, anything about sports.&quot; Rodgers also criticized ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski and other ESPN employees during the interview. Kornheiser responded in an interview by saying: &quot;If he thinks I&#x27;m no good, he wouldn&#x27;t be the first. Or the last,&quot; and &quot;I tried to establish some rapport with that. I guess that rapport didn&#x27;t exist.&quot; The two have since reconciled. Kornheiser and Rodgers even played a round of golf together with Barack Obama and Mark Kelly in April 2016.

In October 2015, Kornheiser was interviewing Huffington Post editor Howard Fineman about the conservative movement in Congress when he asked if Tea Party members are &quot;like ISIS trying to establish a caliphate here,&quot; which Fineman called a &quot;good analogy&quot; but without the violence.

== Honors ==
Kornheiser was a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.

In 2008, Kornheiser was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2012, Kornheiser was ranked No. 8 in the list of the 100 most important sports talk radio hosts in America compiled by Talkers Magazine. In 2016, the &quot;Tony Kornheiser Show&quot; was ranked No. 1 as America&#x27;s Top 20 Local Sports Midday Shows for 2015 by Barrett Sports Media.

In May 2017, Binghamton University – Kornheiser&#x27;s alma mater – awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.

On July 9, 2017, Kornheiser was inducted into the Washington, D.C. Sports Hall of Fame alongside such notable names as Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky and former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.

On October 4, 2017, Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon shared the National Press Club&#x27;s 2017 Fourth Estate Award, which &quot;recognizes journalists who have made significant contributions to the field.&quot;

==White House visits==
On July 12, 2013, Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon and Tony Reali were guests at the White House. After lunch, the trio met in the Oval Office with President Barack Obama. Obama invited Kornheiser and Wilbon to play golf with him the following day, which happened to be Kornheiser&#x27;s 65th birthday.

Kornheiser also played golf with Obama on a number of other occasions, including in September 2013, June 2014, July 2014, July 2015, April 2016, and May 2016.

<text>The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) is a non-profit organisation based in Munich, Germany, dedicated to establishing a free market in information technology, by the removal of barriers to competition. The FFII played a key organisational role and was very active in the campaign which resulted in the rejection of the EU software patent directive in July 2005.

CNET awarded the FFII the Outstanding contribution to software development award for this work, which was the result of years of research, policy, and action. After the July 2005 victory, FFII has continued to defend a free and competitive software market by working towards adequate patent systems and open standards. Currently the FFII fights against software patents lobbies, not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world.

It was founded as a German registered association under the name &quot;Förderverein für eine Freie Informationelle Infrastruktur (FFII) e.V.&quot; in 1999 by developer and far-right politics activist Hartmut Pilch.

== Views ==
FFII&#x27;s view is that software patents present a burden, not a benefit to society. It backs this position up citing extensive studies. FFII is a European NGO on this issue. Through its partnership with many other European organisations with the same goal, it has a reach across all nations of the EU.

FFII has been active on this front since 2000 when, according to the FFII, an attempt to change the European Patent Convention to legitimise software patents failed. In 2003, it strongly but indirectly lobbied the European Parliament against the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.

The EuroLinux anti-software-patent petition, supported and promoted by FFII, was signed by more than 1,500 SMEs, many thousand software developers, tens of thousands of software users system administrators as well as a number of scientists, academics and economists for a total of 400,000 signatories.
FFII organises conferences about the topic, usually in Brussels, such as the conference which took place on April 14, 2004 together with a demonstration of more than 400 people against software patents the one on November 9–10, 2004. In Karlsruhe, FFII organised a demonstration of about 1,000 people against software patents. In 2005 FFII organised an &quot;online demo&quot; supported by 1,200 web sites.

== Structure ==
The FFII was funded originally by donations from SuSE and Infomatec. The Open Society Institute has contributed regularly, as have Red Hat, and Stichting NLnet. The historical list of donors from 1999 to 2005 can be found on the FFII web site. 
Partners in Europe include EFFI, EuroLinux, FSF Europe, and SKOSI.

The FFII exists as a mother organisation with more or less formal chapters in many countries. The national FFII chapters (such as FFII France) handle national membership, media and lobbying, while the mother organisation operates at the EU level and in countries where there is no formal FFII organisation.

As of 14 December 2013, the FFII board consists of Benjamin Henrion (President), Rene Mages (Vice president), Stephan Uhlmann (Treasurer), André Rebentisch (Secretary), Hartmut Pilch.

== Campaigns ==
Besides software patents, FFII promotes various campaigns aimed at disencumbering computing and software development. These include supporting author&#x27;s rights and Interoperability enforcements, such as working to improve copyright regulation by providing technical analysis, amendments and voting recommendations that may influence the European Parliament.

<doc id="495862" wikidata="Q717441" url="?curid=495862" title="Alberto Salazar">
<text>Alberto Salazar (born August 7, 1958) is an American former track coach and long-distance runner. Born in Cuba, Salazar immigrated to the United States as a child with his family, living in Connecticut and then in Wayland, Massachusetts, where Salazar competed in track and field in high school. Salazar won the New York City Marathon three times in the early 1980s, and won the 1982 Boston Marathon in a race known as the &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;. He set American track records for 5,000 m and 10,000 m in 1982. Salazar was later the head coach of the Nike Oregon Project. He won the IAAF Coaching Achievement Award in 2013.

In 2015, Salazar was named in a joint BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; and ProPublica investigation into doping allegations. In 2019, Salazar was banned for four years from athletics for doping offenses involving athletes he coached. The Nike Oregon Project was shut down in the wake of the controversy.

In January 2020, the United States Center for SafeSport placed Salazar on its temporarily banned list while it investigated allegations against him involving sexual and emotional misconduct. SafeSport permanently banned him a year and a half later, in July 2021, after it found that he had committed four violations involving emotional and sexual misconduct. In December 2021, Salazar appealed the ban in arbitration but lost, making him permanently ineligible for any activity held by the USOPC or any sport&#x27;s USOPC-recognized National Governing Body.

==Early life and running career==

===High school===
Born in Cuba, Salazar grew up in Wayland, Massachusetts. His father Jose was a close friend of Fidel Castro and a revolutionary, who then became an opponent of the totalitarian communist regime and member of the anti-Castro movement. The younger Salazar was an outstanding high school runner who was state cross country champion in 1975. He trained with the well-known Greater Boston Track Club (whose members included the likes of Bill Rodgers, Randy Thomas, and Greg Meyer), where he was given the nickname of &quot;the rookie&quot;.

===Collegiate===
From Massachusetts, he went to the University of Oregon where he won numerous All-American honors, was a member of the 1977 NCAA cross country championship team, and won the individual NCAA cross country championship in 1978. Salazar won the 1978 NCAA national cross country championship in cold, snowy conditions, handing Track &amp; Field News Athlete of the Year Henry Rono one of his few losses of the year. He finished 2nd to Rono in a memorable contest at the 1979 NCAA national cross country championships at Lehigh University, in which Rono (28:19) and Salazar (28:28) ran the 3rd and 5th fastest 10,000-meter cross country times in NCAA championship history. Neither time has been matched in over three decades of NCAA cross country competition since then. After that, he finished third in the Olympic Trials 10,000-meter race in 28:10.42 to make the 1980 Olympic team (which didn&#x27;t compete in the Olympics in Moscow due to the U.S. boycott) and received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.

At the 1978 Falmouth Road Race after fading to 10th place, he collapsed at the finish with a temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7 °C) and was read his last rites prematurely.

At the 1981 Millrose Games in New York, he set an American indoor 5,000 meter record with a time of 13:21.2, finishing second behind Suleiman Nyambui, who broke the indoor world record with a 13:20.3.

===Post-collegiate===
From 1980 through 1982, Salazar won three consecutive New York City Marathons. His first-ever marathon was the 1980 race, which he won in 2:09:41, at the time the fastest American debut and the second-fastest time recorded by a U.S. runner (behind Bill Rodgers&#x27; 2:09:27 at Boston in 1979). He was on that week&#x27;s cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; after the victory. In 1981, Salazar set an apparent world record at the New York City Marathon of 2:08:13, surpassing the 12-year-old mark of 2:08:33 set by Australian Derek Clayton in 1969 in Antwerp, Belgium. However, the course was found on re-measurement to be about 148 meters short of the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) distance. This is equivalent to about 27 seconds.

In 1982 he won his first and only Boston Marathon after the memorable head-to-head with Dick Beardsley. Salazar won the race in an exciting sprint finish and collapsed at the end before being taken to an emergency room and given six liters of saline solution intravenously because he did not drink fluids during the race. Salazar ended the year ranked #1 in the world in the marathon by Track &amp; Field News magazine for his wins in Boston and New York, #1 in their North American Road Rankings for his American 10K road record win of 28:04 at the Orange Bowl 10K and his course record of 31:53 at the highly competitive Falmouth road race (his second win and course record there), #8 in the world (and #1 American with an AR of 13:11.93) in the 5,000 meters, and #2 in the world in the 10,000 meters, with three second-place finishes at Eugene (27:30.0), at Oslo in an American Record of 27:25.61, and at Paris (27:29.06).

Salazar enjoyed success in cross country competition, earning several All-American honors in collegiate and post-collegiate national championships. Salazar was also the U.S. national cross country champion in 1979. He fared well at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, finishing second in 1982 and fourth in 1983. His silver medal in 1982 marks the last time an American male runner reached the podium in World Cross Country.

In addition to a fourth-place finish (only one second behind the top three placers) at the 1983 world cross country championships, Salazar twice broke the American 10 km road record in 1983 with efforts of 28:02 and 28:01 at the Americas 10 km and Continental Homes 10 km respectively. He finished as the top ranker in Track &amp; Field News magazine&#x27;s North American Road Rankings for 1983. He was also the 10,000-meter national track champion in 1983, pulling away from Craig Virgin in the last straightaway at the U.S. championships in Indiana in June to win his second such title (the first coming in 1981). However, he finished last in the 10,000 meters at the World Track &amp; Field Championships while suffering from bronchitis and was beaten for the first time in the marathon, finishing fifth at the Rotterdam marathon in April (2:10:08) and then fifth again at Fukuoka in December (2:09:21). (The latter time would have been the American Record for the next 17 years except that there was a problem in filing the paperwork with the authorities.)

In 1984, after a 2nd-place finish by Salazar in the 10,000 meters at the Mt. SAC Relays in 27:45.5, he finished 2nd at the men&#x27;s Olympic marathon trials (2:11:44) to become a member of the United States Olympic Marathon Team, along with Pete Pfitzinger and John Tuttle. He was considered a favorite to win or medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics but finished a disappointing 15th in 2:14:19 under the hot Los Angeles sun.

Salazar&#x27;s competitive decline is often attributed to the stress on his body from that memorable &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; detailed in the eponymous book by John Brant. Salazar recounts falling into a &quot;more-is-better&quot; mindset which led him to reason that if 120 miles per week yielded a certain level of success, then or even would bring even better results. This intense and grueling regimen of such extremely long distances led to a breakdown of his immune system, and he found himself frequently sick, injured, and otherwise unable to continue training.

After failing to make the 1988 Olympic Marathon Team Salazar opened a successful restaurant in Eugene, Oregon. Although only able to stagger through four or five miles per run, he remained obsessed with training. Brant wrote that &quot;He couldn&#x27;t run, yet he couldn&#x27;t stop running.&quot; Salazar unsuccessfully visited the Stanford Sleep Clinic and a cardiologist, had surgery, and trained in Kenya. In 1994 he said that &quot;For most of the last 10 years, I hated running. I hated it with a passion. I used to wish for a cataclysmic injury in which I would lose one of my legs. I know that sounds terrible, but if I had lost a leg, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to torture myself anymore.&quot;

A doctor diagnosed Salazar&#x27;s running problems and exercise-induced asthma as largely due to the 1982 marathon, and successfully prescribed Prozac to improve his depression and physical symptoms. After Salazar closed the restaurant he owned, he began training again at the age of 34 and in 1994 won the prestigious Comrades Marathon. He soon retired from competing, believing that he had nothing left to prove as a runner, and became a running coach. Salazar stated that the medication played a role in motivating him to succeed again in professional running though the actual effect of the drug on his performance remains controversial.

==Post-competitive career==
After his competition career, Salazar moved into coaching. By 1996 this included middle-distance runner Mary Decker, who at the age of 37 qualified for the 5000 meters at the Atlanta Olympics. However, a urine test taken in June at the Olympic Trials showed a testosterone to epitestosterone (T/E) ratio greater than the allowable maximum of six to one. While Decker and her lawyers contended that the T/E ratio test is unreliable for women in their late 30s who are taking birth control pills, she was eliminated in the heats at the Olympics. In June 1997, the IAAF banned Decker from competition. Later reinstated by a USATF panel, the IAAF cleared her to compete but took the case to arbitration. In April 1999, the arbitration panel ruled against her, after which the IAAF through a retroactive ban stripped her of a silver medal she had won in the 1500 meters at the 1997 World Indoor Championships.

Salazar was employed by Nike as coach of the Nike Oregon Project. Aimed at producing Olympic-caliber athletes, project members who have trained under Salazar&#x27;s tutelage include Alan Webb, Mo Farah, Galen Rupp, Adam Goucher, Kara Goucher, Dan Browne, Amy Yoder Begley, Sifan Hassan and Dathan Ritzenhein. His connection to Oregon and Oregon Sports gave him the distinction of being inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. In August 2012 at the London Summer Olympics, two of Salazar&#x27;s Olympic-caliber athletes, Mo Farah and Galen Rupp, finished 1st and 2nd respectively in the 10,000 m; Farah also went on to win gold in the 5,000 m, becoming the first British double Olympian in long distance.

Salazar ran in the ING New York Marathon in 2006, at age 48, serving as a pacesetter for cyclist Lance Armstrong, who was attempting his first marathon. Salazar was primarily responsible for guiding Armstrong for the first of the race, while Joan Benoit Samuelson oversaw the next , and Hicham El Guerrouj the final . With their help, Armstrong met his goal of completing the race under three hours, finishing in 2:59:36.

On Saturday, June 30, 2007, Salazar suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital. On Sunday, July 1 he was reported to be &quot;groggy&quot; by his family and remained listed in serious condition. On July 2, doctors upgraded his condition from &quot;serious&quot; to &quot;fair&quot;. He was released from the hospital on July 8.

On June 26, 2008, on the eve of the US Olympic trials, Salazar was taken to the hospital again, for dehydration and high blood pressure. He attributes this partially to the stress of coaching five Olympic-hopeful athletes. Afterwards, doctors adjusted his medications, but do not believe that there was any further injury to the heart. He returned to the track to coach his athletes through the trials.

In 2012, Salazar published the autobiography &quot;14 Minutes: A Running Legend&#x27;s Life and Death and Life&quot;, along with John Brant. The book tracks Salazar&#x27;s story from his family&#x27;s roots in Cuba, his adolescence in Massachusetts, through his running career to present-day coaching efforts, culminating in his 14-minute-long heart stop in 2007.

===Doping investigations===
In June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; and ProPublica investigation into doping allegations. This involved testimonies from various athletes and people associated with Salazar about alleged microdosing of testosterone and prednisone at the Nike Oregon Project. Salazar declined to be interviewed for the programme, but denied any wrongdoing, saying in a statement that the &quot;allegations your sources are making are based upon false assumptions and half-truths in an attempt to further their personal agendas&quot;. One of the more high-profile allegations was made by former Nike Oregon Project athlete Kara Goucher, who claimed she was pressured by Salazar to take thyroid medication not prescribed by her doctor to lose weight gained during her pregnancy in 2010. The accusations were addressed by Salazar in public releases.

On October 1, 2019, United States Anti-Doping Agency USADA banned Salazar and Dr. Jeffrey Stuart Brown, a colleague at the Nike Oregon Project, for doping offences. These included using a WADA prohibited method, tampering with doping control methods and trafficking testosterone through a prohibited testing program. In response, Salazar stated that &quot;Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from USADA. [...] I have always ensured the World Anti-Doping Agency code is strictly followed.&quot; Records of the investigations were unsealed two days later, exposing a pattern of withholding their own medical records from the athletes, ignoring subpoenas, and other forms of delay.

Salazar appealed his doping ban to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which upheld his 4-year ban on September 16, 2021. The CAS stated that he was found guilty of &quot;possessing testosterone, complicity in Brown&#x27;s administration of a prohibited method, and tampering with the doping control process.&quot; The CAS did reject USADA&#x27;s request to increase the ban beyond 4 years, stating that &quot;None of the ADRVs (anti-doping rule violations) directly affected athletic competition, and... there was no evidence put before the CAS as to any effect on athletes competing at the elite level.&quot;

Salazar&#x27;s doping ban ended on October 1, 2023.

==SafeSport bans==
In January 2020, the United States Center for SafeSport sanctioned Salazar with an additional (temporary) ban from coaching, after SafeSport investigated allegations against him of sexual and emotional misconduct. Although SafeSport did not make public the offense or offenses for which it banned him, Mary Cain, Kara Goucher, Adam Goucher, and Amy Yoder Begley were among those who had previously made public complaints about Salazar&#x27;s conduct, especially pertaining to unsafe weight restrictions.

On July 26, 2021, Salazar was deemed &quot;permanently ineligible&quot; by SafeSport, after it found that he had committed four violations of emotional and sexual misconduct, including two instances of his penetrating a runner with his finger while giving an athletic massage. Salazar appealed via an arbitration that was held in early December 2021. At the arbitration hearing Salazar denied the accusations against him, and said he did not speak with or see the runner on the days in question. The appeal was unsuccessful as an arbitrator did not find Salazar’s explanation credible, and accepted his accuser’s version of events, determining that he more likely than not had sexually assaulted the athlete on two different occasions and had also made sexually inappropriate comments toward the runner. As a result Salazar was effectively banned for life from participating in any activity put on by or under the auspices of the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee or any sport&#x27;s USOPC-recognized National Governing Body. His name was removed from the building on Nike’s Beaverton campus after the ban was imposed. Salazar continued to deny involvement in any misconduct and said that he felt the SafeSport process was unfair and &quot;lacked due process protections&quot;. In 2023, Kara Goucher came forward as the athlete who accused Salazar of sexual abuse. Because Salazar&#x27;s ban only applies to national governing bodies recognized by USOPC, he has been permitted to coach athletes affiliated with other national governing bodies (those outside the US) since his doping ban ended on October 1, 2023.

In November 2023, Salazar and Nike reportedly settled a $20 million lawsuit from Mary Cain, in which she had alleged emotional and physical abuse by Salazar and that Nike did not take the proper measures to protect her.

<text>Gallimimus ( ) is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous period, about seventy million years ago (mya). Several fossils in various stages of growth were discovered by Polish-Mongolian expeditions in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia during the 1960s; a large skeleton discovered in this region was made the holotype specimen of the new genus and species Gallimimus bullatus in 1972. The generic name means &quot;chicken mimic&quot;, referring to the similarities between its neck vertebrae and those of the Galliformes. The specific name is derived from &quot;bulla&quot;, a golden capsule worn by Roman youth, in reference to a bulbous structure at the base of the skull of &quot;Gallimimus&quot;. At the time it was named, the fossils of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; represented the most complete and best preserved ornithomimid (&quot;ostrich dinosaur&quot;) material yet discovered, and the genus remains one of the best known members of the group.

&quot;Gallimimus&quot; is the largest known ornithomimid; adults were about long, tall at the hip and weighed about . As evidenced by its relative &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;, it is highly likely it would have had feathers. The head was small and light with large eyes that faced to the sides. The snout was long compared to other ornithomimids, although it was broader and more rounded at the tip than in other species. &quot;Gallimimus&quot; was toothless with a keratinous (horny) beak, and had a delicate lower jaw. Many of the vertebrae had openings that indicate they were pneumatic (air-filled). The neck was proportionally long in relation to the trunk. The hands were proportionally the shortest of any ornithomimosaur and each had three digits with curved claws. The forelimbs were weak while the hindlimbs were proportionally long. The family Ornithomimidae is part of the group Ornithomimosauria. &quot;Anserimimus&quot;, also from Mongolia, is thought to have been the closest relative of &quot;Gallimimus&quot;.

As an ornithomimid, &quot;Gallimimus&quot; would have been a fleet (or cursorial) animal, using its speed to escape predators; its speed has been estimated at 42–56 km/h (29–34 mph). It may have had good vision and intelligence comparable to ratite birds. &quot;Gallimimus&quot; may have lived in groups, based on the discovery of several specimens preserved in a bone bed. Various theories have been proposed regarding the diet of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; and other ornithomimids. The highly mobile neck may have helped locate small prey on the ground, but it may also have been an opportunistic omnivore. It has also been suggested that it used small columnar structures in its beak for filter-feeding in water, though these structures may instead have been ridges used for feeding on tough plant material, indicative of a herbivorous diet. &quot;Gallimimus&quot; is the most commonly found ornithomimosaur in the Nemegt Formation, where it lived alongside its relatives &quot;Anserimimus&quot; and &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;. &quot;Gallimimus&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, in a scene that was important to the history of special effects, and in shaping the common conception of dinosaurs as bird-like animals.

==History of discovery==

Between 1963 and 1965, the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences organised the Polish-Mongolian palaeontological expeditions to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Among the dinosaur remains discovered in sand beds of the Nemegt Basin were numerous ornithomimids at different growth stages from the Nemegt, Tsaagan Khushuu, Altan Ula IV and Naran Bulak localities. Three partially complete skeletons, two with skulls, as well as many fragmentary remains, were collected. The largest skeleton (later to become the holotype of &quot;Gallimimus bullatus&quot;) was discovered by palaeontologist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska in Tsaagan Khushuu in 1964; it was preserved lying on its back, and the skull was found under its pelvis. One small specimen was also found in Tsaagan Khushuu the same year, and another small specimen was found in the Nemegt locality. A small skeleton without forelimbs was discovered in 1967 by the Mongolian palaeontological expedition in Bugeen Tsav outside the Nemegt Basin. The fossils were housed at the Mongolian, Polish and USSR Academy of Sciences. The Polish-Mongolian expeditions were notable for being led by women, some of whom were among the first women to name new dinosaurs. The fossils discovered in these expeditions shed new light on the interchange of fauna between Asia and North America during the Cretaceous period. Some of the skeletons were exhibited in Warsaw in 1968, mounted in tall, semi-erect postures, which was accepted at the time, though more horizontal postures are favoured today.

In 1972, palaeontologists Halszka Osmólska, Ewa Roniewicz and Rinchen Barsbold named the new genus and species &quot;Gallimimus bullatus&quot;, using the largest collected skeleton, specimen IGM 100/11 (from Tsaagan Khushuu, formerly referred to as G.I.No.DPS 100/11 and MPD 100/11), as the holotype. The generic name is derived from the Latin &quot;gallus&quot;, &quot;chicken&quot;, and the Greek &quot;mimos&quot;, &quot;mimic&quot;, in reference to the front part of the neck vertebrae which resembled those of the Galliformes. The specific name is derived from the Latin &quot;bulla&quot;, a gold capsule worn by Roman youth around the neck, in reference to the bulbous capsule on the parasphenoid at the base of the dinosaur&#x27;s skull. Such a feature had not been described from other reptiles at the time, and was considered unusual. The holotype consists of an almost complete skeleton with a distorted snout, incomplete lower jaw, vertebral series, pelvis, as well as some missing hand and foot bones. 

The other partially complete skeletons were juveniles; ZPAL MgD-I/1 (from Tsaagan Khushuu) has a crushed skull with a missing tip, damaged vertebrae, fragmented ribs, pectoral girdle and forelimbs, and an incomplete left hind limb, ZPAL MgD-I/94 (from the Nemegt locality) lacks the skull, atlas, tip of the tail, pectoral girdle and forelimbs, while the smallest specimen, IGM 100/10 (from Bugeen Tsav), lacks a pectoral girdle, forelimbs and several vertebrae and ribs. Osmólska and colleagues listed twenty-five known specimens in all, nine of which were only represented by single bones.

At the time it was named, the fossils of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; represented the most complete and best preserved ornithomimid material yet discovered, and the genus remains one of the best known members of the group. Ornithomimids were previously known mainly from North America, &quot;Archaeornithomimus&quot; being the only prior known member from Asia (though without a skull). Since the first discoveries, more specimens have been found by further Mongolian-led international expeditions. Three of the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; skeletons (including the holotype) later became part of a travelling exhibit of Mongolian dinosaur fossils, which toured various countries. 
Fossil poaching has become a serious problem in Mongolia in the 21st century, and several &quot;Gallimimus&quot; specimens have been looted. In 2017, Hang-Jae Lee and colleagues reported a fossil trackway discovered in 2009 associated with a clenched &quot;Gallimimus&quot; foot (specimen MPC-D100F/17). The rest of the skeleton appeared to have been removed previously by poachers, along with several other &quot;Gallimimus&quot; specimens (as indicated by empty excavation pits, garbage, and scattered broken bones in the quarry). It is unusual to find tracks closely associated with body fossils; some of the tracks are consistent with ornithomimid feet, while others belong to different dinosaurs. In 2014, a slab with two &quot;Gallimimus&quot; specimens was repatriated to Mongolia along with other dinosaur skeletons, after having been smuggled to the US.

In 1988, the palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul concluded that the skulls of ornithomimids were more similar to each other than previously thought and moved most species into the same genus, &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;, resulting in the new combination &quot;O. bullatus&quot;. In 2010, he instead listed it as &quot;&quot;Gallimimus&quot; (or &quot;Struthiomimus&quot;) &quot;bullatus&quot;&quot;, but returned to using only the genus name &quot;Gallimimus&quot; in 2016. The species involved have generally been kept in separate genera by other writers. An ornithomimid vertebra from Japan informally named &quot;Sanchusaurus&quot; was reported in a 1988 magazine, but was assigned to &quot;Gallimimus&quot; sp. (of uncertain species) by the palaeontologist Dong Zhiming and colleagues in 1990. In 2000, the palaeontologist Philip J. Currie proposed that &quot;Anserimimus&quot;, which is only known from one skeleton from Mongolia, was a junior synonym of &quot;Gallimimus&quot;, but this was dismissed by Kobayashi and Barsbold, who pointed out several differences between the two. Barsbold noted some morphological variation among newer &quot;Gallimimus&quot; specimens, though this has never been published. Barsbold informally referred to a nearly complete skeleton (IGM 100/14) as &quot;Gallimimus mongoliensis&quot;, but since it differs from &quot;Gallimimus&quot; in some details, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and Barsbold proposed in 2006 that it probably belongs to a different genus.

==Description==

&quot;Gallimimus&quot; is the largest known member of the family Ornithomimidae. The adult holotype (specimen IGM 100/11) was about long and tall at the hip; its skull was long and the femur (thigh bone) was . It would have weighed about . In comparison, one juvenile specimen (ZPAL MgD-I/94) was about long, tall at the hip, and weighed about . Based on fossils of the related &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;, it is known that ornithomimosaurs (&quot;ostrich dinosaurs&quot;) were feathered, and that the adults bore wing-like structures as evidenced by the presence of quill-knobs on the ulna bone of the lower arm, bumps that indicate where feathers would have attached.

===Skull===

The head of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; was very small and light compared to the vertebral column. Due to the length of its snout, the skull was long compared to other ornithomimids, and the snout had a gently convex sloping upper profile. The side profile of the snout differed from other ornithomimids in not narrowing towards its front half, and the lower front margin of the premaxilla at the front of the upper jaw rose upwards, instead of being horizontal. Seen from above, the snout was almost spatulate (spoon-shaped), broad and rounded at the tip (or U-shaped), whereas it was acute (or V-shaped) in North American ornithomimids. The orbits (eye sockets) were large and faced sideways, as in other ornithomimids. The temporal region at the side of the skull behind the eyes was deep, and the infratemporal fenestra (the lower opening behind the orbit) was nearly triangular and smaller than that of the related &quot;Struthiomimus&quot;. It had deep muscle scars at the back part of the skull roof, along the parietal bone. The parasphenoid (a bone of the braincase, at the underside of the skull&#x27;s base) was thin-walled, hollow and formed a pear-shaped, bulbous structure. The structure had a shallow furrow which opened towards the front. The internal nares (internal openings for the nasal passage) were large and placed far back on the palate, due to the presence of an extensive secondary palate, which was common to ornithomimids.

The delicate lower jaw, consisting of thin bones, was slender and shallow at the front, deepening towards the rear. The front of the mandible was shovel-like, resulting in a gap between the tips of the jaws when shut. The shovel-like shape was similar to that of the common seagull, and the lower beak may have had a shape similar to that of this bird. The retroarticular process at the back of the jaw (where jaw muscles attached that opened the beak) was well developed and consisted mainly of the angular bone. The surangular was the largest bone of the lower jaw, which is usual in theropods. The mandibular fenestra, a sidewards-facing opening in the lower jaw, was elongated and comparatively small. The lower jaw did not have a coronoid process or a supradentary bone, the lack of which is a common feature of beaked theropods (ornithomimosaurs, oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs and birds), but unusual among theropods in general. The jaws of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; were edentulous (toothless), and the front part would have been covered in a keratinous rhamphotheca (horny beak) in life. The beak may have covered a smaller area than in North American relatives, based on the lack of nourishing foramina on the maxilla. The inner side of the beak had small, tightly packed and evenly spaced columnar structures (their exact nature is debated), which were longest at the front and shortening towards the back.

===Postcranial skeleton===

&quot;Gallimimus&quot; had 64–66 vertebrae in its spine, fewer than other ornithomimids. The centra (or bodies) of the vertebrae were platycoelous, with a flat front surface and a concave hind surface, except for the first six caudal (tail) vertebra—where the hind surface was also flat—and those at the end of the tail—which were amphiplatyan with both surfaces flat. Many of the centra had foramina (openings which have also been called &quot;&quot;), and were therefore probably pneumatic (with their hollow chambers invaded by air sacs). The neck consisted of 10 cervical vertebrae, which were all long and wide, except for the atlas bone (the first vertebra that connects with the back of the skull). The atlas differed from that of other ornithomimids in that the front surface of its intercentrum was slanted downwards towards the back, instead of being concave and facing upwards to support the occipital condyle. The neck appears to have been proportionally longer in relation to the trunk than in other ornithomimids. The neck was divided into two distinct sections: the cervical vertebrae at the front had centra which were nearly triangular in side view and tapered towards the back, as well as low neural arches and short, broad zygapophyses (the processes that articulated between the vertebrae); the cervical vertebrae at the back had spool-like centra which became gradually higher, and long, thin zygapophyses. The pneumatic foramina here were small and oval, and the neural spines projecting outwards from the centra formed long, low and sharp ridges, except for in the hindmost cervical vertebrae.
The back of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; had 13 dorsal vertebrae, with spool-like centra that were short, but tended to become deeper and longer towards the back. Their transverse processes (processes articulating with the ribs) slightly increased in length towards the back. The two first dorsal centra had deep pneumatic foramina, while the rest only had shallow fossae (depressions), and the neural spines were prominent being somewhat triangular or rectangular in shape. The sacrum (fused vertebrae between the pelvic bones) consisted of five sacral vertebrae which were about equal in length. The centra here were spool-like, flattened sideways and had fossae which appear to have continued as deep foramina in some specimens. The neural spines here were rectangular, broad, and higher than those in the dorsal vertebrae. They were higher or equal in height to the upper margin of the iliac blade and were separate, whereas in other ornithomimids they were fused together. The tail had 36–39 caudal vertebrae with the centra of those at the front being spool-shaped, while those at the back were nearly triangular, and elongated across. The neural spines here were high and flat, but diminished backwards, where they became ridge-like. The only sign of pneumaticity in the tail were deep fossae between the neural spines and the transverse process of the two first caudal vertebrae. All the vertebrae in front of the sacrum bore ribs except for the atlas and the last dorsal vertebra.

The scapula (shoulder blade) was short and curved, thin at the front end, and thick at the back. It was connected relatively weakly with the coracoid, which was large and deep from top to bottom. Overall, the forelimbs did not differ much from those of other ornithomimids, all of which were comparatively weak. The humerus (upper arm bone), which had a near circular cross-section, was long and twisted. The deltopectoral crest on the upper front part of the humerus was comparatively small, and therefore provided little surface for attachment of upper arm muscles. The ulna was slender, long and weakly curved, with a nearly triangular shaft. The olecranon (the projection from the elbow) was prominent in adults, but not well developed in juveniles. The radius (the other bone in the lower arm) was long and slender with a more expanded upper end compared to the lower. The manus (hand) was proportionally short compared to those of other ornithomimosaurs, having the smallest manus to humerus length ratio of any member of the group, but was otherwise similar in structure. It had three fingers, which were similarly developed; the first (the &quot;thumb&quot;) was the strongest, the third was the weakest and the second was the longest. The unguals (claw bones) were strong, somewhat curved (that of the first finger was most curved) and compressed sideways with a deep groove on each side. The unguals were similarly developed, though the third was slightly smaller.
The pubis (pubic bone) was long and slender, ending in a pubic boot which expanded to the front and back, a general feature of ornithomimosaurs. The hind limbs differed little from those of other ornithomimids, and were proportionally longer than in other theropods. The femur was nearly straight, long and slender, with a sideways flattened shaft. The tibia was straight, long, with two well developed condyles (rounded end of a bone) on the upper end and a flattened lower end. The fibula of the lower leg was flat, thin and broad at the upper end narrowing towards the lower end. The lower half of the third metatarsal was broad when viewed end on, partly covering the adjoining two metatarsals to each side, but narrowed abruptly at mid-length, wedging between those bones and disappearing (an arctometatarsalian foot structure). The third toe was proportionally shorter in relation to the limb than in other ornithomimids. As in other ornithomimids, the foot had no hallux (or dewclaw, the first toe of most other theropods). The unguals of the toes were flat on their lower sides; the outer two declined slightly outwards from their digits.

==Classification==
Osmólska and colleagues assigned &quot;Gallimimus&quot; to the family Ornithomimidae in 1972, with the North American &quot;Struthiomimus&quot; as the closest relative, while lamenting the fact that comparison between taxa was difficult because other ornithomimids known at the time were either poorly preserved or inadequately described. In 1975, Kielan-Jaworowska stated that though many dinosaurs from Asia were placed in the same families as North American relatives, this category of classification tended to be more inclusive than was used for modern birds. She highlighted that while &quot;Gallimimus&quot; had a rounded beak (similar to a goose or duck), North American ornithomimids had pointed beaks, a difference that would otherwise lead taxonomists to place modern birds in different families. In 1976, Barsbold placed Ornithomimidae in the new group Ornithomimosauria. In 2003, Kobayashi and Jun-Chang Lü found that &quot;Anserimimus&quot; was the sister taxon to &quot;Gallimimus&quot;, both forming a derived (or &quot;advanced&quot;) clade with North American genera, which was confirmed by Kobayashi and Barsbold in 2006.

The following cladogram shows the placement of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; among Ornithomimidae according to the palaeontontologist Bradley McFeeters and colleagues, 2016:

Ornithomimosaurs belonged to the clade Maniraptoriformes of coelurosaurian theropods, which also includes modern birds. Early ornithomimosaurs had teeth, which were lost in more derived members of the group. In 2004, Makovicky, Kobayashi, and Currie suggested that most of the early evolutionary history of ornithomimosaurs took place in Asia, where most genera have been discovered, including the most basal (or &quot;primitive&quot;) taxa, although they acknowledged that the presence of the basal &quot;Pelecanimimus&quot; in Europe presents a complication in classification. The group must have dispersed once or twice from Asia to North America across Beringia to account for the Late Cretaceous genera found there. As seen in some other dinosaur groups, ornithomimosaurs were largely restricted to Asia and North America after Europe was separated from Asia by the Turgai Strait.

In 1994, the palaeontologist Thomas R. Holtz grouped ornithomimosaurs and troodontids in a clade, based on shared features such as the presence of a bulbous capsule on the parasphenoid. He named the clade Bullatosauria, based on the specific name of &quot;Gallimimus bullatus&quot;, which was also in reference to the capsule. In 1998, Holtz instead found that troodontids were basal maniraptorans, meaning that all members of that clade would fall within Bullatosauria, which would therefore become a junior synonym of Maniraptoriformes, and the clade has since fallen out of use.

==Palaeobiology==
The cervical vertebrae of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; indicate that it held its neck obliquely, declining upwards at an angle of 35 degrees. Osmólska and colleagues found that the hands of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; were not prehensile (or capable of grasping), and that the thumb was not opposable. They also suggested that the arms were weak compared to, for example, those of the ornithomimosaur &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;. They agreed with the interpretations of ornithomimid biology by palaeontologist Dale Russell from earlier in 1972, including that they would have been very fleet (or cursorial) animals, although less agile than large, modern ground birds, and would have used their speed to escape predators. Russell also suggested that they had a good sense of vision and intelligence comparable to that of modern ratite birds. Since their predators may have had colour vision, he suggested it would have influenced their colouration, perhaps resulting in camouflage. In 1982, palaeontologist Richard A. Thulborn estimated that &quot;Gallimimus&quot; could have run at speeds of 42–56 km/h (29–34 mph). He found that ornithimimids would not have been as fast as ostriches, which can reach 70–80 km/h (43–49 mph), in part due to their arms and tails increasing their weight.
In 1988, Paul suggested that the eyeballs of ornithomimids were flattened and had minimal mobility within the sockets, necessitating movement of the head to view objects. Since their eyes faced more sideways than in some other bird-like theropods, their binocular vision would have been more limited, which is an adaptation in some animals that improves their ability to see predators behind them. Paul considered the relatively short tails, which reduced weight, and missing halluxes of ornithomimids to be adaptations for speed. He suggested that they could have defended themselves by pecking and kicking, but would have mainly relied on their speed for escape. In 2015, Akinobu Watanabe and colleagues found that together with &quot;Deinocheirus&quot; and &quot;Archaeornithomimus&quot;, &quot;Gallimimus&quot; had the most pneumatised skeleton among ornithomimosaurs. Pneumatisation is thought to be advantageous for flight in modern birds, but its function in non-avian dinosaurs is not known with certainty. It has been proposed that pneumatisation was used to reduce the mass of large bones, that it was related to high metabolism, balance during locomotion, or used for thermoregulation.

In 2017, Lee and colleagues suggested various possible taphonomic circumstances (changes during decay and fossilisation) to explain how the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; foot discovered in 2009 was associated with a trackway. The trackway is preserved in sandstone while the foot is preserved in mudstone, extending below the layer with the tracks. It is possible the fossil represents an animal that died in its tracks, but the depth of the foot in the mud may be too shallow for it to have become mired. It may also have been killed by a flood, after which it was buried in a pond. However, the layers of mud and sand do not indicate flooding but probably a dry environment, and the disrupted sediments around the fossil indicate the animal was alive when it came to the area. The authors thus suggested that the tracks had been made over an extended amount of time and period of drying, and that probably none of them were produced by the individual that owned the foot. The animal may have walked across the floor of a pond, breaking through the sediment layer with the tracks while it was soaked from rain or contained water. The animal may have died in this position from thirst, hunger, or another reason, and mud then deposited on the sand, thereby covering and preserving the tracks and the carcass. The foot may have become clenched and disarticulated as it decomposed, which made the tendons flex, and was later stepped on by heavy dinosaurs. The area may have been a single bone bed (based on the possible number of poached specimens) representing a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; mass mortality, perhaps due to a drought or famine. The fact that the animals seem to have died at the same time (the empty excavation pits were stratigraphically identical) may indicate that &quot;Gallimimus&quot; was gregarious (lived in groups), which has also been suggested for other ornithomimids.

===Feeding and diet===
Osmólska and colleagues pointed out that the front part of the neck of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; would have been very mobile (the hind part was more rigid), the neural arches in the vertebrae of that region being similar to chicken and other Galliformes, indicating similar feeding habits. They found the beak of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; similar to that of a duck or goose, and that it would have fed on small, living prey which it swallowed whole. The mobility of the neck would have been useful in locating prey on the ground, since the eyes were positioned on the sides of the skull. They assumed that all ornithomimids had similar feeding habits, and pointed out that Russel had compared the beaks of ornithomimids with those of insectivorous birds. Osmólska and colleagues suggested that &quot;Gallimimus&quot; was capable of cranial kinesis (due to the seemingly loose connection between some of the bones at the back of the skull), a feature which allows individual bones of the skull to move in relation to each other. They also proposed that it did not use its short handed forelimbs for bringing food to the mouth, but for raking or digging in the ground to access food. The hands of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; may have been weaker than for example those of &quot;Struthiomimus&quot;, which may instead have used its hands for hooking and gripping, according to a 1985 article by palaeontologists Elizabeth L. Nicholls and Anthony P. Russell.

In 1988 Paul disagreed that ornithomimids were omnivores that ate small animals and eggs as well as plants, as had previously been suggested. He pointed out that ostriches and emus are mainly grazers and browsers, and that the skulls of ornithomimids were most similar to those of the extinct moas, which were strong enough to bite off twigs, as evidenced by their gut content. He further suggested that ornithomimids were well adapted for browsing on tough plants and would have used their hands to bring branches within reach of their jaws. Palaeontologist Jørn Hurum suggested in 2001 that due to its similar jaw structure, &quot;Gallimimus&quot; may have had an opportunistic, omnivorous diet like seagulls. He also observed that the tight intramandibular joint would prevent any movement between the front and rear portions of the lower jaw.
In 2001, palaeontologists Mark A. Norell, Makovicky, and Currie reported a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; skull (IGM 100/1133) and an &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; skull that preserved soft tissue structures on the beak. The inner side of the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; beak had columnar structures that the authors found similar to the lamellae in the beaks of anseriform birds, which use these for manipulating food, straining sediments, filter-feeding by segregating food items from other material, and for cutting plants while grazing. They found the Northern shoveller, which feeds on plants, molluscs, ostracods, and foraminiferans, to be the modern anseriform with structures most similar in anatomy to those of &quot;Gallimimus&quot;. The authors noted that ornithomimids probably did not use their beaks to prey on large animals and were abundant in mesic environments, while rarer in more arid environments, suggesting that they may have depended on aquatic food sources. Makovicky, Kobayashi, and Currie pointed out that if this interpretation is correct, &quot;Gallimimus&quot; would have been one of the largest known terrestrial filter feeders.

In 2005, palaeontologist Paul Barrett pointed out that the lamella-like structures of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; did not appear to have been flexible bristles like those of filter-feeding birds (as there is no indication of these structures overlapping or being collapsed), but were instead more akin to the thin, regularly spaced vertical ridges in the beaks of turtles and hadrosaurid dinosaurs. In these animals, such ridges are thought to be associated with herbivorous diets, used to crop tough vegetation. Barrett suggested that the ridges in the beak of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; represented a natural cast of the internal surface of the beak, indicating that the animal was a herbivore that fed on material high in fibre. The discovery of many gastroliths (gizzard stones) in some ornithomimids indicate the presence of a gastric mill, and therefore point towards a herbivorous diet, as these are used to grind food of animals that lack the necessary chewing apparatus. Barrett also calculated that a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; would have needed between of food per day, depending on whether it had an endothermic or an ectothermic (&quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;-blooded) metabolism, an intake which he found to be unfeasible if it was a filter feeder. He also found that ornithomimids were abundant not only in formations that represented mesic environments, but also in arid environments where there would be insufficient water to sustain a diet based on filter-feeding. In 2007, palaeontologist Espen M. Knutsen wrote that the beak shape of ornithomimids, when compared to those of modern birds, was consistent with omnivory or high-fibre herbivory.

David J. Button and Zanno found in 2019 herbivorous dinosaurs mainly followed two distinct modes of feeding, either processing food in the gut—characterized by gracile skulls and low bite forces—or the mouth, characterized by features associated with extensive processing. Ornithomimid ornithomimosaurs, &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;, diplodocoid and titanosaur sauropods, &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;, and caenagnathids, were found to be in the former category. These researchers suggested that ornithomimid ornithomimosaurians such as &quot;Gallimimus&quot; and deinocheirids had invaded these niches separately, convergently achieving relatively large sizes. Advantages from large body mass in herbivores include increased intake rate of food and fasting resistance, and these trends may therefore indicate that ornithomimids and deinocheirids were more herbivorous than other ornithomimosaurians. They cautioned that the correlations between herbivory and body mass were not simple, and that there was no directional trend towards increased mass seen in the clade. Furthermore, the diet of most ornithomimosaurians is poorly known.

===Development===

The shape and proportions of the skull changed significantly during growth. The rear of the skull and the orbits decreased in size, whereas the snout became relatively longer; similar changes occur in modern crocodiles. The skull was also proportionally larger in the younger specimens, and the sloping of the snout&#x27;s upper profile was less distinct. The ribs in the neck were fused to the vertebrae only in adults. The forelimbs appear to have become proportionally longer during growth, whereas the proportional length of the bones in the hind limbs changed very little. In 2012, palaeontologist Darla K. Zelenitsky and colleagues concluded that, since adult ornithomimosaurs had wing-like structures on their arms whereas juveniles did not (as evidenced by specimens of &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;), these structures were originally secondary sexual characteristics, which could have been used for reproductive behaviour such as courtship, display, and brooding.

A 1987 study by the biologists Roman Pawlicki and P. Bolechała showed age-related differences in the content of calcium and phosphorus (important components in the formation of bone) of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; specimens. They found that the ratio was highest in young to middle aged animals, decreasing with age. In 1991, they reported that the bones of old individuals contained the highest amounts of lead and iron, while those in younger animals were lower. A study of the bone histology of various dinosaurs in 2000, by biologists John M. Rensberger and Mahito Watabe, revealed that the canaliculi (channels which connect bone cells) and collagen fibre bundles of &quot;Gallimimus&quot; and other ornithomimids were more akin to those in birds than mammals, unlike those of ornithischian dinosaurs, which were more similar to mammals. These differences may have been related to the process and rate at which bone formed.

==Palaeoenvironment==

&quot;Gallimimus&quot; is known from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, at the end of the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The sediments of the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; type locality Tsaagan Khushuu consist of silts, siltstones, mudstones, sands, as well as less frequent thin beds of sandstones. The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of river channels, mudflats, shallow lakes and floodplains in an environment similar to the Okavango Delta of present-day Botswana. Large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of a significantly more humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations, although caliche deposits indicate that periodic droughts occurred. Fossil bones from the Nemegt Basin, including of &quot;Gallimimus&quot;, are more radioactive than fossils from surrounding areas, possibly because uranium accumulated in the bones, transported there by percolating ground water.

The Nemegt rivers, where &quot;Gallimimus&quot; lived, were home to a wide array of organisms. Occasional mollusc fossils, as well as a variety of other aquatic animals like fish, turtles, and crocodylomorphs, including &quot;Shamosuchus&quot;, have been discovered in this region. Mammal fossils are rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds, including the enantiornithine &quot;Gurilynia&quot;, the hesperornithiform &quot;Judinornis&quot;, as well as &quot;Teviornis&quot;, a possible anseriform, have been found. Herbivorous dinosaurs discovered in the Nemegt Formation include ankylosaurids such as &quot;Tarchia&quot;, the pachycephalosaurian &quot;Prenocephale&quot;, large hadrosaurids such as &quot;Saurolophus&quot; and &quot;Barsboldia&quot;, and sauropods such as &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot;. Predatory theropods that lived alongside &quot;Gallimimus&quot; include tyrannosauroids such as &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, &quot;Alioramus&quot; and &quot;Bagaraatan&quot;, and troodontids such as &quot;Borogovia&quot;, &quot;Tochisaurus&quot; and &quot;Zanabazar&quot;. Herbivorous or omnivorous theropods include therizinosaurs, such as &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, as well as oviraptorosaurians, such as &quot;Elmisaurus&quot;, &quot;Nemegtomaia&quot;, and &quot;Rinchenia&quot;. Other ornithomimosaurs, including &quot;Anserimimus&quot; and &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;, are also found, but &quot;Gallimimus&quot; is the most common member of the group in the Nemegt.

==Cultural significance==

&quot;Gallimimus&quot; was featured in the 1993 movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; by director Steven Spielberg; a similar scene in the original 1990 novel instead featured hadrosaurs. Spielberg had wanted a stampede sequence with animal herds in the movie, but did not know how to achieve it, and it was initially going to be visualised through stop-motion animation. At the time, there was little faith in creating animals through computer animation, but the visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic was given a go-ahead by the movie&#x27;s producers to explore possibilities. ILM created a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; skeleton in the computer and animated a test showing a herd of running skeletons, and later a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; chasing a fully rendered &quot;Gallimimus&quot; herd. The production team became very enthusiastic as nothing similar had previously been achieved, and Spielberg was convinced to write the scene into the script, and to also use computer graphics for other dinosaur shots in the movie instead of stop motion. The &quot;Gallimimus&quot; were animated by tracing frames from footage of ostriches, and footage of herding gazelles was also referenced. Kielan-Jaworowska, who discovered the holotype specimen, called it a &quot;beautiful scene&quot;. The movie&#x27;s dinosaurs were one of the most widely publicised applications of computer-generated imagery in film, and were considered more lifelike than what had been previously accomplished with special effects.

Emphasising the bird-like flocking behaviour of the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; herd was a point in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;&#x27;s story, as they were supposed to represent the precursors to birds. The herd was shown moving as a whole, rather than individual animals running around, and the smaller &quot;Gallimimus&quot; were shown in the middle of the group, as though they were being protected. During the scene, the palaeontologist Alan Grant says that the herd moves with &quot;uniform direction changes, just like a flock of birds evading a predator&quot; as he watches the movements of the fast, graceful &quot;Gallimimus&quot;. This contrasted with how dinosaurs were traditionally depicted in mass media as lumbering, tail-dragging animals, and the movie helped change the common perception of dinosaurs. This and other scenes reflected then-recent theories of bird evolution encouraged by the movie&#x27;s scientific advisor, the palaeontologist John R. Horner, ideas which were still contentious at the time. Despite such theories, &quot;Gallimimus&quot; and other dinosaurs of the movie were depicted without feathers, in part because it was unknown at the time how widespread these were among the group.

It has been claimed that the Lark Quarry tracks (one of the world&#x27;s largest concentrations of dinosaur tracks) in Queensland, Australia, served as inspiration and &quot;scientific underpinning&quot; for the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; stampede scene in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;; these tracks were initially interpreted as representing a dinosaur stampede caused by the arrival of a theropod predator. The idea that the tracks represent a stampede has since been contested (the &quot;theropod&quot; may instead have been a herbivore similar to &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;), and a consultant to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has denied the tracks served as inspiration for the movie.

<text>The Folland Gnat is a British compact swept-wing subsonic fighter aircraft that was developed and produced by Folland Aircraft. Envisioned as an affordable light fighter in contrast to the rising cost and size of typical combat aircraft, it was procured as a trainer aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF) as well as by export customers, who used the Gnat in both combat and training capacities.

Designed by W. E. W. Petter, the Gnat has its origins in the preceding private venture Folland Midge. The issuing of Operational Requirement OR.303 by the British Air Ministry served to motivate the type&#x27;s development; the Gnat was later submitted to meet this requirement. Its design allowed for its construction and maintenance tasks to be carried out without specialised tools, making it suitable for use in countries that had not yet become highly industrialised. The Gnat has been viewed as a major motivating factor towards the issuing of the NATO NBMR-1 requirement, which sought to make available a common strike/attack light fighter with which to equip the air forces of the various NATO members.

Although never used as a fighter by the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Gnat T.1 jet trainer variant was adopted and operated for some time. In the United Kingdom, the Gnat became well known due to its prominent use as the display aircraft of the RAF&#x27;s Red Arrows aerobatic team. The Gnat F.1 was exported to Finland, Yugoslavia and India. The Indian Air Force became the largest operator and eventually manufactured the aircraft under licence. Impressed by its performance during combat, India proceeded to develop the improved HAL Ajeet, a modified variant of the Gnat. In British service, the Gnat was replaced by the Hawker Siddeley Hawk.

==Development==
===Origins===
In October 1950, W. E. W. &quot;Teddy&quot; Petter, a British aircraft designer formerly of Westland Aircraft and English Electric, joined Folland Aircraft as its managing director and chief engineer. Almost immediately upon joining the firm, Petter conducted a study into the economics behind modern fighter manufacturing, and concluded that many combat aircraft entailed far too great a cost in terms of man-hours and material to be readily mass-produced during a major conflict. While the British Air Staff emphasised quality over quantity, the economics involved in the anticipated vast wartime production of many of the RAF&#x27;s aircraft of the time, such as the Hawker Hunter and the Gloster Javelin interceptors, were viewed as questionable.

Petter examined the prospects for producing a more affordable but capable &quot;light fighter&quot;, including a survey of available modern engines to power the type. Having identified suitable powerplant arrangements along with methods of making multiple key design aspects, such as the manufacturing of the fuselage and wings, more affordable, Folland promptly commenced work upon this lightweight fighter concept, financing the project using existing company funds. The light fighter project soon received the Fo-141 designation along with the name Gnat. Development of the Gnat and the specifics of its design were heavily influenced by the issuing of Operational Requirement OR.303, which sought a capable lightweight fighter aircraft. Work to develop the Gnat went ahead, irrespective of any external orders or financing; there was no funding provided to support the type&#x27;s early development from any British government department, such as the Ministry of Supply.

Petter believed that a compact and simplified fighter would offer the advantages of low purchase and operational costs, and that the Gnat should be capable of being manufactured both cheaply and easily. The emergence of new lightweight turbojet engines, several of which were well advanced in their own development process, also enabled the envisioned light fighter concept to be realised. The Gnat was initially intended to be powered by a Bristol BE-22 Saturn turbojet engine, capable of generating 3,800 lbf (16.9 kN 1,724 kgp) of thrust. However, development of the Saturn was cancelled; in its place, the more capable but not immediately available Bristol Orpheus turbojet engine was adopted instead.

In order that the project would not be delayed before reaching the prototype stage, Petter&#x27;s unarmed proof-of-concept demonstrator for the Gnat was instead powered by the less powerful Armstrong Siddeley Viper 101 turbojet engine, capable of generating 1,640 lbf (7.3 kN / 744 kgp) of thrust. While using a different powerplant from later-built prototypes and production aircraft, the demonstrator still used a nearly identical airframe along with similar onboard systems so that these could be proved in advance of the Gnat itself being built. This demonstrator was designated Fo-139 Midge. On 11 August 1954, the Midge performed its maiden flight, piloted by Folland&#x27;s chief test pilot Edward Tennant. Despite the low-powered engine, the compact jet was able to break Mach 1 while in a dive and proved to be very agile during its flying trials. On 20 September 1955, the Midge was destroyed in a crash, which had possibly been due to human error by a pilot from a potential overseas purchaser.

The Midge, partly due to its nature as a private venture, had only a short lifespan, however had served as a proof-of-concept demonstrator for the subsequent aircraft. It had failed to interest the RAF as a combat aircraft at that time, but officers did issue encouragement of the development of a similar aircraft for training purposes. The larger Gnat, which was being developed in parallel with the Midge, was an improved version of the original fighter design; it was differentiated by larger air intakes to suit the Orpheus engine, a slightly larger wing, and provision for the installation of a 30 mm ADEN cannon in each intake lip. The first prototype Gnat was built as a private venture by Folland. Subsequently, six further aircraft were ordered by the British Ministry of Supply for evaluation purposes. On 18 July 1955, the Folland prototype, serial number &quot;G-39-2&quot;, first flew from RAF Boscombe Down, Wiltshire.

Although the evaluation by the British brought no orders for the lightweight fighter, orders were placed by Finland and Yugoslavia. India placed a large order for the type, which included a licence for production by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Although the Gnat&#x27;s development is considered a factor which motivated the Mutual Weapons Development Team to issue the NATO NBMR-1 requirement for a low level strike/attack light fighter, the Gnat itself was not evaluated in the competition, which was won by the Fiat G.91. However, the Gnat was evaluated in 1958 by the RAF as a replacement for the de Havilland Venom, as well as other light aircraft such as the BAC Jet Provost. The Hawker Hunter was selected as the eventual winner of the fly-off competition.

===Trainer===

Although RAF interest in the possibilities for using the Gnat as a fighter had waned, Folland identified a potential use for the type as a trainer aircraft. Accordingly, the aircraft was modified to conform with the requirements of Specification T.185D, which had called for an advanced two-seat trainer aircraft that could transition pilots between the current de Havilland Vampire T 11 and operational fighters, such as the supersonic English Electric Lightning.

Folland proposed the two-seat Fo. 144 Gnat Trainer. The trainer model featured several changes, including the adoption of a new wing with additional fuel capacity, which in turn allowed for more internal space within the fuselage to be allocated for additional equipment. A more powerful variant of the Orpheus engine was also used, while the length of the forward fuselage area was increased, and the tail surfaces were enlarged. The inboard ailerons of the fighter variant were reconfigured to an arrangement of outboard ailerons and conventional flaps. On 7 January 1958, an initial contract for 14 pre-production Gnat trainers was issued.

On 31 August 1959, the prototype Gnat Trainer conducted its maiden flight from Chilbolton airfield, Hampshire. The Ministry did not at first place a production order as they were concerned about the size and ability of the company to take on a large order. Following the take over of Folland by Hawker Siddeley Aviation (becoming the Hamble division), further orders for 30, 20 and 41 trainers were placed between February 1960 and March 1962, receiving the designation &quot;Gnat T Mk. 1&quot;. The final Gnat T.1 for the RAF was delivered in May 1965.

===Further development===
Folland sought to develop more capable versions of the Gnat; one of the more substantial of these proposals was tentatively designated as the Gnat Mk.5. This model was to be capable of supersonic speeds and was intended to be made available in both single-seat and twin-seat configurations, enabling its use in the trainer and interceptor role. The Gnat 5 was to be powered by either a pair of Rolls-Royce RB153R engines or two Viper 20 engines; in the interceptor role, it would be also equipped with a Ferranti AI.23 Airpass radar and armed with a pair of de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles. Featuring an estimated maximum speed around and a time to of 3 minutes, Folland estimated that a prototype could be flown as early as the end of 1962 and that the Gnat 5 could be readied for operational service within four or five years.

In 1960, Maurice Brennan joined Folland as its chief engineer and director. Hawker Siddeley wanted to use his knowledge of variable-geometry wings in future designs. Under his direction, a variable geometry wing was applied to the basic Gnat 5 design to produce two different configurations – one tailless and one with a conventional tail – for a multipurpose fighter/strike/trainer, designated the Fo.147. The design used a unique mechanism to sweep the wings; this mechanism used a combination of tracks positioned on the fuselage sides, the centerline, and on the underside of the wings, and was actuated by hydraulically-driven ball screws positioned at the inner ends of the wings. The wings could be swept from 20 degrees to 70 degrees; at the 70-degree position, longitudinal control was maintained by wing tip-mounted elevons, and at the 20-degree position by a retractable canard arrangement. Auto-stabilisation was also to be used. By providing trimming with the canard, a large tailplane was not needed, as would have been on designs without a canard configuration.

The Fo.147 was to have been capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2, with the speed limit set by the temperature of the structure as a result of kinetic heating. It had a maximum all-up weight of , comparing well with the Gnat 5&#x27;s more restrictive maximum. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the Fo.147: &quot;would have provided a first-class flying test-bed for variable geometry theories...even a VG conversion of the standard Gnat Mk 2 fighter would have been an invaluable research tool&quot;. However, neither the Fo.147 nor its successor, the Fo.148, would be developed to the prototype stage; the RAF showed little interest in the need for a variable-geometry trainer, although it intended to procure the General Dynamics F-111K strike aircraft.

==Design==

The Folland Gnat was a purpose-built light fighter aircraft, suitable as both a trainer and a combat aircraft in ground-attack and day-fighter roles. The cockpit offered many features expected in standard fighter aircraft: full pressurisation, climate control, and an ejection seat.

According to Folland, the Gnat offered advantages over conventional fighter aircraft in terms of cost, man-hours, handling, serviceability, and portability. Its tricycle landing gear let it operate from austere grass airstrips, thanks to the aircraft&#x27;s low weight.

The Gnat design used a conventional metal stressed-skin structure, with extensive flush-rivetting. To reduce workload and cost, intensive fabrication methods such as machining, forging, and casting were minimised. The airframe could be constructed using simple jigs without any specialised skills or tooling. The wing (for example) could be produced at a quarter of the cost, with less than one-fifth the labour, required for the wings of other contemporary fighter aircraft. Similarly, the layout and construction techniques used allow the airframe to be rapidly disassembled into its major subsections, without the use of cranes or ladders; the Gnat was vastly easier to service than most other aircraft.

==Operational history==
===Finland===
The Finnish Air Force received the first of its 13 Gnats (11 fighters and 2 photo-reconnaissance planes) on 30 July 1958. It was soon found to be a problematic aircraft in service and required a lot of ground maintenance. In early 1957 a licence agreement was reached to allow Valmet to build the Gnat at Tampere in Finland, although, in the end, none were built. On 31 July 1958, Finnish Air Force Major Lauri Pekuri, a fighter ace of the Second World War, became the first Finnish pilot to break the sound barrier while flying a Gnat at Lake Luonetjärvi.

Gnat F.1 proved initially problematic in the harsh Finnish conditions. Finland was the first operational user of Gnat F.1, and the plane still had many issues yet to be resolved. All Gnats were grounded for half a year on 26 August 1958 after the destruction of GN-102 due to a technical design error in its hydraulic system, and the aircraft soon became the subject of severe criticism. Three other aircraft were also destroyed in other accidents, with two pilots ejecting and one being killed. Once the initial problems were ironed out, the plane proved to be extremely manouevreable and had good performance in the air, but also to be very maintenance intensive. The availability of spare parts was always an issue, and its maintenance a challenge to the conscript mechanics. The Gnats were removed from active service in 1972 when the Häme Wing moved to Rovaniemi, and when the new Saab 35 Drakens were brought into use.

===India===
In September 1956 the Indian government signed a contract for the production of the aircraft and Orpheus engine in India. The first 13 aircraft for the Indian Air Force (IAF) were assembled at Hamble-le-Rice, they were followed by partly completed aircraft and then sub-assemblies as Hindustan Aircraft slowly took over first assembly, and then production of the aircraft. The first flight of an Indian Air Force Gnat was in the United Kingdom on 11 January 1958, it was delivered to India in the hold of a C-119, and accepted by the Air Force on 30 January 1958. The first Gnat squadron was the No. 23 (Cheetah), which converted from Vampire FB.52 on 18 March 1960 using six Folland-built Gnats. The first aircraft built from Indian-built parts first flew in May 1962. The last Indian-built Gnat F.1 was delivered on 31 January 1974.
The Gnat was an extremely difficult aircraft to handle in the early stages of training. Unlike the RAF, the IAF did not buy a trainer version. Inductees were brought in from Hunter aircraft squadrons, having gained experience on powered controls. They then flew dual checks on the Hunter trainer. The pilot would do a brief full throttle run on the runway before flying solo. The Gnat had a tendency to pitch up sharply on raising the undercarriage; almost all new pilots would find it difficult to control the anticipated pitch up. With sufficient experience, pilots would exploit the nimble mini-sized aircraft to its limits.

The Gnat is credited by many independent and Indian sources as having shot down seven Pakistani North American F-86 Sabres in the 1965 war. During the initial phase of the 1965 war, an IAF Gnat, piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, landed at an abandoned Pakistani airstrip at Pasrur and was captured by the PAF. Two Lockheed F-104 Starfighters claimed to have forced the Gnat down. Sikand — who had a complete electrical failure on his Gnat while he got separated from the IAF flight to fight a Sabre — had to make an emergency landing at the PAF field at Pasrur. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. After the ceasefire, one Pakistani Cessna O-1 was shot down on 16 December 1965 by a Gnat.

The Gnats were used again by India in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The most notable action was the Battle of Boyra where the first dogfights over East Pakistan (Bangladesh) took place. IAF Gnats shot down two PAF Canadair Sabres and badly damaged one. Another notable dogfight involving a Gnat was over Srinagar airfield where a lone Indian pilot held out against six Sabres, shooting two Sabres in the process, before being shot down. Gnat pilot Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon was posthumously honoured with the Param Vir Chakra (India&#x27;s highest gallantry award), becoming the only member of the IAF to be given the award.

By the end of 1971, the Gnat proved to be a frustrating opponent for the larger, heavier and older Sabre. The Gnat was referred to as a &quot;Sabre Slayer&quot; by the IAF since most of its combat &quot;kills&quot; during the two wars were against Sabres despite the Canadair Sabre Mk 6 being widely regarded as the best dogfighter of its era. Tactics called for Gnats taking on the Sabres in the vertical arena, where the Sabres were at a disadvantage. As the Gnat was lightweight and compact in shape, it was hard to see, especially at the low levels where most dogfights took place. Apart from air defence operations, in the Bangladesh Liberation War, Gnats flew anti-shipping operations, ground attack, bomber/transport escort and close air support operations.

The IAF was impressed by the Gnat&#x27;s performance in the two wars, but the aircraft had many technical problems including hydraulics, a temperamental pair of Aden 30 mm cannons which often failed in-flight, significant &#x27;bent thrust&#x27; on take-off, leading to many aborted take-offs and an unreliable control system. To address these failings, the IAF issued a requirement for an improved &quot;Gnat II&quot; in 1972, at first specifying that the new version was to be optimised as an interceptor but then expanding the specification to include ground-attack. Over 175 of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-built licensed version, the Ajeet (&quot;Unconquerable&quot;), were produced in Bangalore. Several Gnats remain in use in private hands. Some IAF Gnats, one of which had participated in the 1971 war in East Pakistan, were presented to the Bangladesh Air Force.

===United Kingdom===
The first production Gnat T.1s for the Royal Air Force were delivered in February 1962 to the Central Flying School at RAF Little Rissington. The major operator of the type was 4 Flying Training School at RAF Valley, the first aircraft being delivered in November 1962. In 1964 4 FTS formed the Yellowjacks aerobatic team with all-yellow painted Gnats. The team reformed in 1965 as part of the Central Flying School as the Red Arrows which operated the Gnat until 1979 as the RAF aerobatic demonstration team. On 14 May 1965 the last Royal Air Force Gnat T.1 to be built was delivered to the Red Arrows.
Once pilots graduated from basic training on the BAC Jet Provost and gained their wings they were selected for one of three streams: fast jet, multi-engined, or helicopter. Those selected for fast jets were posted to RAF Valley for advanced training on the Gnat T.1, typically 70 hours of flying. Students would then move on to operational training using the Hawker Hunter, followed by a posting to an operational conversion unit for the type of aircraft to be flown.

Following the introduction of the Hawker Siddeley Hawk into the training role as a replacement the Gnats were withdrawn from service. The largest operator 4 FTS retired its last Gnat in November 1978. Most of the retired Gnats were delivered to No. 1 School of Technical Training at RAF Halton and other training establishments to be used as ground training airframes. When the RAF had no need for the Gnats as training airframes they were sold off. Many were bought by private operators and a number are still flying today.

===Yugoslavia===
Yugoslavia ordered two Gnat F.1s for evaluation; the first aircraft flew on 7 June 1958 and both were delivered to Yugoslavia by rail. The aircraft were flown by the flight test centre but no further aircraft were ordered. One aircraft was destroyed in a crash in October 1958 while the other is preserved and on display in Serbia.

<text>Sound pressure or acoustic pressure is the local pressure deviation from the ambient (average or equilibrium) atmospheric pressure, caused by a sound wave. In air, sound pressure can be measured using a microphone, and in water with a hydrophone. The SI unit of sound pressure is the pascal (Pa).

==Mathematical definition==
A sound wave in a transmission medium causes a deviation (sound pressure, a &quot;dynamic&quot; pressure) in the local ambient pressure, a &quot;static&quot; pressure.

Sound pressure, denoted &quot;p&quot;, is defined by
formula_1
where
* &quot;p&quot;total is the total pressure,
* &quot;p&quot;stat is the static pressure.

==Sound measurements==

===Sound intensity===
In a sound wave, the complementary variable to sound pressure is the particle velocity. Together, they determine the sound intensity of the wave.

&quot;Sound intensity&quot;, denoted I and measured in W·m−2 in SI units, is defined by
formula_2
where
* &quot;p&quot; is the sound pressure,
* v is the particle velocity.

===Acoustic impedance===
&quot;Acoustic impedance&quot;, denoted &quot;Z&quot; and measured in Pa·m−3·s in SI units, is defined by
formula_3
where
* formula_4 is the Laplace transform of sound pressure,
* formula_5 is the Laplace transform of sound volume flow rate.

&quot;Specific acoustic impedance&quot;, denoted &quot;z&quot; and measured in Pa·m−1·s in SI units, is defined by
formula_6
where
* formula_4 is the Laplace transform of sound pressure,
* formula_8 is the Laplace transform of particle velocity.

===Particle displacement===
The &quot;particle displacement&quot; of a &quot;progressive sine wave&quot; is given by
formula_9
where
* formula_10 is the amplitude of the particle displacement,
* formula_11 is the phase shift of the particle displacement,
* k is the angular wavevector,
* &quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency.

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave &quot;x&quot; are given by
formula_12
formula_13
where
* &quot;v&quot;m is the amplitude of the particle velocity,
* formula_14 is the phase shift of the particle velocity,
* &quot;p&quot;m is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure,
* formula_15 is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of &quot;v&quot; and &quot;p&quot; with respect to time yields
formula_16
formula_17

Since formula_18, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by
formula_19

Consequently, the amplitude of the particle displacement is related to that of the acoustic velocity and the sound pressure by
formula_20
formula_21

==Inverse-proportional law==
When measuring the sound pressure created by a sound source, it is important to measure the distance from the object as well, since the sound pressure of a &quot;spherical&quot; sound wave decreases as 1/&quot;r&quot; from the centre of the sphere (and not as 1/&quot;r&quot;2, like the sound intensity):
formula_22

This relationship is an &quot;inverse-proportional law&quot;.

If the sound pressure &quot;p&quot;1 is measured at a distance &quot;r&quot;1 from the centre of the sphere, the sound pressure &quot;p&quot;2 at another position &quot;r&quot;2 can be calculated:
formula_23

The inverse-proportional law for sound pressure comes from the inverse-square law for sound intensity:
formula_24
Indeed,
formula_25
where
* formula_26 is the particle velocity,
* formula_27 is the convolution operator,
* &quot;z&quot;−1 is the convolution inverse of the specific acoustic impedance,
hence the inverse-proportional law:
formula_22

==Sound pressure level==

Sound pressure level (SPL) or acoustic pressure level (APL) is a logarithmic measure of the effective pressure of a sound relative to a reference value.

Sound pressure level, denoted &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; and measured in dB, is defined by:
formula_29
where
* &quot;p&quot; is the root mean square sound pressure,
* &quot;p&quot;0 is a reference sound pressure,
* is the neper,
* is the bel,
* is the decibel.

The commonly used reference sound pressure in air is

which is often considered as the threshold of human hearing (roughly the sound of a mosquito flying 3 m away). The proper notations for sound pressure level using this reference are or , but the suffix notations , , dBSPL, and dBSPL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.

Most sound-level measurements will be made relative to this reference, meaning will equal an SPL of formula_30. In other media, such as underwater, a reference level of is used. These references are defined in ANSI S1.1-2013.

The main instrument for measuring sound levels in the environment is the sound level meter. Most sound level meters provide readings in A, C, and Z-weighted decibels and must meet international standards such as IEC 61672-2013.

===Examples===
The lower limit of audibility is defined as SPL of , but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. While ( or ) is the largest pressure variation an undistorted sound wave can have in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (i. e., if the thermodynamic properties of the air are disregarded; in reality, the sound waves become progressively non-linear starting over 150 dB), larger sound waves can be present in other atmospheres or other media, such as underwater or through the Earth.

Ears detect changes in sound pressure. Human hearing does not have a flat spectral sensitivity (frequency response) relative to frequency versus amplitude. Humans do not perceive low- and high-frequency sounds as well as they perceive sounds between 3,000 and 4,000 Hz, as shown in the equal-loudness contour. Because the frequency response of human hearing changes with amplitude, three weightings have been established for measuring sound pressure: A, B and C. 

In order to distinguish the different sound measures, a suffix is used: A-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dBA or LA. B-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dBB or LB, and C-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dBC or LC. Unweighted sound pressure level is called &quot;linear sound pressure level&quot; and is often written as dBL or just L. Some sound measuring instruments use the letter &quot;Z&quot; as an indication of linear SPL.

===Distance===
The distance of the measuring microphone from a sound source is often omitted when SPL measurements are quoted, making the data useless, due to the inherent effect of the inverse proportional law. In the case of ambient environmental measurements of &quot;background&quot; noise, distance need not be quoted, as no single source is present, but when measuring the noise level of a specific piece of equipment, the distance should always be stated. A distance of one metre (1 m) from the source is a frequently used standard distance. Because of the effects of reflected noise within a closed room, the use of an anechoic chamber allows sound to be comparable to measurements made in a free field environment.

According to the inverse proportional law, when sound level &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;1 is measured at a distance &quot;r&quot;1, the sound level &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;2 at the distance &quot;r&quot;2 is
formula_31

===Multiple sources===
The formula for the sum of the sound pressure levels of &quot;n&quot; incoherent radiating sources is
formula_32

Inserting the formulas
formula_33
in the formula for the sum of the sound pressure levels yields
formula_34

<text>The House of Frankopan (, , , ) was a Croatian noble family, whose members were among the great landowner magnates and high officers of the Kingdom of Croatia in union with Hungary.

The Frankopans, along with the Zrinskis, are among the most important and most famous Croatian noble families who, from the 11th to the 17th century, were very closely connected with the history, past and destiny of the Croatian people and Croatia. For centuries, members of these noble clans were the bearers and defenders of Croatia against the Ottomans, but also resolute opponents of the increasingly dangerous Habsburg imperial absolutism and German hegemony, which in the spirit of European mercantilism sought to consolidate throughout the Habsburg Monarchy. The past of these two clans is intertwined with marital ties, friendships and participation in almost all significant events in Croatia, especially on the battlefields in the defense of Croatia from the Ottoman conqueror.

== History ==
The Frankopan family was one of the leading Croatian aristocratic families from the 12th to the 17th century. Since the 15th century they were trying to link themselves to the Roman patrician Frangipani family (which claimed descent from a Roman plebeian family of Anicii and ended in 1654 with Mario Frangipane being its last male descendant). However &quot;Croatian Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Italian Encyclopedia&quot; and German &quot;Biographical Lexicon of the History of Southeastern Europe&quot; by the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies highly question the bloodline connection between the two families and remind of the common fashion of medieval noble families in Europe to try and connect themselves to ancient Roman nobility. Along with the members of the Zrinski family the Frankopan ranked high in terms of importance by virtue of power, wealth, fame, glory and role in Croatian and Hungarian history. The first known member of Croatian lineage of the Frankopan family was Dujam I Krčki (&quot;Doymus Veglensis&quot; in Latin sources that also attribute the title of comes to him), lord of Krk who received permission by Domenico Michieli, Doge of Venice from 1118 to 1130, to rule the island of Krk as vassal of the Republic of Venice. His exact origin is unknown, but he and his descendants were referred to as the Counts of Krk in historical documents. In 1221, the brothers Henry and Servidon Frankopan received the islands of Brač, Hvar, Korčula and Lastovo as a gift from King Andrew II of Hungary for their services.
In 1428 Nikola IV Krčki (Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia from 1426 to 1432) was the first of the Counts of Krk to call himself Frankapan. In 1430 he managed to receive recognition from Pope Martin V for being a descendant of the old Roman patrician family Frangipani and officially started using the name and coat of arms Frangipani.

In 1240–1241 the Mongol Empire advanced from Poland toward Hungary whose King, Béla IV resisted bravely but finally had to seek refuge in Dalmatia. King Béla stayed with the Frankopans who assisted him with arms and funds and brought him into safety in Veglia and then brought him back to his own land. As reward the King gave the Frankopans the county of Senj with surrounding lands and the castle of Modruš.

In 1246 there was another war, between Frederick II, Duke of Austria and Béla, who, with the assistance of the Frankopan, won a victory. As a further reward, King Béla then, by royal decree, created the Frankopans as Lords of their territory for them and their descendants.

The Frankopans constantly supported the Catholic Church. In particular, Nikola Frankopan reconstructed the Holy House of Our Lady in 1294 in Tersatto (Trsat). It is recorded that in 1291, Nikola Frankopan sent a delegation to Nazareth to measure the Holy House after the House had been saved, presumably by the Crusaders, and brought to Trsat or Tersatto, on the Adriatic Coast where the Frankopans had a castle. In 1294 Nikola Frankopan, gave the Holy House to the Pope to be placed on Papal lands, at Loreto, near Ancona.
Although the possessions of the family were exposed to every assault both from the east and the west, their power increased steadily until the 17th century when their lands reached further east. The Zrinski and Frankopan families came into closer affinity by marriage ties until in the eyes of the European courts they had become one of the most important families of Croatia.

In 1420 the Swedish King Erik of Pomerania called Ivan VI Frankopan, the eldest son of the Croatian ban Nikola IV, to Sweden to accompany the Swedish King to the Holy Land and later to assist the King at the Court in Sweden. Ivan VI Frankopan lived in Sweden at intervals between 1420 and 1430. After his father&#x27;s death he returned to his home country. His eldest son called Matthias (Matija) stayed in Sweden.

In 1425 Emperor Sigismund confirmed the noble status of Nikola Frankopan referring to him as &quot;Niklas Frangiapan Comes de Begle, Segnie et Modrusse&quot; (&quot;Nikola Frankopan, Count of Krk, Senj and Modruš&quot;) using the Latin title of comes. He also granted the family the privileges of red wax, (Rotwachsprivilegien), i.e., the right to use red wax for their seals. Sigismund underlines at the end of this document that no one must ever dispute these rights of the family.

Bernardin Frankopan&#x27;s (1453–1529) paternal grandmother Dorothy was from a prominent Hungarian noble family, Garay, while his mother Isotta from Este family was Duchy of Ferrara of Ferrara. Through ancestry from royal Spanish families Bernardin had even Árpád ancestry (the Árpád dynasty founded the Kingdom of Hungary.) The Frankopan family was persecuted after the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy, where the Count Fran Krsto Frankopan participated in an uprising against Habsburg King Leopold I. He and his brother-in-law, Petar Zrinski were executed in Wiener Neustadt.

The line of Stjepan II Frankopan, Ban of Croatia (d. 1481), died out with Katarina Frankopan in the 16th century. The line of Sigismund Frankopan expired with Franjo Frankopan, Bishop of Eger in 1542. Another branch died out in 1572 with Franjo Frankopan, Ban of Croatia; and the Trsat branch died out with Fran Krsto Frankopan in 1671 (and in the female line with Maria Juliana Frankopan, married Countess of Abensberg und Traun and later Countess von Attems). 

=== Doimi de Lupis&#x27;s name claiming ===
In 1991, Vjekoslav Nikola Antun Doimi de Lupis (1939–2018), originally also Dujmić-Vukasinović, by then a British citizen, changed his name and surname to &quot;Louis Doimi de Frankopan Šubić Zrinski&quot; or &quot;Louis Michal Antun Doimi de Lupis de Frankopan Shubich Zrinski&quot; under British Civil law, adding several names of medieval Croatian noble families that combined in such a fashion were historically never attributed to any member of mentioned noble families. In the late 1990s, Louis&#x27;s cousin Mirko Jamnicki-Dojmi di Delupis wrote an open letter where he denounced claims over Frankopan, Šubić and Zrinski names by his family and presented the family tree of Dojmi di Delupis containing 129 names from the year 1200 onwards. Louis&#x27;s descendants include Lady Nicholas Windsor, and historian Peter Frankopan who also claimed that they always had the same name.

In 2002, the wife of Louis Doimi de Lupis, Swedish lawyer Ingrid Detter, bought the Ribnik Castle, once the property of the Frankopans, and today in the Register of Cultural Goods of Croatia (Z-301), for the price of 1.6 million kunas from the Ribnik municipality and in accordance with the decision of the Ministry of Culture, the Directorate for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, however hardly anything has been invested. In 2003, they also founded the literary awards &quot;Katarina Zrinska&quot; and &quot;Petar Zrinski&quot;, which were held only once. In the same year, during the Pope John Paul II visit of The Shrine of Our Lady of Trsat, which was tightly related to the Frankopan family, the members of de Lupis family managed to get presented not by their original name yet as Frankopans.

== Holdings ==

Several of the Frankopan castles remain in Croatia, mostly around the Gorski kotar region and the island of Krk. The castle at Stara Susica near Trsat incorporates structures going back to the Illyrian and Roman periods. The town of Bosiljevo has a medieval fortified castle, renovated in the last century in the spirit of the Romanesque. The castle and park at Severin na Kupi were owned by the Frankopan family until the mid-17th century. Other castles or property of the Frankopans could be found in Ribnik, Bosiljevo, Novi Vinodolski, Drivenik, Ogulin, Slunj, Ozalj, Cetingrad, Trsat, and other surrounding towns. The Frankopan castle in the town of Krk is currently used for open-air performances in the summer months. Some castles which were properties of the family:

<text>The current flag of Indiana was designed by Paul Hadley and officially adopted by the U.S state of Indiana on May 31, 1917.

It is the state&#x27;s third official flag and has remained unchanged except for the creation of a statute to standardize the production of the flag in 1955. Prior to 1955, it was referred to as the state&#x27;s official banner.

==History==
===First flag===
A state flag for Indiana was in use as early as 1885, depicting the seal of Indiana wrapped in an oak leaf wreath, a star-spangled shield with 13 stars and stripes below the seal, and a red scroll above the seal that bears the name Indiana.

On February 21, 1885, each state was asked to dedicate a state flag for the Washington Monument. At the time, Indiana lacked a state flag, and so the Indiana government had authorized Eliza Callis, the State Librarian for the Indiana State Library, to produce the first Indiana state flag. In 1893 when Benjamin Harrison came to Indianapolis the flag was flown to celebrate his arrival.

===Second flag===
In 1901, Senate Bill 239 of Chapter 150 in Laws of the State of Indiana sought to make the flag of the United States the official state flag of Indiana. This Act passed at the Sixty-Second Regular Session of the General Assembly, and was put into effect on March 9, 1901 when Governor Winfield Durbin signed the bill into law. This Act lasted until 1955 when the Indiana General Assembly amended the Act, officially recognizing Paul Hadley&#x27;s flag design as the state flag.

The bill reads as follows:
WHEREAS, The State of Indiana has no flag; and
WHEREAS, The flag of the United States is recognized as the flag of every State and Territory composing the United States; therefore
SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That said flag of the United States, representing each State with a star in a blue field, be and is hereby adopted as the flag of the State of Indiana.

===Current flag===
To commemorate the state&#x27;s 1916 centennial anniversary, the Indiana General Assembly issued a resolution to adopt a new state flag. At the request of the General Assembly, a contest was sponsored by the Indiana Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution to design a flag to serve as the official state banner. As an incentive to increase the number of submissions, the contest offered the winner a one hundred dollar cash prize. More than two hundred submissions were received and examined by the Society before a winner was selected. The entry created by Paul Hadley of Mooresville, Indiana, was ultimately chosen as the winner of the contest and the cash prize.

On May 31st, 1917, the flag was chosen as the state&#x27;s official banner. The General Assembly made only one change to Hadley&#x27;s original design: they added the word &quot;Indiana&quot;, in a crescent shape, over the top of the torch. The state &quot;banner&quot; was later designated as the state &quot;flag&quot; in a statute passed in 1955 that also standardized the dimensions of the flag, namely mandating a more rectangular aspect ratio as most Indiana state flags made until then were of a more squared shape.

===Flag evolution===

The symbols of the Indiana state flag such as the torch in a circle of stars were used in the Indiana Bicentennial Torch Relay in 2016. The torch on the Indiana state flag was created into a physical torch that was used for the event. 

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Indiana&#x27;s flag 32nd in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked.

==Iconography==
The flag consists of a gold torch that represents liberty &amp; enlightenment; the rays around the torch represent their far-reaching influence. The nineteen stars represent Indiana&#x27;s place as the nineteenth state to join the United States. The thirteen stars in the outer loop symbolize the original Thirteen Colonies, the five inner stars represent the next five states added to the Union, and the one large star above the torch represents Indiana.

==Statute==

The current statute that governs the design of the state flag states:

The flag&#x27;s dimensions shall be three feet fly by two feet hoist; or five feet fly by three feet hoist; or any size proportionate to either of those dimensions. The field of the flag shall be blue with nineteen stars and a flaming torch in gold or buff. Thirteen stars shall be arranged in an outer circle, representing the original thirteen states; five stars shall be arranged in a half circle below the torch and inside the outer circle of stars, representing the states admitted prior to Indiana; and the nineteenth star, appreciably larger than the others and representing Indiana shall be placed above the flame of the torch. The outer circle of stars shall be so arranged that one star shall appear directly in the middle at the top of the circle, and the word &quot;Indiana&quot; shall be placed in a half circle over and above the star representing Indiana and midway between it and the star in the center above it. Rays shall be shown radiating from the torch to the three stars on each side of the star in the upper center of the circle.

===Usage===
Several other laws govern the use of the state flag.

The flag is required to be flown by all state militias and the Indiana National Guard. It is to be on display at the Indiana Statehouse at all times, and a new and different state flag is required to replace the previous flag each day whenever doing so would be feasible and practicable. The flag must also be displayed at any agency that is funded in part or in full by the state government, including public schools, state universities, and state parks. When the state flag is in too poor of a condition that it is not fitting for display, the flag should be honorably destroyed using the same method provided for the retiring and disposing of the flag of the United States.

In all other respects, the Indiana state flag should be treated with the same care and respect as the flag of the United States.

===Colors===
Although there are no specified shades of blue, gold or buff, the Indiana Historical Bureau uses hex codes #000F5D (blue) and #D59F0F (gold) for digital files, and they use Pantone 072C (blue) and 109C (gold) for printing or painting.

===Design===

Despite the flag code only specifying for there to be six rays on the flag, many copies of the state flag place an additional ray in between the torch and the large star. The addition of a seventh ray matches Paul Hadley’s original flag design. Still, some flags only use six rays.

==Usage in popular culture==

A large variety of things utilize the colors and symbols of the state flag. This includes Indiana state agency logos, college logos, private business logos, license plates, monuments, art pieces, and flags and seals of counties and municipalities in Indiana just to list a few.

The team colors for the NBA&#x27;s Indiana Pacers were taken from the gold and blue of the flag.

In late 2008, Bloomington-licensed CW affiliate WTTV used the flag&#x27;s torch and stars element in their station logo until 2015 when they became a CBS affiliate, though the logo remains in use for their second digital subchannel.

The logo of the BP-acquired Amoco Corporation (formerly Standard Oil of Indiana) prominently features a torch to commemorate the company&#x27;s Hoosier origins; it remains in use at the few BP stations using Amoco and Standard trade dress to maintain trademark protection.

A variation of the Indiana state flag was used as the Gotham flag in the 1989 movie &quot;Batman&quot;. The flag can be seen in the mayor&#x27;s office.
After the Apollo 11 moon landing, a display case containing the state flag and 0.05 grams of space dust was created by NASA and presented to Governor Edgar D. Whitcomb. The display case remains on display at the Indiana State Museum.

In 1973, a piece of Lunar basalt 70017 was given to the state of Indiana by President Richard Nixon. A display case was created containing the piece of lunar basalt. Also on this display case, below the rock, is a copy of the state flag that had been carried to the Moon aboard Spacecraft America during the Apollo 17 mission.
==Flag proposals==
The idea of a state flag contest was first raised at the annual state DAR conference in 1915. To commemorate the state&#x27;s 1916 centennial anniversary, the Indiana General Assembly issued a resolution to adopt a new state flag. At the request of the General Assembly, a contest was sponsored by the Indiana Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution to design a flag to serve as the official state banner. This contest had received over two hundred flag submissions, including several flags designed by Paul Hadley. Of the flag submissions, only a few of them are known to have been documented.

<text>The flag of the State of Iowa is a vertical tricolor flag designed by Dixie Cornell Gebhardt in 1917. Iowa legislators officially adopted the flag in 1921.

== History ==
The State of Iowa did not have a banner for the first 75 years of its existence, largely because of calls for national unity during and after the American Civil War, in which Iowa fought for the Union. It was not until World War I that the creation of a state banner was requested, recorded first by the Iowa Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), while Iowa National Guardsmen positioned along the Mexican border made several requests for a banner, as other states had banners to represent themselves. In 1917, Iowa was one of three states that had no banner.

The flag was designed by DAR member and Knoxville, Iowa, resident Dixie Cornell Gebhardt, who was prompted to create the design by Iowa guardsmen. It was approved by the DAR flag committee in early May 1917 and presented to the Iowa State Council for Defense, where it was accepted on May 11, 1917. The flag was sent to Iowa troops for designation but would not be officially adopted as the state flag for nearly four more years.

Iowa governor William Lloyd Harding formally accepted the flag on behalf of the state on March 19, 1918, but legislative action on adoption failed in February 1919. Still, the Iowa Daughters met with legislators urging them to accept the flag again in September 1920, suggesting that past failures were caused by high expenses.

Despite not being adopted, the banner was used often throughout the nation to represent Iowa, notably in Continental Hall where it was among official flags of other states, though marked as unofficial. This was all the more reason to adopt the flag officially, according to the wife of congressman Horace Mann Towner.

Finally, in January 1921, Iowa legislators again deliberated on the adoption of an official banner, and by mid-March of that same year, the flag was accepted as law.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association placed Iowa&#x27;s flag 42nd in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked.

== Protocol and procedure ==
The banner is only to be used in official representation of the state of Iowa or in distinction between citizens of different states. The flag should always be flown below and &quot;subservient&quot; to the flag of the United States, while being provided and raised by public officers. Schools must fly the banner when classes are in session, and public buildings may fly the banner on secular days.

== Design ==
Iowa law officially describes the state flag.

Cornell Gebhardt assigned meaning to each color of the flag: blue represents loyalty, justice, and truth; white stands for purity; red symbolizes courage. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; suggested that the design hearkens back to Iowa&#x27;s history as a French territory, with both flags containing blue, white and red from left to right, though Iowa&#x27;s banner has a wider white section. The &quot;Register&quot; also stated that the word &quot;Iowa&quot; written in red symbolizes the &quot;Iowa soldier [writing] in letters of blood on the white page of history his unalterable determination to defend the ideals represented by the banner and its wonderful motto.&quot;

It is one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wyoming. The eagle carrying streamers in its beak also features on the Iowa state seal.

<text>Springhill is a 17th-century plantation house in the townland of Ballindrum near Moneymore, County Londonderry in Northern Ireland. It has been the property of the National Trust since 1957 and, in addition to the house, gardens and park, there is a costume collection.
It is open from March to June, and September on weekends, and is open to the public seven days a week during July and August.

==Features==
This 17th-century unfortified house was built about 1680-1695 and was originally surrounded by a defensive bawn. Around 1765 two single-storey wings were added and the entrance front was modified to its present arrangement of seven windows across its width.

==History==

===The Conyngham family===
The Conyngham family had come from Ayrshire in Scotland in about 1609, possibly from Glengarnock and the first of the family in Ulster was said to have been one of the family of the Earls of Glencairn. Alexander Conyngham, Dean of Raphoe, ancestor of the later Marquesses Conyngham, was probably a near relative - his son Sir Albert Cunningham&#x27;s portrait is at Springhill and not Slane Castle. They were granted lands under James I&#x27;s Plantation of Ulster in County Armagh and County Londonderry. The early history of the family is something of a mystery. Mina Lenox-Conynham asserted that a document previously held in the Public Records Office in Dublin asserted that the lands at Ballindrum (later Springhill) were in Conyngham hands as early as 1609, but she believed this record to have been destroyed during the Battle of Dublin and the shelling of the Four Courts It is believed that some form of farm dwelling was constructed on the estate in the second quarter of the seventeenth century (probably on the site of the present carpark) but this was destroyed during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

===William Conyngham I===
William Conyngham I (referred to in family documents as &quot;the elder&quot;) was a colonel in the Irish rebellion of 1641 and one of Cromwell&#x27;s Commissioners for County Armagh and held land at Drumcrow in the County and property in the town of Armagh itself. He was granted new title deeds by Cromwell in 1652, &#x27;the old ones having been destroyed in the recent wars&#x27;. He died in 1666, when High Sheriff of County Londonderry. In 1676 his widow lived in a house on the north side of Armagh with a garden and &quot;a little parke&quot; called &quot;Garreturne&quot;.

===William Conyngham II===
Marriage articles between William Conyngham II (known to the family as &quot;Good Will&quot;) and Ann Upton of Castle Upton near Templepatrick executed 168, stated that he was required &quot;to build a convenient house of lime and stone, two stories high ... with necessary office houses&quot; for his wife-to-be. It is widely believed that the present house owes its origin to this document though dendrochronological examination of the roof timbers on the central part of the house date the beams to after 1690. At this time, many of the surviving outbuildings along with the rare Dutch styled gardens were created.

===George Butle Conyngham===
From William Conyngham II, the estate passed to George Butle in 1721. George was the son of William Conyngham II&#x27;s sister Anne, who had married David Butle. George thereupon adopted the name Butle-Conyngham. Under the terms of the Plantation Grant, he reconstructed the village of Coagh in about 1755, naming the main square Hanover Square in deference to George II.

===Col. William Conyngham===
From George Butle Conyngham, the estate passed to his eldest son, Colonel William Conyngham of the 7th Dragoon Guards (known as the &quot;Black Horse&quot; regiment) in 1765. Col William added the two wings to either side of the house as a nursery and ballroom respectively.

===George Lenox-Conyngham===
Col. William Conyngham died without issue in 1784. The estate passed to his brother David Conyngham who also died childless four years later. As a result, the estate then passed to the son of their sister Ann who had married Clotworthy Lenox of Derry, grandson of James Lenox, Alderman of Derry (Mayor of Derry 1693 and 1697), remembered as one of the leaders of the Siege of Derry and the city&#x27;s Member of Parliament 1703–1713. Col. George Lenox, upon inheriting the estate, adopted the name Lenox-Conyngham and his descendants lived in the house until 1961. George served under Castlereagh in the Irish Volunteers but, after being betrayed by Castlereagh, resigned his commission in disgrace in 1816. As a result of this, combined with his depressive nature, he committed suicide later that year. His 2nd wife Olivia (4th daughter of William Irvine of Castle Irvine, County Fermanagh) is said to haunt the house to this day and is reputed to be the best documented ghost in Ireland. George Lenox-Conyngham married as his first wife Jane Hamilton of Castlefin, by whom he had a son and heir William Lenox-Conyngham. Jane&#x27;s mother was Jean Hamilton, daughter of John Hamilton of Brown Hall County Donegal; Jean married John Hamilton of Castlefin County Donegal, and after his death married George Lenox-Conyngham&#x27;s uncle William Conyngham.

===William Lenox-Conyngham, and the Lissan House connection===
From George, the house passed to his eldest son William Lenox-Conyngham in 1816. He had been a talented lawyer in Glasgow but left his legal career to run the estate. In 1818 he married Charlotte Staples, daughter of John Staples of Lissan House near Cookstown. John Staples was a respected lawyer and member of the Irish House of Commons. Staples first wife was Harriet Conolly of Castletown House in County Kildare. The descendants of their eldest daughter Louisa Anne inherited Castletown House after the death of Lady Louisa Conolly in 1821. His second wife was Henrietta Molesworth, daughter of Field Marshal Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth. Their son Thomas Staples became the 9th Lissan Baronet.

During William Lenox-Conyngham&#x27;s tenure, the estate was drained and improved and a large well-appointed dining room was added to the rear of the house, complete with a 17th-century Italian chimneypiece salvaged from Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol&#x27;s Ballyscullion House near Bellaghy which was demolished in about 1825.

===Sir William Fitzwilliam Lenox-Conyngham===
When William Lenox-Conyngham died in 1858, the estate passed to his eldest son Lieutenant Colonel Sir William Lenox-Conyngham who had married Laura Arbuthnot, daughter of George Arbuthnot of Elderslie (Founder of the Indian bank, Arbuthnot &amp; Co) in 1856. Her father&#x27;s elder brother was Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet, Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Sir William Lenox-Conyngham was highly involved in military matters and was knighted (Knight Commander of the KCB) by Queen Victoria in 1881. During his tenure, the estate was largely sold off under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act 1885 and the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 and was reduced to around three hundred acres. Finances became a grave concern for the family. Sir William was the last Agent of The Drapers&#x27; Company, overseeing their remaining estate in Northern Ireland, which had been extensive and included Draperstown and Moneymore.

===Decline of the Estate===
By the time of Sir William&#x27;s death in 1906, there was little left of the estate and as a result of some unwise investments, his son Lt. Col. William Arbuthnot Lenox-Conyngham found financial matters very trying. In 1899 he married Mina Lowry of Rockdale near Cookstown in County Tyrone. She was the last member of the family to live on the estate and she continued to do so even after the death of her son and the National Trust taking over in 1957, until her own death in 1961. Col. William Arbuthnot fought in both the Boer War and World War I and his younger brother Lt. Col. John Staples Molesworth Lenox-Conyngham was killed in action at Guillemont during the Battle of the Somme, on 3 September 1916, personally leading the 6th Battalion Connaught Rangers over the top and into the attack armed only with an ancient revolver. He is buried at Carnoy in France. The two wooden crosses that marked his grave were returned to Ireland and now lie inside St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Armagh, next to his memorial.

===National Trust===
William Arbuthnot Lenox-Conyngham died in 1938 and the estate passed to his elder son Capt. William Lowry Lenox-Conyngham who led the local Home Guard during the Second World War as a result of being invalided out of the National Defence Corps in 1940. Realising that the finances of the family were now in terminal decline and recognising that neither he nor his brother had any children to carry on the direct line, William Lowry entered into negotiations with the National Trust in 1956 with a view to handing over the house. This had followed a chance meeting with Nancy, Countess of Enniskillen who had presented Florence Court in County Fermanagh to the Trust the previous year. In the event, he signed his will bequeathing the house and estate to the National Trust only three days before his death in 1957.

William&#x27;s uncle George Hugh Lenox-Conyngham married Barbara Josephine née Turton whose mother Lady Cecilia was the daughter of Joseph Leeson, 4th Earl of Milltown of Russborough County Wicklow. They had two sons Denis Hugh and Alwyn Douglas and two daughters Cecilia Laura and Eileen Mary, born in Edinburgh. Their father had, like previous members of the family, been educated in Edinburgh, in George&#x27;s case at Fettes College where he was the first former pupil to return as a school master. After being Housemaster of Kimmerghame House, he became a priest. His first living was at Denver, Norfolk, then he was appointed Rector of Lavenham, a living that was held by his old Cambridge College Gonville &amp; Caius. Eileen, Denis, their mother Barbara and aunt Alice Lenox-Conyngham travelled on the Titanic.

Following the death of William Lowry in 1957, the head of the family became Captain Alwyn Douglas Lenox-Conyngham RN, his elder brother Denis having died in China in 1928, whilst serving with his regiment The Cameronians. His eldest son Charles Denis Lenox-Conyngham, former Managing Director of Blue Funnel Line and Chairman of Sealink is the current head of the family.

===Restoration===
Upon adopting the property, the National Trust undertook a large-scale programme of restoration and re-construction adopting the orthodoxy of 1950s conservation practice which saw the Victorian smoking room demolished, large portions of the house stripped back to stone and all the rooms re-arranged to reflect their appearance when first constructed.

==Present day==
The house today contains a vitally important and almost complete collection of one family&#x27;s occupation for three hundred years. In the Gun Room can be found one of the largest surviving 18th century wallpaper schemes surviving in the UK (Chinese wallpaper from the 1720s), along with a &quot;long gun&quot; dating to about 1680 which was presented to Alderman James Lenox after the Siege of Derry. Present is a six-inches-long muzzle-loader and two late 18th-Century blunder busses. The Library contains one of the most important collections of 17th and 18th century books in Ireland and is composed of around 3000 volumes, the oldest of which is a small Latin psalter of 1541.

In the old laundry can be found the largest costume collection in Northern Ireland (established by Viscount Clanwilliam in 1960) and a selection from the collection is displayed annually in the costume museum.

The bedroom contains an intriguing medicine chest, once owned by the 3rd Viscount Molesworth.

Springhill was used for the location of the three-part adaptation of Eugene McCabe’s modern Irish classic, &quot;Death and Nightingales&quot;, first broadcast in November 2018, featuring as the home of landowner Billy Winters.

<text>John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell (16 November 1921 – 16 December 1987), styled Viscount Amberley from 1931 to 1970, was the eldest son of the philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell (the 3rd Earl) and his second wife, Dora Black. His middle name was a tribute to the writer Joseph Conrad, whom his father had long admired. He was the great-grandson of the 19th-century British Whig Prime Minister Lord John Russell. He succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father on 2 February 1970.

== Education ==
John Russell was educated at the progressive Dartington Hall School, the University of California, Los Angeles and Harvard University. Upon leaving Harvard in 1943 he returned to Britain and enlisted in the Royal Naval Reserve. In the Reserve, he learned the Japanese language.

== Career ==
Russell had a distinguished early career, working for the FAO among other organisations, but in later life he was diagnosed as schizophrenic. This made him the only person in the United Kingdom to be denied the vote on two counts, first, for being a peer and, second, for being insane. He delivered a speech in the House of Lords on 18 July 1978 that was considered so outlandish that it was claimed to be the only speech unrecorded by Hansard, although it is included in the online version while lacking the final section that he had written but failed to read aloud after being interrupted.

== Personal life ==
He was married on 28 August 1946 to Susan Doniphan Lindsay, daughter of the poet Vachel Lindsay. They were divorced in 1955. They had three daughters: , Lady Sarah Elizabeth Russell , and Lady Lucy Catherine Russell (21 July 1948 – 11 April 1975). Neither Sarah nor Lucy married or bore children; Felicity had one daughter, Rowan. Like their father and mother, the three daughters had mental illnesses. Lucy, who was Bertrand Russell&#x27;s favourite grandchild, died from self-immolation, at the age of 26, in the forecourt of a church near Penzance, ostensibly protesting in the cause of world peace. Like her father Lucy was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Russell was succeeded as Earl by his half-brother, the historian Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell.

<doc id="495900" wikidata="Q180997" url="?curid=495900" title="Post mill">
<text>The post mill is the earliest type of European windmill. Its defining feature is that the whole body of the mill that houses the machinery is mounted on a single central vertical post. The vertical post is supported by four quarter bars. These are struts that steady the central post.

The body of the windmill can be turned around the central post to bring the sails into the wind. All post mills have an arm projecting from them on the side opposite the sails and reaching down to near ground level. With some, as at Saxtead Green, the arm carries a fantail to turn the mill automatically. With the others the arm serves to rotate the mill into the wind by hand. 

The earliest post mills in England are thought to have been built in the 12th century. The earliest working post mill in England still used today is to be found at Outwood, Surrey. It was built in 1665. The earliest remaining example of a non-operational mill can be found in Great Gransden in Cambridgeshire, built in 1612. 
Their design and usage peaked in the 18th and 19th centuries and then declined after the introduction of high-speed steam-driven milling machinery. Many still exist today, primarily in Northern Europe and Great Britain. The term &quot;peg mill&quot; or &quot;peg and post mill&quot; (in which the &quot;post&quot; was the tailpole used to turn the mill into the wind) was used in north-west England, and &quot;stob mill&quot; in north-east England, to describe mills of this type.

Post mills dominated the scene in Europe until the 19th century when tower mills began to replace them. The advantage of the tower mill over the earlier post mill is that it is not necessary to turn the whole mill (&quot;body&quot;, &quot;buck&quot;) with all its machinery into the wind; this allows more space for the machinery as well as for storage.

==Types of post mill==
There are many variations amongst post mills.

===Sunk post mill===
The earliest post mills were quite small, and this led to problems with stability as they were liable to blow down in strong winds. A solution was found by burying the bottom of the trestle in a mound of earth. The last sunk post mills in England were at Warton, Lancashire, and Essington, Staffordshire.

===Open trestle post mill===
As mills were made bigger, it was found that the trestle did not need to be buried. Thus the open trestle post mills were built. The oldest surviving is at Great Gransden, Cambridgeshire. Others exist in the UK at Bourn, Cambridgeshire; Great Chishill, Cambridgeshire; Nutley, Sussex and Chillenden, Kent. Open trestle post mills are also found in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and in New England, USA.
===Post mill with roundhouse===
The space around the trestle could be used for storage, but was open to the weather. Mill owners started to build roundhouses around the trestles, and later mills were built with a roundhouse from new. This had the dual advantage of creating a covered storage area and protecting the trestle from bad weather. In Suffolk, millwrights would build post mills mounted on tall, two or three storey roundhouses, as at Saxtead Green.
====Midlands post mill====
In the Midlands and North West of England, the top of the roundhouse had a curb, and rollers affixed to the mill body enabled the roundhouse to bear some of the weight of the mill. Examples of Midlands post mills extant include Danzey Green mill, (preserved at Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings) and the mill at Wrawby, Lincolnshire.

====Alternative ways to protect the trestle====
In eastern Europe, instead of a roundhouse an &quot;apron&quot; was fitted to the bottom of the body of the mill, enclosing the trestle and thereby affording protection from the weather.

===Hollow Post mill===

Some post mills are hollow post mills. In these mills the main post is bored to take a driveshaft, similar to an Upright Shaft in a smock or tower mill. This enables the mill to drive machinery in the base or roundhouse. Hollow post mills were not common in the United Kingdom. In the Netherlands, they are called &quot;Wipmolen&quot; and were mostly used for drainage. In France, the &quot;Moulin Cavier&quot; was a type of hollow post mill used for corn milling.

===Composite mill===

A few mills looked like post mills, but were not post mills. These composite mills often had a post mill body mounted on a short tower resembling a roundhouse, as at Banham and Thornham in Norfolk. Composite mills lack the central post on which the body of the post mill is mounted and turns upon to enable the mill to face the wind.

===Paltrok mill===

In the Netherlands and Germany, a variety of mill called the paltrok (Low German spelling &quot;Paltrock&quot;, from High German &quot;Pfalzrock&quot; (&quot;palisade skirt&quot;); the shape of the millhouse resembles that kind of garment) was built. Though similar in name and appearance, Dutch and German paltrok mills differ in historical and technical regard.

The Dutch paltrok mill was invented around 1600 and specifically designed for sawing wood. Several hundred have existed of this type of windmill; however, only five paltrok mills remain in the Netherlands, at Zaanse Schans, Haarlem, Zaandam, Amsterdam and at the Netherlands Open Air Museum, Arnhem. Dutch paltrok mills are, like post windmills, supported on a central wooden post around which the entire millhouse rotates. The central post, however, is short and, to provide stability, a rim bearing is added on a brick base, on which the millhouse rotates with numerous rollers. Side extensions protect the sawing floor and workmen from the weather.

German paltrok mills were commonly converted from post mills where the post and trestle were replaced by a wooden or iron rim bearing, set into the ground or on a brick base. The millhouse was enlarged and supported on this rim by numerous rollers or small wheels. These mills are technically composite mills although the tower is very short and of large diameter. This type of mill provided more internal space than a post mill and was cheaper than the alternative of erecting a smock mill.

<doc id="495901" wikidata="Q590821" url="?curid=495901" title="Flag of Kentucky">
<text>The flag of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a U.S. state, was adopted on March 26, 1918. In June 1962, it was slightly redesigned.

==History==
An early state flag design was first mentioned in 1883. The design was given to the Adjutant General&#x27;s Department. It was described as: &quot;It will bear the coat-of-arms of the state, the figures being correct portraits of Daniel Boone and Dick Tateboon companions of the early day.&quot;

The second state flag was designed by Jesse Cox Burgess, an art teacher in Frankfort, the state capital of Kentucky. It was adopted by the Kentucky General Assembly on March 26, 1918. In June 1962, the flag was standardized.

==Design==
The flag consists of the Commonwealth&#x27;s seal on a navy blue field, surrounded by the words &quot;Commonwealth of Kentucky&quot; above and sprigs of goldenrod, the state flower, below.

The seal depicts a pioneer and a statesman embracing. Popular belief claims that the buckskin-clad man on the left is Daniel Boone, who was largely responsible for the exploration of Kentucky, and the man in the suit on the right is Henry Clay, Kentucky&#x27;s most famous statesman. However, the official explanation is that the men represent all frontiersmen and statesmen, rather than any specific persons.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territorial flags; Kentucky&#x27;s flag was ranked 66th.

== Pledge ==
In 2000, the General Assembly adopted the following pledge of allegiance to the flag of Kentucky:

<doc id="495913" wikidata="Q558570" url="?curid=495913" title="Rick Law">
<text>Rick Law (born December 15, 1969) is an American entertainment illustrator and producer, best known for his career with The Walt Disney Company. His work has spanned across all forms of popular entertainment media: films, TV, music, theme park, print, toys, and video games.

==Early life==
Law was born in Maryland, and had a turbulent early childhood, before moving at age 11 with his family to Salinas, California, where he attended Salinas High School and graduated a year and 1/2 early. 
As a 15 year old, Law created a t-shirt design that caught the attention of music artist Steve Taylor and won Law a record company promotion. In 1986, at age 16, Law first attended San Diego Comic-Con where he was further inspired by other artists and creators he met there.

==Career==
Law&#x27;s first professional job came at age 17, designing logos for a real estate company. Law&#x27;s previous interaction with Taylor and his record company, eventually led Law to additional opportunities in creating art and working with others in the music industry including Amy Grant, MTV, Arista Records, Tower Records, Mariah Carey, The Choir and Pat Boone.

Law&#x27;s early efforts at producing included arranging concerts for performer Rich Mullins in Salinas. Law was also a founder and created the original logo art for the Spirit West Coast music festival in Monterey, CA.

Law&#x27;s initial foray into Hollywood came about during a 1988 trip to Los Angeles with a friend. Seeking a way to sneak into the Paramount Pictures movie studio became a chance encounter with director Richard Donner who allowed Law permission to visit his &quot;Scrooged&quot; set and access to the studio lot.

In 1989 Law was a consultant for &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. One of his observations on the initial shows&#x27; studio audience was to highlight those audience members who had less than optimal seating. The result was the creation of the recurrent &quot;Dog Pound&quot; comedy bit.

Law&#x27;s first movie poster design was for the 1992 Paramount Pictures film &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; starring Steve Martin.

In 1995 Law created the supernatural themed black &amp; white comic series &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, both writing and illustrating the series.

In 1996, Law illustrated &quot;Pond and Stream : Habitats&quot; for children&#x27;s educational publisher Evan-Moor.

<doc id="495954" wikidata="Q19374" url="?curid=495954" title="Flag of Louisiana">
<text>The flag of Louisiana consists of a rectangular field of blue with the arms of Louisiana, a pelican vulning herself, in white in the center, with a ribbon beneath, also in white, containing in blue the state motto: &quot;Union Justice Confidence&quot;. The flag was officially adopted July 1, 1912, and is often referred to as the Pelican flag.

==History==
As early as 1812, the brown pelican appeared on the Louisiana state seal, various militia company colors, and uniform buttons, including on a flag with a blue field and the phrase &quot;Union, Justice and Confidence&quot;.

===First flag===
On February 11, 1861, the state adopted a flag with a pale yellow star in a red canton and thirteen blue, white, and red stripes. The first flag was used until the end of the Civil War. The flag represented the 13 stripes of the U.S. flag, along with the red, white, and blue of the French tricolor and the yellow and red of the Spanish flag.

=== 1912 Flag ===
In 1878, after the end of Reconstruction in Louisiana, the pre-Civil War flag with a white pelican on a blue field came into common use; however, it was not designated as the state&#x27;s official flag by an act of the legislature. On June 5, 1912, Rep. William F. Roy of St. Bernard Parish introduced legislation adopting &quot;that flag now in general use&quot; as the state&#x27;s official flag. The bill was drafted by of the Louisiana Historical Society, which had endorsed the idea in April 1912. The flag was described at the time as &quot;a solid blue field with the coat of arms of the State, the pelican feeding its young, in white in the center, with a ribbon beneath, also in white, containing in blue the motto of the State, &#x27;Union, justice and confidence&#x27;&quot;. The bill passed the Louisiana House of Representatives on June 13 by a vote of 71–1. The state Senate followed suit on June 28, approving the measure 32–0. However, beyond stating that the pelican be rendered &quot;in white&quot;, the 1912 law did not specify details about the design of the pelican, its number of chicks, or other details, which led to variations in the bird&#x27;s appearance over the years. Even the shade of blue for the flag varied.

=== 21st-century standardization ===
During the 19th century, it was traditional on the state flag and seal for the pelican in her piety to have three drops of blood on her chest. In later years, however, the tradition (on both the state flag and seal) was haphazardly followed, which was noticed by an eighth-grader at Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma, who brought this to the attention of his state legislator.

On May 25, 2006, a law was enacted requiring the flag to include &quot;an appropriate display of three drops of blood&quot; on the pelican&#x27;s breast; however, it wasn&#x27;t until November 22, 2010, that a formal redesign of the flag with standardized imagery was formally introduced. Baton Rouge artist Curtis Vann Jr., who was hired to design a standardized pelican for the updated flag, used a more realistic depiction of a brown pelican for his design, although rendered in white as required by law, but he also incorporated the brown pelican&#x27;s yellow–brown crown. The design also specified an azure field and removed &quot;and&quot; from the banner beneath the pelican&#x27;s nest.

==Symbolism==

In medieval lore, pelicans were believed to be attentive to the needs of their chicks to the point of drawing their own blood to feed their chicks when no other food was available. This image of the pelican in her piety came to symbolize the Passion of Jesus and the Eucharist.

William C. C. Claiborne, the first governor of the Orleans Territory, selected a pelican for the territory&#x27;s first seal and it was a common state symbol prior to being formally adopted in 1912 as part of the state flag.

==Pledge of allegiance==
The Louisiana Pledge of Allegiance, adopted in 1981, is as follows: 
&quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the state of Louisiana and to the motto for which it stands: A state, under God, united in purpose and ideals, confident that justice shall prevail for all of those abiding here.&quot;

<doc id="495959" wikidata="Q5253682" url="?curid=495959" title="Delfinen-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Delfinen&quot;-class submarines were the first class of submarines constructed for the Royal Danish Navy following World War II. They were designed and built within Denmark, with first three boats of the class financed by Denmark. The fourth was financed by the United States (where it was known as SS-554) under the Cost Share program. Constructed between 1956 and 1963, the class comprising four submarines (, , and ) entered service in 1961 and the last taken out of service in 1990. Replaced by the Norwegian , three of them were scrapped while a fourth was converted into a museum ship and remains on display at the Aalborg Maritime Museum.

==Description==
The &quot;Delfinen&quot; class had a standard displacement of and when submerged. They measured long with a beam of and a draught of . The submarines were propelled by two shafts powered by two B&amp;W diesel engines and two BBC electric motors. The submarines had a maximum speed of both surfaced and submerged and a range of at . The submarines were equipped with passive and active sonar and a schnorkel. The &quot;Delfinen&quot; class were armed with four torpedo tubes located in the bow. They had a complement of 33.

==Ships==
==Construction and service==
Following World War II, the Royal Danish Navy which had lost the majority of its fleet during the German invasion, was restocked with ex-British Royal Navy submarines on loan and salvaged Danish submarines that had been scuttled during the war. Denmark joined NATO and was assigned the defence of the Baltic Sea which led to an emphasis on submarines. The &quot;Delfinen&quot; class marked the Royal Danish Navy&#x27;s first new submarines in the post war era. Designed by the Danish and constructed at the Naval Shipyard in Copenhagen, the first three vessels in the class were paid for the Danish and were constructed between 1956 and 1961. The fourth submarine of the class, &quot;Springeren&quot;, was financed by the United States and known as SS-554.

The class remained in service until the beginning of the 1980s, when the Royal Danish Navy intended to replace them with former Norwegian s in 1986. Only three &quot;Kobben&quot;-class units were acquired due to a lack of funds and &quot;Springeren&quot; remained in service until 1990. &quot;Springeren&quot; is preserved as a museum ship at the Langeland Fortet Museum.

<text>The flag of Maine features the state coat of arms on a blue field. In the center of a heraldic shield, a moose rests under a tall pine tree. A farmer and seaman are meant to represent the traditional reliance on agriculture and the sea by the state. The North Star is intended to allude to the state motto: &quot;dirigo&quot; (&#x27;I lead&#x27;).

The North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) conducted a survey in 2001 that ranked Maine&#x27;s current flag as one of the worst in design. Amongst the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags, Maine&#x27;s flag ranked 60th (13th worst).

==Statute and design==

The law establishing the flag was enacted on February 23, 1909, and was modeled after flags used in the American Civil War:

§206. State flag. The flag to be known as the official flag of the State shall be of blue, of the same color as the blue field in the flag of the United States, and of the following dimensions and designs; to wit, the length or height of the staff to be 9 feet, including brass spearhead and ferrule; the fly of said flag to be , and to be on the staff; in the center of the flag there shall be embroidered in silk on both sides of the flag the coat of arms of the State, in proportionate size; the edges to be trimmed with knotted fringe of yellow silk, wide; a cord, with tassels, to be attached to the staff at the spearhead, to be long and composed of white and blue silk strands. A flag made in accordance with the description given in this section shall be kept in the office of the Adjutant General as a model.

The design commonly used omits the circular ring prescribed by Maine Law as a part of the Maine arms and moves the &quot;Sea and Forest Scene&quot; from the outside of the shield to the inside of the shield. No known flags of the state conform to the official description. The coat of arms has no official colors, so variations in coloration can be seen in flags from different manufacturers. The blue field, however, is specified to be the same blue as in the flag of the United States. According to the official description, the flag should have a fringe of yellow silk and should have a blue and white silk cord attached at the spearhead; these embellishments are very rarely observed.

==History==
===First flag===

Originally, the 1901 Maine flag consisted of a green pine tree, a Indigenous-derived symbol of New England and freedom, in the center, with a blue &quot;North Star&quot;, all on a buff-colored background.

===Second flag===
The Maine legislature approved the current flag of Maine on February 24, 1909.

===Ensign===

Maine is also one of only two states with a separate ensign, which is rarely seen (the other is Massachusetts). It features symbols from the current flag and the older one, with a white field and green pine tree. The green pine tree has the foul anchor, and the words &quot;MAINE&quot; and &quot;DIRIGO&quot; around it.

A photograph of the earliest-known specimen of the Maine merchant and marine flag was featured in a June 1939 International News Photos wire photo.

===First Militia Flags===

Maine had a semi official state color used by its militia from 1822 to 1861. After separating from Massachusetts in 1820, the Maine Adjutant General Samuel Cony needed to supply flags for Maine&#x27;s approximately 100 militia companies because one of the articles of separation required Maine to return all militia flags (but it failed to mention poles, which were retained and reused). Casting about for a cost-effective method of producing such quantity of flags, he engaged John R. Penniman of Boston in 1822 to provide a suitable design which was engraved onto a copper plate and then printed onto silk in multi-colors, the first known production of such for flags. A second printing was done in 1827. About a dozen or so portions of these flags still exist, including one at the Maine Historical Society still mounted on its original pole. The last known instance of a Maine militia unit using this flag was in 1861 at the First Battle of Bull Run, which was recorded as being captured by Confederate forces.

===Flag of the 20th Maine===

Several flags were used by the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War.

===Bicentennial Flag of 2020===

In 2019, Maine lawmakers introduced a bill to adopt a simpler flag for the state, based on the original 1901 flag. A flag with a buff background, a blue star, and green pine tree from the Merchant and Marine flag, created by the Maine Flag Company, was one of the proposed options. Maine resident Jeff Van West also submitted a design for the new flag. His flag had a white star on a dark blue of a night sky over a lighter blue representing the rivers, ponds, and oceanfront of Maine. He had the tree extend off the flag border to give the feeling of being in the forest looking out over the water.

The measure to change the state flag failed. However, the legislature approved creating a flag for Maine&#x27;s Bicentennial in 2020. Secretary of State Matt Dunlap submitted three designs for public comment: one of his own design, one using the Maine Bicentennial Committee logo, and a third based on Van West&#x27;s flag, but replacing the white star with the red/gold/white Dirigo Star from the state flag. After the third design won the contest, Van West offered Dunlap a further revision replacing the multicolored Dirigo Star with a monochromatic white version. Dunlap approved that design as the Maine 2020 Bicentennial Flag.

A grass-roots movement to adopt a modernized version of the 1901 flag has since sprung up.

===2024 redesign and referendum===
In November 2024, the state held a referendum on whether to restore the 1901 flag or keep the current one. The referendum had initially been scheduled for 2023, but the Maine Legislature delayed it until 2024. The Legislature then attempted a further delay until 2026, which was vetoed by Governor Janet Mills. On August 5, 2024, the winner of the flag redesign contest was announced, with honors going to Adam Lemire of Gardiner, Maine. His design, chosen out of more than 400 entries, features a pine tree modeled after one he saw in Viles Arboretum in Augusta, Maine. It has sixteen branches, one for each of Maine&#x27;s counties. The referendum, held as part of the 2024 United States elections, saw the proposed flag rejected by 55% to 45%.

<text>The flag of Maryland is the official flag of the U.S. state of Maryland and the 17th-century heraldic banner of arms of Cecil, 2nd Baron Baltimore. It consists of the arms of his father George, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1632), quartered with those of his grandmother, heiress of the Crossland family. The flag was officially adopted by the Maryland General Assembly in 1904.

==History==

The Maryland colony was founded by The 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), which was granted to him as the son and heir of The 1st Baron Baltimore by King Charles I, hence the use of his banner of arms as the flag. During the colonial period, only the gold (yellow) and black Calvert arms were associated with Maryland. The state stopped using the colors following American independence, but they were reintroduced in 1854.

The red and white cross bottony counterchanged had gained popularity during the American Civil War. Maryland had remained loyal to the U.S. despite it being a slave state and a large proportion of its citizens supporting the Confederacy, the latter being particularly concentrated in the city of Baltimore, the counties of the southern part of the state, and the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Those Marylanders who supported the Confederacy, many of whom fought in the Army of Northern Virginia of Robert E. Lee, adopted the Crossland banner (seen as &quot;secession colors&quot;) and often used a metal bottony cross pinned to their gray uniforms or caps (kepis). The black and gold bend dexter counterchanged of the Barons Baltimore was used in the flags and devices and pinned on the uniforms of Union Army regiments in the Army of the Potomac. After the war, Marylanders who had fought on either side of the conflict returned to their state in need of reconciliation.

The present design, which incorporates both of the coats of arms used by George Calvert, began to appear officially after the Civil War. The flag in its present form was first flown in Baltimore, on October 11, 1880, at a parade marking the 150th anniversary of the founding of Baltimore (1729–1730). It was flown again on October 25, 1888, at the Gettysburg Battlefield during ceremonies dedicating monuments to the Maryland regiments of the Army of the Potomac by reorganized regiments of the former state militia, now the Maryland National Guard.

The flag was not officially adopted as the state flag until 1904. The present flag is symbolic of the reunion of all the citizens in the state and is represented through the colors of the flag.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association placed Maryland&#x27;s flag fourth best in design quality out of the 72 flags of the provinces of Canada, the U.S. states, and the territories of the United States. It finished behind the flags of New Mexico, Texas and Quebec respectively.

===Previous designs===
Post-independence and the discontinuation of the Calvert flag, many banners were used to represent Maryland. By the Civil War, the most common design representing all of Maryland consisted of the seal of Maryland on a blue background. Pre-1876 the Maryland seal did not include the current Maryland flag on it. These banners were unofficial, and designs varied. It is not known the exact specifications of these banners.

===Current design===
The banner of arms of the Barons Baltimore, the present flag is a quartered field with the arms of The 1st Baron Baltimore in the canton (1st quarter) and the lower fly (4th quarter), with the arms of Alicia Crossland in the upper fly and lower hoist (2nd and 3rd quarters).

In the black and gold quarters of the flag is the arms of The 1st Baron Baltimore, a former Secretary of State, granted as a reward for his storming a fortification during a battle. (The vertical bars approximate the bars of the palisade.) The red and white quarter is the coat of arms of the Crossland family, the family of Lord Baltimore&#x27;s mother from South Crosland in West Yorkshire, England, and consists of a cross bottony with the red and white sides of the cross alternating. Since Lord Baltimore&#x27;s mother was a heraldic heiress, he was entitled to use both arms in his banner of arms. Upon the death of George, Lord Baltimore, in April 1632, the right to bear the arms and banner passed to his eldest son Cecil, 2nd Baron Baltimore, to whom the Province of Maryland was granted that same year.

The heraldic blazon is: &quot;Quarterly, 1st and 4th, paly of six Or and Sable, a bend counterchanged (for Calvert); 2nd and 3rd, quarterly argent and gules, a cross bottony counterchanged (for Crossland)&quot;.

====Color scheme====
==Uses==

The Calvert and Crossland arms and banner, and the Maryland flag itself, have been adapted for use in various ways across the state.

===Official===
*The gold and black Calvert coat of arms and red and white Crossland coat of arms are featured in the seal of the town of Ferryland, Newfoundland, the present-day site of Calvert&#x27;s Colony of Avalon.
*Some Maryland counties and municipalities have arms and/or flags incorporating various elements of the arms, including the city of Baltimore, as well as Calvert, Caroline, Baltimore, Howard, and Worcester counties.
*From 1986 to 2010, Maryland&#x27;s standard issue license plates were white with black lettering and a central seal with the flag&#x27;s unique design. The 1986 plates are still valid and widely seen after being temporarily replaced by a design commemorating the bicentennial of the War of 1812, which had its Chesapeake Campaign in the state. On Monday, September 26, 2016, Maryland offered the option to replace the commemorative War of 1812 license plates with plates featuring a flowing Maryland flag beneath tag number. Maryland driver&#x27;s licenses also use the pattern of the state flag.
*The flag of the short-lived Republic of Maryland—a state established by the Maryland State Colonization Society to &quot;repatriate&quot; freed slaves in Africa—also used Calvert&#x27;s black and yellow.

===Education===
*The school colors of Calvert School, an independent school in Baltimore City, are black and gold.
*Goucher College incorporates the flag in its seal.
* The seal of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore features the same design and colors as the Maryland flag. The Johns Hopkins colors are sable and gold, taken from the Calvert coat of arms (though the athletic colors are blue and white, as the school mascot is the blue jay).
* The shield of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College) utilizes both the Calvert shield in its upper-left quadrant, as well as a stylized red and yellow quadrant, symbolic of the Maryland state flag.
*The school colors of Towson University, a member of the University System of Maryland, are black and gold, and the university seal incorporates the Calvert and Crossland shield.
*The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), also in the University System of Maryland, uses all four colors in its main logo.

===Sport===
* An alternate logo of the Baltimore Ravens professional football team in the National Football League is a shield with alternating Calvert and Crossland Banners interlocked with a stylized &quot;B&quot; and &quot;R&quot;.
* The University of Maryland, College Park athletic teams have long used the colors of the state flag. All four colors from the flag are currently used, with the primary colors being red and white, with black and gold used as accent colors. The Maryland flag is also displayed on the right shoulder of the football uniforms. At the start of the 2011 football season, the team unveiled a new uniform designed by Baltimore-based sportswear company Under Armour combining both parts of the flag. Similarly, the men&#x27;s lacrosse team features designs from the flag on the jersey shoulders.
* Beginning on September 9, 2008, the University of Maryland painted both end zones at SECU Stadium with the flag&#x27;s two patterns.
*The Baltimore Dragon Boat Club features the flag motif in its logo.
*Starting with the 2009 season, the Baltimore Orioles major league baseball club has added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms that features a round version of the Maryland flag.
*Maryland-based company Under Armour released a line of cleats in 2017, with the Crossland coat of arms design incorporated into the cleats. Under Armour bags also incorporate the flag in its design starting in late 2015 and is seen at its outlet mall locations.
*Junior Hockey teams Maryland Black Bears (NAHL) and Team Maryland (EHL) sport the flag on their team jerseys.

===Other===
*Southwest Airlines painted a Boeing 737-700 in a Maryland state flag theme in 2005, dubbed &quot;Maryland One&quot; in recognition of the airline&#x27;s hub in Baltimore.
* The world&#x27;s only full size chain mail/scale mail Maryland flag was created by Brian Galloway, a retired U.S. Air Force veteran from Cecil County. It is , consisting of over 22,000 individual aluminum scales, over 45,000 rings, and weighs close to .
* The flag, as a coat of arms, is used on the state&#x27;s welcome sign.
==Legal description==
Section 7-202 of the General Provisions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland provides:
&quot;(a) The State flag is divided into quarters.
(b) The first and fourth quarters are a paly of six pieces, or (gold) and sable
(black), and a bend dexter (right diagonal band) counterchanged, so that they consist of six alternating gold and black vertical bars with a diagonal band on which the colors are reversed.
(c) The second and third quarters are quartered argent (white) and gules (red), a cross bottony counterchanged, so that they consist of a quartered field of white and red, charged with a Greek cross that has arms terminating in trefoils and opposite coloring
so that red is on the white quarters and white is on the red quarters, as represented on the escutcheon of the State seal.&quot;

The Maryland 
Secretary of State publishes a &quot;Protocol for the Maryland State Flag&quot; which, among other things, specifies the colors of the flag:

1.04. The red and yellow colors in the Maryland flag should conform to the following Pantone Matching System colors:
* red on coated stock: PMS 201
* red on uncoated stock: PMS 193
* yellow on coated stock: PMS 124
* yellow on uncoated stock: PMS 124

==Flagpole restrictions==

In 1945, the Maryland General Assembly made a gold cross bottony the official ornament for the top of any flagpole carrying the state flag. Maryland is the only state in the union that has a specific guideline not only on how to display the flag but also on what ornament should be on top of the flagpole as well. Sometime before October 10, 2007, Government House (the Governor&#x27;s Mansion) in Annapolis ceased to display the cross bottony at the top of the flag pole, but the flags at the State House continue to do so (adhering to Maryland General Provisions Code § 7-202 &amp; 7-203 (2016)). In March 2015, the gold cross bottony was put back on top of the flag pole on Government House (Governor&#x27;s Mansion). All other state government buildings, including public schools, obey this guideline, but many private individuals and businesses do not.

<text>The GP14 is a wooden or fibreglass hulled double-handed fractional Bermuda rigged sailing dinghy designed by Jack Holt in 1949.

The class is active in the UK, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and parts of the north-eastern USA. With over 14,000 built, the GP14 is popular for both racing and cruising.

== Design ==

The GP14 was designed by Jack Holt in 1949, with the assistance of the Dovey Yacht Club in Aberdyfi. The idea behind the design was to build a General Purpose (GP) 14-foot dinghy which could be sailed or rowed, capable of also being powered effectively by a small outboard motor, able to be towed behind a small family car and able to be launched and recovered reasonably easily, and stable enough to be able to lie to moorings or anchor when required. Racing soon followed, initially with some degree of opposition from Yachting World, who had commissioned the design, and the boat soon turned out to be an outstanding racing design also.

The boat was initially designed with a main and small jib as a comfortable family dinghy. In a design philosophy that is both practical and highly redolent of social attitudes of the day the intention was that she should accommodate a family comprising parents plus two children, and specifically that the jib should be modest enough for &quot;Mum&quot; or older children to handle, while she should perform well enough to give &quot;Dad&quot; some excitement when not taking the family out. While this rig is still available, and can be useful when using the boat to teach sailing, or for family sailing, and has some popularity for cruising, the boat is more commonly seen with the full modern rig of a mainsail, genoa and spinnaker. Australian boats also routinely use trapezes.

In the late eighties underfloor buoyancy was introduced to the foam-reinforced plastic (FRP) boats, and the internal layout of these boats underwent several stages of modernisation. In the early 1990s a new internal layout was introduced in the wooden boats (the &quot;Series 2&quot;), with built-in underfloor buoyancy.

This was further modified over the following years, led by boat builders Alistair Duffin, who builds in wood, and Holt Allen (later Speed Sails Ltd and now Winder Boats), who manufacture in GRP (glass-reinforced plastic) and FRP. As of the 2011 RYA Dinghy Show a new builder in FRP, Boon Boats, has entered the market with a significantly different interior layout, developed in agreement with the Class Association. The majority of wooden boats in recent years have been built by Alistair Duffin. Another highly respected wooden boat builder of the class, Tim Harper, has recently returned to building them after a period not doing so. New to the fleet of wooden builders is Gingerboats. A few boats are still amateur built, and one amateur-built boat won the National Championship in both 2002 and 2005 (and is still regularly winning in top flight competition), while another amateur-built boat came second in the 2006 World Championship. Racing honours are evenly divided between the wooden and the plastic boats. New boats are currently available in wood, GRP and FRP.

== Racing ==
The biannual GP14 World Championships where most recently held at Plas Heli in Pwllheli, Wales and was won by Matt Mee and Chris Robinson of Red Wharf Bay Sailing Club and Blackpool  &amp; Fleetwood Yacht Club respectively. The 2026 Worlds are due to be held at the Royal Northern Ireland Yacht Club in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 

== Cruising ==
A number of owners cruise the boats, in some cases as well as racing them and in other cases in preference to racing, and cruises have ranged from the gentlest day sailing to such ambitious undertakings as crossings of the English Channel and the Irish Sea, and a circumnavigation of the Isle of Mull. Indeed in 1959 one intrepid owner sailed single-handed from Southend to Calais, and followed this in 1962 with a trip from Dover to Ostend. More recently, in 2011, two GP14s in company cruised the full length of the Great Glen, from Fort William to Inverness.

In the very early days of the class, when people used to a more traditional type of dinghy dubbed this new creation the &quot;floating coffin&quot;, Roger Seal conclusively demonstrated her seaworthiness by sailing from Cardiff to New Quay, Wales, via St. David&#x27;s Head.

Very occasional cruising owners camp aboard, although it has to be admitted that space for this is more than a little restricted.

Most serious cruising boats, even if only day-cruising, set dedicated cruising sails; these are constructed differently from racing sails and from heavier but more supple cloth, and are nearly always equipped with a means of reefing. The original design, with the small jib, provided for square gooseneck roller reefing for the main; modern boats usually prefer slab/jiffy reefing for the main, and some set fully reefable genoas by means of a headsail reefing drum and associated equipment (including a reefing spar).

An active Class Association supports both racing and cruising activities.

<text>In geology, a graben () is a depressed block of the crust of a planet or moon, bordered by parallel normal faults.

==Etymology==
&quot;Graben&quot; is a loan word from German, meaning &#x27;ditch&#x27; or &#x27;trench&#x27;. The first known usage of the word in the geologic context was by Eduard Suess in 1883. The plural form is either &quot;graben&quot; or &quot;grabens&quot;.

==Formation==
A graben is a valley with a distinct escarpment on each side caused by the displacement of a block of land downward. Graben often occur side by side with horsts. Horst and graben structures indicate tensional forces and crustal stretching.

Graben are produced from parallel normal faults, where the displacement of the hanging wall is downward, while that of the footwall is upward. The faults typically dip toward the center of the graben from both sides. Horsts are parallel blocks that remain between graben; the bounding faults of a horst typically dip away from the center line of the horst. Single or multiple graben can produce a rift valley.

==Half-graben==

In many rifts, the graben are asymmetric, with a major fault along only one of the boundaries, and these are known as half-graben. The polarity (throw direction) of the main bounding faults typically alternates along the length of the rift. The asymmetry of a half-graben strongly affects syntectonic deposition. Comparatively little sediment enters the half-graben across the main bounding fault because of footwall uplift on the drainage systems. The exception is at any major offset in the bounding fault, where a relay ramp may provide an important sediment input point. Most of the sediment will enter the half-graben down the unfaulted hanging wall side (e.g., Lake Baikal).

<doc id="495981" wikidata="Q221881" url="?curid=495981" title="Flag of Massachusetts">
<text>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been represented by official but limited-purpose flags since 1676, though until 1908 it had no state flag &quot;per se&quot; to represent its government. A variant of the white flag with blue seal was carried by each of the Massachusetts volunteer regiments during the American Civil War alongside the National Colors. An exception were the two &quot;Irish regiments&quot; (the 9th and 28th Volunteers), each of which was permitted to carry an alternative green flag with a harp symbol. 

The state currently has three official flags: a state flag, a governor&#x27;s flag, and a &quot;naval and maritime flag&quot; (despite it no longer having its own naval militia). With Florida, it is one of only two state flags to prominently feature a Native American in its heraldry. In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Massachusetts&#x27;s state flag 38th in design quality out of 72 flags (U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial).

In early 2021, then-Governor Charlie Baker signed a bill to change the state flag and seal. As of 2022, the redesign was not complete and the commission asked to extend the deadline to 2023. In 2023 the commission concluded without recommending specific replacements for either flag or seal, though the commission&#x27;s co-chair Brian Boyles stated that he and his colleagues had made significant progress on the issue.

== State flag ==

The flag of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts displays, on both sides, the state coat of arms on a white field. The shield is meant to depict an Algonquian Native American with bow and arrow; the arrow is pointed downward, signifying peace. However, the face of the figure is modelled on a photo of Ojibwe chief Thomas Little Shell. A white star with five points appears next to the figure&#x27;s head, signifying Massachusetts as a U.S. state. A blue ribbon surrounds the shield, bearing the state motto &quot;Ense Petit Placidam, Sub Libertate Quietem&quot; (&quot;By the Sword We Seek Peace, But Peace Only Under Liberty&quot;). 

Above the shield is the state military crest: the bent arm holding a broadsword aloft. The sword has its blade up, to remind that it was through the American Revolution that liberty was won. The sword itself is a copy of one belonging to Myles Standish and signifies the philosophy that one would rather lose their right arm than live under tyranny.

The state flag was officially adopted in 1907, but had been used unofficially since the American Revolutionary War as the ensign of the Massachusetts State Navy. In 1971, the earlier pine tree was replaced by the current design.

===Attempts to change the flag===

On January 11, 2021, Governor Charlie Baker signed a bill establishing a commission to change the state flag and seal by October 1, 2021 that will &quot;faithfully reflect and embody the historic and contemporary commitments of the Commonwealth to peace, justice, liberty and equality and to spreading the opportunities and advantages of education.&quot; The bill was previously approved by the Massachusetts Senate on July 28, 2020. The Special Commission on Massachusetts Flag and Seal (Special Commission to Investigate the Features of the Official Seal and Motto of the Commonwealth) first met in July 2021. In April 2022 the Commission voted to ask the state legislature to extend the deadline for completion of the Commission&#x27;s work to March 31, 2023
In May 2022, the Commission recommended changing the seal, motto, and flag, however the Commission failed to agree upon a proposal. With lawmakers not having extended the deadline past December 31, 2022, and the Commission&#x27;s own deadline having expired at the end of March 2023, as well as UMass Amherst polling showing lukewarm support for a change, the issue appeared to be closed for the time. On July 29, 2024, Governor Maura Healey signed off on a budget amendment to change the state flag and seal.

===Historical and related flags===
== Naval and maritime flag ==
In April 1776, the Massachusetts State Navy adopted, as its flag (naval ensign), a white field charged with a green pine tree and the motto &quot;An Appeal to Heaven.&quot; In 1971 the motto was removed, and the flag was designated &quot;the naval and maritime flag of the Commonwealth&quot;.

Massachusetts is one of only three states with its own maritime ensign. The second is Maine, which was part of Massachusetts until 1820. Third and last is South Carolina, which activated her navy twice: first during the American Revolutionary War and again during the American Civil War.

<doc id="495983" wikidata="Q771592" url="?curid=495983" title="Aulacogen">
<text>An aulacogen is a failed arm of a triple junction. Aulacogens are a part of plate tectonics where oceanic and continental crust is continuously being created, destroyed, and rearranged on the Earth’s surface. Rift zones are places where new crust is formed. An aulacogen is a rift zone that is no longer active.

==Origin of term==
The term &quot;aulacogen&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;aulax&quot; &#x27;furrow&#x27; and was suggested by the Soviet geologist Nikolay Shatsky in 1946.

== Formation ==
A triple junction is the point where three tectonic plates meet; the boundaries of these plates are characterized by divergence, causing a rift zone or spreading center; a transform fault; or convergence causing subduction or uplift of crust and forming mountains. The failed arm of a triple junction can be either a transform fault that has been flooded with magma, or more commonly, an inactive rift zone. Aulacogen formation starts with the termination of an active rift zone, which leaves behind a graben-like formation. Over time, this formation starts to subside and eventually minor volcanism starts to take place. The final inversion stage takes place when tectonic stress on the aulacogen changes from tensional to compressional forming horsts. The inversion of ancient, buried aulacogens can exert a dramatic effect on crustal deformation.

== Characteristics ==
Aulacogens can become a filled graben, or sedimentary basin surrounded by a series of normal faults. These can later become the pathway for large river systems such as the Mississippi River. The rock forming an aulacogen is brittle and weak from when the rift zone was active, causing occasional volcanic or seismic activity. Because this is an area of weakness in the crust, aulacogens can become reactivated into a rift zone. An example of a reactivated aulacogen is the East African Rift or the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, an ancient aulacogen that reactivated during the breakup of Pangaea. Abandoned rift basins that have been uplifted and exposed onshore, like the Lusitanian Basin, are important analogues of deep-sea basins located on conjugated margins of ancient rift axes.

==Examples==

=== Africa ===
* The Benue Trough in Nigeria, formed as part of the Early Cretaceous rifting that predated the separation of South America from Africa

===Asia===
* The Cambay rift in India
* The Kutch rift in India

=== Europe ===
* The Lusitanian Basin, located on the Southwestern European margin (offshore Portugal)
* The Pechora-Kolvin aulacogen in Russia
* The Pachelma aulacogen in Russia
* The Vyatka aulacogen in Russia
* The Sernovodsk-Abdulino aulacogen in Russia
* The Kaltasa aulacogen in Russia

=== North America ===
* The Canadian Grand Banks region, where the Hibernia Oil Field is located.
* The Stenian period Midcontinent Rift System that is still visible at the surface in the area of Lake Superior.
* The Mississippi embayment with the associated New Madrid Seismic Zone is an example of an ancient aulacogen that dates back to the breakup of the ancient continent, Rodinia. This ancient rift was the site of extreme earthquakes in the early 19th century in the region.
* The Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen is an Eocambrian rift system formed as a product of intracontinental rifting during the breakup of Pannotia. The Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen is located in southwestern Oklahoma and extends into northeastern Texas. The Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen is a failed rift zone that was active during the Early Cambrian during the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia and the opening of the Iapetus Ocean. Volcanism and later faulting associated with the aulacogen created the Wichita and Arbuckle mountains. The rocks that were formed during active rifting of the aulacogen are now exposed in the Wichita and Arbuckle mountains through the processes of uplift and erosion. The majority of these rocks are made up of basalts and other mafic and intermediate lavas, which are typically associated with rift zones. An estimated 250,000 km3 of lava was erupted during active rifting.

The Midwestern United States can attribute many of its features to failed rift zones. Rifting in this part of the continent took place in three stages: 1.1 billion years ago, 600 million years ago, and 200 million years ago. Both the aulacogen associated with the Mississippi embayment and the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen were formed between 500 and 600 million years ago.

<doc id="495989" wikidata="Q336220" url="?curid=495989" title="Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell">
<text>Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell, 5th Earl Russell, (15 April 1937 – 14 October 2004), was a British historian and politician. 

As an academic historian, he worked primarily on 17th-century English history, having extensively written and lectured on the parliamentary struggles of the English Civil Wars. In 1987 he succeeded his half-brother, John Russell, as Earl Russell, gaining a seat in the House of Lords.

==Early life==
From a long family line of distinguished Whigs and Liberals, Russell was the son of the philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell and his third wife Patricia Russell. He was also a great-grandson of the 19th-century Whig Prime Minister Lord John Russell. He was named after his father&#x27;s great friend Joseph Conrad, who was his godfather. He was educated at Eton College, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar, and Merton College, Oxford.

In 1960, he began his career as a lecturer in history at Bedford College, London.

==Academic career==
Russell became a historian working on the origins of the English Civil War and critical of older Whig and Marxist interpretations. His major works include &quot;Crisis of Parliaments: English history 1509–1660&quot; (1971), &quot;Origins of the English Civil War&quot; (edited, 1973), &quot;Parliaments and English politics, 1621–1629&quot; (1979), &quot;Unrevolutionary England, 1603–1642&quot; (1990), and &quot;Fall of the British monarchies, 1637–1642&quot; (1991). His work on early Stuart Parliaments was profoundly influenced by the work of Alan Everitt, who had argued that the English gentry were preoccupied with defending their positions in the localities rather than responding to the demands of the Crown. This no longer seems entirely plausible in the light of the work done by Richard Cust, Clive Holmes, Peter Lake and Christopher Thompson. Russell argued that the Civil War was much less a result of long term constitutional conflicts than had previously been thought, e.g. by Lawrence Stone and Christopher Hill, and that its origins are to be sought rather in the years immediately preceding the outbreak of war in 1642 and in the context of the problems of the multiple kingdoms of the British Isles, a hypothesis for which he was indebted to the pioneering study of Helmut Koenigsberger. This area is still being explored by historians like John Adamson and David Scott even if their detailed conclusions vary from those reached by Russell.

He was lecturer (and later reader) in history at Bedford College, University of London (now part of Royal Holloway), 1960–1979; professor of history at Yale University, US, 1979–1984; Astor Professor of British History at University College London, 1984–1990; and professor of British history at King&#x27;s College London from 1990 to his retirement in 2003.

==Political career==
As a young man, Russell&#x27;s political allegiance varied between the Labour Party and the then weak Liberal Party. He stood as the Labour candidate in Paddington South in the 1966 general election, but failed to win the seat from the Conservatives.

He succeeded to the title of Earl Russell on the death of his half-brother, John Russell, in 1987. He was the first parliamentarian to take his seat as a Liberal Democrat, shortly after the party was formed in 1988 from a merger of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party.

In 1999, all but 92 hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords. Lord Russell was elected at the top of his party&#x27;s list of hereditary peers to retain their seats, though he had consistently argued in favour of abolishing the Lords completely, and replacing it with an elected senate. He was admired in the House for his fund of historical anecdotes and dry sense of humour.

He was vice-president of the Liberal Democrat Youth and Students 1993–1994 and honorary president of the Liberal Democrat History Group 1998–2004. In 1988 he became Co-Chairman (later President) of the Council for Academic Autonomy, a group of university academics promoting the principles of academic freedom and the independence of universities from state and commercial control, and was instrumental in a crucial amendment to the Education Reform Act of 1988.

==Death==
Russell&#x27;s health worsened in the late 1990s and in 2004 he died of respiratory failure and the complications of emphysema, at Central Middlesex Hospital, a year after the death of his wife in 2003.

He was succeeded as Earl Russell by his elder son, Nicholas, who died in 2014 and was succeeded by his brother, John, who is also a politician.
==Published books==
*&quot;The Crisis of Parliaments: English History 1509–1660&quot; (1971)
*&quot;The Origins of the English Civil War&quot; (1973)
*&quot;Parliaments and English Politics, 1621–1629&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Unrevolutionary England:1603-1642&quot; (1990)
*&quot;The Causes of the English Civil War&quot; (1990)

*&quot;Academic Freedom&quot; (1993)
*&quot;An Intelligent Person&#x27;s Guide to Liberalism&quot; (1999)

In his book &quot;Academic Freedom&quot;, Russell examines the ideal and the limits of academic freedom, and the relations between the university and the state. He notes (p. 24) that his father&#x27;s career is a reminder that a free society is not a guarantee against losing an academic job for holding very unpopular opinions on non-academic subjects, as Bertrand Russell in fact did twice.

<doc id="495993" wikidata="Q828147" url="?curid=495993" title="Flag of Minnesota">
<text>The state flag of the U.S. state of Minnesota consists of a dark blue field representing the night sky and the state&#x27;s shape, an eight-pointed star representing the North Star, and a bright blue field representing the state&#x27;s abundant waters; the star is based on one prominently featured in the Minnesota State Capitol rotunda.

Since its inception in 1893, the flag of Minnesota has had four official designs. Of these, the first three included a seal depicting an American pioneer plowing land while a indigenous warrior rides past him on horseback. Initially created for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, the first flag featured a white obverse side with the state seal surrounded by moccasin flowers, while the reverse was solid blue. The design incorporated significant dates and the state motto, &quot;L&#x27;Étoile du Nord.&quot; The flag was modified with a major redesign in 1957 that standardized the color to royal blue on both sides, and simplified the central design for cost-effectiveness and durability.

In 1983, it underwent another redesign to update the state seal and lighten the blue field. This version of the flag retained the circular arrangement of stars and the state&#x27;s name but faced criticism over its complexity, similarity to other state flags, and its depiction of Minnesota&#x27;s history. These criticisms, particularly concerns about the depiction of Indigenous peoples and compliance with vexillological standards, led to calls for a redesign.

In 2022, the Minnesota Legislature established the State Emblems Redesign Commission to propose new designs for the state flag and seal. After extensive public input and deliberation, the commission selected the current flag design in December 2023. This new design was officially adopted on May 11, 2024. The flag has been praised by vexillologists and members of the public for its simplicity and distinctiveness. It has been criticized for a perceived similarity to the flag of Somalia and for its plainness, and it faced opposition from rural counties. This flag change occurred amid a series of other U.S. states changing their flags in the 21st century. 

==Design and use==
===Statute===
Minnesota statute 1.141 states that &quot;The design of the state flag as certified in the report of the State Emblems Redesign Commission... is adopted as the official state flag.&quot; The text of the law defers the details of the current flag&#x27;s appearance and design to the Commission&#x27;s report, which was dated January 1, 2024.

===Display and use===
The flag is to be flown over the Minnesota State Capitol from sunrise to sunset. When the flag is folded for storage, it should be folded in the same way as the national flag. 

Mutilating, defiling, or casting contempt upon the flag, attaching any design to the flag, or using the flag for advertising were misdemeanor offenses under State Statute 609.40, excepting flags on written or printed documents. However, following the 1990 Supreme Court ruling &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot;, enforcement of this law has been deemed unconstitutional.

==== Folding History ====
The flag of Minnesota did not have an official folding technique until 2010, when instructions for folding the 1983 State Flag for storage and display were codified in law. The folding for storage technique was done in the same manner as the U.S. flag, but the display technique was developed by members of the Minnesota National Guard, and was so detailed that it was confusing to some. The original code (which was repealed in 2024 with the adoption of the new state flag) read: 
===Geometry and colors===

The flag has an aspect ratio of 3:5. The shape of the flag&#x27;s dark blue region represents the shape of the state of Minnesota itself. The flag&#x27;s white star is a regular octagram, having the Schläfli symbol {8/3}; the floor of the rotunda in the Minnesota State Capitol has an identical octagram design. The State Emblems Redesign Commission&#x27;s report also contains an official construction sheet for the flag.

The flag uses three colors: dark blue, light blue, and white. Respectively, they represent the night sky, the waters of Minnesota, and Polaris, the North Star. The State Emblems Redesign Commission&#x27;s report provided technical specifications for the flag&#x27;s colors, alternately in the distinct Web color, CMYK and Pantone systems:

==History==

===1893 flag===
In 1891, the Minnesota legislature voted to sponsor an exhibition at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, and in response then governor William Rush Merriam appointed a board to supervise the preparations. The board comprised only men, but preparations specific to the showcasing of &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot; were passed off to an all-women group of volunteers known as the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Board. Minnesota had no official flag at that time, and the Auxiliary Board formed a six-person committee to design a flag. The committee held a contest to design the flag, and 200 entries were submitted. In February 1893, Amelia Hyde Center was announced the winner and received $15 () for her winning design. The Board then successfully petitioned the legislature to officially adopt the design as the state flag. 

Center&#x27;s design was white on one side and bright blue on the other. In the center of the white obverse was the state seal wreathed in white moccasin flowers overlaying a ring of blue. The seal depicted a farmer using a plow while a Native American figure on horseback rides to the west. A red ribbon across the seal bore a motto, (in French, &quot;The Star of the North&quot;). The years 1819 (establishment of Fort Snelling), 1858 (statehood), and 1893 (adoption of the flag) appeared in gold around the seal. &quot;Minnesota&quot; was written in gold under the seal, and 19 gold stars, representing the fact that Minnesota was the 19th state to be admitted after the original 13 states, were arranged in clusters to form the five points of a star. Historians have noted the design was likely influenced by various flags used by Minnesota&#x27;s infantry regiments during the Civil War, many of which consisted of a blue field emblazoned with either an American eagle or the state seal with a scroll.

The first flag was made of silk and was embroidered by Pauline and Thomane Fjelde, who won a gold medal for their creation. The flag was adopted on April 4, 1893.

While the reverse of the official design was a solid blue field, some examples of the flag, particularly those mass produced in the twentieth century, featured the seal design on that side as well.

===1957 flag===
The flag was redesigned in 1957 in advance of the 1958 state centennial. Most significantly, the field of both the obverse (formerly white) and the reverse (formerly bright blue) were made royal blue; the unification allowed flags to be produced from a single piece of cloth, reducing manufacturing costs and making the flag more durable in high winds. Separately, the white lady&#x27;s-slippers depicted in the original were replaced with the pink-and-white lady&#x27;s-slipper native to Minnesota.

The central design featured three concentric circular fields. The innermost field was filled with a simplified version of the state seal. Around the seal was a ring of blue ornamented with a wreath of pink-and-white lady&#x27;s-slippers and a red ribbon, upon which are written the years 1819 and 1893 (for the establishment of Fort Snelling and the first Minnesota flag, respectively). At the top of the blue ring the year 1858 is set in gold. Around the blue ring is a white ring upon which 19 stars form five radially arrayed groups. Each group contained four stars except for the top-center group, which had two stars of standard size and one larger than the rest, representing the North Star. The number 19 was chosen to symbolize the fact that Minnesota was the 19th state to enter the Union after the original 13. The larger star at the top symbolized the North Star. Between the bottom two groups, the state&#x27;s name was set in red. Both the blue ring and the white ring were bordered with gold.

In 1957, another flag, designed by former adjutant General of the Minnesota National Guard Joseph Nelson, was proposed and endorsed by Rep. John Tracy Anderson. It depicts 19 stars forming the shape of a larger star, inside a vertical triband of red on the left, white in the center, and blue on the right. 

===1983 flag===
In 1983, the seal was redrawn, and the color field was lightened from a royal blue to a medium blue; the shade could vary in different flag makers&#x27; designs.
The flag was rectangular and featured a design emblazoned in the center of a field of blue. According to statute, the flag was bordered with gold and finished with gold fringe, but this was rarely used and more common on indoor flags.

Several changes were also made to the seal in this year. The Indigenous figure was turned to face farther south, more towards the farmer. Also, the Mississippi River and St. Anthony Falls were added to the seal to note the importance of these resources in transportation, industry, and the settling of the state. Beyond the falls on the seal, the state added three pine trees representing the state tree (the Norway pine) and the three pine regions of the state: the St. Croix, Mississippi, and Lake Superior. Around the seal, the flag still showed three notable years in Minnesota history (1819, 1858, and 1893), the pink-and-white lady&#x27;s slipper, and 19 stars placed the same as in 1957.

====Response to the 1983 flag====
The 1983 revision of the flag came under growing criticism. Longstanding frustration with its illegibility, similarity to other state flags, and failure to comply with vexillological best practices. This was joined by concerns that the image depicted in the seal offered a negationist view of Minnesota&#x27;s settlement by Europeans that concealed the violence committed against Indigenous peoples.

===Proposed North Star Flag===
The North Star Flag design was created in 1988 by Lee Herold and Reverend William Becker. The flag has the colors of green, representing forests, white, representing winter, and blue, representing water. A yellow star in the top left represents the North Star and the state&#x27;s motto, .

Herold had opposed the official state flag since its creation when he was in high school. He presented the proposal to state legislators in 1989, supported by Republican representative Gil Gutknecht. However, the North Star Flag design was never officially adopted by the state. In 1995, he left his career as an accountant and opened a flag store, Herold Flags, in Rochester, Minnesota.

===2024 flag===

====2023 Redesign Commission====
On March 22, 2022, two Democratic-Farmer-Labor members of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Mike Freiberg and Peter Fischer, introduced a bill to redesign the state&#x27;s flag and seal. Fischer began supporting a flag redesign in 2017 after a group of high school students raised the issue to him. The law outlines specific guidelines for the redesign, stipulating that the new designs &quot;must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota&#x27;s shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities&quot; and that symbols representing only a single community or person are prohibited. It was proposed as part of a state budget bill and was opposed by Republican representatives, who viewed it as a low priority.

In May 2023, as a part of the annual state budget, the Minnesota Legislature established the State Emblems Redesign Commission, tasked with proposing new designs for Minnesota&#x27;s flag and seal. The legislation dictates that, barring any contrary legislation, the chosen flag design will be adopted as the state flag on May 11, 2024. The committee has 13 members, including representatives of the Indian Affairs Council, the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage, the Minnesota Council on Latino Affairs, and the Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans, along with three members of the general public appointed by Governor Tim Walz. The committee held its first meeting on September 5.

In October 2023, the committee received public input to suggest flag designs. A total of 2,123 flag and 398 seal submissions were received. Common themes included the state bird (the loon), lakes and rivers, and the North Star. More various entries included a photograph of a dog, a photograph of a wooden floor, national flags and imitations of them such as those of the Soviet Union, psychedelic monkey drawings, and a design depicting a loon shooting lasers from its eyes similar to the Laser Kiwi flag proposed during the 2015–2016 New Zealand flag referendums. Several entries were just unchanged images of the existing flag of Minnesota.

On November 21, 2023, the commission met in the Minnesota Senate Building to review the selections. Despite having planned to select five flag designs, the group chose six finalists. All the finalists featured a star motif, the colors blue and white; none featured the loon, which the committee believed represented only part of Minnesota. Herold attended the hearing, but his North Star Flag design was not a finalist. On December 13, the number of flags was narrowed to three, F2100, F944, and F1953.

At the time of the redesign, multiple American states were considering changing their flags. Utah had replaced its flag to be more distinctive the prior year, and Mississippi had replaced its flag in 2021.

====Final design====

On December 15, 2023, the committee decided that the final flag would be a variant of F1953, eliminating F2100 and F944. By December 19, 2023, after much deliberation on specific design aspects, the commission had settled on five variations of F1953 to be the subject of the final vote.A2 was selected by the commission as the finalized design on December 19, 2023, with 11 out of 12 votes (B2 having received 1 vote). Thus, the new state flag consisted of an all light-blue banner with a simplified shape of Minnesota on the hoist in dark blue and a simplified eight-pointed star in the center of the shape. According to the commission, the eight-pointed star is a design used by indigenous and immigrant cultures, forms the shape of the letter M, and matches a design on the floor of the Capitol&#x27;s rotunda that points north.

The flag officially became the new state flag on May 11, 2024.

====Response to the 2024 flag====
Initial responses to the final design included both praise and criticism for its simplicity, as well as praise for its symbolism. Ted Kaye of the North American Vexillological Association called the new design &quot;outstanding&quot; and said that it has a place in the top 10 flags of the U.S. A local news station poll found that just 23% of Minnesota voters supported switching to the new flag, while 21% supported replacing the flag with a different design and 49% wished to keep the existing flag. 

Democratic leaders praised the community input and the removal of the old flag&#x27;s offensive imagery as successes. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, who did not fly the former flag in protest of its depictions of Indigenous people, celebrated it as an &quot;upgrade&quot; that allows it to represent every Minnesotan.

Right-wing critics claimed the flag was similar to the flag of Somalia or of the Somali region of Puntland. Officials said the resemblance was a coincidence, citing the Minnesota-specific meaning behind the colors and symbolism. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon further countered these claims, noting similarities in Iowa&#x27;s flag to France and Texas&#x27;s flag to Chile.

Several rural counties, including Crow Wing, Houston, McLeod, Nobles, Becker, Mower, and Brown, passed resolutions opposing the flag in general, or the process by which the new flag design was chosen. In early March 2024, Republican state legislators announced plans to introduce a series of bills that would put the flag design to a public vote, but the bills did not come up for a vote during the 2024 legislative session.

<text>The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada () is a regulatory college which acts as a national, nonprofit organization established in 1929 by a special Act of Parliament to oversee the medical education of specialists in Canada.

The Royal College is an association of physicians concerned with setting national standards for medical education and continuing professional development in Canada for 80 medical specialties. As such, the Royal College is neither a licensing nor a disciplinary body. Instead, it is a regulatory authority that helps ensure that the training and evaluation of medical and surgical specialists and two special programs maintain certain standards of quality.

All specialists in Canada, with the exception of family physicians, must be certified by the Royal College before they obtain a provincial or territorial licence to practice. The only exception is in the province of Quebec, where the Royal College shares the responsibility for certifying physicians with the Collège des médecins du Québec.

To become certified, a physician must pass Royal College examinations. Access to these examinations is usually gained by completing a Royal College-accredited residency program at a Canadian university. Access is also available for medical residents who complete a Royal College-recognized residency program in the United States. Certain international training programs approved by the Royal College provide limited access to Royal College examinations.

Since its founding, the Royal College has been granted the patronage of the Canadian monarch, currently Charles III.

==History==

In June 1929, a special Act of Parliament established the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada to oversee postgraduate medical education in Canada. At first, the Royal College offered just two specialty qualifications: Fellowship in general medicine and Fellowship in general surgery. By 2014, the Royal College had expanded its activities to recognize 80 disciplines, granting Fellowships in 30 specialties, 35 subspecialties, two special programs and 13 Areas of Focused Competence (AFC-diplomas).

From the 1940s to the 1970s, the Royal College conducted examinations at two levels in most specialties: Fellowship, the higher qualification, or Certification, a lesser designation. In 1972, the Royal College abolished this dual standard and began to offer a single certification that continues today: Fellowship.

In 1968, the Royal College established the McLaughlin Examination and Research Centre at the University of Alberta and Laval University to research and develop modern techniques for evaluating specialist physicians. In 1987, the Royal College merged the centre into a bilingual McLaughlin Centre based in Ottawa, Ontario.

Since the mid-1980s, the Royal College has broadened its activities to study areas of special interest in Canadian healthcare, including injury prevention and patient safety. In 2005, the Royal College set a specific goal to improve the health of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.

Today, the headquarters for the Royal College is located at 774 Echo Drive in Ottawa, Ontario. The building, constructed in 1921, was formerly the monastery of the Sisters Adorers of the Precious Blood.

==Objectives==
The work of the Royal College centres around its prime objective — to ensure the highest possible standards of specialist training and specialist care. The Royal College undertakes work under the following six areas:
* Prescribes the requirements for specialty education in 80 areas of medical, surgical and laboratory medicine plus two special programs,
* Accredits specialty residency programs,
* Assesses the acceptability of residents&#x27; education,
* Conducts certifying examinations,
* Administers the Maintenance of Certification Program, a mandatory continuing professional development program for all members, and
* Sets standards for professional and ethical conduct among its members.

==Membership==
In 2014, the Royal College had more than 44,000 members worldwide, including Fellows, residents, and honorary, retired, and emeritus members. 

Fellows of the Royal College use the designation FRCPC (Fellow of The Royal College of Physicians of Canada) or FRCSC (Fellow of The Royal College of Surgeons of Canada) depending on their qualifications. Since 1997, the Royal College has also offered category of resident membership called &quot;resident affiliate” in an attempt to engage residents at an early stage of their careers. Those who choose to join the Royal College receive complimentary membership during the time they are registered in a Royal College-accredited residency program. Approximately 2,000 members are designated as resident members.

The Royal College website includes a directory of all current and retired Fellows.

==International medical graduates==
An international medical graduate is someone who has completed his or her medical training outside of Canada or the United States and whose medical training is recognized by the World Health Organization. There are 29 international jurisdictions that the Royal College has assessed and deemed as having met Royal College criteria. For the graduates of these particular jurisdictions, the College assesses their training to determine the extent to which they have successfully met and completed the Royal College training requirements. When the training is deemed comparable and acceptable, the IMGs are ruled eligible to take the Royal College certification examination. Success at the certification examination will lead to Royal College certification. The Royal College accepts training from some international jurisdictions that have similar residency training accreditation systems to Canada.

==Work with other medical organizations==
The Royal College maintains close working relations with the 17 Canadian university medical schools, numerous national professional associations, voluntary health organizations and governmental agencies where it has a respected and influential voice in discussions affecting medical education, medical research and the delivery of high-quality health care to Canadians. In some cases, the Royal College accredits training programs conjointly with other professional organizations. In addition, Royal College training programs are sometimes cited as requirements for specific levels of remuneration for resident physicians.

The Royal College co-sponsored the 10th Annual International Conference on Medical Regulation, which took place at the Ottawa Convention Centre in Ontario, Canada, in October 2012.

==Continuing professional development==
The Royal College develops and administers a continuing professional development program called Maintenance of Certification (MOC) that requires Fellows to engage in certain activities to maintain their competence throughout their careers. Introduced in 2000, MOC is a core service delivered by the Royal College and is also open to health care professionals who are not Fellows and not physicians. The program awards credits to participants who engage in learning activities that enhance their practice. Elements of the MOC Program are recognized by medical associations in other countries, including the American Medical Association (which allows its members to convert certain MOC credits to AMA PRA Category 1 credits) and the American College of Physicians.

==CanMEDS==
In 1996, the Royal College adopted CanMEDS, a medical education framework it developed that emphasizes the essential competencies of a physician. Revised in 2005, the CanMEDS competencies have now been integrated into the Royal College&#x27;s accreditation standards, objectives of training, final in-training evaluations, exam blueprints, and the Maintenance of Certification program. All 17 medical schools in Canada also use the framework to assess the abilities of their residents. The Royal College is now updating the framework to further align it with a competency-based approach to medical education. The revised CanMEDS framework launched in 2015.

Since its creation, CanMEDS has been adopted and adapted around the world. CanMEDS is an educational framework identifying and describing seven roles that lead to optimal health and health care outcomes: medical expert (central role), communicator, collaborator, manager, health advocate, scholar and professional. The overarching goal of CanMEDS is to improve patient care.

==Competency-based medical education==
Competency-based medical education, or CBME, is an outcomes-based approach to the design, implementation, assessment and evaluation of a medical education program using an organizing framework of competencies. In 2012, the Royal College began a multi-year plan to design, develop, implement and sustain a program of CBME. Under CBME, medical education (for residents in training and specialist physicians who pursue lifelong learning) progresses not according to how much time a resident or certified physician has practised certain skills, as has been the case in the past in Canada. Instead, it progresses under a system in which residents and certified physicians must achieve and demonstrate core competency levels called &quot;milestones” before they move on, receive credit or are otherwise recognized by the system.

In 2013, the Royal College announced Competence by Design, the name that the organization has given to its reorientation toward a CBME model of learning and assessment (The CanMEDS Framework, first introduced in 1997, sets out the competencies and principles considered essential for Canadian physicians). As of 2014, the Royal College&#x27;s move toward CBME and Competence by Design was received with mixed reactions from Royal College Fellows.

==Health and educational policy work==
The Royal College engages regularly in work to affect health policy, especially in the areas of physician employment and resident duty hours.

Physician employment: In 2013, the Royal College released the results of a Canada-wide study that showed an increasing number of specialists cannot find jobs relevant to their skills and training.

Resident Duty Hours: In 2013 the National Steering Committee on Resident Duty Hours, hosted by the Royal College with funding from Health Canada, released a report called Fatigue, Risk and Excellence: Toward a Pan-Canadian consensus on resident duty hours. The steering committee&#x27;s research process and subsequent report were widely received as robust and a major step forward in the controversial debate about duty hours.

==Awards and grants==
The Royal College&#x27;s awards and grants program distributes $1 million a year in awards, grants, fellowships and visiting professorships. Awards recognize the importance and potential impact of specialist physicians&#x27; work and categories include original research, personal achievements and visiting professorships. Grants support professional development and research, with categories covering continuing professional development grants, travelling fellowships and medical education grants.

Among the more notable Royal College awards is the Teasdale-Corti Humanitarian Award which recognizes physicians and surgeons who, while providing health care or emergency medical services, go beyond the accepted norms of routine practice, which may include exposure to personal risk. The award is named in honour of Dr. Lucille Teasdale and Dr. Piero Corti, a physician couple who devoted their professional careers to healing, teaching, and improving the condition of the population residing in the poverty stricken Gulu region of Uganda. Past recipients have worked throughout the world, including in Africa, Europe and South America.

The International Medical Educator of the Year Award is given to an international medical educator who has demonstrated lasting impact and a commitment to enhancing ethics and humanism in residency education. In 2019, the prize was awarded to Dr. Melchor Sánchez Mendiola, MD, MHPE, PhD, from National Autonomous University of Mexico.

<text>The flag of Mississippi consists of a white magnolia blossom surrounded by 21 stars and the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; written below, all put over a blue Canadian pale with two vertical gold borders on a red field. The topmost star is composed of a pattern of five diamonds, an Indigenous symbol; the other 20 stars are white, as Mississippi was the 20th state to join the Union. The flag was adopted on January 11, 2021.

Mississippi has had three official state flags in its history. The first flag, known as the &quot;Magnolia Flag&quot;, was adopted in 1861 and consisted of a &quot;Flag of white ground, a magnolia tree in the , a blue field in the upper left hand corner with a white star in the , ... with a red border and a red fringe at the extremity of the Flag&quot;. The Magnolia Flag was declared to be &quot;null and void&quot; by a state constitutional convention in 1865 and the state was left without an official flag until the second one was adopted in 1894.

The second flag, designed by Edward N. Scudder and adopted in 1894, consisted of a triband of three equal horizontal stripes of blue, white, and red, with a canton of the Confederate battle flag. The thirteen stars on the state flag officially represented &quot;the number of the original states of the Union&quot;, although they are sometimes thought to be for the states that seceded from the Union plus Missouri and Kentucky, which had both Confederate and Union governing bodies. From 1894 to 1956, and again from 2003 to 2020, this was the only state flag to incorporate the Confederate battle flag into its design, Georgia being the other from 1956 to 2003. In response to the George Floyd protests in 2020, state legislators proposed new flag designs omitting the Confederate flag.

On June 27, 2020, Governor Tate Reeves stated that if the Mississippi Legislature passed a bill that weekend addressing the flag issue, he would sign it into law. Subsequently, on June 28, 2020, the Legislature passed a bill to repeal the sections of the Mississippi State Code which made provisions for a state flag, mandate the Mississippi Department of Archives and History develop a plan for the removal of the former flag from public buildings within 15 days of the bill&#x27;s effective date, and establish a commission to design a replacement that would exclude the Confederate battle flag and include the U.S. national motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot;. Reeves then signed it into law on June 30, 2020.

The third flag was designed by Rocky Vaughan, Sue Anna Joe, Kara Giles, Dominique Pugh, and Micah Whitson. It was chosen by the commission to Redesign the Mississippi State Flag, which was established by the same June 2020 Mississippi House bill which retired the second flag. The commission received thousands of submissions, and narrowed them down to a single choice, which was submitted for public vote as a ballot measure on November 3, 2020. Voters approved the new design in a two-choice vote but the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the new proposed design was never approved by voters directly. It is one of three U.S. state flags to feature the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; (the U.S. national motto), with the other two being those of Florida and Georgia.

==History==

===First flag (1861–1865)===

Before 1861, Mississippi lacked a flag. When the State Convention at the Capitol in Jackson declared its secession from the United States (&quot;the Union&quot;) on January 9, 1861, near the start of the American Civil War, spectators in the balcony handed a Bonnie Blue flag down to the state convention delegates on the convention floor, and one was raised over the state capitol building in Jackson as a sign of independence. Later that night, residents of Jackson paraded through the streets under the banner. Harry McCarthy, an Irish singer and playwright who observed the street parade, was inspired to write the patriotic song &quot;The Bonnie Blue Flag.&quot;

The first flag was known as the &quot;Magnolia flag.&quot; It was the official state flag from March 30, 1861, until August 22, 1865. On January 26, 1861, the delegates to the state convention approved the report of a special committee that had been appointed to design a coat of arms and &quot;a suitable flag.&quot; The flag recommended by the committee was &quot;A Flag of white ground, a magnolia tree in the center, a blue field in the upper left hand corner with a white star in the center, the Flag to be finished with a red border and a red fringe at the extremity of the Flag.&quot; Due to time constraints and the pressure to raise &quot;means for the defense of the state,&quot; the delegates neglected to adopt the flag officially in January but did so when they reassembled in March 1861. The Magnolia Flag was not widely used during the war, as the various Confederate flags were displayed more frequently. Following the war&#x27;s end, a state constitutional convention nullified many of the ordinances and resolutions passed by the State Convention of 1861. Among those nullified was the ordinance of March 1861 &quot;to provide a Coat of Arms and Flag for the State of Mississippi.&quot;

=== Second flag (1894–2020)===

On February 7, 1894, the Legislature replaced the Civil War era Magnolia Flag with a new one designed by Edward N. Scudder that incorporated the Confederate battle flag in its canton. This second state flag consisted of three equal horizontal triband of blue, white, and red, with the canton of the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia. The 13 stars on the state flag officially represented &quot;the number of the original states of the Union&quot;; though they are sometimes thought to have been for states that seceded from the Union, plus Missouri and Kentucky which had Union and Confederate governments.

The Mississippi Code of 1972, in Title 3, Chapter 3, described the flag as follows:

In 1996, governor Daniel Fordice sent a memorandum to every manufacturer that produced a Mississippi flag, ordering for the stars in the canton to face upward, and for fimbriation to be added around the canton. The fimbriation was to be the same width as the white outline on the cross of the canton. Before 1996, the flag was often produced with unaligned stars and no fimbriation.

In 1906, Mississippi adopted a revised legal code that repealed all general laws that were not reenacted by the legislature or brought forward in the new code. The legislature inadvertently omitted mention of the 1894 flag, leaving the state with no official state flag from 1906 to 2001. In 2000, the Supreme Court of Mississippi confirmed that the state legislature had in 1906 repealed the 1894 adoption of the state flag; the flag used since then and considered official had actually only been customary or traditional.

===Flag Change Proposals===
====Early proposals to change the 1894 flag====
=====2001 referendum=====


In January 2001, Governor Ronnie Musgrove appointed an independent commission which developed a new proposed flag design. On April 17, 2001, a legally binding state referendum to change the flag was put before Mississippi voters by the legislature on recommendation of this commission.

The referendum, which asked voters if the new design prepared by the independent commission should be adopted, was defeated in a vote of 64% (488,630 votes) to 36% (267,812), and the 1894 state flag was retained. The proposed flag would have replaced the Confederate rebel battle flag with a blue square canton with 20 white stars in a circular row. The outer ring of 13 stars would represent the original Thirteen Colonies, the middle ring of six stars would represent the six nations that have had sovereignty over Mississippi Territory (various Native American nations as a collective nation, French Empire, Spanish Empire, British Empire, the Confederate States, and the United States) as well as the six states that precede Mississippi&#x27;s admission (Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, and Indiana), and the inner and slightly larger star would represent Mississippi itself. The 20 stars would also represent Mississippi&#x27;s status as the 20th U.S. state and member of the United States of America.

When Georgia adopted a new state flag in 2003, the Mississippi flag remained the only U.S. state flag to include the Confederate battle flag&#x27;s saltire. In 2001 a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Mississippi&#x27;s flag 22nd in design quality of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territorial flags ranked.

=====2015 replacement efforts=====
In the wake of the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting, in which nine black parishioners of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church were killed by Confederacy admirer and white supremacist Dylann Roof, there were renewed calls for Southern states to cease using the Confederate battle flag in official capacities. This extended to increased criticism of Mississippi&#x27;s state flag. All eight public universities in Mississippi, along with &quot;several cities and counties&quot;, including Biloxi, later refused to fly the state flag until the emblem was removed. The flag was excluded from state-flag displays in New Jersey, Oregon, and Philadelphia that included the flags of the other 49 states.

2015 proposal for a new flagOn September 10, 2015, Steve Earle released the single &quot;Mississippi It&#x27;s Time&quot; with all proceeds going towards the civil rights organization, Southern Poverty Law Center. The song was produced by Earle and recorded with his longtime backup band, the Dukes, in the summer of 2015 in the aftermath of the massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015. The song advocates for removal of the Confederate flag from state grounds and tackles historical themes of slavery, racism, patriotism, and progress since the Civil War.

Over 20 flag-related bills, some calling for another statewide referendum, were introduced in the legislature in 2015 and 2016, but none made it out of committee. A 2016 federal lawsuit alleging that the flag is tantamount to &quot;state-sanctioned hate speech&quot; was dismissed by both a district court and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

=====Hospitality and Bicentennial flags=====

An alternative was devised in 2014 by artist Laurin Stennis, granddaughter of former U.S. senator John C. Stennis. Her proposal was originally dubbed the &quot;Declare Mississippi flag&quot; but was popularly called the &quot;Stennis flag&quot; and later renamed the &quot;Hospitality flag&quot;. In June 2020, Stennis stepped back from the effort to change the 1894 flag, citing potential harm associated with her last name, which she shares with her grandfather who was a segregationist for much of his career. In August 2020, the copyrighted design was withdrawn from being an option for a new flag because it did not include the legislature-mandated &quot;In God We Trust&quot; slogan.

The flag consists of a single blue star on a white field, an inversion of the white star on a blue field of the Bonnie Blue flag. It is encircled by 19 smaller stars representing each state in the Union when Mississippi joined, as well as symbolizing &quot;unity and continuity&quot; drawing inspiration from the artifacts of the indigenous peoples of the region. The central white field represents &quot;faith and possibility&quot;, and is flanked on each side by vertical red bars, representing &quot;the blood spilled by Mississippians, whether civilian or military, who have honorably given their lives in pursuit of liberty and justice for all&quot;. In an interview, Stennis said the red bars also stand for &quot;Mississippians&#x27; &#x27;passionate differences&#x27; on the flag issue&quot;.

Since its inception, numerous bills were brought before the legislature to have the Stennis flag declared the new state flag, but none of them passed. On April 17, 2019, Mississippi governor Phil Bryant signed a new specialty license plates bill. One of the new specialty plates included the Stennis flag along with the phrase &quot;History + Hope + Hospitality&quot;. This was the first time that the Stennis flag&#x27;s design received some form of state sanction by being used in an official capacity.

A flag was created by the Mississippi Economic Council to celebrate the state&#x27;s bicentennial in 2017. This flag consisted of a blue, white and red tricolor with the state seal centered on the white stripe. The flag also had the words &quot;Established 1817&quot; and &quot;Bicentennial 2017&quot; written on the white stripe on either side of the seal. This flag, without the wording, has been used as an alternative state flag and has been suggested as a possible replacement for it.

In late June 2020, former Governor Phil Bryant suggested using the bicentennial flag as a future state flag. Following the retirement of the previous state flag on June 30, 2020, this banner was used in some instances as a &quot;de facto&quot; placeholder. African American Mississippians from 2017 to 2020 frequently used the bicentennial flag along with the 2001 proposed flag.

===Third flag (2020–present)===
On June 9, 2020, lawmakers gathered votes and started drafting legislation to change the state flag. This was the first substantial action to change the state flag since the 2001 referendum. The proposed legislation would adopt Laurin Stennis&#x27;s design as the new flag of Mississippi. With the support of Republican Speaker of the House, Philip Gunn, lawmakers began to court Republican state house members to vote for the resolution.

Gunn ensured that he would get the resolution passed through a House committee if verbal support from 30 Republicans was secured to go along with the 45 Democratic members of the House. An update on June 10 showed that lawmakers believed that they had secured at least 20 Republicans who were in favor of voting for the resolution to change the flag, while 20 more were on the fence. The lawmakers&#x27; goal was to secure at least 40 Republicans needed to suspend rules to allow a bill to be considered in the session. On June 11, Senate Democrats filed a resolution to change the state flag.

On June 18, 2020, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, Greg Sankey, announced the SEC would consider banning championship events in Mississippi until the flag was changed. The SEC is the athletic conference for the two largest universities in Mississippi, Ole Miss and Mississippi State. The announcement by the conference was followed by support of changing the flag from Chancellor Glenn Boyce of the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) and President Mark E. Keenum of Mississippi State University. The athletic directors of the universities, Keith Carter (Ole Miss) and John Cohen (Mississippi State), also supported changing the flag, along with various coaches from the universities.On June 19, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) banned all post-season play from occurring in Mississippi until the flag was changed. The NCAA had previously banned predetermined events such as football bowl games and men&#x27;s basketball tournament games in 2001 from occurring in the state. The new rule would have also banned merit-based championship sites, such as baseball regionals, softball regionals, women&#x27;s basketball tournament games and tennis tournament games. Ole Miss hosted both baseball and softball regionals in 2019. Mississippi State hosted a baseball regional, men&#x27;s tennis tournament games and women&#x27;s basketball tournament games in 2019.

Also on June 19, the leaders of the eight public universities in Mississippi (Alcorn State University, Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, Mississippi University for Women, Mississippi Valley State University, University of Mississippi and University of Southern Mississippi) issued a joint statement calling for a new state flag. On June 22, Conference USA banned all postseason play in Mississippi until the removal of the Confederate emblem from the state flag. Conference USA was home to the state&#x27;s third largest university, Southern Miss, until moving to the Sun Belt Conference in 2023, and hosted its annual baseball tournament in Mississippi for eight times in nine years from 2011-19. On June 23, presidents of the fifteen community colleges in Mississippi issued a joint statement showing their support for a new flag.

The Mississippi Baptist Convention condemned the former state flag on June 23, 2020. In a statement, Baptist leaders said: &quot;The racial overtones of the flag&#x27;s appearance make this discussion a moral issue. Since the principal teachings of Scripture are opposed to racism, a stand against such is a matter of biblical morality.&quot; Walmart announced that it would cease displaying the state flag at its 85 Mississippi store locations on June 23, 2020. The retailer normally displays the applicable state flag alongside the U.S. national flag at its locations in the U.S.

====2020 Legislative action ====
On June 24, 2020, Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann announced his support for a new flag. Hosemann was joined by Attorney General Lynn Fitch, State Auditor Shad White, Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson and Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney. On June 27, 2020, the Mississippi Legislature passed a resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 79, that suspended rules in the legislative chambers in order to debate and vote on a bill to remove and replace the state flag. The motion passed the House on an 85–34 vote and the Senate on a 36–14 vote.

At that time, there was no consensus on the method of changing the flag, whether it be retiring the current flag or immediately adopting another. A proposal floated by several members of the Legislature was to create a new Mississippi flag. This flag, with a yet-to-be-determined design that did not include any Confederate images, would be used alongside the current flag. This plan was soundly rejected by Governor Tate Reeves who said it would not &quot;satisfy either side of this debate&quot; and compared it to the separate but equal doctrine.

On June 28, 2020, the Legislature passed a bill, House Bill 1796, that would relinquish the state flag, remove the state flag from public buildings within 15 days of the bill&#x27;s effective date, and constitute a nine-member commission to design a new flag that would be put to voters in a referendum to be held in November 2020. The bill required that the Confederate battle flag not be included on the proposed design, and the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; be included, as Georgia did when it removed the Confederate emblem from its state flag in 2003. In the House, the bill was passed by 91 in favor and 23 against. In the Senate, the bill was passed with 37 in favor and 14 against.

Earlier that weekend, Governor Reeves had stated that he would sign any flag bill passed that weekend by the Legislature into law. Subsequently, after the Legislature passed the bill, a spokesperson for the governor indicated that he would sign, and Reeves did so on June 30, 2020. As the legislation repealed the sections of the Mississippi State Code which made provisions for a state flag, namely Section 3-3-16, Mississippi ceased once again to have an official state flag at this point.

====2020 referendum====
Under the terms of House Bill 1796 
(approved by the governor on June 30, 2020), a body known as the commission to Redesign the Mississippi State Flag would be constituted to suggest a design for a new state flag no later than September 14, 2020. The bill instructed the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to develop a plan for the removal of the 1894 flag from public buildings across the state and provide administrative support for the commission. The act stipulated that any design proposed by the commission must include the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and must not contain the Confederate battle flag. The proposed design would then be subject to a referendum to be held concurrently with the general election on November 3, 2020.

The Mississippi Department of Archives and History invited the public to submit designs for a new state flag on July 13. In accordance with the rules imposed by House Bill 1796, designs would only be accepted if they contained the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and not include the Confederate battle flag. The commission also added that suggestions would need to be unique and adhere to principles of the North American Vexillological Association: that the design should use only two or three basic colors, be simple enough for a child to draw, and have meaningful symbolism.

More than 2000 submissions meeting the legislative criteria were received and displayed on the Mississippi Department of Archives and History website. Each of the 9 commission members picked 25 flags, narrowing the list down to 147. While a modified Hospitality flag did not proceed beyond the first round, a similar-looking &quot;Mosquito flag&quot; briefly did, apparently due to a commissioner&#x27;s typographical error. At an August 14 meeting, the commission announced that they had selected nine finalists. These finalists, depicting various elements including a representation of the Mississippi River, magnolias, and stars composed of diamonds significant to the Choctaw nation, had either red, white, and blue or green and white color schemes. The commission announced that they would narrow these designs down to five finalists at its next meeting on August 18. Five finalists were published on August 18, and this was reduced to two flags on August 25.

The final two flags were the &quot;Great River Flag&quot; designed by Micah Whitson and &quot;The New Magnolia&quot; designed by Rocky Vaughan, Sue Anna Joe, Kara Giles and Dominique Pugh. On September 2, the commission voted 8–1 to put the New Magnolia flag on the November ballot. Slight modifications were made to the original design, including making the text bolder and the red and gold bars thicker. The flag is officially referred to as the &quot;In God We Trust Flag&quot;. Rocky Vaughan is credited with designing the flag&#x27;s overall layout, with design support provided by Sue Anna Joe, Kara Giles and Dominique Pugh (who created the magnolia illustration featured in the center). Micah Whitson was also given credit for the appearance of the Native American star. The flag was approved by 73% of the votes cast in a referendum on November 3, 2020. The flag was passed by the Mississippi State House of Representatives on January 5, 2021, and was passed by the State Senate on January 6, 2021. It officially became the state flag after being signed by the state&#x27;s Governor on January 11, 2021.

According to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History,

====After the 2020 referendum====
Let Mississippi Vote is a group that is attempting another referendum on a choice of four flag designs: the Magnolia flag that was adopted in the November 2020 referendum, the flag that it replaced, the Stennis version, and the Bicentennial flag. Their stated aim is to give Mississippians a choice instead of voting on only one flag. The group reached their goal of 5000 volunteers and has sent wording for their referendum to the Mississippi Attorney General&#x27;s Office for approval. They needed 106,190 valid signatures from Mississippi residents for the initiative to be placed on a ballot no earlier than 2023.

The number of valid signatures was specified by a 1992 amendment to the Mississippi Constitution when the state had five congressional districts, and written as 12% of the total votes cast for governor in the election preceding the filing of the ballot initiative, with no more than 20% of those signatures coming from a single congressional district. However, as a result of redistricting after the 2000 U.S. census, Mississippi was reduced to four congressional districts. In an unrelated case involving a medical marijuana initiative that had been certified for the ballot and then approved by Mississippi voters in 2020, the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned the initiative and said that the ballot requirements &quot;cannot work in a world where Mississippi has fewer than five representatives in Congress&quot;. Although Let Mississippi Vote continues to collect signatures, the court decision has so far not yet been addressed by the legislature, for example by further amending the Mississippi Constitution.

<text>Alexei Yurievich Nemov (; born 28 May 1976) is a Russian retired artistic gymnast. During his career, he won five world championships, three European championships and twelve Olympic medals.

==Early life==
Born in Barashevo, Mordovia, Alexei Nemov grew up in Tolyatti on the Volga River. His father left him and his mother when Nemov was just a baby, and Nemov has never seen him since. Alexei started gymnastics at age five.

==Gymnastics career==
Nemov made his debut at the 1993 World Championships at the age of sixteen, placing fifth in the floor event. The following year, he stamped himself as a true all-around contender, winning his qualifying session at the Worlds. He later faltered and dropped to twelfth overall. He won his first major all-around title at the Goodwill Games in Saint-Petersburg, beating his second-place teammate and World Silver Medalist Aleksei Voropaev by over one point. Nemov&#x27;s style of gymnastics was considered very well-rounded; he had complex acrobatics, a unique style, and elegance when he performed.

Despite his initial promising success internationally, by 1995 Nemov had gained a reputation for having inconsistent performances. In the all-around at the 1995 European Cup, Nemov, then 19, was the leader after five events and had put up the high score on three events. When he came to high bar, he only needed an 8.75 to win the title. He missed his two major release moves and crashed into the bar on another, botched a required element, and stopped in the middle of his routine. He scored a 7.35 and dropped to ninth overall.

A few months later, Nemov competed in the World Championships in Sabae, Japan. The Russian team had an extremely poor showing during the qualifying round, finishing in 11th place, with Nemov in 96th position all-around. The team rebounded in the finals to finish 4th overall (still a disappointment since it marked the first time in decades that the Russians failed to medal in the team competition), while Nemov put up the highest optional score of all the competitors.

At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Nemov seemed poised to win the gold. Nemov won six medals (two gold, one silver, and three bronze). He performed solidly in the all-around, battling World Champion Li Xiaoshuang every step of the way. Nemov ruined his chances for gold, however, when he botched his middle tumbling run in the final event, finishing second by a narrow margin.

While many questioned Nemov&#x27;s dedication and fitness level, he continued to excel. Several shoulder injuries, as well as his marriage and the birth of his first son, along with perceived inconsistencies in character were cited as evidence of weak gymnastics prior to the 2000 Sydney Olympics. This led to increased concerns about Aleksei&#x27;s lack of a major title. However, as a high-performance athlete, Nemov went into the 2000 Olympics in the best shape of his life – having never seen his newborn son (born in September 2000), and was able to take home to his son what he called a golden rattle, in reality an all-around gold medal. Except for still rings, he had won at least one Olympic medal in every other discipline of men&#x27;s gymnastics by the end of the Sydney games.

===2004 Olympics controversy and rule change===
Although injury took its toll, Nemov competed through to the 2004 Athens Olympics, mainly as an anchor for the fledgling Russian team. Though unable to defend his all-around title, Nemov&#x27;s performances brought the house down on high bar in Athens and placed him in the middle of a judging controversy. After performing a routine with six release skills in the high bar event final (including four in a row – three variations of Tkatchev releases and a Gienger), the judges posted a score of 9.725, placing him in third position with several athletes still to compete. The crowd became unruly on seeing the results and interrupted the competition for almost fifteen minutes. Influenced by the crowd&#x27;s fierce reaction, the judges reevaluated the routine and increased Nemov&#x27;s score to 9.762, but this did not improve his placement and he finished without a medal. As the crowd&#x27;s anger was disrupting other competitors, like eventual men&#x27;s floor exercise competition champion Kyle Shewfelt, Nemov went out on the floor and gestured to quiet the audience. For this act of sportsmanship he received the 2005 Fair Play Award from the International Fair Play Committee.

This scandal was just the latest of several judging disputes in the competition, such as the scoring controversy involving Korean gymnast Yang Tae-Young, and prompted a major reconstruction of the gymnastics scoring system, which was implemented in 2006. The rule changes are credited as having encouraged more acrobatic activity and increasing difficulties on the high bar apparatus seen in later competitions. The Russian Olympic Committee later awarded Nemov $40,000 in recognition of his character, and he retired from gymnastics soon after.

==Personal life==
Nemov currently lives in his hometown of Tolyatti with his wife Galina and his son Alexei (born 2000) and his other son Dima (born 2009).

In 2022, after the International Gymnastics Federation opened a disciplinary case against Ivan Kuliak for wearing the military symbol &quot;Z&quot; (used by Russian invading forces in Ukraine) at an international gymnastics medal ceremony, Nemov expressed support for him, saying that Kuliak had been &quot;provoked&quot; and that his actions showed &quot;courage&quot;.

<text>The International Churches of Christ (ICOC) is a body of decentralized, co-operating, religiously conservative and racially integrated Christian congregations. Originating from the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement, the ICOC emerged from the discipling movement within the Churches of Christ in the 1970s. Kip McKean, a key figure until 2003, expanded the church from Gainesville to Boston and it quickly became one of the fastest growing Christian movements with a heavy focus on US college campuses. Under his leadership, the ICOC experienced rapid growth but also faced criticism. In March 2024, the ICOC numbered their members at 112,000. 

The ICOC is organized with a cooperative leadership structure broken down into regional families that have their own representative delegates. Viewing the Bible as the sole authority, the ICOC emphasizes being a non-denominational church united under Christ. It advocates salvation through faith and baptism, rejects &quot;faith alone&quot;, and emphasizes global unity. Historically, the church practiced exclusive baptism and strict &quot;discipling&quot;, but since 2002, has shifted to a more decentralized, voluntary discipling approach. The ICOC also promotes racial integration, opposes abortion and recreational drugs, and engages in international service through the HOPE Worldwide.

David V. Barrett noted in 2001 that in the 1990s the ICOC &quot;attracted a huge amount of criticism and hostility&quot; from the anti-cult movement. The church&#x27;s emphasis on and system of discipling during the period of McKean&#x27;s leadership was the subject of particular criticism, with some ex-members alleging that it involved the humiliation of vulnerable members. The ICOC&#x27;s use of &quot;love bombing&quot;, which involved drawing members in through showing them love and affection that became more conditional over time, was also criticised, due to its tendency to attract vulnerable and lonely people. The church has been barred from recruiting students on campuses or has been denied student organization status at numerous universities.

In 2022, the ICOC were named in US federal lawsuits, alleging that leaders of the church covered up the sexual abuse of children and financially exploited members between 1987 and 2012. The complaints were voluntary dismissed at the request of the plaintiffs in July 2023 and refiled in the Superior Court in Los Angeles, California in December of 2024.

The ICOC has its roots in a movement that reaches back to the period of the Second Great Awakening (1790–1870) of early nineteenth-century America. Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell are credited with what is today known as the Stone-Campbell or Restoration Movement. There are a number of branches of the Restoration movement, and the ICOC was formed from within the Churches of Christ. Specifically, it was born from a discipling movement that arose among the Churches of Christ during the 1970s. This discipling movement developed in the campus ministry of Chuck Lucas.

In 1967, Chuck Lucas was minister of the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville, Florida (later renamed the Crossroads Church of Christ). That year he started a new project known as Campus Advance (based on principles borrowed from the Campus Crusade and the Shepherding Movement). Centered on the University of Florida, the program called for a strong evangelical outreach and an intimate religious atmosphere in the form of &quot;soul talks&quot; and &quot;prayer partners. Soul talks&quot; were held in student residences and involved prayer and sharing overseen by a leader who delegated authority over group members. &quot;Prayer partners &quot; referred to the practice of pairing a new Christian with an older guide for personal assistance and direction. Both procedures led to &quot;in-depth involvement of each member in one another&#x27;s lives&quot;.

The ministry grew as younger members appreciated the new emphasis on commitment and models for communal activity. This activity became identified by many with the forces of radical change in the larger American society that characterized the late sixties and seventies. The campus ministry in Gainesville thrived and sustained strong support from the elders of the local congregation in the &#x27;Crossroads Church of Christ&#x27;. By 1971, as many as a hundred people a year were joining the church. Most notable was the development of a training program for potential campus ministers.

===From Gainesville to Boston: 1970s–1980s===
Among the converts at Gainesville was a student named Kip McKean who was converted by Chuck Lucas.
McKean was introduced to the Florida Church of Christ&#x27;s controversial recruitment style in 1967. Born in Indianapolis, McKean completed a degree while training at Crossroads, and afterward served as campus minister at several Churches of Christ locations. By 1979 his ministry grew from a few individuals to over three hundred making it the fastest growing Church of Christ campus ministry in America. McKean then moved to Massachusetts, where he took over the leadership of the Lexington Church of Christ (soon to be called the Boston Church of Christ). Building on Lucas&#x27; initial strategies, McKean only agreed to lead the church in Lexington as long as every member agreed to be &#x27;totally committed&#x27;. The church grew from 30 members to 3,000 in just over 10 years in what became known as the &#x27;Boston Movement&#x27;. McKean taught that the church was &quot;God&#x27;s true and only modern movement&quot; and under his leadership, it &quot;envisioned and implemented a tightly structured community that returned to the doctrines and lifestyles of the first-century Christian churches, with the goal of evangelizing the entire planet within a generation&quot;. According to journalist Madeleine Bower, &quot;the group became renowned for its extreme views and rigid teaching of the Bible, but mainstream churches quickly disavowed the group&quot;.

David G. Bromley and J. Gordon Melton, sociologist and historian of religion respectively, note how International Churches of Christ grew quickly in the 1980s, but that &quot;Even as ICOC developed, however, its relationships with several established institutional sectors deteriorated&quot;. The church&#x27;s &quot;doctrine signaled the movement&#x27;s self-perceived superiority to other Christian churches in teaching that it alone had rediscovered biblical doctrines critical to individual salvation and insisting on rebaptizing new members to ensure their salvation&quot;. They note that further tensions developed as a result of the church&#x27;s &quot;aggressive evangelizing tactics&quot; and use of &#x27;discipling&#x27; or &#x27;shepherding&#x27; practices, whereby new members were provided spiritual guidance and had their personal lives closely supervised by more established members. &quot;Members were taught that commitment to the church superseded all other relationships&quot;, write Bromley and Melton. As a result, &quot;the main branch of the
Churches of Christ disavowed its relationship with ICOC; a number of universities banned ICOC recruiters; and ICOC became a prominent target of media and anticult group opposition&quot;.

In 1985 a Church of Christ minister and professor, Dr. Flavil Yeakley, administered the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test to the Boston Church of Christ (BCC), the founding church of the ICOC. Yeakley passed out three MBTI tests, which asked members to perceive their past, current, and five-year in the future personality types. While over 900 members were tested, 835 individuals completed all three forms. A majority of those respondents changed their perceived or imagined personality type scores on the three tests in convergence with a single type. After completing the study, Yeakley observed that &quot;The data in this study of the Boston Church of Christ does not prove that any certain individual has actually changed his or her personality in an unhealthy way. The data, however, does prove that there is a group dynamic operating in that congregation that influences its members to change their personalities to conform to the group norm&quot;.
By the end of 1988 the churches in the Boston Movement were for all practical purposes a distinct fellowship, initiating a fifteen-year period during which there would be little contact between the CoC and the Boston Movement. By 1988, McKean was regarded as the leader of the movement. It was at this time that the Boston church initiated its program of outreach to the poor called HopeWorldwide. Also in 1988, McKean selected a handful of couples that he and Elena, his wife, had personally trained and named them World Sector Leaders. In 1989 mission teams were officially sent out to Tokyo, Honolulu, Washington, DC, Manila, Miami, Seattle, Bangkok, and Los Angeles. That year, McKean and his family moved to Los Angeles to lead the new church &quot;planted&quot; (a euphemism the church uses for &quot;established&quot;) some months earlier. Within a few years Los Angeles, not Boston, was the fulcrum of the movement.

===The ICOC: 1990s===
In 1990 the Crossroads Church of Christ broke with the movement and, through a letter written to &quot;The Christian Chronicle&quot;, attempted to restore relations with the Churches of Christ. By the early 1990s some first-generation leaders had become disillusioned by the movement and left. The movement was first recognized as an independent religious group in 1992 when John Vaughn, a church growth specialist at Fuller Theological Seminary, listed them as a separate entity. TIME magazine ran a full-page story on the movement in 1992 calling them &quot;one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing and most innovative bands of Bible thumpers&quot; that had grown into &quot;a global empire of 103 congregations from California to Cairo with total Sunday attendance of 50,000&quot;. A formal break was made from the Churches of Christ in 1993 when the group organized under the name &quot;International Churches of Christ.&quot; This new designation formalized a division that was already in existence between those involved with the Crossroads/Boston Movement and &quot;original&quot; Churches of Christ. In September 1995, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that for every three members joining the church, two left, attributing this statistic to church officials.

Growth in the ICOC was not without criticism. Other names that have been used for this movement include the &quot;Crossroads movement,&quot; &quot;Multiplying Ministries,&quot; and the &quot;Discipling Movement&quot;. One Church is formed per city, and as it expands it is broken down into &quot;sectors&quot; that oversee &quot;zones&quot; which have their own neighborhood Bible study groups. Claims that this structure too authoritarian were responded to by McKean saying, &quot;I was wrong on some of my initial thoughts about biblical authority&quot;. Al Baird, former ICOC spokesperson adds, &quot;It&#x27;s not a dictatorship,&quot; ; &quot;It&#x27;s a theocracy, with God on top.&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported in 1996 that &quot;The group is considered so aggressive and authoritarian in its practices that other evangelical Protestant groups have labeled it &#x27;aberrational&#x27; and &#x27;abusive&#x27;. It has been repudiated by the mainstream Churches of Christ, a 1.6 million-member body from which it grew&quot;.

Growth continued globally and in 1996 the independent organisation &quot;Church Growth Today&quot; named the Los Angeles ICOC as the fastest growing Church in North America for the second year running and another eight ICOC churches were in the top 100. By 1999, the Los Angeles church reached a Sunday attendance of 14,000. By 2001, the ICOC was an independent worldwide movement that had grown from a small congregation to 125,000 members and had planted a church in nearly every country of the world in a period of twenty years. In his 2001 book &quot;The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, &#x27;Cults&#x27; and Alternative Religions&quot;, David V. Barrett wrote that the ICOC was &quot;currently causing perhaps more concern than almost any other&quot; evangelical church in the United Kingdom. Barrett writes that &quot;In the last decade ICOC has attracted a huge amount of criticism and hostility from anti-cultists&quot;, noting that it had been made aware of various criticisms &quot;but unlike some of the other movements founded in the 1970s, does not yet have appeared to reached the point in its development where it becomes sensitive to the genuine distress of some of its members and their families have experienced, and willing to modify some of its practices to reduce the possibility of causing such distress&quot;. In 1998, Ron Loomis, an expert on cults and leader of a cult-awareness program at the College of Lake County, called the ICOC &quot;the most intensive cult in existence since the mid-1970s&quot;.

Barrett also noted in 2001 that as with other new religious movements, membership turnover in the ICOC was high, with &quot;many leaving after a few months because they find the discipline of life in the movement too demanding or oppressive&quot;. He concluded that &quot;There are probably far more ex-members of ICOC than current members&quot;, though noted ICOC attempts to discourage members from leaving and that communal living arrangements and the fact that the ICOC encouraged the breaking-off of friendships with non-members made it difficult for some to leave.

===The ICOC: 2000s===
Membership growth stopped as the 90&#x27;s finished. In 2000, the ICOC announced the completion of its six-year initiative to establish a church in every country with a city that had a population over 100,000. In spite of this, numerical growth continued to slow. Beginning in the late 1990s, problems arose as McKean&#x27;s moral authority as the leader of the movement came into question. Expectations for continued numerical growth and the pressure to sacrifice financially to support missionary efforts took its toll. Added to this was the loss of local leaders to new planting projects. In some areas, decreases in membership began to occur. At the same time, realization was growing that the accumulated costs of McKean&#x27;s leadership style and associated disadvantages were outweighing the benefits. In 2001, McKean&#x27;s leadership weaknesses were affecting his family, with all of his children disassociating themselves from the church, and he was asked by a group of long-standing elders in the ICOC to take a sabbatical from overall leadership of the ICOC. On 12 November 2001, McKean, who had led the International Churches of Christ, issued a statement that he was going to take a sabbatical from his role of leadership in the church:

 Nearly a year later, in November 2002 he resigned from the office and personally apologized citing arrogance, anger and an over-focus on numerical goals as the source of his decision.

Referring to this event, McKean said:

Ronald Enroth writes that McKean &quot;was forced to step down because of his own rule that leaders must resign if their children leave the church&quot;.

The period following McKean&#x27;s departure included a number of changes in the ICOC, including decentralization and a dismantling of its headquarters and central leadership. Some changes were initiated from the leaders themselves and others brought through members. Most notable was Henry Kriete, a leader in the London ICOC, who circulated an open letter detailing his feelings about theological exclusivism and authority in the ICOC. This letter affected the ICOC for the decade after McKean&#x27;s resignation. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; reported in 2003 that following McKean&#x27;s resignation, &quot;leadership now is in the hands of 10 elders ruling by consensus&quot;.

Critics of the ICOC claim that Kip McKean&#x27;s resignation sparked numerous problems. However, others have noted that since McKean&#x27;s resignation the ICOC has made numerous changes. &quot;The Christian Chronicle&quot;, a newspaper for the Churches of Christ, reports that the ICOC has changed its leadership and discipling structure. According to the paper, &quot;the ICOC has attempted to address the following concerns: a top down hierarchy, discipling techniques, and sectarianism&quot;. In September 2005, nine members were elected to serve as a Unity Proposal Group. They subsequently developed a &#x27;Plan for United Cooperation&#x27;, published in March 2006. In September 2012, it was reported that around 93% of ICOC churches supported the plan.

Over time, McKean attempted to re-assert his leadership over the ICOC, yet was rebuffed. Sixty-four Elders, Evangelists and Teachers wrote a letter to McKean expressing concern that there had been &quot;no repentance&quot; from his publicly acknowledged leadership weaknesses. McKean then began to criticize some of the changes that were being made, as he did in the 1980s toward Mainline Churches of Christ. After attempting to divide the ICOC he was disfellowshipped in 2006 and founded a church that he called the International Christian Church.

&quot;The Christian Chronicle&quot; reports that the ICOC&#x27;s reported membership peaked at 135,000 in 2002, before dropping to 89,000 in 2006. ICOC leaders reported that a mid-2012 survey revealed that membership had grown again to 97,800 members in 610 churches across 148 countries.

=== Legal issues ===

====Lawsuit by an ICOC member church alleging defamation====
On November 23, 1991, two Singapore Newspapers, &quot;The New Paper&quot; (English) and &quot;Lianhe Wanbao&quot; (Chinese), published articles stating that the Singapore Central Christian Church (a member of ICOC) was a &quot;cult&quot;. The church sued the papers, alleging defamation. An initial court ruling held that what the papers had written was fair and in the public interest. An appeals court, however, overruled the lower court, stating that the papers had stated that the church was a cult as if that was a fact, when it was not a fact, but a comment. The papers were each ordered to pay the church . &quot;The New Paper&quot; had to pay the founder of the church, John Philip Louis, . The papers also had to pay the legal fees of the church and its founder. In the same ruling, the appeals court held that an article that had also characterized the church as a cult, in the bi-monthly, Singapore-based, Christian magazine &quot;Impact&quot;, was written fairly from the standpoint of a Christian publication written for the Christian community. The church and Louis were ordered to pay &quot;Impact&#x27;s&quot; legal fees.

====Lawsuits related to alleged coverup of sexual abuse====

In 2022, the ICOC and the International Christian Churches were named in multiple US federal lawsuits. They alleged that between 1987 and 2012, leaders of the two churches covered up the sexual abuse of children, some of whom were as young as three, and financially exploited members. The lawsuits alleged that the ICOC, together with its affiliates the International Christian Church, the City of Angels International Christian Church, HOPE Worldwide and Mercy Worldwide, &quot;indoctrinated&quot; the plaintiffs, keeping them isolated while they were sexually exploited and manipulated through the ICOC&#x27;s &quot;rigid&quot; belief system. The lawsuit also named ICOC leaders, founder Kip McKean and the estate of Chuck Lucas, as defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the ICOC and its leaders created a &quot;system of exploitation that extracts any and all value it can from members&quot;. The lawsuits alleged that members were forced to give 10% of their income as a tithe to the church and additionally to fund twice-yearly special mission trips, which drove some to depression and suicide. The Los Angeles ICOC responded to the lawsuits by stating: &quot;As the Church&#x27;s long-standing policies make clear, we do not tolerate any form of sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, or sexual coercion, and we will fully cooperate with the authorities in any investigations of this type of behavior&quot;. The federal lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice at the request of the plaintiffs in July 2023. They were then refiled in the Superior Court in Los Angeles, California (i.e., State Court) in December of 2024.

==Church governance==

The International Churches of Christ are a family of over 750 independent churches in 155 nations around the world. The 750 churches form 34 Regional Families of churches that oversee mission work in their respective geographic areas of influence. Each regional family of churches sends Evangelists, Elders and Teachers to an annual leadership conference, where delegates meet to pray, plan and co-operate world evangelism. &quot;Service Teams&quot; provide global leadership and oversight. The Service Teams consists of an Elders, Evangelists, Teachers, Youth &amp; Family, Campus, Singles, Communications &amp; Administration, and HOPEww &amp; Benevolence teams.

===Ministry Training Academy===

The education and ministerial training program in the ICOC is the Ministry Training Academy (MTA). In 2013, the MTA finalized a curriculum consisting of twelve core courses that are divided into three areas of study: biblical knowledge, spiritual development, and ministry leadership. Each course requires at least 12 hours of classroom study in addition to course work. An MTA student who completes the twelve core classes receives a certificate of completion.

=== ICOC&#x27;s relationship with mainstream Churches of Christ ===
With the resignation of McKean, some efforts at healing between the International Churches of Christ and the mainstream Churches of Christ are being made. In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the &quot;Faithful Conversations&quot; dialog between members of the Churches of Christ and International Churches of Christ. Those involved were able to apologize and initiate an environment conducive to building bridges. A few leaders of the Churches of Christ apologized for use of the word &quot;cult&quot; in reference to the International Churches of Christ. The International Churches of Christ leaders apologized for alienating the Churches of Christ and implying they were not Christians. Despite improvements in relations, there are still fundamental differences within the fellowship. Early 2005 saw a second set of dialogues with greater promise for both sides helping one another.

===HOPE Worldwide===
Founded in 1991, HOPE Worldwide is a non-profit organization established by the ICOC that supports disadvantaged children and the elderly. It relies on donations from ICOC churches, companies and individuals and on government grants. , HOPE Worldwide was operating 100 projects in 30 countries. , the organization reported serving on average more than one million people per year, in more than 60 countries.

HOPE Worldwide received grants from US president George W. Bush&#x27;s AIDS program for its work in several countries, and arranged for Chris Rock to visit South Africa for an AIDS prevention event.

==Beliefs and practices of the ICOC==
===Beliefs===

The ICOC considers the Bible the inspired word of God. Through holding that their doctrine is based on the Bible alone, and not on creeds and traditions, they claim the distinction of being &quot;non-denominational&quot;. Members of the International Churches of Christ generally emphasize their intent to simply be part of the original church established by Jesus Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection, which became evident on the Day of Pentecost as described in Acts 2. They believe that anyone who follows the plan of salvation as laid out in the scriptures is saved by the grace of God, through their faith in Jesus, at baptism. The ICOC has over 700 churches spread across 155 nations, with each church being a racially integrated congregation made up of a diversity of people from various age groups, economic, and social backgrounds. They believe Jesus came to break down the dividing wall of hostility between the races and people groups of this world and unite mankind under the Lordship of Christ 

Like the Churches of Christ, the ICOC recognizes the Bible as the sole source of authority for the church and it also believes that the current denominational divisions are inconsistent with Christ&#x27;s intent, believing instead that Christians ought to be united. The ICOC, like the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), in contrast to the CoC, consider permissible practices that the New Testament does not expressly forbid.

The ICOC teaches that &quot;anyone, anywhere who follows God&#x27;s plan of salvation in the Bible and lives under the Lordship of Jesus, will be saved. Christians are saved by the grace of God, through their faith in Jesus Christ, at baptism.&quot; They claim that &quot;faith alone&quot; (e.g., saying the Sinner&#x27;s Prayer) is not sufficient unless an individual by faith obeys God and gets baptized, believing that baptism is necessary for the forgiveness of sins. The belief in the necessity of baptism is in agreement with the prevailing view in the Churches of Christ and Restoration Movement. It is in contrast with the beliefs of Baptist churches that teach that faith alone is adequate for salvation.

====One True Church (OTC) doctrine====
Originally, the ICOC taught that only baptisms within ICOC member churches were legitimate and hence only members of ICOC churches had had their sins forgiven and were saved. This is known as the One True Church (OTC) doctrine.

In 2003, however, after the departure of McKean, the leadership of ICOC issued letters of apology stating that they had been &quot;too judgmental&quot; in applying this doctrine. As a consequence, many within ICOC began to accept that baptisms outside of ICOC churches, particularly those of family members who belonged to other Christian denominations, could be legitimate. 

This is consistent with their historical roots in the Churches of Christ, which believe that Christ established only one church, and that the use of denominational creeds serves to foster division among Christians. This belief dates to the beginning of the Restoration Movement; Thomas Campbell expressed an ideal of unity in his &quot;Declaration and address&quot;: &quot;The church of Jesus Christ on earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one.&quot;

====Lifestyle beliefs====
The ICOC is opposed to abortion, recreational drugs, and non-marital sexual relations. Homosexuals are welcome, but they must lead a life of chastity. Members&#x27; romantic partners require approval by the church.

===Practices===
====Sunday worship====

A typical Sunday morning service involves singing, praying, preaching, and the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. An unusual element of ICOC tradition is the lack of established church buildings. Congregations meet in rented spaces: hotel conference rooms, schools, public auditoriums, conference centers, small stadiums, or rented halls, depending on the number of parishioners. Though the church is not static, neither is it ad hoc – the leased locale is converted into a worship facility. &quot;From an organizational standpoint, it&#x27;s a great idea&quot;, observes Boston University Chaplain Bob Thornburg. &quot;They put very little money into buildings...You put your money into people who reach out to more people in order to help them become Christians.&quot;

This practice of not owning buildings changed when the Tokyo Church of Christ became the first ICOC church to build its own church building. This building was designed by the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. This became an example for other ICOC churches to follow.

====Discipling====
=====McKean era (1979–2002)=====
A distinguishing feature of the ICOC under McKean was an intense form of discipleship. McKean&#x27;s mentor, evangelist Chuck Lucas, developed this practice based in part on the book &quot;The Master Plan of Evangelism&quot; by Robert Coleman. Coleman&#x27;s book taught that &quot;Jesus controlled the lives of the apostles, that Jesus taught the apostles to &#x27;disciple&#x27; by controlling the lives of others, and that Christians should imitate this process when bringing people to Christ.&quot; Under McKean, &quot;discipling&quot; entailed members being &quot;assigned a more senior adviser who is always available and frequently present in their lives, even at intimate moments, which mentors them through relationship difficulties. In this practice, individuals interact with other group members in hierarchical relationships&quot;. According to Kathleen E. Jenkins&#x27;s ethnography of the church, McKean viewed discipling as &quot;the most efficient way to achieve the movement&#x27;s stated goal: &#x27;to evangelize the world in one generation&#x27;&quot;.

The church&#x27;s emphasis on discipling during this period was the subject of criticism. A number of ex-members expressed problems with discipling in the ICOC. Critics and former members allege that discipling &quot;involved public scorn as a way to humiliate vulnerable members, to keep them humble&quot;. Jenkins notes that &quot;[t]his ICOC structure has been greatly criticized by anti-cult organizations, university officials (the ICOC has been banned from several campuses), and ex-members&quot;.

Discipling under McKean was mandatory. All disciples (i.e., baptized members) had to be paired with and mentored by a more mature Christian . They had to check in with their discipler frequently, such as daily or weekly, and was held accountable by them. This included the activities and Church contribution a disciple would give (typically 15-30% including &quot;special contribution) . Disciples were also held accountable for how many new people they met on a daily basis and recruited into the church. Anyone criticizing the authority of a discipler was publicly rebuked in group meetings.

Those who left the ICOC were to be shunned, and disciples were told that only those baptized within the ICOC were saved; all other people were damned. Furthermore, anyone that left the church would also lose their salvation.

A 1999 study found that a substantial minority of former ICOC members included in the study &quot;reached clinically significant levels of psychological distress, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms&quot;. Two-thirds of them had sought psychotherapy after leaving the church.

Nonetheless, many disciples, including some who left, got a great deal out of the structure of the discipling system. The found &quot;meaning and community&quot; and formed close friendships across racial and class lines within the ICOC. Sociologist Dr. Joseph E. Lee posits that the strict discipling program helped lead to a lowering of barriers between races and classes. He found this to be a general characteristic of organizations (e.g., martial arts schools) with strong formal beliefs and discipline. Kathleen Jenkins found that &quot;Discipling [...] created tightly bound networks that threw members into frequent contact with disciples from different backgrounds who intimately and routinely intervened in all aspects of an individual&#x27;s life. These intimate racially and ethnically diverse discipling networks provided members with social resources such as childcare, teen counseling, tutoring, employment opportunities, domestic help, and other kinds of assistance in day-to-day living&quot;.

=====Post McKean era (2002–present)=====
According to Joseph Yi, writing in 2009, with the departure of McKean in 2002 the ICOC transitioned from a top-down organization to a &quot;loose federation of autonomous local churches&quot;. This led to a change in discipling practices. One of the local ICOC churches, the Chicago Church of Christ, made discipling voluntary and not mandatory. Instead of a top-down hierarchy, they adopted a &quot;servant leadership&quot; model.

====Love bombing====
The ICOC has been accused of using the tactic of &quot;love bombing&quot;, which David Barrett describes as &quot;showing a great deal of love, affection and attention to prospective members to draw them in&quot;, resulting in the criticism that &quot;vulnerable or lonely people, and this includes many students, will be attracted by this&quot;. Journalist Alasdair Belling has noted that this attention and praise &quot;slowly becomes more conditional over time&quot;.

== University campuses ==

Starting from his own college days in the 1970s, McKean and the churches he has led (e.g., ICOC and its predecessors and successors) made recruiting on college campuses a priority.

In 1994, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Campus Advance, the ICOC&#x27;s campus ministry, had been accused of using &quot;high-pressure tactics&quot; to &quot;systematically target and isolate recruits and deprive them of food and sleep in carefully coordinated steps to break down resistance and cause mental confusion&quot;, saying former members compared the group&#x27;s tactics to those of a cult. In response, a spokesperson for the New York Church of Christ stated that &quot;This word &#x27;cult&#x27; is so inflammatory and thrown around so loosely that it is completely unfair and totally unfounded&quot;. The articles noted that &quot;representatives of the church say their actions are misrepresented by religious groups jealous of their ability to appeal to young adults&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;complaints against the church and its campus affiliates are strikingly uniform in portraying church members as adept in singling out vulnerable targets, like lonely students, and enveloping them rapidly with a psychological dependency that is difficult to break&quot;, while the Church leaders rejects nearly every allegation.

In 1996 the dean of Boston University&#x27;s Marsh Chapel, Rev. Robert Watts Thornburg, referred to the church as &quot;the most destructive religious group I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Thornburg stated that the church&#x27;s &quot;[r]ecruitment techniques include the duplicitous use of love and high pressure harassment, producing incredibly high levels of false guilt&quot; and that &quot;The group cuts across the very core of what higher education is about. It refuses to receive questions or have any kind of discussion of an idea. It simply says &#x27;Believe and obey&#x27;, and if you do anything else you are hard of heart&quot;. An evangelist for the church responded to the allegations by stating that &quot;We are a very, very different church from what&#x27;s already established&quot; and that &quot;Whenever you see something radical or different, of course you&#x27;re going to get that label that it&#x27;s a cult&quot;. 

In 2000, a &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; article by Carolyn Kleiner on proselytizing on college campuses described the ICOC as a &quot;fast-growing Christian organization known for aggressive proselytizing to college students&quot; and as &quot;one of the most controversial religious groups on campus&quot;. Kleiner states that &quot;some ex-members and experts on mind-control assert [it] is a cult&quot;. The article quotes ICOC spokesperson Al Baird, who stated &quot;We&#x27;re no more a cult than Jesus was a cult&quot;, and sociologist Jeffrey K. Hadden, who was in agreement with Baird and stated that &quot;every new religion experiences a high level of tension with society because its beliefs and ways are unfamiliar. But most, if they survive, we come to accept as part of the religious landscape&quot;.

A 2004 edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Evangelism&quot; reported that academics had complained that their students who get involved with the group tend to lose interest in their studies.

Anna Kira Hippert and Sarah Harvey of the Religion Media Centre noted in 2021 that the ICOC&#x27;s discipling system together with its university campus activities &quot;made the ICOC one of the more controversial new Christian groups in the UK&quot;.

===University responses===
Boston University banned the group in 1987 or 1989, by which time 50 students per year were reportedly dropping out of education to join the church. The ICOC was reportedly the first religious group to have been banned at Boston University.

In 1994 it was banned at American University and George Washington University.

In November 1996, it was reported that the ICOC had either been barred from recruiting students or had been denied student organization status by 22 US colleges and universities, according to information compiled by the American Family Foundation. The reasons cited for these decisions were mostly accusations of harassment or violations of campus policies.

In 1998, it was reported that the ICOC had been banned from university campuses in the United Kingdom, including in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester.

In March 2000, the State University of New York at Purchase settled a court case about an incident that happened in 1998, when it had suspended an ICOC member was for allegedly &quot;intimidating ... harassing ... and detaining&quot; another student and banned the church from holding services on the Purchase campus. The student was reinstated and the ICOC was allowed to use campus facilities again.

By 2000, according to &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;[a]t least 39 institutions, including Harvard and Georgia State, [had] outlawed the organization at one time or another for violating rules&quot; regarding recruiting and harassment.

The ICOC in the 2020s was banned from operating at a number of Australian universities. The ICOC&#x27;s group at the University of New South Wales (where it is formally banned), the UNSW Lions, has repeatedly renamed itself to maintain a presence on campuses.

==Racial integration in ICOC churches==
ICOC churches have an overall higher degree of racial integration than many other religious congregations. This is a priority for the denomination. Racial prejudice is viewed as a state of personal sinfulness which is done away with once a person is baptized and becomes a member. Jenkins also notes that &quot;mandatory close and frequent social interaction forced members to develop such strong cross-racial and ethnic networks&quot;. Writing in 2004, Kevin S. Wells reported that &quot;The fact that ICOC congregations are typically multicultural has [...] gained the positive attention of national media in recent years&quot;. In 2017, the ICOC formed an organization called SCUAD (Social, Cultural, Unity. and Diversity) that would &quot;seek to champion racial conversation, education, and action among ICOC churches&quot; By 2021, many local ICOC churches had instituted their own SCUAD groups. There was, however, a certain amount of backlash from members who saw the SCUADs&#x27; explicit discussion of racism as a form of critical race theory. Nonetheless, by 2022 most congregations had begun conversations about &quot;racial inclusion, diversity and justice&quot;, although Michael Burns states that &quot;It seemed [...] that very few had undertaken to carefully examine their history, beliefs, practices, and systems and subsequently engaged in significant structural change&quot;.

<doc id="496013" wikidata="Q858384" url="?curid=496013" title="Monster (manga)">
<text>Monster (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa. It was published by Shogakukan in its manga magazine &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; between December 1994 and December 2001, with its chapters collected in 18 volumes. The story revolves around Kenzo Tenma, a Japanese surgeon living in Düsseldorf, Germany whose life enters turmoil after he gets himself involved with Johan Liebert, one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a psychopathic serial killer.

Urasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel &quot;Another Monster&quot;, a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter&#x27;s point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by Madhouse into a 74-episode anime television series, which aired on Nippon TV from April 2004 to September 2005. The manga and anime were both licensed by Viz Media for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, Siren Visual licensed the anime for Australia.

&quot;Monster&quot; was Urasawa&#x27;s first work to receive international acclaim and success; the manga has sold over 20 million copies, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. The manga has won several awards, including the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award and the Japan Media Arts Festival. Its anime adaptation has been called one of the best anime series of its decade.

== Plot ==
Dr. Kenzo Tenma is a young Japanese brain surgeon, working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in Düsseldorf, West Germany. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins Johan and Anna Liebert into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. Director Heinemann and the other doctors in Tenma&#x27;s way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.

Nine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a &quot;monster.&quot; Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers&#x27; room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma&#x27;s attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.

Tenma is suspected by the police, particularly BKA Inspector Lunge, and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy&#x27;s sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her adoptive parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her adoptive parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this &quot;monster&quot;: from the former East Germany&#x27;s attempt to use a secret orphanage known as &quot;511 Kinderheim&quot; to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children&#x27;s books used in a eugenics experiment in the former Czechoslovakia. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this &quot;monster&quot;, and vows to fix the mistake he made by ending Johan&#x27;s life.

== Production ==
Urasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea. So he jokingly proposed a story about women&#x27;s judo, and that lead to his first solo work &quot;Yawara!&quot; (1986–1993).

The original idea for &quot;Monster&quot; came from the 1960s American television series &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, which had a strong impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story, a doctor is wrongfully convicted of murder, but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police. He said that his editor was adamant that the series would not do well, and tried to stop him from creating it.

The Japanese medical industry was strongly influenced by the professional practices in Germany, thus it seemed natural to the author to set &quot;Monster&quot; in Germany. Post-war Germany was chosen so that the neo-Nazi movement could be included in the story. When he started the semimonthly &quot;Monster&quot; at the end of 1994, Urasawa was already writing &quot;Happy!&quot; weekly and continued to serialize both at the same time. When &quot;Happy!&quot; ended in 1999, he began the weekly &quot;20th Century Boys&quot;. Writing both &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; at the same time caused him to be briefly hospitalized for exhaustion.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===

Written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa, &quot;Monster&quot; was serialized in Shōgakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; from December 1994 to December 2001. Shōgakukan collected its 162 chapters into 18 volumes released from 30 June 1995 to 28 February 2002. Takashi Nagasaki is credited as &quot;co-producer&quot; of the manga&#x27;s story. &quot;Monster&quot; received a nine-volume re-release between 30 January and 29 August 2008.

&quot;Monster&quot; was licensed in North America by Viz Media, who published all 18 volumes between 21 February 2006 and 16 December 2008. They released the version of the series, titled &quot;Monster: The Perfect Edition&quot;, between 15 July 2014 and 19 July 2016.

=== Anime ===

The manga series was adapted into an anime by Madhouse, which aired between 7 April 2004 and 28 September 2005 on Nippon TV. Directed by Masayuki Kojima and written by Tatsuhiko Urahata, it features original character designs by long-time Studio Ghibli animator Kitarō Kōsaka which were adapted for the anime by Shigeru Fujita. The music was composed by Kuniaki Haishima, including the opening theme &quot;Grain&quot;.

David Sylvian was commissioned to write the first ending theme, &quot;For the Love of Life&quot;, on which he collaborated with Haishima. In the cover notes to the official soundtrack he said, &quot;I was attracted to the &quot;Monster&quot; material by the moral dilemma faced by its central character. The calm surface of the music giving way to darker undercurrents, signifying the conscience of the lead protagonist and the themes of morality, fate, resignation, and free will.&quot; It was used for the first 32 episodes. The second ending theme, &quot;Make It Home&quot; by Fujiko Hemming, was used for the remaining 42 episodes. It is the only song Hemming sung in her career.

The credit sequence features illustrations from the book &quot;Obluda, Která Nemá Své Jméno&quot; (The Monster Who Didn&#x27;t Have A Name) by Emil Scherbe which was published by Shogakukan on 30 September 2008.

An English dub of &quot;Monster&quot; was produced by Salami Studios for Viz Media, which had the North American license to the anime. The show aired on Syfy&#x27;s Ani-Mondays with two episodes back-to-back each Monday night at 11:00 pm EST, beginning 12 October 2009, as well as on its sister network Chiller. A DVD box set of the series, containing the first 15 episodes was released 8 December 2009. However, due to low sales of the first box set, Viz decided not to continue releasing the remaining episodes on DVD and later dropped the license. &quot;Monster&quot; began airing on Canada&#x27;s Super Channel on 15 March 2010, and on the Funimation Channel on 3 April 2010 on weekends at 12:30 am. The series was also available digitally from several internet retailers. Siren Visual licensed the series for Australia in 2013, and released it in five DVD volumes beginning in November 2013.

Netflix began streaming the series internationally on 1 January 2023, premiering the first 30 episodes; the entire 74 episodes were made available for the following month.

=== Live-action adaptations ===
In 2005, it was announced that New Line Cinema acquired the rights for an American live-action film adaptation of &quot;Monster&quot;. Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Josh Olson (&quot;A History of Violence&quot;) was hired to write the screenplay. No new information on the film was released since.

In 2013, it was revealed that Guillermo del Toro and American premium television network HBO were collaborating on a pilot for a live-action TV series based on &quot;Monster&quot;. Co-executive producer Stephen Thompson (&quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;) was writing the pilot, while del Toro was to direct it and be an executive producer alongside Don Murphy and Susan Montford. In 2015, del Toro told Latino-Review that HBO had passed on the project and that they were in the process of pitching to other studios.

== Reception ==
=== Manga ===
&quot;Monster&quot; has been critically acclaimed. It won an Excellence Prize in the Manga Division at the first Japan Media Arts Festival in 1997; and the Grand Prize of the 3rd Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 1999. It also won the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 2001; and the Best Manga Series at the Lucca Comics Awards in 2004. The Young Adult Library Services Association placed &quot;Monster&quot; on their 2007 Great Graphic Novels for Teens list. Viz Media&#x27;s English release was nominated several times for Eisner Awards, twice in the category Best U.S. Edition of International Material – Japan (2007 and 2009) and three times in Best Continuing Series (2007, 2008, 2009). In 2009, when Oricon conducted a poll asking which manga series the Japanese people wanted to see adapted into live-action, &quot;Monster&quot; came in fifth. At the 2009 Industry Awards held by the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation, the organizers of Anime Expo, &quot;Monster&quot; won the award for Best Drama Manga. The &quot;Monster&quot; manga has over 20 million copies in circulation.

Writing for &quot;Time&quot;, Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winner Junot Díaz praised the manga, proclaiming &quot;Urasawa is a national treasure in Japan, and if you ain&#x27;t afraid of picture books, you&#x27;ll see why&quot;. &quot;About.com&quot;″s Deb Aoki called &quot;Monster&quot; a multi-layered suspense series and satisfying mystery that stands up to repeat readings, although it is sometimes a &quot;little hard to follow&quot;. Reviewing the &quot;Monster&quot; manga for &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, Carl Kimlinger called Urasawa a master of suspense &quot;effortlessly maintaining the delicate balance of deliberate misinformation and explicit delineation of the dangers facing protagonists that only the finest suspense thrillers ever achieve.&quot; He commented that even the stories and characters that had felt unrelated to the greater picture are &quot;eventually drawn together by Johan&#x27;s grand plan.&quot; Kimlinger deemed the art &quot;invisible perfection,&quot; never &quot;showy or superfluous,&quot; with panels laid out so well that it is easy to forget how much effort is put into each and every page. Though he did not find the characters&#x27; physical designs attractive, he praised their expressiveness, writing that the characters &quot;wear their personalities on their faces, communicating changes in their outlooks, psychology, inner thoughts and emotions with shifts in expression that range from barely perceptible to masks of rage, hate and fear.&quot; &quot;UK Anime Network&quot; gave the first volume a perfect score based on the engrossing story, but felt the artwork, while appealing, was not &quot;groundbreaking&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Active Anime&quot; felt the art improved across the manga&#x27;s serialization.

A.E. Sparrow of &quot;IGN&quot; described &quot;Monster&quot; as a &quot;Hitchcock film set to manga&quot; and felt its real strength comes from its huge cast of interesting characters, who each have &quot;a unique story and history to relate&quot;. Carlo Santos, also for &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, called &quot;Monster&quot; &quot;a one-of-a-kind thriller&quot; and suggests that one of the most overlooked qualities of it is that &quot;amidst all the mystery and horror, there are moments of love and hope and all the good things about humanity.&quot; Though she praised the manga for its &quot;cinematically precise&quot; art, never confusing the reader, and making each person visually distinct despite the large cast of characters, Casey Brienza from the same website felt that too much time was spent developing minor characters &quot;who are likely to be dead or forgotten just a few dozen pages later,&quot; and that the series&#x27; ending &quot;went out with a whimper.&quot; Brienza noted that &quot;there is nothing satisfactory ever revealed to fully account for [Johan&#x27;s] supremely scrambled psyche,&quot; but concluded that as long as the reader does not look for &quot;deep meanings or think too hard about whether or not it all makes sense in the end&quot; they will enjoy it. Leroy Douresseaux of &quot;Comic Book Bin&quot;, praised &quot;Monster&quot;″s finale and wrote that the manga is &quot;worth reading again and again. It&#x27;s perfection&quot;.

=== Anime ===
&quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; called the anime adaptation &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;, stating that it features &quot;sophisticated storytelling and complex plot weaving, memorable characters, godly production values and excellent pacing&quot;. Darius Washington of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; named &quot;Monster&quot; one of the ten best anime of the past decade. Carl Kimlinger enthused that &quot;It cannot be overstated how brilliantly apart from the anime mainstream this unsettling, fiercely intelligent, and ultimately uncategorizable journey into darkness is.&quot; He praised Madhouse&#x27;s animation for not only keeping up the dark &quot;cinematic quality of Urasawa&#x27;s art&quot; but also improving on it, as well as Kuniaki Haishima&#x27;s score for adding &quot;immeasurably to the series&#x27; hair-raising atmosphere.&quot; Though he noted Viz Media&#x27;s inability to acquire the original ending theme song due to licensing problems, Kimlinger also called their English dub of the series one of the best in recent memory.

Kimlinger praised the series, for &quot;its fidelity to Naoki Urasawa&#x27;s original manga&quot;, commenting that &quot;there isn&#x27;t a scene left out, only a handful added in, and as far as I can tell not a line of dialogue changed or omitted. Given its faithfulness, fans of the manga will know that the series won&#x27;t get any better than this, this is as good as the series gets.&quot; As well as for its frequent habit of giving the spotlight to newly introduced characters instead of the main cast. He also described the ending of the series as, &quot;we feel vaguely let down when what we should really be doing is glorying in the somewhat messy, yes, but exhilarating final throes of one of last decade&#x27;s great series&quot;. Nonetheless, he considered such an ending to be expected, since &quot;as ambitious and complicated and just plain huge as &quot;Monster&quot; is, no conclusion is going to be entirely satisfactory. Someone is bound to get short-changed, loose ends are bound to be left dangling, and even if they weren&#x27;t, the simple truth is that no climax could ever live up to the series&#x27; build-up&quot;.

<text>Luss (, &#x27;herb&#x27;) is a village in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, on the west bank of Loch Lomond. The village is within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.

==History==
Historically in the County of Dunbarton, its original name is &quot;Clachan dhu&quot;, or &#x27;dark village&#x27;. Ben Lomond, the most southerly Munro, dominates the view north over the loch, and the Luss Hills rise to the west of the village.

Saint Kessog brought Christianity to Luss at the early 6th century in the Early Middle Ages. A number of early medieval and medieval monuments survive in the present churchyard, including simple cross-slabs which may date to as early as the 7th century AD, and a hogback grave-cover of the 11th century. A well-preserved late medieval effigy of a bishop is preserved within the modern church. The present Church of Scotland place of worship was built in 1875 by Sir James Colquhoun, 5th Baronet, in memory of his father, who had drowned in the loch in December 1873. The church is noted for its online services as well as for holding over one hundred weddings per year, mostly for couples from outwith the parish. Luss is the ancestral home of Clan Colquhoun and the McInturners of Luss, a sept of Clan Lamont.

==Places of interest==

Nowadays Luss is a conservation village, with a bypass carrying the busy A82 trunk road. In its position just off the main road to the West Highlands, it is visited by many tourists, and has a large car and coach park and a number of tourist-oriented shops.

Its Outstanding Conservation Area contains 36 buildings, 24 of which are of Category B or C listed status. Many of Luss&#x27; cottages, several of which are located on Pier Road, have been described as picturesque. Five of these are Category B listed, were built in the mid-19th century, and are identical constructions; namely Avonlea and Ivy Bank, Fernlea and Ivy Cottage, Laurel Cottage and Ravenslea, Rose Cottage and The Sheiling and Yewbank and Lonaigview.

Between 1980 and 2003, Luss was the main outdoor filming location for the Scottish Television drama series &quot;Take the High Road&quot;. Largely as a result of this, the village of 120 residents attracts more than 750,000 visitors each year. Although the programme is no longer made, the village&#x27;s name in the series, &quot;Glendarroch,&quot; is used for some buildings.

The village has a kiltmaker and a bagpipe works.

About a mile south of the village, in a cove at Aldochlay, is a small figure on a stone plinth. A contemporary legend evolved that it is a memorial to a child drowned in the loch, but it was in fact erected in 1890 by a local stonemason, who found the statue in a London scrapyard. &#x27;Wee Peter&#x27;, as he is locally known, was moved to the site after a brief spell near the railway, and has remained there ever since.

==Facilities==
The village hosts a water taxi service to Balloch, at the south of the loch, allowing visitors to transfer onwards to Glasgow by train or visit its shopping centre, Lomond Shores. Luss Pier is a popular starting point for boat trips on the loch.

The Loch Lomond Golf Club, which was for a number of years the site of the Barclays Scottish Open, is within the village&#x27;s borders.

<doc id="496020" wikidata="Q11598" url="?curid=496020" title="Arrested Development">
<text>Arrested Development is an American satirical television sitcom created by Mitchell Hurwitz. It aired on Fox for three seasons from November 2, 2003, to February 10, 2006, followed by two seasons on Netflix; season four being released on May 26, 2013, and season five being released on May 29, 2018, and March 15, 2019.

&quot;Arrested Development&quot; follows the Bluths, a formerly wealthy, dysfunctional family. It is presented in a serialized format, incorporating handheld camera work, voice-over narration, archival photos and historical footage, and maintains numerous running gags and catchphrases. Ron Howard served as both an executive producer and the omniscient narrator and, in later seasons, appears in the show as a fictionalized version of himself. Set in Newport Beach, California, the series was filmed primarily in Culver City and Marina del Rey.

&quot;Arrested Development&quot; received critical acclaim. It won six Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award, and attracted a cult following. It has been widely regarded as one of the greatest TV shows of all time. It influenced later single-camera comedy series such as &quot;30 Rock&quot; and &quot;Community&quot;.

Despite the positive critical response, &quot;Arrested Development&quot; received low ratings and viewership on Fox, who canceled the series in 2006. In 2011, Netflix licensed new episodes and distributed them on its streaming service. These episodes were released in May 2013. Netflix commissioned a fifth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, the first half of which premiered in May 2018, and the second half in March 2019. The show was due to be removed from Netflix in March 2023 but will remain on the service until 2026.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
Discussion that led to the creation of the series began in the summer of 2002. Ron Howard had the original idea to create a comedy series in the style of handheld cameras and reality television, but with an elaborate, highly comical script resulting from repeated rewritings and rehearsals. Howard met with David Nevins, the president of Imagine Television, Katie O&#x27;Connell, a senior vice president, and two writers, including Mitchell Hurwitz. In light of recent corporate accounting scandals, such as Enron and Adelphia, Hurwitz suggested a story about a &quot;riches to rags&quot; family. Howard and Imagine were interested in using this idea, and signed Hurwitz to write the show. The idea was pitched and sold in Q3 2002. There was a bidding war for the show between Fox and NBC, with the show ultimately selling to Fox as a put pilot with a six-figure penalty.

Over the next few months, Hurwitz developed the characters and plot for the series. The script of the pilot episode was submitted in January 2003 and filmed in March 2003. It was submitted in late April to Fox and was added to the network&#x27;s fall schedule that May.

=== Casting ===
Alia Shawkat was the first cast in the series. Michael Cera, Tony Hale, and Jessica Walter were cast from video tapes and flown in to audition for Fox. Jason Bateman and Portia de Rossi both read and auditioned for the network and were immediately chosen. The character of Gob was the most challenging to cast. When Will Arnett auditioned, he played the character &quot;like a guy who thought of himself as the chosen son, even though it was obvious to everyone else that he was the least favorite&quot;; he was chosen immediately for his portrayal. The characters of Tobias and George Sr. were originally going to have minor roles, but David Cross and Jeffrey Tambor&#x27;s portrayals mixed well with the rest of the characters, and they were given more significant parts. Howard provided the narration for the initial pilot, and his narrating meshed so well with the tone of the program that the decision was made to keep his voice. Howard aided in the casting of &quot;Lucille 2&quot;; the producers told him that their dream actress for the role was Liza Minnelli but that they assumed no one of her stature would take the part. She agreed when Ron Howard asked her himself, because they were old friends; she had been his babysitter when she was a teenager.

=== Filming techniques ===
&quot;Arrested Development&quot; uses several elements that were rare at the time for American live-action sitcoms. It was shot on location and in HD video (at 24 frames per second) with multiple cameras, parodying tactics often employed in documentary film and reality television, straying from the &quot;fixed-set, studio audience, laugh track&quot; style long dominant in comedy production. The show makes heavy use of cutaway gags, supplementing the narrative with visual punchlines like security camera footage, Bluth family photos, website screenshots, archive films, and flashbacks. An omniscient third-person narrator (producer Ron Howard) ties together the multiple plot threads running through each episode, while humorously undercutting and commenting on the characters. &quot;Arrested Development&quot; developed self-referentiality through use of in-jokes that evolved over multiple episodes, which rewarded longtime viewership (and in turn may have discouraged new viewers and contributed to the show&#x27;s ratings difficulties).

Because of scheduling conflicts, the fourth season used a different format with longer episodes focusing on one character. The season was later re-edited to be more in line with the format of the other seasons.

=== Cancellation and revival ===
During the series&#x27; third season in 2006, despite months-long rumors of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; having been picked up by the cable television network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. Hurwitz said, &quot;I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I think a lot of the actors were ready to move on.&quot; He said that he was &quot;more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping&quot; than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, &quot;If there&#x27;s a way to continue this in a form that&#x27;s not weekly episodic series television, I&#x27;d be up for it&quot;.

After the series cancellation, Fox Entertainment Group sold the initial 53-episode run for syndication. In a first for its kind, the syndication involved a three-year deal with Microsoft&#x27;s nascent internet video streaming service MSN Video (now Bing Video) before the series would go on to cable channel G4.

On October 2, 2011, the cast of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; reunited for a panel at The New Yorker Festival in New York. At the panel, Hurwitz declared his intention of producing a truncated fourth season as a lead-in to a film adaptation.

Six years after the series had been canceled by Fox, filming for a fourth season began on August 7, 2012. Fifteen episodes of the show&#x27;s revival season were released simultaneously on Netflix on May 26, 2013. Although it received generally favorable reviews, it was far less well-received than prior seasons, leading Netflix to re-edit the season in 2018. Netflix confirmed on May 17, 2017, that a fifth season was expected to be released on its service in 2018, with filming taking place from August 2017 to November 2017. &quot;Arrested Development&quot; was set to be removed from Netflix on March 15, 2023. However, after a last-minute deal, Netflix retained the streaming rights.

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===

The plot of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; revolves around the members of the Bluth family, a formerly wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show&#x27;s straight man, who strives to do the right thing and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father&#x27;s expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father&#x27;s plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Mae &quot;Maeby&quot; Fünke (Alia Shawkat), which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.

Michael&#x27;s father, George Bluth Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), is the patriarch of the family and a corrupt real estate developer who is arrested in the first episode. George goes to considerable lengths to manipulate and control his family in spite of his imprisonment, and makes numerous efforts to evade justice. His wife, and Michael&#x27;s mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter), is ruthlessly manipulative, materialistic, and hypercritical of every member of her family, and constantly drinks alcohol. Her grip is tightest on her youngest son, Byron &quot;Buster&quot; Bluth (Tony Hale), who is overeducated on various random subjects but lacks emotional intelligence or common sense. Buster is also a mother&#x27;s boy who has dependency issues and is prone to panic attacks.

Michael&#x27;s older brother is George Oscar Bluth II (Will Arnett), known by the acronym Gob, which is pronounced in the series like the Biblical figure Job (). An unsuccessful professional magician whose business and personal schemes usually fail or become tiresome and are quickly abandoned, Gob is competitive with Michael and bullies Buster. Michael&#x27;s twin sister, Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), is spoiled and materialistic, continually seeking to be the center of attention and espousing various social causes for the sake of vanity. In the finale, it is revealed that she and Lucille are sisters. She is married to Tobias Fünke (David Cross), a discredited psychiatrist-turned-aspiring actor. Tobias is a self-diagnosed &quot;never-nude&quot; (a disorder comparable to gymnophobia), whose language and behavior have heavily homosexual overtones to which he seems oblivious and which are the center of much tongue-in-cheek comedy throughout the series. Their daughter, Maeby, is a rebellious teen with an opportunistic streak, who seeks to defy her parents for the sake of attention, and otherwise pursues boys and power, and furthers her complicated relationship with George Michael.

== Episodes ==

=== Season 1 (2003–04) ===
George Bluth Sr., patriarch of the wealthy Bluth family, is the founder and former CEO of the successful Bluth Company which markets and builds mini-mansions among many other activities. His son Michael serves as manager of the company, and, after being passed over for a promotion, decides to leave both the company and his family. Just as he makes this decision, however, George Sr. is arrested by the Securities and Exchange Commission for defrauding investors and gross spending of the company&#x27;s money for &quot;personal expenses&quot;. His wife Lucille becomes CEO, and immediately names as the new president her extremely sheltered youngest son Buster, who proves ill-equipped, as his only experience with business is a class he took concerning 18th century agrarian business. Furious at being passed over again, Michael secures another job with a rival company and plans on leaving his family behind for good. Realizing that they need Michael, the family asks him to come back and run the company, which Michael scoffs at until he sees how much the family means to his teenaged son George Michael. To keep the family together, Michael asks his self-centered twin sister Lindsay, her husband Tobias and their daughter Maeby to live together in the Bluth model home with him and George Michael.

Throughout the first season, different characters struggle to change their identities. Buster works to escape from his mother&#x27;s control by bonding with brothers Michael and Gob as well as with love interest Lucille Austero, Lucille Bluth&#x27;s neighbor and chief social rival. George Michael nurses a forbidden crush on his cousin Maeby, while continually trying to meet his father&#x27;s expectations. Lindsay&#x27;s husband Tobias searches for work as an actor, with the aid of Carl Weathers. Michael falls in love with his screw-up older brother Gob&#x27;s neglected girlfriend Marta, and is torn between being with her and putting &quot;family first&quot;. After seeing Michael physically fight with Gob, Marta realizes that they do not share the same family values and she leaves them both. To spite Buster, Lucille adopts a Korean son whom she calls &quot;Annyong&quot; after she mistakes the Korean word for &quot;hello&quot; as his name. Through an escalating series of dares, Gob marries a woman he just met, played by Will Arnett&#x27;s then real-life wife Amy Poehler, but cannot get an annulment because he refuses to admit that he did not consummate the marriage. Kitty, George Sr.&#x27;s former assistant and mistress, tries to blackmail the company. She is caught in the Bluth family yacht&#x27;s explosion, as used in one of Gob&#x27;s magic acts, but survives with a cooler full of damning evidence labeled &quot;H Maddas&quot;. After previous failed attempts, and a brief religious stint in Judaism, George Sr. finally escapes from prison by faking a heart attack. It is also revealed that George Sr. committed &quot;light treason&quot; by using the company to build mini-palaces for Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

=== Season 2 (2004–05) ===
Because of his father&#x27;s latest prison break deception (a faked heart attack), Michael decides to leave his family and move to Phoenix, Arizona with George Michael but discovers that he cannot leave the state due to the Bluth Company being under investigation and him having to go to jail as a replacement for his father. Lucille appoints Gob the new Bluth Company president, but since Gob proves utterly incompetent, the position&#x27;s real duties revert to Michael. During the rest of the season Gob serves as figurehead president; Michael is still under scrutiny for George Sr.&#x27;s illegal activity.

George Sr. is not, in fact, gone. After faking his death in Mexico by paying off the cops, George Sr. returns to the family model home, where George Michael discovers him hiding in the attic. To protect his son from legal implications, Michael hides George Sr. in Gob&#x27;s prop Aztec Tomb, orchestrates a diversion, and tells the family that George Sr. has escaped once more. Throughout the rest of the season, Michael sneaks George Sr. provisions, and George Sr. keeps tabs on the Bluth family through the ventilation system. George Sr. also faces an onslaught from the outside world; the press begins looking for him in Iraq, fumigators surround the house while he&#x27;s still in the attic, and Kitty returns to steal a sample of his semen to make her own Bluth baby.

Buster meanwhile joins the army, but escapes serving in Iraq when his hand is bitten off by a loose seal (a play on &quot;Lucille&quot;) Gob had mistakenly trained to develop a taste for mammal flesh. Buster is refitted with a sharp hook, which he copes with poorly and often brandishes dangerously in social situations. During Buster&#x27;s long psychological recovery, he bonds with George Sr.&#x27;s stoner twin brother Oscar, who moves in with Lucille in an attempt to rekindle a past love affair. Uncle Oscar slowly reveals himself as Buster&#x27;s presumptive biological father. Eventually, George Sr. takes revenge on the adulterous Oscar and Lucille by kidnapping Oscar, knocking him unconscious, exchanging appearances with him, and sending him to prison in his place.

Lindsay and Tobias continue their disastrous open relationship. Lindsay tries—but fails—to secure a lover, while Tobias paints himself blue each night in a futile attempt to join the Blue Man Group. When Lindsay kicks him out of the house, Tobias disguises himself as a singing British nanny named &quot;Mrs. Featherbottom&quot; (an idea he gets from the film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;) so he can watch over his daughter Maeby. The family sees right through this incompetent disguise, but they humor Tobias since—in the guise of Mrs. Featherbottom—he does their chores.

George Michael begins dating a deeply religious girl, Ann Veal, who encourages him to smash pop music CDs and to run for student body president against perennial favorite Steve Holt. Michael dislikes her and tries to disrupt the kids&#x27; relationship, most notably by breaking up Ann and George Michael&#x27;s pre-engagement. Meanwhile, Maeby cons her way into an after school job as a film studio executive. When Maeby&#x27;s studio remakes &quot;Les Cousins Dangereux&quot;, George Michael abandons Ann to pursue his crush on Maeby. Maeby herself realises she has feelings for George Michael in light of his relationship, and the two kiss while the living room of the model home collapses.

=== Season 3 (2005–06) ===
Michael again searches for his runaway father, George Sr. Gob receives an invitation to a father/son reunion outing, and believes it to be George Sr. trying to contact him. In reality, the invitation was meant to reunite Gob with Steve Holt, son of Eve Holt, a girl Gob slept with in high school. Meanwhile, George Michael and Maeby deal with their previous kiss by avoiding each other.

In an attempt to remain in disguise, George Sr. joins the Blue Man Group. Michael discovers this and arranges to have his father placed under house arrest. George Sr. claims that he was set up by an underground British group. Michael goes to Wee Britain, a fictional British-themed city district, to investigate, and in the process meets a new love interest, Rita Leeds (Charlize Theron). Michael and the audience are led to believe that Rita is a mole for the underground British group, working for a man named &quot;Mr. F&quot;. However, love-struck Michael proposes to her, and the couple run off to wed. Finally, it is revealed that Rita is actually an &quot;MRF&quot;, or &quot;mentally retarded female&quot;. Despite Rita&#x27;s &quot;condition&quot;, the family pushes him to go forward with the marriage because Rita is wealthy and they want her money. Michael is not persuaded and gently ends the relationship just as he and Rita are about to walk down the aisle. Meanwhile, Tobias and Lindsay seek legal help from Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio) concerning their troubled marriage.

With the family&#x27;s retainer used up because of Lindsay&#x27;s and Tobias&#x27;s advances, Bob Loblaw chooses to no longer represent the Bluth family. Attorney Jan Eagleman offers to represent the family, on the condition that they participate in a mock trial in a new reality courtroom show called &quot;Mock Trial with J. Reinhold&quot;. Musical accompaniment for the show&#x27;s theme song and perceived jokes from testifying witnesses is provided by &quot;William Hung And His Hung Jury&quot;. Michael uses an illegal threat from prosecutor Wayne Jarvis to have the mock case &quot;dismissed&quot;. Gob and Franklin briefly appear in another courtroom show presided over by Bud Cort. Meanwhile, Maeby and George Michael perform a mock wedding for Alzheimer&#x27;s patients that is accidentally conducted by a real priest; the two become legally married.

The family members are afraid to testify at the mock trial and at the real deposition; Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake entering rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a USO Tour in Iraq. The deceptions are all uncovered by the prosecution, and in Iraq Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and paid for by the CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all of the charges against George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby&#x27;s sixteenth birthday.

To celebrate their victory in Iraq, the Bluths throw a shareholders&#x27; party on the . During preparation for the party, it is revealed that Lindsay was adopted, meaning that George Michael and Maeby are not blood relatives. At the party, the Bluth&#x27;s other adopted child, Annyong, reappears. He reveals that he is there to avenge the Bluth family&#x27;s theft of his grandfather&#x27;s frozen banana idea and the cause of his subsequent deportation, an event orchestrated many years earlier by Lucille Bluth. Annyong has turned over evidence implicating Lucille in the Bluth Company&#x27;s accounting scandals. Before the police arrive, Michael and George Michael flee on Gob&#x27;s yacht, &quot;The C-Word&quot;, and depart to Cabo with half a million dollars in cashier&#x27;s checks, finally leaving the family to fend for themselves. However, it is revealed in the epilogue that George Sr. is also on the yacht, having lured his brother Oscar into taking his place once again. Also in the epilogue, Maeby tries to sell the television rights to the story of the Bluth family to Ron Howard, who tells her that he sees it as a movie rather than a series.

=== Season 4 (2013) ===
Filming for a fourth season to be released on Netflix began on August 7, 2012, more than six years after the series had been canceled by Fox. The season consists of 15 new episodes, all debuting at the same time on Netflix on May 26, 2013, in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latin America, and the Nordic countries. Several actors who had recurring roles in the original series returned to reprise their roles, including Carl Weathers as himself, Henry Winkler as Barry Zuckerkorn, Ben Stiller as Tony Wonder, Mae Whitman as Ann Veal, Scott Baio as Bob Loblaw, Judy Greer as Kitty Sanchez, and Liza Minnelli as Lucille Austero; while new characters are played by Debra Mooney, John Slattery, Tommy Tune, Terry Crews, Isla Fisher and John Krasinski. Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen appear as Lucille and George Sr., respectively, in flashbacks.

All episodes of the season occur over approximately the same stretch of time, but each focuses on a different character. Information on events depicted in a given episode is often partial and filled in during a later episode.
Creator Mitch Hurwitz created a recut of season four called &quot;Arrested Development Season 4 Remix: Fateful Consequences&quot;, in which the season&#x27;s story is presented in chronological order. The recut consists of 22 episodes and was released May 3, 2018, on Netflix.

=== Season 5 (2018–19) ===

The fifth season revolves around the mystery of who killed Lucille Austero with the lead suspect being Buster.

Netflix confirmed on May 17, 2017, that a fifth season featuring the full cast had been ordered. The fifth season includes 16 episodes; the first eight were released on May 29, 2018, and the remaining eight episodes premiered on March 15, 2019.

== Reception ==

=== Television ratings ===
The show, while critically acclaimed, did not gain a sizable audience. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the show&#x27;s first season was the 120th most popular show among households and the 88th among viewers aged 18 to 49, averaging 6.2 million viewers.

U.S. ratings in the second season averaged about six million viewers, while the third season averaged about four million viewers. Fox announced that it would halt the production of the second season at eighteen episodes—four episodes short of the planned season.

For the third season, Fox positioned the show on Mondays at 8:00 p.m. ET. Ratings dropped further than previous seasons. On November 9, 2005, Fox announced that the show would not be airing in November sweeps, and that they had cut the episode order for the third season from 22 to 13. Fox ended up showing the last four episodes in a two-hour timeslot—directly opposite the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics. The series finale episode received 3.43 million viewers.

=== Critical response ===

==== Original run ====
Throughout its original run, &quot;Arrested Development&quot; received critical acclaim. It is widely regarded as one of the defining shows of the 2000s and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest comedies of all time. In 2007, the show was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;Time&quot;&quot;.

Tim Stack of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the series, saying &quot;Is it beating a dead horse to once again state that this underappreciated gem is the best sitcom on TV? Too bad. &quot;Arrested Development&quot; is the best sitcom on TV!&quot;

David Bianculli from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; stated &quot;If you&#x27;re not watching this series on Fox, the least you can do is buy it on DVD. You&#x27;ll love it, and it&#x27;s such a dense show (in the best sense of the word) that it rewards repeated viewing. Like &quot;Scrubs&quot; and the British version of &quot;The Office&quot;, it is the sort of show that truly deserves to be seen uninterrupted, several episodes at a time, for maximum enjoyment. The laughs-per-minute quotient here is insanely high, making it great value as a home library purchase.&quot;

Alison Powell of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said &quot;As Hollywood agents worry about the demise of the town&#x27;s lowing cash cow, the multi-camera, staged sitcom, here to save the day is &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, a farce of such blazing wit and originality, that it must surely usher in a new era in comedy.&quot;

Gillian Flynn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Arrested Development&quot; the best television show of 2005 and said in her review that &quot;As oddball as &quot;Arrested&quot; is, it&#x27;s also humane. A flawless cast—from Will Arnett&#x27;s breathy, bombastic Gob to Jessica Walter&#x27;s boozy Lucille—grounds it, aided by Ron Howard&#x27;s affable narration. The center of sensibility is good son Michael (Jason Bateman) and his even better son, George Michael (Michael Cera). Bateman and Cera give the best reacts around—the former all weary exasperation, the latter adorably bunny-stunned. Together, they&#x27;re the sweetest, awkwardest straight men on the smartest, most shockingly funny series on TV ... which is likely canceled, despite six Emmy wins. It&#x27;s a perversion not even the Bluths deserve.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the show at No. 2 in the &quot;25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years&quot;, praising its &quot;fast, delirious, interlocking jokes that don&#x27;t pander to the masses; winky gags (e.g. fake preview scenes for the following week&#x27;s episode); and a cast of absurd characters&quot;. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it No. 16 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

==== Revival ====
The 2018–2019 revival of the show was met with critical disappointment.

== Controversies ==
=== Lawsuit ===
In November 2003, the producers of the show were sued by the hip hop group Arrested Development over the alleged use of their name. Rapper Speech from the group said &quot;The use of our name by Fox is not only confusing to the public, but also has the potential to significantly dilute what the &#x27;Arrested Development&#x27; name means to our fans&quot;. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed sum. This incident was alluded to in the episode &quot;Motherboy XXX&quot;. The narrator claims the show is &quot;legally required to make a distinction&quot; between the &quot;Motherboy&quot; event happening in the episode and a band called &quot;Motherboy&quot;.

===Tambor&#x27;s misconduct===
In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in May 2018, Tambor apologized for actions that led to sexual misconduct accusations against him by co-workers on the TV show &quot;Transparent&quot;, and mentioned one &quot;blowup&quot; he had with co-star Jessica Walter during production of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Walter was asked about the incident during a cast interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She became emotional, stating that &quot;in almost 60 years of working, I&#x27;ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set and it&#x27;s hard to deal with, but I&#x27;m over it now ... [Tambor] never crossed the line on our show, with any, you know, sexual whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize. I have to let it go.&quot;

Bateman stated that &quot;in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, &#x27;difficult&#x27; ... [acting] is a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.&quot; Tony Hale said that &quot;we all have bad moments&quot;, while David Cross suggested that Tambor&#x27;s outbursts were a &quot;cumulative effect.&quot; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; criticized Cross&#x27;s comment as suggesting that Walter had &quot;asked for it.&quot; Shawkat came to Walter&#x27;s defense, saying that being difficult &quot;doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s acceptable&quot; to treat someone badly. After outlets criticized the men&#x27;s statements, Hale, Bateman, and Cross issued apologies to Walter. Netflix cancelled the show&#x27;s UK press tour. Cera, who was not part of the group interview, stated that &quot;obviously I have to give a lot of consideration to whether I take jobs with anyone and think about how it affects people&quot;.

<doc id="496021" wikidata="Q212136" url="?curid=496021" title="Horst (geology)">
<text>In physical geography and geology, a horst is a raised fault block bounded by normal faults. Horsts are typically found together with grabens. While a horst is lifted or remains stationary, the grabens on either side subside. This is often caused by extensional forces pulling apart the crust. Horsts may represent features such as plateaus, mountains, or ridges on either side of a valley. Horsts can range in size from small fault blocks up to large regions of stable continent that have not been folded or warped by tectonic forces.

The word &quot;Horst&quot; in German means &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;heap&quot; and was first used in the geological sense in 1883 by Eduard Suess in &quot;The Face of the Earth.&quot;

== Geomorphology ==
Horsts may have either symmetrical or asymmetrical cross-sections. If the normal faults to either side have similar geometry and are moving at the same rate, the horst is likely to be symmetrical and roughly flat on top. If the faults on either side have different rates of vertical motion, the top of the horst will most likely be inclined and the entire profile will be asymmetrical. Erosion also plays a significant role in how symmetrical a horst appears in cross-section.

== Horsts and hydrocarbon exploration ==
Horsts can form structural petroleum traps. In many rift basins around the world, the vast majority of discovered hydrocarbons are found in conventional traps associated with horsts. For example, much of the petroleum found in the Sirte Basin, Libya (of the order of tens of billions of barrels of reserves) are found on large horst blocks such as the Zelten Platform and the Dahra Platform and on smaller horsts such as the Gialo High.

== Examples ==
The Vosges Mountains in France and Black Forest in Germany are examples of horsts, as are the Table, Jura, the Dole mountains and the Rila – Rhodope Massif including the well defined horsts of Belasitsa (linear horst), Rila mountain (vaulted domed shaped horst) and Pirin mountain – a horst forming a massive anticline situated between the complex graben valleys of Struma and that of Mesta.

Larger areas where the continent remains stable with horizontal table-land stratification can be considered horsts, such as the Russian Plain, Arabia, India and Central South Africa. This is in distinction to folded regions such as some mountain chains of Eurasia.

The Midcontinent Rift System in North America is marked by a series of horsts extending from Lake Superior to Kansas.

The Rwenzori Mountains in the East African Rift are an upthrown fault block, and are the highest non-volcanic, non-orogenic mountains in the world.

The Vosges Mountains in France were formed by isostatic uplift in response to the opening of the Rhine Graben, a major extensional basin.

<doc id="496022" wikidata="Q5036770" url="?curid=496022" title="Captain Pugwash">
<text>Captain Pugwash is a fictional pirate who appears in a series of British children’s comic strips, books and television shows created by John Ryan.

The eponymous hero – Captain Horatio Pugwash – sails the high seas in his ship called the &quot;Black Pig&quot;, assisted by cabin boy Tom, pirates Willy and Barnabas, and Master Mate. His mortal enemy is Cut-Throat Jake, captain of the &quot;Flying Dustman&quot;.

==History==
At John Ryan’s wedding in 1950, he was introduced by a friend to Marcus Morris, who was launching &quot;Eagle&quot;, and asked the artist to create a strip for it. When John returned home, he claimed that &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; appeared without explanation. It ran for the first nineteen issues of &quot;Eagle&quot;, but was dropped due to being considered too childish, and John replaced it with &quot;Harris Tweed&quot;.

The first &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; picture book, subtitled &quot;A Pirate Story&quot; and featuring Tom’s debut, was rejected by twelve publishers until The Bodley Head picked it up in 1957. The book became successful, and was translated around the world. That same year, the BBC commissioned it to be adapted into an animated short film, made using &quot;captions&quot;. This was a form of cutout animation that involved levers attached to the back of characters.

All the voices were provided by Peter Hawkins, who had to be hidden behind a monitor due to his facial expressions made while recording being too distracting for the animators. What this did mean was that he could write notes in his script about incidental characters and be reminded of them as they appeared onscreen. Further short films would be produced and broadcast until 1966, and in 1960 a popular and regularly released Radio Times strip was launched to promote the series, running until 1965. In 1974 a new colour series was commissioned, with Peter Hawkins reprising his roles, and wider-reaching than its sporadically produced predecessor. Six of its 30 episodes were remakes of black-and-white shorts, as were six of the books.

In 1997, John Ryan licensed the franchise to John Cary Films, followed by The Britt Allcroft Company purchasing the rights to the character, with the intention of producing a revival series. The new series of 26 episodes, animated traditionally, aired in 1998.

A related book by John Ryan is &quot;Admiral Fatso Fitzpugwash&quot;, in which it is revealed that Pugwash had a medieval ancestor who was First Sea Lord but was terrified of water.

==Characters==
===Captain Pugwash===
The pompous but likeable captain of the &quot;Black Pig&quot;. Although he boasts of being the &quot;bravest buccaneer&quot;, he is actually quite cowardly and stupid. His greed often gets him into trouble. Nevertheless, he usually wins the day – either with the help of Tom the Cabin Boy or by sheer luck. Despite being a pirate, he is rarely seen committing any acts of piracy.

===The Mate/Master Mate/Mr. Mate===
A somewhat dopey character, who has a tendency to use malapropisms and to mispronounce common words. He has a teddy bear in his bunk and is quite mild-mannered. It is not entirely clear why he is the mate, as he does not appear to have any authority over the rest of the crew. He was present in the first ever Pugwash story, in which he was depicted as being constantly sleepy. Pugwash&#x27;s adenoidal pronunciation of Master Mate&#x27;s name appears to be the main source of the urban legend about characters&#x27; sexually suggestive names.

===Barnabas===
The most aggressive of the pirates, but in reality just as harmless. He is quite rebellious and grumpy, and is perhaps marginally more intelligent than Willy, the Mate or the Captain. He was not present in the 1998 series.

===Willy===
A simple sailor from Wigan. He appears to be the youngest crew member (apart from Tom). He is against using violence, and has been the crew&#x27;s saviour on occasion (more by luck than by design).

===Tom the Cabin Boy===
It might be argued that without Tom, Pugwash would have been sunk long ago. He is the most intelligent and resourceful member of the crew, the only one who can cook and the only one who can actually sail a ship. Although Pugwash never admits it, Tom&#x27;s ability to think up schemes is probably the only thing that prevents him from being a total failure as a pirate, though Tom is never angry at him stealing the spotlight. The rest of the crew also found they were unable to operate without Tom, after he left with the captain when the crew mutinied. Tom is an expert concertina player, despite this being a 19th-century anachronism for an 18th-century pirate, and part of his repertoire is &quot;The Trumpet Hornpipe&quot; (the &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; theme).

He was portrayed with a Home Counties accent in the first television adaptation, and with an Irish accent in the 1998 series.

===Cut-Throat Jake===
Captain Pugwash&#x27;s fearsome arch-enemy, captain of the &quot;Flying Dustman&quot; (a pun on the Flying Dutchman combined with a reference to the occupation of dustman). When he is not scheming to bring about Pugwash&#x27;s downfall, he is a rather more competent pirate than his enemy, and always seems to have plenty of treasure. He speaks with a stereotypical West Country accent, and is easily recognisable by his eye patch and enormous black beard.

===Characters added in the 1998 series===
* Jonah
This character replaced pirate Barnabas, who was in the earlier series. His catchphrase is &quot;No good will come of this, mark my words!&quot; Jonah appears to be of Jamaican origin. He is the tallest of the crew so he often hits his head on the ceiling of the ship&#x27;s lower deck. He is also one of the strongest of the crew as he is the &quot;Black Pig&quot;&#x27;s carpenter.
* Governor of Portobello
This character lives at the top of the island in a mansion covered in vines. He talks very quietly and his head of guard, Lt. Scratchwood, usually acts as a megaphone. He is deeply in love with Donna Bonanza and attends to her every need.
* Donna Bonanza
An infamous opera singer who is the love of the Governor of Portobello and has her own group of security guards. She owns a cat named Franco.
* Toni
Tom the Cabin Boy’s best friend, who works for barber Betty, and has dreams of becoming a member of the &quot;Black Pig&quot;.
* Dook 
A member of Jake’s crew who somewhat resembles Barnabas, but is less aggressive in the 1998 series. This character appeared in the original series, but was never named. 
* Swine
An Australian pirate who works for Jake. He almost always has a mug of grog in his hand. Like Dook, he appeared in the original series but was unnamed. 
* Stinka
A Mexican who works for Jake, who sometimes finds him annoying. Again, this character was unnamed in the earlier series.
* Jake’s Mum
The mother of Cut-Throat Jake, who serves as the &quot;Flying Dustman&quot;’s cook. 
* Lieutenant Scratchwood Toddington
The voice for the governor and the law for the town of Portobello. In charge of the guard and collecting taxes, he also spends his time chasing thieves.
* Rook
Portobello’s merchant, who sometimes works for Cut-Throat Jake.

=== Libel case regarding &quot;double entendres&quot; ===
In 1991, the &quot;Pugwash&quot; cartoonist John Ryan successfully sued the &quot;Sunday Correspondent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspapers for inaccurately claiming that some &quot;Pugwash&quot; character names were &quot;double entendres&quot;.

==Pugwashisms==
Captain Pugwash is renowned for his exclamations, owing something to the style of Captain Haddock in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;:

* &quot;Dolloping doubloons/dolphins!&quot;
* &quot;Coddling catfish!&quot;
* &quot;Lolloping landlubbers!&quot;
* &quot;Suffering seagulls!&quot;
* &quot;Staggering stalactites!&quot;
* &quot;Nautical nitwits!&quot;
* &quot;Plundering porpoises!&quot;
* &quot;Kipper me capstans!&quot;
* &quot;Tottering turtles!&quot;
* &quot;Dithering dogfish!&quot;
* &quot;Scuttling cuttlefish!&quot;
* &quot;Stuttering starfish!&quot;
* &quot;Blistering barnacles!&quot;
* &quot;Shuddering sharks!&quot;

Cut-Throat Jake has occasionally been known to utter the similar exclamation, &quot;Scupper me skull-and-crossbones!&quot;

== Theme music ==
The series&#x27; signature tune was the &quot;Trumpet Hornpipe&quot;, a folk dance that dates to at least the early nineteenth century. Some early versions of the tune refer to it as &quot;Lascelles Hornpipe&quot; and &quot;Baloon Hornpipe&quot;. The composer and country of origin are unknown.

The original black-and-white episodes of &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; used a solo rendition by the accordionist Tom Edmondson, who had learned the tune from watching Jimmy Shand&#x27;s band in Northumberland as a teenager. Edmondson&#x27;s version was recorded in the front room of his home in Harbottle, Northumberland, on 12 July 1954. The recording was made by the folklorist Peter Kennedy as part of the BBC&#x27;s Folk Music and Dialect Recording Scheme and Edmondson was paid £1.50 (30s) for his efforts. The track was transferred to disc for the BBC Sound Library and, according to John Ryan, it was later chosen as the &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; theme by &quot;a genius at the BBC&quot;, whose name he could not remember.

For the colour &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; episodes, a new recording of the &quot;Trumpet Hornpipe&quot; was commissioned from Johnny Pearson in 1973. This version used accordion, bass and acoustic guitar, and the finished piece was retitled &quot;Shipshape&quot;. The recording was published by KPM and was later added to the KPM Recorded Music Library which gave Pearson the composer credit. Pearson’s arrangement of the theme is also used as the goal theme for Fleetwood Town FC.

For the 1998 series, a new arrangement of the theme was created by Philip Lane. Another arrangement appears in the audiobook versions.

The Trumpet Hornpipe itself is in the code of BBC Micro computer game &quot;Frak!&quot; and Acorn Electron game &quot;Zalaga&quot;, intended to be played when a pirated version of the game was loaded, a reference to &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot;.

==Planned film==
In May 2017, a live-action film adaptation was announced, to be directed by John Hay, produced by Atticus Films and starring Nick Frost as Captain Pugwash and Jason Flemyng in an unknown role. Production was set to begin in 2018, with the plot following Captain Pugwash travelling to Botany Bay, where he eventually finds himself at the helm of &quot;The Black Pig&quot; on a mission to rescue Tom the Cabin Boy&#x27;s father, who is marooned on a volcanic island. In March 2021, Frost said that he believes the film will be unlikely to be produced because of budget issues, however the following year Isabel Ryan, daughter of creator John, said she wants the film to have the involvement of Rye.

== Stage adaptations ==
On 17 December 1973, a theatre show, &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot;, written by Ryan and John Kennett, opened at the King&#x27;s Road Theatre in Chelsea, London. Directed by John Ingram and designed by John Marsh, the entertainment for children played twelve performances a week (twice daily, Monday to Saturday) until 12 January 1974. Edward Philips as Pugwash headed a cast of live actors playing characters including Tom and Cut-Throat Jake. The following year a second play was performed, entitled &quot;Captain Pugwash and the Inca Treasure&quot;, from 19 December 1974 to 18 January 1975. In 2008 a new show was performed with Richard Alan in the title role.

== In popular culture ==
In a 1990 episode of &quot;The 8.15 from Manchester&quot;, Captain Pugwash was a special guest.

In a 2002 issue of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Pugwash and Tom the Cabin Boy attended The Pirates’ Conference, alongside Captain Clegg of &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, Long John Silver and Captain Hook.

Ed Hartwell’s 2005 short film &quot;Time Looters&quot; was made using a similar &quot;caption&quot; style of cutouts. All the voices were provided by Joe Grossi, in a similar way to Peter Hawkins.

In a 2006 &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot; sketch, Robert Webb criticises the 1974-1975 series, however he finds he is sitting next to the cardboard cutout who played Pugwash.

In a 2007 &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; sketch parodying BBC Two’s loss of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a ripoff entitled &quot;The Stimpsons&quot; was created, however the characters and their couch were quickly revealed to be Captain Pugwash, &quot;Mr. Benn&quot;, &quot;Charley the Cat&quot; and &quot;Bagpuss&quot;.

The Norwegian band &quot;Kaptein Kaliber&quot;, founded in 1996, was named after the Norwegian name for the character. Their first album in 1999 featured Pugwash on the cover, limited to twenty copies.

According to Isabel Ryan, her father John did not partake in merchandising unless somebody had created something for him. Waves of merchandise were first produced with the 1974 series, including badges, T-shirts, and jigsaw puzzles. In 1981, Corgi Toys produced a model of the &quot;Black Pig&quot;, complete with stand-up figures of Pugwash and Tom the Cabin Boy. John himself remarked that the franchise did not sell well in the United States due to the titular character being &quot;too innocuous&quot;. For the 1998 series, Vivid Imaginations created many more toys, including miniatures and plushies, both in eight inches and fourteen inches. Six inch Happy Meal plushies were also available as part of the &quot;Children’s Favourites&quot; line.

=== Home video releases ===
The first VHS release of the 1974 series was in 1982, courtesy of RPTA Video. The tape was also released on CED Videodisc. In 1987 Tempo Video released a new tape, which was also sold in Australia via Thorn EMI and the US via Family Home Entertainment.

Between 1990 and 1991 BBC Video released eighteen episodes across two tapes.

For the 1998 series, VCI Home Video released three tapes.

In 2005 HIT Entertainment released 6 episodes on DVD.

This was followed in 2006 by all 26 episodes across three discs exclusive to Australia, and in 2007 by a single release of all 30 episodes of the 1974 series.

<doc id="496028" wikidata="Q941023" url="?curid=496028" title="Eastern Time Zone">
<text>The Eastern Time Zone (ET) is a time zone encompassing part or all of 23 states in the eastern part of the United States, parts of eastern Canada, and the state of Quintana Roo in Mexico.

* Eastern Standard Time (EST) is five hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−05:00). Observed during standard time (late autumn/winter in the United States and Canada).
* Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is four hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−04:00). Observed during daylight saving time (spring/summer/early autumn in the United States and Canada).
On the second Sunday in March, at 2:00 a.m. EST, clocks are advanced to 3:00 a.m. EDT, creating a 23-hour day. On the first Sunday in November, at 2:00 a.m. EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00 a.m. EST, which results in a 25-hour day.

==History==
The boundaries of the Eastern Time Zone have moved westward since the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) took over time-zone management from railroads in 1938. The easternmost and northernmost counties in Kentucky were added to the zone in the 1940s, and in 1961 most of the state went Eastern. In 2000, Wayne County, on the Tennessee border, switched from Central to Eastern Time. Within the United States, the Eastern Time Zone is the most populous region, with nearly half of the country&#x27;s population.

In March 2019, the Florida Legislature passed a bill requesting authorization from Congress for year-round daylight saving time, which would effectively put Florida on Eastern Daylight Time year-round (except for west of the Apalachicola River, which would be on Central Daylight Time year-round). A similar bill was proposed for the Canadian province of Ontario by its legislative assembly in late 2020, which would have a similar effect on the province if passed.

==Daylight saving time==
For those in the United States, daylight saving time for the Eastern Time Zone was introduced by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which specified that daylight saving time would run from the last Sunday of April until the last Sunday in October. The act was amended to make the first Sunday in April the beginning of daylight saving time beginning in 1987.

Later, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended daylight saving time in the United States, beginning in 2007. Since then, local times change at 2:00 a.m. EST to 3:00 a.m. EDT on the second Sunday in March, and return from 2:00 a.m. EDT to 1:00 a.m. EST on the first Sunday in November.

In Canada, daylight saving time begins and ends on the same days and at the same times as it does in the United States.

==Canada==
In Canada, the following provinces and territories are part of the Eastern Time Zone: Within Canada, as with the United States, the Eastern Time Zone is the most populous time zone.
* Most of Ontario
* Most of Quebec
* Most of Nunavut

Most of Canada observes daylight saving time synchronously with the United States, with the exception of Saskatchewan, Yukon, and several other very localized areas. Southampton Island in Nunavut uses Eastern Standard Time throughout the year.

==United States==

The boundary between time zones is set forth in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations with the boundary between the Eastern and Central Time Zones being specifically detailed in Part 71.

Washington, D.C. and 17 states are located entirely within the Eastern Time Zone. They are:
* Connecticut
* Delaware
* Georgia
* Maine
* Maryland
* Massachusetts
* New Hampshire
* New Jersey
* New York
* North Carolina
* Ohio
* Pennsylvania
* Rhode Island
* South Carolina
* Vermont
* Virginia
* West Virginia
Five states are divided between the Eastern Time Zone and the Central Time Zone. The following locations observe Eastern Time:

* Florida: The majority of the state, including Big Bend regions east of the Apalachicola River and portions of Gulf County south of the Intracoastal Waterway
* Indiana: The majority of the state, except Northwest Indiana and the Evansville metropolitan area. 
* Kentucky: The eastern portion of the state, including its three largest metropolitan areas: Louisville, Lexington, and Northern Kentucky
* Michigan: The entire state except for the four Upper Peninsula counties that border Wisconsin: Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee
* Tennessee: All of East Tennessee including the major cities of Chattanooga, Knoxville and the Tri-Cities region, with the exception of Bledsoe, Cumberland, and Marion counties

Additionally, Phenix City, Alabama, and several nearby communities in Russell County, Alabama, unofficially observe Eastern Time. This is due to their close proximity to Columbus, Georgia, which is on Eastern Time. In addition Smiths Station in Lee County along with Valley and Lanett in Chambers County observe Eastern Time.

==Mexico==

* Quintana Roo: This is the only Mexican state to observe EST. It moved from Central Time to Eastern Time after a successful lobbying effort by tourism interests. Quintana Roo does not observe daylight saving time.

==Caribbean islands==
The Bahamas and Haiti officially observe both Eastern Standard Time during the winter months and Eastern Daylight Time during the summer months. Cuba generally follows the U.S. with Eastern Standard Time in the winter, and Eastern Daylight Time in the summer, but the exact day of change varies year to year. The Cayman Islands and Jamaica use Eastern Standard Time year-round.

===Turks and Caicos Islands===
The Turks and Caicos Islands followed Eastern Time with daylight saving until 2015, when the territory switched to the Atlantic Time Zone. The Turks and Caicos Islands switched back to the pre-2015 schedule in March 2018. A 2017 consultation paper highlighted the advantage for business and tourism of being in the same time zone as the eastern United States as an important factor in the decision.

<text>Arrested Development is an American hip hop group, that was formed in Atlanta in 1988. It was founded by Speech and Headliner as a positive, Afrocentric alternative to the gangsta rap popular in the late 1980s. Baba Oje and frontman Speech met at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee when they were both students.

== History ==
Arrested Development was formed in 1988 by rapper and producer Todd Thomas (&quot;Speech&quot;) and turntablist Timothy Barnwell (known as Headliner). The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of...&quot; was the number-one album in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s 1992 Pazz and Jop Critic&#x27;s Poll and in &quot;The Wire&quot;″s 1992 Critic&#x27;s choice. The group won two Grammy Awards in 1993: for Best New Artist, making them the first hip hop artist to win this award, and for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. They were also named Band of the Year by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The debut album sold over 6 million copies worldwide.

A few months later, the group was approached by film director, Spike Lee to compose a song for his upcoming biopic based on the life of Malcolm X. The group then recorded &quot;Revolution&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack for the film as well as the second half of its closing credits when the film was released in 1992.

Their 1994 follow-up, &quot;Zingalamaduni,&quot; sold poorly, and they broke up shortly after in 1996. The group reunited in 2000, touring and releasing records via Speech&#x27;s Vagabond Productions, but Aerle Taree did not return due to vocal problems. Today, Aerle is a poet and converted from Buddhism to Christianity. DJ Headliner started his own business named Creative Royalty Group. On 14 October 2010, Baba Oje had a stroke.

In November 2003, the group sued the Fox network over the name of the TV show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. The suit is referenced in the &quot;Arrested Development&quot; episodes &quot;Public Relations&quot;, &quot;Motherboy XXX&quot;, &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;, and &quot;For British Eyes Only&quot;.

In June 2005, the group won the first round of the television series contest, &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;, performing &quot;Tennessee&quot; and covering Los Lonely Boys&#x27; &quot;Heaven&quot; and donated the $20,000 proceeds to UNICEF.
The group&#x27;s follow-up to their 2004, &quot;Among The Trees&quot; was &quot;Since the Last Time&quot;, released internationally on 18 September 2006. &quot;Since the Last Time&quot; was released in the United States on 30 October 2007, on Vagabond Record &amp; Tapes, Speech&#x27;s boutique label.

In March 2007, they toured Australia as part of a triple-bill, along with Simple Minds and INXS. In 2008, Arrested Development teamed with The Black Eyed Peas and performed at The Concert for Peace in Jerusalem, Israel to promote peace among Palestinians and Israelis. Also in 2008, Arrested Development visited and sang with Debbie Peagler, an incarcerated survivor of domestic violence, and the inmate gospel choir that Peagler led at a California women&#x27;s prison. Their visit was meant to support Peagler&#x27;s legal battle for her release from prison and call attention to the plight of other victims of abuse and wrongful incarceration. The collaborative performance is included in Yoav Potash&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Crime After Crime&quot;.

In 2010, the group released their ninth album &quot;Strong&quot; under Vagabond Records and Tapes, and licensed to the Japanese record label Cutting Edge, on December 9, 2009, and had a top 10 hit in Japan with the single &quot;The World Is Changing&quot;. In an interview with Songfacts, Speech explained that the track &quot;Greener&quot; takes on the issue of climate change from the perspective of the African-American community.

On January 8, 2011, they performed with Emmylou Harris at the festival first night of the Sydney Festival in Sydney, Australia to 50,000 people. In August 2012, the group released its tenth album &quot;Standing at the Crossroads&quot;, recorded while touring internationally. The album, given away for free from the group&#x27;s official website, took a lo-fi approach and was recorded entirely on a Mac laptop. The same month, they announced a new tour throughout the United States and Australia to celebrate their 20th anniversary.

On October 9, 2016, Arrested Development performed at the Delicious Festival in South Africa. A line up that included The Jacksons, Macy Gray, De La Soul, Elements of Life, Roy Ayers and local food celebrities Reuben Riffel, and Sarah Graham. The next day, members of Arrested Development drove to an orphanage in Soweto, then paid homage to Nelson Mandela at his home.

In January 2018, Arrested Development performed on the Trumpet Awards television show.

Baba Oje died of leukemia on October 26, 2018. His age was reported to be 86 or 87.

In October 2018, Speech released &quot;The Nigga Factory&quot;, a three-part docuseries exploring themes of racism and Afrocentrism. Later that year, they also released the album &quot;Craft &amp; Optics&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;16 Bars&quot;, a documentary that follows prison inmates as they undertake musical projects, was made.

On September 5, 2019, Arrested Development was given an award from Black Music Honors, which acknowledges artists that have made a significant contribution to African-American music.

On December 11, 2023, the group released the song Hip Hop Saves Lives featuring Chuck D &amp; Grandmaster Caz. The record was produced by Configa.

<doc id="496037" wikidata="Q637125" url="?curid=496037" title="Floristry">
<text>Floristry is the production, commerce, and trade in flowers. It encompasses flower care and handling, floral design and arrangement, merchandising, production, display and flower delivery. Wholesale florists sell bulk flowers and related supplies to professionals in the trade. Retail florists offer fresh flowers and related products and services to consumers. The first flower shop in the United States opened prior to 1851.

Floristry concerns the cultivation of flowers as well as their arrangement and sale. Much of the raw material supplied for the floristry trade comes from the cut flowers industry. Florist shops, along with online stores, are the main flower-only outlets, but supermarkets, garden supply stores, and filling stations also sell flowers.

Floral design or floral arts is the art of creating flower arrangements in vases, bowls, baskets, or other containers, or making bouquets and compositions from cut flowers, foliages, herbs, ornamental grasses, and other plant materials. Often the terms &quot;floral design&quot; and &quot;floristry&quot; are considered synonymous. Florists are people who work with flowers and plants, generally at the retail level. Floristry differs from floristics, the study of distribution and relationships of plant species over geographic areas. Floristry also differs from horticulture, which more broadly relates to the cultivation of flowers and plants so they will remain fresh as long as possible, and would be desirable for purchase, which also involves knowledge of customers&#x27; requirements and expectations. The ability to create a variety of floral designs such as wreaths, bouquets, corsages, boutonnières/&#x27;buttonholes&#x27;, permanent arrangements, and other more complicated arrangements are also important.

Education, both formal and informal, is another significant segment of the floristry industry. Established floristry designers and artists impart their craft to students interested in floral design as hobby or career. Courses are generally available through community colleges, private post-secondary vocational schools, and professional florist trade associations.

In the Netherlands, the first horticultural college was founded in 1896 in Naaldwijk; the second horticultural college was founded in 1897 in Aalsmeer. In 1926, the first national professional qualification examinations in floristry were held in the Netherlands. The horticultural college in Aalsmeer celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1972 and in 1997 its 100th anniversary. Since 1926 is the horticultural college in Aalsmeer was called the Rijks Middelbare Tuinbouw School (RTMS). The first professional floristry education started at the RMTS in 1968. The first professor in floristry at the horticultural college in Aalsmeer was Mr. Theo Boerma. In 1972 Theo Boerma started teaching professional evening courses for the floristry diploma: vakdiploma Bloemist-Winkelier. In 1980 Theo Boerma and his wife José Boerma founded the first privately owned floristry school; Boerma Instituut International Floral Design School in Aalsmeer. The floristry diploma was recognized by the Dutch government until 1996. When the borders of Europe opened, the diploma was no longer needed but professional training for Dutch and international students is still organised by the Boerma Instituut.

The floristry business has a significant market in the corporate and social event world, as flowers play a large part in the decor of special events and meetings. Centerpieces, entryways, reception tables, bridal bouquets, wedding chuppahs, and stage sets are only a few examples of how flowers are used in the business and social event settings. Flowers are also traditionally used in ecclesiastical settings and their arrangement is often done by skilled church volunteers.

==Styles==
Many nations have their own style of floral arranging. This is dependent on what flower varieties are readily available, and the culture of the nation.

===Ikebana===
Today, florists in Japan also sell pre-arranged or done-while-you-wait ikebana. Ikebana is a style of floral design that originated in Japan. Best known for its simplicity of line and form, ikebana is a design style primarily practiced for personal enjoyment. It has three parts of alignment: heaven, man, and earth.

===English Garden===
English Garden style is traditionally an English form of floral design. Stems are placed in a radial fashion and feature abundant use of seasonal flowers and foliages. These designs are often done as low, tufted mounds, or taller vase arrangements that are all-sided (360°), and incorporate garden flowers like roses, gardenia, camellia, delphinium and peonies. The flowers are usually arranged with minimal space between the blooms and foliage is used to accent the flowers as these are the main feature.

===Modern/European Style===
Modern/European Style floristry involves contemporary, linear designs that highlight unique forms of both individual floral materials and of the designs themselves. Arrangements generally feature negative space and incorporate asymmetric placement of materials. The style stands in direct contrast to traditional radial arrangements such as English Garden. Modern designs are identified by their play on the space used between each bloom, which is often dramatic, and the play on the use of color and different textures, which can be quite experimental.

Modern/European Style designs often incorporate unique, exotic or tropical flowers such as bird of paradise, orchids, &quot;Anthurium&quot;, and &quot;Protea&quot; of the Caribbean and other exotic locals, but may also employ more common blossoms, such as Roses, Gerberas and lilies.

===Contemporary/Dutch Style===
Contemporary/Dutch Style designs also involve contemporary and linear designs. The Dutch designs use a lot of different kinds of greens are used in a natural way. The &quot;Dutch Garden&quot; style arrangement—started in the early 1980s—is a very good example of a Dutch style arrangement. Stones, bark and mosses are used in these designs.

===Australian Style===
Australian floral style is a harmonious blend of nature&#x27;s raw beauty and artistic expression. Drawing inspiration from the country&#x27;s diverse landscapes and native flora, this style encapsulates the essence of the land Down Under. With a focus on native flowers like banksias, eucalyptus, and Waratahs, Australian floral arrangements exude a distinctive rustic charm. The style often showcases a fusion of textures, colours, and shapes, mirroring the dynamic contrasts found in the Australian environment. Whether it&#x27;s a coastal-inspired arrangement echoing the tranquil shores or a bold creation capturing the vibrant hues of the outback, Australian floral style is a unique and captivating representation of the country&#x27;s natural riches.

==Significance of particular flowers==
Typically, a florist will organize flowers by season and holiday. Flowers have various different meanings in different cultures. The holidays and events for which flowers are used vary. Poppies are used to remember fallen soldiers only in Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries. People often prefer flowers that are associated with their ethnic group or country and the cultural meaning of the flower color strongly affects their choice and use. Colors convey different meanings to different groups so that, for example, various colors may be associated with luck or death or love. A flower such as a red rose might communicate love in some cultures, whereas in others, it might be considered indecent or simply puzzling. The vastly divergent attitudes to the color white can also lead to miscommunication and sometimes give offense. White, for example, represents death in many Asian cultures, whereas white is usually a symbol of purity and innocence in countries with a European heritage. Early Victorians, among others, developed an entire, comprehensive language of flowers sometimes referenced in the floral industry today.

== Role in personal relationships ==
Due to the rich and nuanced significance of different flowers and the myriad design possibilities using floral materials, it is hardly surprising that floral arrangements play a number of roles in personal relationships. They&#x27;re sent to express love, celebrate special occasions, offer condolences, and more.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2021, floristry became an even more important means of communicating with loved ones from a distance. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;in lieu of saying it in person, we&#x27;re all saying it with flowers.&quot; This has led to an increase in profit for the American floral industry; over 80% of respondents to a survey conducted by the Society of American Florists said their holiday sales had increased in 2020 compared with 2019.

== Fresh flower sources ==
There are usually three major sources of fresh flowers for retail florists: local growers, local wholesalers and flower auctions. The majority of these are supplied by specialist horticultural and cut flower suppliers.

Internationally there are hundreds of wholesale flower markets and auctions, the largest of which is located in Aalsmeer, the Netherlands: the Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer. Other major markets include the fledgling Dubai Flower Centre and the Ota Flower Market in Tokyo, Japan.

Within North America, Miami is considered to be the main distribution point for imported fresh flowers. Many local wholesalers purchase fresh flower stock from importers in Miami to resell to local florists in their areas. Wholesale flower districts are present in many North American cities such as New York, Boston, and Los Angeles, San Francisco and Carlsbad, California. Flower auctions are run using the Dutch clock system and are mainly located in Canada: Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

==Floristry shops==
In the Netherlands gardeners started to sell flower arrangements from around 1850. In 1851 Butz Flowers opened its doors in New Castle, Pennsylvania, and is still operating today as one of the oldest floristry shops in the United States. Soon after, around 1900, the first flower shops started to open in The Netherlands. At that time the flower shops also had small greenhouses from which they sold their flowers.

Generally, a florist&#x27;s shop will contain a large array of flowers, sometimes displayed on the street, or will have a large plate glass window to display the flowers. To keep them fresh, the flowers will be refrigerated and kept in water, generally in glass or plastic vases or other containers. Most shops have a refrigerator/chiller cabinet/cooler near the front of the shop/store with large glass doors so that customers can easily view the contents. Some shops also have another cooler out of the customers&#x27; view where they keep extra stock and arrangements for customers&#x27; orders. Most stores have a separate work room in which the design florist or designers can work on orders with more privacy.

The flowers sold in florist shops typically represent the varieties abundantly available in the season but also include blossoms flown in from around the world. Basic varieties in temperate latitudes include roses, tulips, irises, orchids and lilies. Fashion sometimes plays a role in floristry; what is considered the flower that everyone needs to have today can change very quickly.

Some shops also stock gift baskets, fruits, and chocolates as well as flowers, whereas some shops will purchase these things only when needed for an order. Floral business is seasonal and is heavily influenced by the following holidays and events: Christmas, Valentine&#x27;s Day, Administrative Professionals&#x27; Day, Mothers&#x27; Day, All Souls Day, Advent, Easter, weddings and funerals. These occasions make up the largest part of the business, with the sale of house plants and home decor being a smaller, but more constant, part. Flowers for personal enjoyment as well as those selected to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, thank-yous and get well wishes are also a significant portion of a florist&#x27;s business.

==Supermarket flowers==

Cut flowers are widely sold in supermarkets and petrol stations. These outlets offer a limited selection, usually in the form of mixed bouquets and roses by the dozen. Flowers purchased at these outlets are generally less expensive than the flowers purchased at a florist shop. Professional florists may offer a greater selection, higher flower quality, or more skillfully arranged flowers.

==Technology==
In the United States, the number of florists has dropped since a peak of over 27,000 in 1992 to fewer than 20,000 in 2007. The World Wide Web has contributed to this decline by making alternatives more accessible.

Floral wire services play an intermediary by gathering orders to be fulfilled by local florists. Floral wire services take a percentage of customers order value for orders provided through their websites and additional fees for the transmission of orders to local florists.

Few companies ship flowers direct to the consumer. ProFlowers, Interflora, Teleflora, FTD typically function as &quot;order gatherers&quot; and will work with local florists to have the order delivered.

Floral foam is a foam used by florists to fixate flower stems for storage and delivery. It usually consists of phenol-formaldehyde plastic. Due to an additional treatment with detergents, the substance can soak up water and increase the longevity of arranged flowers. Floral foam is non-biodegradable, non-recyclable and toxic for both humans and animals.

<text>This is a list of locomotives including notable locomotives that are preserved in museums or in heritage railways. For a list of locomotive types or models, please see List of locomotive classes.

A list of locomotive classes that have a corresponding Wikipedia article. A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload, it is usually referred to as a multiple unit, motor coach, railcar or power car; the use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter).

Following is a mix of individual locomotives and of locomotive classes or models, organized by company.

For a list of preserved locomotives, such as those in museums, see List of preserved locomotives in the United States and List of preserved locomotives in Canada.

<doc id="496055" wikidata="Q7289550" url="?curid=496055" title="Ramification problem">
<text>In philosophy and artificial intelligence (especially, knowledge based systems), the ramification problem is concerned with the indirect consequences of an action. It might also be posed as &quot;how to represent what happens implicitly due to an action&quot; or how to control the secondary and tertiary effects of an action. It is strongly connected to, and is opposite the qualification side of, the frame problem.

Limit theory helps in operational usage. For instance, in KBE derivation of a populated design (geometrical objects, etc., similar concerns apply in shape theory), equivalence assumptions allow convergence where potentially large, and perhaps even computationally indeterminate, solution sets are handled deftly. Yet, in a chain of computation, downstream events may very well find some types of results from earlier resolutions of ramification as problematic for their own algorithms.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Ribon&quot; from 1991 to 1994, with its chapters collected in eight volumes. An original video animation (OVA), animated by Group TAC and directed by Hiroko Tokita, was released in 1994.

==Plot==
Midori Saejima is a first-year high school student at the newly established Hijiri Gakuen. She is persuaded by her classmates to run for student council, and she becomes eager to apply once she realizes that Akira Sudō, a mysterious boy to whom she is attracted, is also running for student council. Akira and Midori are elected president and vice-president respectively, along with Bunta Kōno, Yūko Mamiya, and Shūichi Takigawa as other officers.

Though Midori and Akira quickly develop a close relationship, Midori learns that he has been romantically attracted to Hiroko Maki, her favorite art teacher, since middle school. Akira reveals that while Hiroko remains an important person in his life, she is already romantically involved with his tutor, Masashi Sakamoto. Akira eventually reciprocates Midori&#x27;s feelings and they begin dating. However, after Hiroko and Masashi break up, Midori suggests to Akira that they too should break up once she notices he is unable to prioritize her over Hiroko.

After their break-up, Midori begins dating Ken Nakagawa, a musician and friend from middle school, but she realizes she cannot love anyone but Akira and ends their relationship. Before she is able to reconcile with Akira, he suddenly takes a three-month leave of absence from school to search for Masashi abroad. While traveling in France, Akira calls Midori and admits he is in love with her, and the two resolve their relationship. Midori later learns Akira decided to look for Masashi in order to find closure with his complicated feelings towards Hiroko, as well as the fact that he had discovered Masashi is his half-brother.

Once Akira locates Masashi in India, the two return to Japan. Hiroko and Masashi get married and decide to travel abroad, with Hiroko quitting her teaching job. Akira decides to enter a preparatory college to eventually take over his father&#x27;s company, while the rest of their classmates make plans for after high school graduation. Midori decides to enter a 4-year art college and eventually becomes an art teacher at Hijiri Gakuen.

She falls in love with Akira on her first day of high school and runs for student council, eventually becoming vice president. Yazawa wrote Midori to be a popular girl at school to appeal to her reader demographic. She wrote Midori to be a &quot;kind&quot; and &quot;good girl&quot; comparable to an &quot;angel&quot;, but she also aimed to depict her as a &quot;human girl&quot; where she has moments where she is naturally not like that to avoid making her appealing solely to her readers.
:

After creating a &quot;refreshing&quot; male lead for her previous work, &quot;Marine Blue no Kaze ni Dakarete&quot;, Yazawa decided to create Akira as the opposite, with him having a &quot;tough&quot; but &quot;kind&quot; personality with a &quot;dark side.&quot; Yazawa also wanted to draw a character with a pompadour hairstyle, having been a fan of Eikichi Yazawa and James Dean.

==Media==
===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa, &quot;Tenshi Nanka ja Nai&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Ribon&quot; from the September 1991 to the November 1994 issues. While conceptualizing the series, Yazawa debated on the story centered on a rockabilly band or a student council. While she settled for a student council at the recommendation of her editor, the band concept would later be reused for &quot;Nana&quot; in 2000. Yazawa also stated that she was asked by her editor to make her female characters more &quot;attractive&quot; and was also faced with the challenge of creating a story that would draw in &quot;Ribon&quot;&#x27;s reader demographic of elementary school girls. After consulting people for suggestions on the main character, Yazawa was given feedback that children project themselves onto the main character, and that if she made the main character a popular girl at school, the target audience might find interest with it. Yazawa then decided to draw a school life story that people would be &quot;entertained&quot; by. The title came from a random phrase Yazawa pieced together that she felt expressed the main character, Midori, which she aimed to depict as a &quot;proper human girl&quot; who, while she was a &quot;kind&quot; and &quot;good girl&quot; that was &quot;like an angel&quot;, also naturally had moments where she is &quot;not like that all the time.&quot; Chapter 29 shows a cameo appearance of characters from &quot;Marine Blue no Kaze ni Dakarete&quot;, Yazawa&#x27;s previous work.

Shueisha collected its chapters in eight volumes, released from May 15, 1992, to March 15, 1995. The series was republished in a four-volume edition in 2000, and a six-volume edition from 2008 to 2009. A five-volume &quot;reorganized&quot; version was released in 2019.

<doc id="496060" wikidata="Q1377821" url="?curid=496060" title="Shingo Katori">
<text>is a Japanese actor, singer, television host, radio personality. He was the youngest member of SMAP, one of the best-selling boy band in Asia. 

==Early life==
Katori was born in Yokohama, Kanagawa and moved to Tokyo to pursue his career. He has one younger brother.

==Career as a pop star==
===Music===

In 1987, at age 10, Katori auditioned for Johnny &amp; Associates, a Japanese talent agency that recruits and trains young boys, preteens to teens, to become singers and members of boy bands. After five of the other band members auditioning individually from 1986 through 1987, in autumn 1987, twenty boys, from ages ten to seventeen, were put together into a group called The Skate Boys, which was initially created as backup dancers for a famous boy band, Hikaru Genji. In April 1988, producer Johnny Kitagawa chose six out of the twenty boys to create a new boy band and named them &quot;SMAP&quot;.

After SMAP’s disbandment on 31 December 2016, Katori has been pursuing his solo career. He left Johnny &amp; Associates on 9 September 2017, together with two other SMAP members, Goro Inagaki and Tsuyoshi Kusanagi and entered CULEN, a Japanese talent agency. On 22 September 2017, they launched a new project, &quot;atarashiichizu&quot; (&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;New Map&quot;) as their common fan site, supported by various Japanese leading creators. Since then, Katori has been extending his activities also into artistic fields.

On January 1, 2020, Katori released his first solo album, entitled &quot;20200101&quot;. The album features songs written by Katori, as well as collaborations with artists such as TeddyLoid, BiSH, Kreva, Kishidan, and Scha Dara Parr, and more. The album is said to be a celebration of the year 2020, with both the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics were scheduled to be held during that year. In 2021, Katori held his first solo concert entitled &quot;Sakura Saku Rekishi Aru Meijiza de 20200101 ni Wani Wa Waiwai Katori Shingo&quot;, at the Meiji-za from April 4, 2021, to April 29, 2021. Katori also live streamed the last day of the concert on the streaming platform AbemaTV.

Katori&#x27;s second solo album entitled &quot;Tokyo SNG&quot; was released on April 13, 2022. Inspired by numerous styles of jazz, from standard style to big band jazz, Katori wished to evoke the feeling of hearing &quot;jazz in a tuxedo&quot;. He also contributed to writing some of the songs on the album, such as the titular &quot;Tokyo SNG&quot;, &quot;Kongaragatte&quot;, &quot;Shingopation&quot;, and &quot;Catharsis&quot;, to name a few. The album also features collaborations with WONK, Atarashii Gakko!, and the Zazen Boys.

On January 3, 2023, it was announced that Katori would be collaborating with popular K-Pop group Seventeen for a brand new song entitled &quot;BETTING&quot;, to serve as the theme song for fellow ex-SMAP member Tsuyoshi Kusanagi&#x27;s latest drama, War of Traps. Katori had met the group the year prior, leading to them collaborating on a song together. BETTING was co-produced by Katori, PLEDIS Entertainment producuer Bumzu, and SEVENTEEN member Woozi. Katori serves as the main vocal on the track, performing alongside SEVENTEEN&#x27;s Mingyu, Jeonghan, and Seungkwan. It was released on streaming platforms on January 17, 2023.

===Acting===
In 1988, he made his acting debut in a television series, &quot;Abunai Shonen III&quot;, along with his band members. After several supporting roles, in 1996, he landed his first major role in a drama television series, &quot;Tomei Ningen&quot;, which became a massive success. He has also starred in many high-rated television series, such as &quot;Hito ni Yasashiku&quot; (2002), &quot;Saiyuki&quot; (2006), and &quot;Bara no nai Hanaya&quot; (2008). In 2004, he starred in NHK&#x27;s Taiga drama, &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;. He is also a member of the Mitani Crew, a core group of actors that Japanese playwright Kōki Mitani tends to use in his work.

In 2021, Katori starred in TV Tokyo&#x27;s drama entitled &quot;Anonymous: Keishicho ”Yubisatsujin” Taisakushitsu.&quot; This was his first lead role on a TV Tokyo drama series, as well as his first broadcast drama series after five years. He also performed the main theme for the series, entitled &quot;Anonymous (feat. WONK)&quot;, and released it on both digital storefronts and streaming platforms on February 1, 2021.

===Shingo Mama===
From October 1998, Nakai and Katori launched their own variety program, &quot;SataSma&quot;, which was created and aimed towards younger viewers and families. Katori starred in a segment titled, &quot;Shingo Mama&#x27;s Secret Breakfast&quot;, where Katori would cross-dress as a character called &quot;Shingo Mama&quot;, and visit houses to cook breakfast for children instead of their mother, allowing her to sleep in and rest in the morning. Katori started to use the phrase, &quot;Ohha&quot;, a pun for &quot;Ohayo&quot;, meaning &quot;good morning&quot;, during the segment as his trademark phrase, which soon became a popular word used among children. Shingo Mama, the lovable character Katori played, and the phrase &quot;Ohha&quot;, became a social phenomenon. As a result, SMAP incidentally brought in kindergartners and preteens to their fan base.

On 16 August 2000, Katori released a single, &quot;Shingo Mama&#x27;s Oha Rock&quot;, as Shingo Mama, which reached number one on the charts with over 1,200,000 physical copies sold and became a social phenomenon. In December 2000, the trademark phrase &quot;Ohha&quot;, used by Katori, won the &quot;Ryukougo Taisho&quot;, an annual traditional event of announcing words that describes that year. From 2000 to 2001, Shingo Mama promoted the use of &quot;Ohha&quot; as part of a Ministry of Education campaign to encourage family communication.

== Artistic career ==
&quot;I’ve always loved painting for as long as I can remember,&quot; he said in an interview in his first book of illustration collection. He thinks he came to like painting because of the family background (his father was an art dealer). Katori displayed his artistic talent also at SMAP&#x27;s concerts. He became in charge for staging of the concert tours, beginning from &quot;super.modern.artistic.performance&quot; (2008) through &quot;We are SMAP&quot; (2010) and &quot;Gift of SMAP&quot; (2012) until &quot;Mr. S – saikou de saikou no CONCERT TOUR&quot; (2014).

Katori has been creating and engaged in various artworks and projects:

* Painting on Tsugaru Railway&#x27;s train car (1997). As a special project in the SMAP&#x27;s long-run television variety show, “SMAPxSMAP”, Katori painted a train car together with local children. After the car ended its service in 2000, it was kept at Kanagi Station for the purpose of exhibition, then moved to Kase Station. In 2017, 20 years after the painting was made, Katori visited the Kase Station again in a TV show (“Oja MAP!!”) in order to restore the work. The car is now one of the touristic attractions in the region and visited by Katori&#x27;s fans.
* &quot;Shingo no Itazura&quot;, an illustration collection book (1998), contains pictures published on magazine Wink Up and some new works created for this book.
* &quot;SNAP NO SHINGO&quot;, a photo diary for the period of one year from 16 October 2004 until 15 October 2005. The pictures were originally taken for &quot;SmaTIMES&quot; weekly paper published by a TV news variety show &quot;SmaSTATION&quot;.
* Painting &quot;Takarabako&quot; (&quot;Treasure Box&quot;, 2011). Appointed as an ambassador for a Cirque du Soleil show called &quot;Kooza&quot; in Japan, he painted a picture on a large canvas (1,800 x 1,500 mm), featuring characters and contents of the show. The painting was exhibited in the foyer during the Kooza&#x27;s performance in Japan.
* Artwork &quot;Kūsō Tamago&quot; (&quot;Fantasy Egg&quot;, 2014). After successful mission for &quot;Kooza&quot;, Katori was again appointed as an ambassador for the next Cirque du Soleil&quot;s performance in Japan, &quot;OVO&quot; and created an artwork featuring its motive &quot;ovo&quot;, which means an &quot;egg&quot; in Portuguese. The artwork accompanied the show around Japan.
* Fashion Photo Book &quot;Fuku Baka Shifukubon&quot; (roughly &quot;a book of happiest private wardrobe of a fashion freak&quot;, 2014). A photo book featuring Katori, known as a fashion freak, in his private clothes, coordinated by a noted fashion stylist, Tomoki Sukezane. For this book, Katori&#x27;s private wardrobe was transported from his flat to the photo studio by two 2-ton trucks. The estimated total value of the &quot;collection&quot; built-up over 15 years was 200 million Yen.
* Art Exhibition &quot;Museum of Together&quot; held by The Nippon Foundation, at Aoyama Spiral Garden, Tokyo, Japan for 13–31 October 2017. With other 22 artists, Katori joined in the exhibition with his two paintings, &quot;Hinotori&quot; (&quot;Fire Bird&quot;, 2014) and &quot;Isoge mada maniau&quot; (&quot;Hurry Up, We Are Going to Be on Time&quot;, 2010). It was his first participation in an art exhibition.
* A special exhibition celebrating the 100th anniversary of Cartier’s icon watch TANK, at Cartier in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo, Japan for 28 October – 26 November 2017. Inspired by the legendary timepiece of the French luxury brand, Katori created a painting and an art work.
* Graffiti in Hong Kong, at the corner of Hollywood Road and Shalley Street, Old Town Central, unveiled on 27 March 2018. Requested by Hong Kong Tourism Board, a government-subvented body, Katori completed the graffiti on a 4.5m-high and 6m-wide wall beside the Mid-Levels Escalator within 18 hours. As the project was to be kept confidential, he worked with the covered wall for 3 continuous nights from midnight until 6 am.
* Exhibition &quot;NAKAMA de ART&quot; at the Imperial Hotel Plaza, Tokyo, Japan for 24 May – 24 June 2018. Together with 13 emerging artists he selected, Katori organized an art gallery under the name of &quot;NAKAMA de ART&quot;. A literal translation of &quot;nakama&quot; is &quot;buddy&quot; or &quot;mate&quot;, so the exhibition title could roughly mean &quot;Let&#x27;s do art together&quot;.
*Car Wrapping on BMW X2 (2018). Appointed as a &quot;Brand Friend&quot; of a BMW&#x27;s SUV model X2, Katori was featured in its concept movie (a part of which was streamed also as TV advertisement later) and designed the car wrapping. The wrapped vehicle was exhibited at some special events.
*Fashion Brand and Permanent Pop-up Shop &quot;jantje_ontembaar&quot;. Together with a noted stylist Tomoki Sukezane who knows Katori over 20 years, Katori started-up a fashion brand and opened its own boutique at the Imperial Hotel Plaza under concept &quot;Permanent Pop-up Shop&quot;, meaning &quot;a shop with ever changing contents for an unlimited period of time&quot;. The brand collaborates with well-respected manufacturers such as Sanyo Coat (by Sanyo Shokai), MINEDENIM and Borsalino. The brand name &quot;jantje_ontembaar&quot; comes from Dutch words &quot;jantje&quot; and &quot;ontembaar&quot; which are said to be origins of Japanese words &quot;yancha&quot; and &quot;otenba&quot;, naughty boy and girl. With that, Katori and Sukezane want to encourage people to keep a heart of a child and think out-of-the-box.
* Exhibition &quot;NAKAMA des ARTS&quot; in Hall Charles V in the Louvre Museum (Carrousel du Louvre), Paris, France for 19 September – 3 October 2018. Katori&#x27;s first solo exhibition occurred within the framework of Japonismes 2018, a cultural festival organized by France and Japan to celebrate the 160th anniversary of diplomatic relation between the two countries.
*Painting of Tokyo Tower. On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Tokyo Tower, the national public broadcasting of Japan, NHK put a special program &quot;Miagereba anata wa itsumo sokoni&quot; (&quot;Thank you for being there every time when I look up&quot;) on air on 22 December 2018. In this program, Katori painted a picture featuring the Tokyo Tower. Katori often says that he likes the Tokyo Tower very much and the tower has been encouraging him a lot since he started his career in show business as a 11-year-old boy. In this work, he put colors on a night scenic photo of Tokyo he took by himself. It was the first time he utilized this art technique. The painting was exhibited on the Main Deck of the Tokyo Tower for the period from 2 February until 8 March 2019, then in &quot;boum! boum! boum!&quot; (see below), Katori&#x27;s first solo exhibition in Japan after the world&#x27;s premiere in Paris, France in 2018.
*Painting &quot;New Year Woman&quot;. For the first issue of a triannual magazine, &quot;Shūkanbunshun Woman&quot;, launched on 29 December 2019, Katori created a picture on a 1303 x 970 mm canvas. &quot;Shūkanbunshun&quot; is a well-established weekly magazine started in 1959, published by a leading Japanese publishing company, Kabushikigaisha Bungeishunjū (Bungeishunjū Ltd.). &quot;Shūkanbunshun Woman&quot; is its special edition targeting female readers. The picture is to be seen in Katori&#x27;s exhibition &quot;boum! boum! boum!&quot; (see below).
*Blog &quot;kūsō fantejī&quot; (&quot;fantasy&quot; in Japanese and in French). Starting from 1 January 2019, he has been posting a short fantasy story almost every day with a black-and-white picture he paints. These pictures form a part of his exhibition &quot;boum! boum! boum!&quot; (see below).
*Painting &quot;Freedom Gan’nen&quot; (&quot;First Year of Freedom&quot;), exhibited in front of Tokyo Midtown Hibiya for the New Year&#x27;s period of 2 – 14 January 2019, then in &quot;boum! boum! boum!&quot; (see below). Four canvases were made to a one big square canvas with a side longer than 4 meters. The character the creation features stands for a &quot;pig&quot; as 2019 is a year of the pig in Japanese traditional calendar with twelve earthly branches.
*Exhibition &quot;&quot;&quot;boum! boum! boum!&quot; for 15 March – 16 June 2019 in IHI Stage Around Tokyo in Toyosu, Tokyo. Katori&#x27;s first solo exhibition in Japan after the world&#x27;s premiere in Paris in 2018. The event title &quot;boum! boum! boum!&quot; stands for a pounding heart in French. The concept of the exhibition, which is designed more like a show than an art exhibition, is &quot;Looking inside Shingo Katori&quot;. After watching a short film on the seats of the innovative theater, in which the audience area rotates 360 degrees, the visitors are requested to step on to the stage with three separate segments where Katori&#x27;s art pieces are installed. The exhibition catalogue also includes Katori&#x27;s talks with noted artists, Tadanori Yoko&#x27;o and Makoto Aida.

<text>The Royal Society, formally The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, is a learned society and the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy of sciences. The society fulfils a number of roles: promoting science and its benefits, recognising excellence in science, supporting outstanding science, providing scientific advice for policy, education and public engagement and fostering international and global co-operation. Founded on 28 November 1660, it was granted a royal charter by King Charles II and is the oldest continuously existing scientific academy in the world.

The society is governed by its Council, which is chaired by the society&#x27;s president, according to a set of statutes and standing orders. The members of Council and the president are elected from and by its Fellows, the basic members of the society, who are themselves elected by existing Fellows. , there are about 1,700 fellows, allowed to use the postnominal title FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society), with up to 73 new fellows appointed each year from a pool of around 800 candidates. There are also royal fellows, honorary fellows and foreign members. Up to 24 new foreign members are appointed each year (from the same pool of 800) and they are allowed to use the postnominal title ForMemRS (Foreign Member of the Royal Society). The Royal Society president is Adrian Smith, who took up the post and started his five-year term on 30 November 2020, replacing the previous president, Venki Ramakrishnan.

Since 1967, the society has been based at 6–9 Carlton House Terrace, a Grade I listed building in central London which was previously used by the Embassy of Germany, London.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
The Invisible College has been described as a precursor group to the Royal Society of London, consisting of a number of natural philosophers around Robert Boyle. The concept of &quot;invisible college&quot; is mentioned in German Rosicrucian pamphlets in the early 17th century. Ben Jonson in England referenced the idea, related in meaning to Francis Bacon&#x27;s House of Solomon, in a masque &quot;The Fortunate Isles and Their Union&quot; from 1624/5. The term accrued currency in the exchanges of correspondence within the Republic of Letters.

In letters dated 1646 and 1647, Boyle refers to &quot;our invisible college&quot; or &quot;our philosophical college&quot;. The society&#x27;s common theme was to acquire knowledge through experimental investigation. Three dated letters are the basic documentary evidence: Boyle sent them to Isaac Marcombes (Boyle&#x27;s former tutor and a Huguenot, who was then in Geneva), Francis Tallents who at that point was a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and London-based Samuel Hartlib.

The Royal Society started from groups of physicians and natural philosophers, meeting at a variety of locations, including Gresham College in London. They were influenced by the &quot;new science&quot;, as promoted by Francis Bacon in his &quot;New Atlantis&quot;, from approximately 1645 onwards. A group known as &quot;Philosophical Society of Oxford&quot; was run under a set of rules still retained by the Bodleian Library. After the English Restoration, there were regular meetings at Gresham College. It is widely held that these groups were the inspiration for the foundation of the Royal Society.

An alternative view of the founding, held at the time, was that it was due to the influence of French scientists and the Montmor Academy in 1657, reports of which were sent back to England by English scientists attending. This view was held by Jean-Baptiste du Hamel, Giovanni Domenico Cassini, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and Melchisédech Thévenot at the time and has some grounding in that Henry Oldenburg, the society&#x27;s first secretary, had attended the Montmor Academy meeting. Robert Hooke, however, disputed this, writing that:

[Cassini] makes, then, Mr Oldenburg to have been the instrument, who inspired the English with a desire to imitate the French, in having Philosophical Clubs, or Meetings; and that this was the occasion of founding the Royal Society, and making the French the first. I will not say, that Mr Oldenburg did rather inspire the French to follow the English, or, at least, did help them, and hinder us. But &#x27;tis well known who were the principal men that began and promoted that design, both in this city and in Oxford; and that a long while before Mr Oldenburg came into England. And not only these Philosophic Meetings were before Mr Oldenburg came from Paris; but the Society itself was begun before he came hither; and those who then knew Mr Oldenburg, understood well enough how little he himself knew of philosophic matter.
On 28 November 1660, which is considered the official foundation date of the Royal Society, a meeting at Gresham College of 12 natural philosophers decided to commence a &quot;Colledge for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematicall Experimentall Learning&quot;. Amongst those founders were Christopher Wren, Robert Boyle, John Wilkins, William Brouncker and Robert Moray.

At the second meeting, Sir Robert Moray announced that the King approved of the gatherings, and a royal charter was signed on 15 July 1662 which created the &quot;Royal Society of London&quot;, with Lord Brouncker serving as the first president. A second royal charter was signed on 23 April 1663, with the king noted as the founder and with the name of &quot;the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge&quot;; Robert Hooke was appointed as Curator of Experiments in November. This initial royal favour has continued and, since then, every monarch has been the patron of the society.

The society&#x27;s early meetings included experiments performed first by Hooke and then by Denis Papin, who was appointed in 1684. These experiments varied in their subject area, and were both important in some cases and trivial in others. The society also published an English translation of &quot;Essays of Natural Experiments Made in the Accademia del Cimento, under the Protection of the Most Serene Prince Leopold of Tuscany&quot; in 1684, an Italian book documenting experiments at the Accademia del Cimento. Although meeting at Gresham College, the society temporarily moved to Arundel House in 1666 after the Great Fire of London, which did not harm Gresham but did lead to its appropriation by the Lord Mayor. The society returned to Gresham in 1673.

There had been an attempt in 1667 to establish a permanent &quot;college&quot; for the society. Michael Hunter argues that this was influenced by &quot;Solomon&#x27;s House&quot; in Bacon&#x27;s &quot;New Atlantis&quot; and, to a lesser extent, by J. V. Andreae&#x27;s &quot;Christianopolis&quot;, dedicated research institutes, rather than the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, since the founders only intended for the society to act as a location for research and discussion. The first proposal was given by John Evelyn to Robert Boyle in a letter dated 3 September 1659; he suggested a grander scheme, with apartments for members and a central research institute. Similar schemes were expounded by Bengt Skytte and later Abraham Cowley, who wrote in his &quot;Proposition for the Advancement of Experimental Philosophy&quot; in 1661 of a &quot;&#x27;Philosophical College&quot;, with houses, a library and a chapel. The society&#x27;s ideas were simpler and only included residences for a handful of staff, but Hunter maintains an influence from Cowley and Skytte&#x27;s ideas. Henry Oldenburg and Thomas Sprat put forward plans in 1667 and Oldenburg&#x27;s co-secretary, John Wilkins, moved in a council meeting on 30 September 1667 to appoint a committee &quot;for raising contributions among the members of the society, in order to build a college&quot;. These plans were progressing by November 1667, but never came to anything, given the lack of contributions from members and the &quot;unrealised—perhaps unrealistic&quot;—aspirations of the society.

===18th century===

During the 18th century, the gusto that had characterised the early years of the society faded; with a small number of scientific &quot;greats&quot; compared to other periods, little of note was done. In the second half, it became customary for His Majesty&#x27;s Government to refer highly important scientific questions to the council of the society for advice, something that, despite the non-partisan nature of the society, spilled into politics in 1777 over lightning conductors. The pointed lightning conductor had been invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1749, while Benjamin Wilson invented blunted ones. During the argument that occurred when deciding which to use, opponents of Franklin&#x27;s invention accused supporters of being American allies rather than being British, and the debate eventually led to the resignation of the society&#x27;s president, Sir John Pringle. During the same time period, it became customary to appoint society fellows to serve on government committees where science was concerned, something that still continues.

The 18th century featured remedies to many of the society&#x27;s early problems. The number of fellows had increased from 110 to approximately 300 by 1739, the reputation of the society had increased under the presidency of Sir Isaac Newton from 1703 until his death in 1727, and editions of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; were appearing regularly. During his time as president, Newton arguably abused his authority; in a dispute between himself and Gottfried Leibniz over the invention of infinitesimal calculus, he used his position to appoint an &quot;impartial&quot; committee to decide it, eventually publishing a report written by himself in the committee&#x27;s name. In 1705, the society was informed that it could no longer rent Gresham College and began a search for new premises. After unsuccessfully applying to Queen Anne for new premises, and asking the trustees of Cotton House if they could meet there, the council bought two houses in Crane Court, Fleet Street, on 26 October 1710. This included offices, accommodation and a collection of curiosities. Although the overall fellowship contained few noted scientists, most of the council were highly regarded, and included at various times John Hadley, William Jones and Hans Sloane. Because of the laxness of fellows in paying their subscriptions, the society ran into financial difficulty during this time; by 1740, the society had a deficit of £240. This continued into 1741, at which point the treasurer began dealing harshly with fellows who had not paid. The business of the society at this time continued to include the demonstration of experiments and the reading of formal and important scientific papers, along with the demonstration of new scientific devices and queries about scientific matters from both Britain and Europe.

Some modern research has asserted that the claims of the society&#x27;s degradation during the 18th century are false. Richard Sorrenson writes that &quot;far from having &#x27;fared ingloriously&#x27;, the society experienced a period of significant productivity and growth throughout the eighteenth century&quot;, pointing out that many of the sources critical accounts are based on are in fact written by those with an agenda. While Charles Babbage wrote that the practice of pure mathematics in Britain was weak, laying the blame at the doorstep of the society, the practice of mixed mathematics was strong and although there were not many eminent members of the society, some did contribute vast amounts – James Bradley, for example, established the nutation of the Earth&#x27;s axis with 20 years of detailed, meticulous astronomy.

Politically within the society, the mid-18th century featured a &quot;Whig supremacy&quot; as the so-called &quot;Hardwicke Circle&quot; of Whig-leaning scientists held the society&#x27;s main Offices. Named after Lord Hardwicke, the group&#x27;s members included Daniel Wray and Thomas Birch and was most prominent in the 1750s and &#x27;60s. The circle had Birch elected secretary and, following the resignation of Martin Folkes, the circle helped oversee a smooth transition to the presidency of Earl Macclesfield, whom Hardwicke helped elect. Under Macclesfield, the circle reached its &quot;zenith&quot;, with members such as Lord Willoughby and Birch serving as vice-president and secretary respectively. The circle also influenced goings-on in other learned societies, such as the Society of Antiquaries of London. After Macclesfield&#x27;s retirement, the circle had Lord Morton elected in 1764 and Sir John Pringle elected in 1772. By this point, the previous Whig &quot;majority&quot; had been reduced to a &quot;faction&quot;, with Birch and Willoughby no longer involved, and the circle declined in the same time frame as the political party did in British politics under George III, falling apart in the 1780s.

In 1780, the society moved again, this time to Somerset House. The property was offered to the society by His Majesty&#x27;s Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient and there was not enough room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.

===19th century===

The early 19th century has been seen as a time of decline for the society; of 662 fellows in 1830, only 104 had contributed to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. The same year, Charles Babbage published &quot;Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes&quot;, which was deeply critical of the society. The scientific Fellows of the society were spurred into action by this, and eventually James South established a Charters Committee &quot;with a view to obtaining a supplementary Charter from the Crown&quot;, aimed primarily at looking at ways to restrict membership. The Committee recommended that the election of Fellows take place on one day every year, that the Fellows be selected on consideration of their scientific achievements and that the number of Fellows elected a year be limited to 15. This limit was increased to 17 in 1930 and 20 in 1937. As of 2024, 85 Fellows and 24 Foreign Members are elected each year. This had a number of effects on the society: first, the society&#x27;s membership became almost entirely scientific, with few political Fellows or patrons. Second, the number of Fellows was significantly reduced—between the years 1700 and 1850, the number of Fellows rose from approximately 100 to approximately 750. From then until 1941, the total number of Fellows was always between 400 and 500.

The period did lead to some reform of internal Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along with a copy of the total income and expenditure of the society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before. As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. 

In 1850 the society accepted the responsibility of administering a government grant-in-aid of scientific research of £1,000 per year; this was supplemented in the financial year 1876/1877 by a Government Fund of £4,000 per year, with the society acting as the administering body of these funds, distributing grants to scientists. The Government Fund came to an end after a period of five years, after which the Government Grant was increased to £4,000 a year in total. This grant has now grown to over £47 million, some £37 million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.

By 1852, the congestion at Somerset House had increased due to the growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty&#x27;s Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker&#x27;s apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was the lack of space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty.

===20th century===
On 22 March 1945, the first female Fellows were elected to the Royal Society. This followed a statutory amendment in 1944 that read &quot;Nothing herein contained shall render women ineligible as candidates&quot;, and was contained in Chapter 1 of Statute 1. Because of the difficulty of co-ordinating all the Fellows during the Second World War, a ballot on making the change was conducted via the post, with 336 Fellows supporting the change and 37 opposing. Following approval by the Council, Marjory Stephenson and Kathleen Lonsdale were elected as the first female Fellows.

In 1947, Mary Cartwright became the first female mathematician elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. Cartwright was also the first woman to serve on the Council of the Royal Society.

Due to overcrowding at Burlington House, the society moved to Carlton House Terrace in 1967.

===21st century===
To show support for vaccines against COVID-19, the Royal Society under the guidance of both Nobel prize-winner Venki Ramakrishnan and Sir Adrian Smith added its power to shape public discourse and proposed &quot;legislation and punishment of those who produced and disseminated false information&quot; about the experimental medical interventions. This was brought to popular notice in January 2020 by a retired justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Lord Sumption, who in his broadside wrote &quot;Science advances by confronting contrary arguments, not by suppressing them.&quot; The proposal was authored by sociologist Melinda Mills and approved by her colleagues on the &quot;Science in Emergencies Tasking – COVID&quot; in an October 2020 report entitled &quot;COVID-19 vaccine deployment: Behaviour, ethics, misinformation and policy strategies&quot;. The SET-C committee favoured legislation from China, Singapore and South Korea, and found that &quot;Singapore, for instance has the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), with four prominent (criminal) cases within the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. POFMA also lifted any exemptions for internet intermediaries which legally required social media companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and Baidu to immediately correct cases of misinformation on their platforms.&quot;

==Coat of arms==

The blazon for the shield in the coat of arms of the Royal Society is &quot;in a dexter corner of a shield argent our three Lions of England, and for crest a helm adorned with a crown studded with florets, surmounted by an eagle of proper colour holding in one foot a shield charged with our lions: supporters two white hounds gorged with crowns&quot;, with the motto of &quot;nullius in verba&quot;. John Evelyn, interested in the early structure of the society, had sketched out at least six possible designs, but in August 1662 Charles II told the society that it was allowed to use the arms of England as part of its coat and the society &quot;now resolv&#x27;d that the armes of the Society should be, &quot;a field Argent, with a canton of the armes of England; the supporters two talbots Argent&quot;; Crest, &quot;an eagle Or holding a shield with the like armes of England, viz. 3 lions&quot;. The words &quot;Nullius in verba&quot;&quot;. This was approved by Charles, who asked Garter King of Arms to create a diploma for it, and when the second charter was signed on 22 April 1663 the arms were granted to the president, council and fellows of the society along with their successors.

The helmet of the arms was not specified in the charter, but the engraver sketched out a peer&#x27;s helmet (barred helmet) on the final design, which is used. This is contrary to the heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire&#x27;s helmet (closed helmet); it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer&#x27;s helmet as a compliment to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.

== Charter book ==
Fellows and foreign members are required to sign a book when they join the Royal Society. This book is known as the Charter Book, which has been signed continuously since 1663. All British monarchs have signed the book since then, apart from William and Mary, and Queen Anne. In 2019, the book was digitised.

==Motto==
The society&#x27;s motto, &quot;Nullius in verba&quot;, is Latin for &quot;Take nobody&#x27;s word for it&quot;. It was adopted to signify the fellows&#x27; determination to establish facts via experiments and comes from Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot;, where he compares himself to a gladiator who, having retired, is free from control.

==Fellows of the Royal Society (FRS)==
The society&#x27;s core members are the fellows: scientists and engineers from the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth selected based on having made &quot;a substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge, including mathematics, engineering science and medical science&quot;. Fellows are elected for life and gain the right to use the postnominal Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). The rights and responsibilities of fellows also include a duty to financially contribute to the society, the right to stand for council posts and the right to elect new fellows. Up to 52 fellows are elected each year and in 2014 there were about 1,450 living members in total. Election to the fellowship is decided by ten sectional committees (each covering a subject area or set of subjects areas) which consist of existing fellows.

The society also elects royal fellows, honorary fellows and foreign members. Royal fellows are those members of the British royal family, representing the British monarchy&#x27;s role in promoting and supporting the society, who are recommended by the society&#x27;s council and elected via postal vote. There are currently four royal fellows: The King of the United Kingdom, The Duke of Kent, The Princess Royal, and The Prince of Wales. Honorary fellows are people who are ineligible to be elected as fellows but nevertheless have &quot;rendered signal service to the cause of science, or whose election would significantly benefit the Society by their great experience in other walks of life&quot;. Six honorary fellows have been elected to date, including Baroness O&#x27;Neill of Bengarve. Foreign members are scientists from non-Commonwealth nations &quot;who are eminent for their scientific discoveries and attainments&quot;. Eight are elected each year by the society and also hold their membership for life. Foreign members are permitted to use the post-nominal ForMemRS (Foreign Member of the Royal Society) and as of August 2020 number about 185.
The appointment of fellows was first authorised in the second charter, issued on 22 April 1663, which allowed the president and council, in the two months following the signing, to appoint as fellows any individual they saw fit. This saw the appointment of 94 fellows on 20 May and 4 on 22 June; these 98 are known as the &quot;Original Fellows&quot;. After the expiration of this two-month period, any appointments were to be made by the president, council and existing fellows. Many early fellows were not scientists or particularly eminent intellectuals; it was clear that the early society could not rely on financial assistance from the king, and scientifically trained fellows were few and far between. It was, therefore, necessary to secure the favour of wealthy or important individuals for the society&#x27;s survival. While the entrance fee of £4 and the subscription rate of one shilling a week should have produced £600 a year for the society, many fellows paid neither regularly nor on time. Two-thirds of the fellows in 1663 were non-scientists; this rose to 71.6% in 1800 before dropping to 47.4% in 1860 as the financial security of the society became more certain. In May 1846, a committee recommended limiting the annual intake of members to 15 and insisting on scientific eminence; this was implemented, with the result being that the society now consists exclusively of scientific fellows.

==Structure and governance==
The society is governed by its council, which is chaired by the society&#x27;s president, according to a set of statutes and standing orders. The members of council, the president, and the other officers are elected from and by its fellowship.

===Council===
The council is a body consisting of 20 to 24 fellows, including the officers (the president, the treasurer, two secretaries—one from the physical sciences, one from life sciences—and the foreign secretary), one fellow to represent each sectional committee and seven other fellows. The council is tasked with directing the society&#x27;s overall policy, managing all business related to the society, amending, making or repealing the society&#x27;s standing orders and acting as trustees for the society&#x27;s possessions and estates. Members are elected annually via a postal ballot, and current standing orders mean that at least ten seats must change hands each year. The council may establish (and is assisted by) a variety of committees, which can include not only fellows but also outside scientists. Under the charter, the president, two secretaries and the treasurer are collectively the officers of the society. The current officers are:
* President: Adrian Smith
* Treasurer: Jonathan Keating
* Biological Secretary: Linda Partridge
* Physical Secretary: Sheila Rowan
* Foreign Secretary: Mark Walport and Alison Noble (jointly)

===President===
The president of the Royal Society is the head of both the society and the council. The details for the presidency were set out in the second charter and initially had no limit on how long a president could serve; under current society statute, the term is five years.

The current president is Adrian Smith, who took over from Venki Ramakrishnan on 30 November 2020. Historically, the duties of the president have been both formal and social. The Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 left the president as one of the few individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government&#x27;s chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.

===Permanent staff===
The society is assisted by a number of full-time paid staff. The original charter provided for &quot;two or more Operators of Experiments, and two or more clerks&quot;; as the number of books in the society&#x27;s collection grew, it also became necessary to employ a curator. The staff grew as the financial position of the society improved, mainly consisting of outsiders, along with a small number of scientists who were required to resign their fellowship on employment. The current executive director is Dame Julie Maxton DBE.

==Functions and activities==

The society has a variety of functions and activities. It supports modern science by disbursing over £100 million to fund almost 1,000 research fellowships for both early and late-career scientists, along with innovation, mobility and research capacity grants. Its awards, prize lectures and medals all come with prize money intended to finance research, and it provides subsidised communications and media skills courses for research scientists. Much of this activity is supported by a grant from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, most of which is channelled to the University Research Fellowships (URF). In 2008, the society opened the Royal Society Enterprise Fund, intended to invest in new scientific companies and be self-sustaining, funded (after an initial set of donations on the 350th anniversary of the society) by the returns from its investments.

Through its Science Policy Centre, the society acts as an advisor to the UK Government, the European Commission and the United Nations on matters of science. It publishes several reports a year, and serves as the Academy of Sciences of the United Kingdom. Since the middle of the 18th century, government problems involving science were irregularly referred to the society, and by 1800 it was done regularly.

==Carlton House Terrace==

The premises at 6–9 Carlton House Terrace is a Grade I listed building and the current headquarters of the Royal Society, which had moved there from Burlington House in 1967. The ground floor and basement are used for ceremonies, social and publicity events, the first floor hosts facilities for Fellows and Officers of the society, and the second and third floors are divided between offices and accommodation for the President, Executive Director and Fellows.

Carlton House Terrace was designed by John Nash as two blocks of houses, with a space in between them. The building is still owned by the Crown Estates and leased by the society; it underwent a major renovation from 2001 to 2004 at the cost of £9.8 million, and was reopened by the Prince of Wales on 7 July 2004.

Carlton House Terrace underwent a series of renovations between 1999 and November 2003 to improve and standardise the property. New waiting, exhibition and reception rooms were created in the house at No.7, using the Magna Boschi marble found in No.8, and greenish grey Statuario Venato marble was used in other areas to standardise the design. An effort was also made to make the layout of the buildings easier, consolidating all the offices on one floor, Fellows&#x27; Rooms on another and all the accommodation on a third.

==Kavli Royal Society International Centre==
In 2009 Chicheley Hall, a Grade I listed building located near Milton Keynes, was bought by the Royal Society for £6.5 million, funded in part by the Kavli Foundation. The Royal Society spent several million on renovations adapting it to become the Kavli Royal Society International Centre, a venue for residential science seminars. The centre held its first scientific meeting on 1 June 2010 and was formally opened on 21 June 2010. The centre was permanently closed on 18 June 2020 and the building was sold in 2021.

==Publishing==
Through Royal Society Publishing, the society publishes the following journals:
* &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A&quot; (mathematics and the physical sciences)
* &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&quot; (biological sciences)
* &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A&quot;
* &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&quot;
* &quot;Biology Letters&quot;
* &quot;Open Biology&quot;
* &quot;Royal Society Open Science&quot;
* &quot;Journal of the Royal Society Interface&quot;
* &quot;Interface Focus&quot;
* &quot;Notes and Records&quot;
* &quot;Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society&quot;

The society introduced the world&#x27;s first journal exclusively devoted to science in 1665, &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, and in so doing originated the peer review process now widespread in scientific journals. Its founding editor was Henry Oldenburg, the society&#x27;s first secretary.
It remains the oldest and longest-running scientific journal in the world. It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and, since 1886, has been divided into two parts; A, which deals with mathematics and the physical sciences, and B, which deals with the biological sciences. 

&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; consists of freely submitted research articles and is similarly divided into two parts. &quot;Biology Letters&quot; publishes short research articles and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005. &quot;Journal of the Royal Society Interface&quot; publishes cross-disciplinary research at the boundary between the physical and life sciences, while &quot;Interface Focus&quot;, publishes themed issue in the same areas. &quot;Notes and Records&quot; is the society&#x27;s journal of the history of science. &quot;Biographical Memoirs&quot; is published twice annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. &quot;Open Biology&quot; is an open access journal covering biology at the molecular and cellular level. &quot;Royal Society Open Science&quot; is an open access journal publishing high-quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer-review. All the society&#x27;s journals are peer-reviewed.

In May 2021, the society announced plans to transition its four hybrid research journals to open access

==Honours==
The Royal Society presents numerous awards, lectures, and medals to recognise scientific achievement. The oldest is the Croonian Lecture, created in 1701 at the request of the widow of William Croone, one of the founding members of the Royal Society. The Croonian Lecture is still awarded on an annual basis and is considered the most important Royal Society prize for the biological sciences. Although the Croonian Lecture was created in 1701, it was first awarded in 1738, seven years after the Copley Medal. The Copley Medal is the oldest Royal Society medal still in use and is awarded for &quot;outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science&quot;.

<text>The Kuban is a river in Russia that flows through the Western Caucasus and drains into the Sea of Azov. The Kuban runs mostly through Krasnodar Krai for , but also in the Karachay–Cherkess Republic, Stavropol Krai and the Republic of Adygea.

The Kuban flows north and west from its source near Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, eventually reaching Temryuk Bay in the Sea of Azov. It is navigable up to Krasnodar. Major cities on the river are Karachayevsk, Cherkessk, Nevinnomyssk, Armavir, Novokubansk, Kropotkin, Ust-Labinsk, Krasnodar and Temryuk. Despite its name, Slavyansk-on-Kuban lies not on the Kuban River, but on its distributary the Protoka.

==Geography and hydrology==

The river originates on the slopes of Mount Elbrus and forms at the merger of its two tributaries, the Ullukam and Uchkulam; from the source of the Ullukam to the delta, it has a length of . Between the source and Nevinnomyssk the river flows mostly in the deep and narrow gorge, has many thresholds and rapidly changes its elevation. Near Nevinnomyssk a dam supplies water to the Nevinnomyssk channel. In its central part, until the confluence with the Bolshaya Laba, the Kuban River flows in a wide flat valley with terraced slopes. Then it bends to the west and develops a left-bank floodplain, which is wide near Ust-Labinsk. There it is winding and has many shoals and rapids. Below the mouth of Laba the river widens up to . Between the mouths of the rivers Laba and Afips the Adyghe marshes cover an area of about , and below the river Afips, about is occupied by the Zakubanskie marshes. At from the mouth, the Kuban converges with a major tributary, the Protoka, which is long. Near its mouth the Kuban narrows to and then forms a delta covering about . The delta contains numerous limans, some of which have gradually separated from the river. Until the 19th century the Kuban River discharged into both the Black and the Azov seas. However later, the rising grounds redirected the river entirely to the Azov Sea.

In the upper stream the river is mostly fed by glaciers and high-mountain snow (49%). Near Krasnodar, this contribution drops to 32%; meanwhile, the water supply from the subsoil water increases from 21% to 32%, and that of rainwater from 27% to 32%. The river does not freeze over because of a relatively warm climate and rapid flow in the upper part. The Kuban River is characterized by numerous (6–7 through the year) floods due to rains and thaws, both in the winter and summer. The water level used to fluctuate by up to , with the maximum in July and the minimum in February. The amplitude of these fluctuations was reduced by construction of the Nevinnomyssk channel and the Tschikskoe, Krasnodar and Shapsug reservoirs. These measures also provided water for fish farming and rice fields.

The average discharge of the Kuban River is at its maximum near Krasnodar at about . It was formerly higher by some but was lowered by the reservoir construction. The average discharge near Armavir is , and it formerly varied between before the filling of the Krasnodar Reservoir in the 1980s. The annual outflow to the Azov Sea is about of water, 8 million tonnes of sediments and 4 million tonnes of dissolved salts.

The average turbidity is 682 g/m3. Water salinity increases toward the delta; it normally varies between 50 and 400 mg/L and may reach 1000 mg/L in some areas. All major tributaries flow into the Kuban from the left and originate in the Caucasus Mountains. Those tributaries include the Bolshoy Zelenchuk, Maly Zelenchuk, Urup, Laba, Belaya and Pshish.

The main tributaries of the Kuban are, from source to mouth:

*Teberda (left)
*Maly Zelenchuk (left)
*Bolshoy Zelenchuk (left)
*Urup (left)
*Laba (left)
*Belaya (left)
*Pshish (left)
*Apchas (left)

==Flora==

The river flows through three types of landscape: mixed forests of the Caucasus in the south, Crimean Submediterranean forests in the central part, and steppe in the north. The Caucasus mixed forests are rich in tree species; at mid-elevation, they are dominated by Georgian oak (&quot;Quercus iberica&quot;), hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus caucasica&quot;), sweet chestnut (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;) and Oriental beech (&quot;Fagus orientalis&quot;). Higher forests are coniferous and consist of fir (&quot;Abies nordmanniana&quot;) and spruce (&quot;Picea orientalis&quot;). The Crimean Submediterranean forests are also coniferous, dominated by fir and spruce.

The vegetation of the delta mostly consists of thickets of reeds, grassweed, sedges, bur-reed and cattail. Less frequent are tape-grasses, grass rush, arrowhead and other water-hungry plants. The estuaries have rich underwater vegetation in the form of stoneworts algae, pondweed, hornworts, lilies and other species. The total area of such vegetation is . Some estuaries contain thickets of lotus which was brought to the area from Africa.

==Fauna==

The wide delta of Kuban, with its abundant estuaries, is especially rich in plankton and benthos. There are about 400 species of zooplankton, including rotifers, copepods, cladocerans, mollusks, worms, etc., providing abundant food for fish. The fish fauna of the Kuban differs from that of the nearby Don and Volga rivers and contains more than 65 species from 16 families. They are dominated by the genera &quot;Gobio&quot;, &quot;Romanogobio&quot;, &quot;Squalius&quot; and &quot;Chondrostoma&quot; and contain species and genera such as carp, Prussian carp, roach, bream, silver bream, pike, perch, ruffe, &quot;Chalcalburnus&quot;, &quot;Sprattus&quot;, &quot;Mugil&quot; and others. Some species such as silver carp and grass carp were acclimatized in the last decade.

Endemic species include the Kuban barbel (&quot;Barbus kubanicus&quot;), &quot;Gobio kubanicus&quot;, Little Kuban gudgeon (&quot;Romanogobio parvus&quot;), Kuban long-barbelled gudgeon (&quot;R. pentatrichus&quot;), Kuban nase (&quot;Chondrostoma kubanicum&quot;), &quot;Sabanejewia kubanica&quot;, &quot;Oxynoemacheilus merga&quot; and Aphips chub.

Kuban barbel and Kuban nase are the only species of their genera within the Kuban basin. They prefer mountainous streams with a rapid flow and sandy or rocky bottom on which they spawn. After the construction of the Krasnodar Dam in the 1980s, the Kuban barbel became rare in the lower Kuban. On the contrary, Kuban nase moves downstream to lower sections or larger tributaries in winter. It is rather sensitive to the water quality, especially turbidity. Its population also declined after the construction of the Krasnodar Dam, but is still large in the middle and upper parts of the Kuban and its tributaries.

The Kuban gudgeon and Little Kuban gudgeon are restricted to the sections with moderately fast flow and gravel or sandy bottoms; they are abundant in the middle part of the river. The Kuban gudgeon is unusual by having five anal branched rays. Aphips chub (&quot;Squalius aphipsi&quot;) occurs in southern tributaries of Kuban and is hiding in small pools in the summer. It spawns in rapid streams deep with a pebble or rocky bottom. It does not migrate much, but it moves downstream in winter to find deeper pools and returns upstream in summer. This species is abundant throughout the whole river.

Before the construction of dams, the River had migratory stocks of sturgeons (&quot;Acipenser gueldenstaedtii&quot;, &quot;A. stellatus&quot;, &quot;Huso huso&quot;) and cyprinids (&quot;Alburnus mento&quot;, &quot;Vimba vimba&quot;). These species have low presence nowadays.

The delta of the Kuban River and its estuaries are a popular resting ground for various migratory birds, especially waterfowl such as wild geese, ducks, cormorants, pelicans, swans and gray herons. Also abundant are birds of prey, such as falcons, as well as foxes and wild cats. Muskrats were brought to the watershed in the 20th century for commercial fur production.

==Geological history==

Tens of thousands of years ago, the Azov Sea was much larger and covered the delta of the Kuban River. Deposition of silt by the Kuban gradually pushed out the sea and shaped the delta with numerous limans and shallow estuaries. Frequent eruptions of the mud volcanoes contributed to this deposition process. There are about 25 mud volcanoes in the area and some are still active.

==Human activities==
The ancient Greeks called the river &quot;Hypanis&quot;.

Kuban River gave its name to the Kuban Cossacks who settled in its basin in the 18th–19th centuries. During the Russian conquest of the Caucasus it was part of the North Caucasus Line.

The delta of Kuban is an important rice-growing region of Russia. Also developed here is fishery with the major commercial species including perch, roach and chalcalburnus. The river is navigated up to Krasnodar where it feeds the Krasnodar Thermal Power Plant.

<text>The Šubić family, also known initially as Bribirščić (Berberistich, Broborstic, Breberstic, Breberienses), was one of the Twelve noble tribes of Croatia and a great noble house which constituted Croatian statehood in the Middle Ages. They held the county of Bribir (&quot;Varvaria&quot;) in inland Dalmatia. They with their prominent branch Zrinski (1347–1703) were arguably the leading noble family of Croatia for almost 500 years.

==History==

===Origins===
Today Bribir is an archaeological site in inland Dalmatia. It is located on a flat hill about fifteen kilometres northwest of Skradin, near the old Zadar road which goes through Benkovac. Under the steep rocks of its western side there is the source of the Bribirčica stream and from here the rich and fertile Bribir-Ostrovica field spreads out. The hill of Bribir, an ideal place to control the surrounding territory, was a perfect area to inhabit. The one who held it had control over all roads and approaches from the sea to the hinterland, making it an ideal settlement.

During the Roman period Bribir, known as Varvaria, had the status of &quot;municipium&quot; and was the centre of one of the fourteen Liburnian counties. The Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote in the 10th century about the Croats settling in Dalmatia in the 7th century and described how they had organised their country into eleven counties (zupanias) one of which was &quot;Breberi&quot;, centred on site of the old &quot;Varvaria&quot; (Moravcsik &amp; Jenkins, eds. 1967). A line of hills separated it from the territory of Knin to the north and to the south it bordered on Skradin. It was held by a kindred that in coeval documents is referred to as &quot;nobiles, comites&quot; or &quot;principes Breberienses&quot; (nobles, counts or rulers of Breber, &quot;knezovi Bribirski&quot; in Croatian). These &quot;Breberienses&quot; belonged to the Šubić tribe from Luka županija, one of the twelve tribes which composed Croatian statehood in the Middle Ages, and according to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs. In 1182 was mentioned noble Tolimir &quot;filius Stephani Subici&quot; in the hinterland of Zadar, in 1248 some noble &quot;Subinich&quot; were on the island of Krk, while Mladen III Banić (1342) and Paul III Banić (1345) were first members of the main line of Bribir to be called &quot;seu generationis Subichievich&quot;.

===Original coat of arms===
 The original coat of arms of this clan of nobles is a wing argent on a shield gules. The crest is a sprig of barberry. Argent and gules were the colours of the Croatian kindreds that sided with the papal party such as the lords of Krk (before they took on the shield of the Roman Frangipani), the Gusić, the Mogorović and the Hrvatinić, and still are those of Croatia.

The device could be derived from the winged shield standard of the royal chamberlain, a post held by &quot;Budez postelnic berberensis jupanus&quot; (1069). Wings are common, especially as a crest, in later Croatian heraldry. This could be accounted by the numerous &quot;familiares&quot; of the powerful Zrins who kept the Breber device in their coat of arms.

===Timeline===
In recent history books whenever members of this kindred are mentioned in relation to their prominent role in the 13th and 14th centuries the surname of Šubić is conferred upon them by the historian. This was not the way that the members called themselves at the time. During the Middle Ages every man in Croatia bore four names: the name given at baptism, the patronym, the name of his kindred which was also the name of the settlement in which he lived, and his tribal affiliation (Jirecek, 1967). When, with the introduction of feudalism, king Bela confirmed the kindred in their possession of Breber (1251) this name would again be used to identify them since by then the custom was to be called after one&#x27;s premier fief. Thus, in the period from 1069 to the destruction of the county by the Turks in 1520, the many personages of the clan that emerge from the original Latin documents qualify themselves as &quot;de Breberio&quot; preceded by their Christian name and patronym; only rarely do they add their tribal affiliation.

The seal of Paul I Šubić of Bribir (born in 1312), the greatest figure of the clan, has the following lettering on it: &quot;+ S(IGILLVM) PAVLI BREBERIENSIS BANI TOCIVS SCLAVONIE&quot;Another seal of the same man has: &quot;PAVLVS DE BREBERIO BANVS CROATORVM D[OMI]N[V]S ET BOSNE&quot;Thus, in the vulgar the surname would be Breber or some variant &quot;(Breberić, Brebrić, Barbier, Barber, Barberich&quot;, etc.). The 19th century erudite Croatian historians who wrote the first history books for the public opted for Šubić which, in the ardent nationalistic spirit of the time, sounded reassuringly Slavic as compared to Breber. 

During the reign of Demetrius Zvonimir (1075–1089), the mythical golden age of the Kingdom of Croatia, the highest court offices of (&quot;comes camerarius&quot;) and (&quot;comes palatinus&quot;) were held by &quot;Budez&quot; and &quot;Dominicus&quot;, both of the lineage. During the 13th and 14th centuries Brebers were many times called to cover the post of count in the townships of Split, Trogir, Skradin and Omiš, primarily clashing with Domald of Sidraga, Kačić and Nelipić family. In the documents, it is possible to identify six different branches of the Breber clan. The most illustrious of which is the one descended from &quot;iupanus Miroslaus Brebriensis, filius Bogdanizi&quot; (1184). His great-grandson Paul, mentioned above, reached the peak of power towards the end of the 13th century. He was Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, his rule extended to Bosnia, and with his brothers he controlled the maritime cities of Dalmatia. In these regions he was champion of the Pope and was instrumental in placing Charles, the firstborn of the King of Naples, on the throne of Hungary and Croatia. He was related to the King of Naples, the King of Serbia, the Da Camino lords of Treviso, and the Tiepolo and Dandolo patricians of Venice. When he died in 1312, his eldest son Mladen tried to maintain the hold over the other Croatian clans, but was unsuccessful and bit by bit lost land, castles and towns.

===Decline===
Besides these particular offshoots which went their separate ways, a numerous kin continued to abide by the ancient holding of Breber. In 1324 when the citizenship of Zadar was conferred on the &quot;nobiles domini de Briberio&quot;, 190 members of the clan presented themselves for the investiture. In 1353 the Ottoman Turks crossed the Dardanelles and began their invasion of Europe. In the 15th century Bosnia was already a pashalik from where raids would be carried into Croatia-Dalmatia. The feudal levies and the clan warriors had no hope against the Turkish war machine and met their fate in the battle of Krbavsko Polje (1493). The castle of Breber was caught on the front between the Turkish, Hungarian and Venetian armies and by 1520 had become a desolate waste of rubble. Last news giving the &quot;comites Breberienses&quot; still in their ancient seat is in the diocesan synod of Skradin held at the time of bishop Archangel (1490–1502). The Turkish terror displaced large portions of the population of Dalmatia-Croatia. Some sought refuge in the cities of the coast, some crossed the sea to Italy, others, especially those belonging to the nobility, resettled to the north in that part of Slavonia still under the crown of Hungary-Croatia. Their clan organisation definitely disrupted, the single Breber families settled in various places in the county of Zagreb (&quot;Comitatus Zagrabiensis)&quot; (Adamcek &amp; Kampus, 1976). In the second half of the 16th century we find one nucleus settled in Turopolje (&quot;Campus Zagrabiensis&quot;) where they joined the free community of lesser nobles (&quot;nobiles unius sessionis&quot;). Another group established itself at Stubica and other places in the Zagorje region, where one branch, the counts Jankovic Bribirsky, owned the Horvatska manor in the 17th century and remained one of the prominent local families till the 20th century. Breber families are still living in these places to this day.

==Noble branches==
===Zrinski branch===

In 1347 King Louis I of Hungary conferred on this branch of the Brebers, in the persons of Count Gregory and Count George (Grgur and Juraj in Croatian), respectively son and nephew of Ban Paul, the Zrin Castle (in exchange for the strategically important castle of Ostrovica, their last holding outside of ancestral Bribir. This branch would be known by the surname of Zrin (but also variously &quot;a Zrinio, Zrinski, Zrínyi, Zrini, de Serin, Sdrin&quot; following Latin, contemporary Croatian, Hungarian, French, or Italian usage) which rose to its height of fame and glory with Count Nikola IV (1508–1566), the hero of Szigetvár, and with Count Nikola VII (1620–1664), the Scourge of the Ottomans.

Mark Forstall (or Marcus Forstall), the secretary of the latter, compiled a history of the Zrins, tracing it back to the Brebers, to the tribe of Šubić, and from there to the Roman &quot;gens Sulpicia&quot; which, according to Suetonius, sprang from the love of Zeus for Pasiphaë. Even the illustrious erudite Charles Ducange (1610–1688) mentions these fabulous origins in his Illyrici Veteris et Novi, p. 237:&quot;Dynastae in Zrinio magno semper in Dalmatia, et in Croatia potentatu gaudebant, primum ante anno 1347. Breberiensium, deinde Zriniorum nomine cogniti: Comites Breberienses ex antiquo Sulpitorum Romanorum genere orti, Subich a Dalmatis patrio cognominabantur sermone&quot;.A feeling for classical antiquity was a cultural feature of the Renaissance and the wish to establish a link with the great tradition of Rome was a common vanity of those times. The claim of the Zrins, however, is not totally groundless. During the times of the Roman Empire, Dalmatia was a senatorial province and would have affiliations with the patrician families of the capital. P. Sulpicius Rufus was governor of Illyricum around 45 B.C. and could have established a settlement of &quot;clientes&quot; here, as was the general custom during Roman rule. Varvaria was a Roman &quot;municipium&quot; under Italic law but was actually enrolled in the tribe Claudia. Archaeological evidence at Bribir shows no sign of interruption of human occupation between the Roman &quot;municipium&quot; and the arrival of the Croats. This belonging of the &quot;Breberienses&quot; to the universe of Rome is revealed by their emergence to power in the time when Croatia was placed under papal suzerainty during the reign of Zvonimir (1075–1089), and also when later they bitterly fought and defeated (1227) the Kacic kindred, champions of the heretical party. And later still when the Pope would address ban Mladen as &quot;dilectus filius&quot; (1319). Other kindreds and families in Croatia and Dalmatia like the Karin, the Babonić, the Frankopan, the Gusić and some of the patrician families from the maritime cities also claimed a similar link with Rome.

Count Martino Zrinski or Sdrigna, was born in 1462 and was the son of Count Peter II and brother of Nikola III, father of Nikola IV, the one who is referred to in history as Nikola the Great Zrinski of Siget (Szigetvár in Hungarian). Martino Zrinski was the first member of the Zrinski family to live in Cefalonia, Greece. He adopted the name of Sdrin or Sdrinia. 

===Other branches===
Another branch of the Breber clan, descended from Peter living at the beginning of the 14th century, owed its rise to having remained unshakeably loyal to Sigismund of Luxemburg, the future Holy Roman Emperor (1411), in his struggle for the crown of Hungary-Croatia against King Ladislaus of Naples. Nikola, James and John, &quot;nobiles de Breberio&quot;, were confirmed in their possessions. James was nominated Viceban. The family also received the castle of Perna with all the appurtenances. This family was then known as Perényi (&quot;Peranski&quot; in Croatian, or &quot;Peransky, de Perén, a Pernya&quot; in other languages) and was numbered among the magnates of Hungary up to the 20th century. Gabriel Perényi and bishop Francis Perényi fell fighting in the fateful Battle of Mohács (29 August 1526).

Another family branch that rose to wealth and power were the descendants of &quot;Ugrinus&quot; (died 1335). Known under the nickname of Melić, then Melith, which later became their surname, they obtained vast estates in Transylvania.

<doc id="496076" wikidata="Q325974" url="?curid=496076" title="Pierre Drieu La Rochelle">
<text>Pierre Eugène Drieu La Rochelle (; 3 January 1893 – 15 March 1945) was a French writer of novels, short stories, and political essays. He was born, lived and died in Paris. Drieu La Rochelle became a proponent of French fascism in the 1930s, and was a well-known collaborationist during the German occupation. He is best known for his books &quot;Le Feu Follet&quot; and &quot;Gilles&quot;.

==Early life==
Drieu was born into a middle class family from Normandy, based in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. His father was an unsuccessful lawyer who relied on his wife&#x27;s dowry and ended up squandering it, being &quot;responsible for a sharp decline in the family&#x27;s social status&quot; by the time of his son&#x27;s adolescence. 

Although a brilliant student, Pierre failed his final exam at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques. Wounded three times, his experience as a soldier during World War I had a deep influence on him and marked him for the rest of his life. 

In 1917, Drieu married Colette Jéramec, the sister of a Jewish friend. They divorced in 1921. Sympathetic to Dada and to the Surrealists and the Communists, and a close friend of Louis Aragon in the 1920s, he was also interested in the royalist Action Française, but refused to adhere to any one of these political currents. He wrote &quot;Mesure de la France&quot; (&quot;Measure of France&quot;) in 1922, which gave him some small notoriety, and edited several novels.

In Drieu&#x27;s political writings, he argued that the parliamentary system (the &quot;gouvernement d&#x27;assemblée&quot; of the French Third Republic) was responsible for what he saw as the &quot;decadence&quot; of France (economic crisis, declining birth rates, etc.). In his essays &quot;Le Jeune Européen&quot; (&quot;European Youth&quot;, 1927) and &quot;Genève ou Moscou&quot; (&quot;Geneva or Moscow&quot;, 1928), Drieu La Rochelle advocated a strong Europe and denounced the &quot;decadent materialism&quot; of democracy. He believed that a federal Europe could bolster a strong economic and political union isolated from the imperialist Russians and Americans; in 1939 he came to believe that only Nazi Germany could deliver such an autarkian promise. 

His pro-European views expressed in 1928 were soon followed by closer contacts with employers&#x27; organizations, among them Ernest Mercier&#x27;s Redressement Français, and then, at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s, with some currents of the Radical Party.

==Fascism and collaboration==
As late as 1931, in his essay &quot;L&#x27;Europe contre les patries&quot; (&quot;Europe Against the homelands&quot;), Drieu was writing as an anti-Hitlerian, but by 1934, especially after the 6 February 1934 riots organized by far right leagues before the Palais Bourbon, and then a visit to Nazi Germany in September 1935 (where he witnessed the Reichsparteitag rally in Nuremberg), he embraced Nazism as an antidote to the &quot;mediocrity&quot; of liberal democracy. After the 6 February 1934 riots, he contributed to the review &quot;La Lutte des Jeunes&quot; and reinvented himself as a fascist. The title of his October 1934 book &quot;Socialisme Fasciste&quot; (&quot;Fascist Socialism&quot;) was representative of his politics at the time. In it, he described his discontent with Marxism as an answer to France&#x27;s problems. He wrote that he found inspiration in Georges Sorel, Fernand Pelloutier, and the earlier French socialism of Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Proudhon.

Drieu La Rochelle joined Jacques Doriot&#x27;s fascist Parti Populaire Français (PPF) in 1936, and became the editor of its review, &quot;L&#x27;Emancipation Nationale&quot;, until his break with the party beginning in 1939. In 1937, with &quot;Avec Doriot&quot;, he argued for a specifically French fascism. He continued writing his most famous novel, &quot;Gilles&quot;, during this time.

He supported collaborationism and the Nazis&#x27; occupation of northern France. During the occupation of Paris, Drieu succeeded Jean Paulhan (whom he saved twice from the hands of the Gestapo) as director of the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; and thus became a leading figure of French cultural collaboration with the Nazi occupiers, who he hoped would become the leader of a &quot;Fascist International&quot;. His friendship with the German ambassador in Paris, Otto Abetz, pre-dated the war. He was a member of the committee of the Groupe Collaboration. Beginning in 1943, however, he became disillusioned by the New Order, and turned to the study of Eastern spirituality.

In a final, provocative act, he again embraced Jacques Doriot&#x27;s PPF, simultaneously declaring in his secret diary his admiration for Stalinism. Upon the liberation of Paris in 1944, Drieu had to go into hiding. Despite the protection of his friend André Malraux, and after a failed first attempt in July 1944, Drieu committed suicide.

<doc id="496077" wikidata="Q3134980" url="?curid=496077" title="Mountain Time Zone">
<text>The Mountain Time Zone of North America keeps time by subtracting seven hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when standard time (UTC−07:00) is in effect, and by subtracting six hours during daylight saving time (UTC−06:00). The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time at the 105th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory. In the United States, the exact specification for the location of time zones and the dividing lines between zones is set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 49 CFR 71.

In the United States, Canada, and Mexico, this time zone is generically called Mountain Time (MT). Specifically, it is Mountain Standard Time (MST) when observing standard time, and Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) when observing daylight saving time. The term refers to the Rocky Mountains, which range from British Columbia to New Mexico. In Mexico, this time zone is known as the or (&quot;Pacific Zone&quot;). In the United States and Canada, the Mountain Time Zone is to the east of the Pacific Time Zone and to the west of the Central Time Zone.

In some areas, starting in 2007, the local time changes from MST to MDT at 2am MST to 3am MDT on the second Sunday in March and returns at 2am MDT to 1am MST on the first Sunday in November.

Most of Mexico, and most of Arizona in the United States, do not observe daylight saving time (DST), and during the spring, summer, and autumn months they are on the same time as Pacific Daylight Time. The Navajo Nation is the only part of Arizona that observes DST. Its territory lies mostly within Arizona but extends into Utah and New Mexico (both observe DST statewide). Meanwhile, the Hopi Reservation, despite being completely surrounded by the Navajo Nation, does not observe DST, and neither do some Arizona state offices located within the Navajo Nation.

The largest city in the Mountain Time Zone is Phoenix, Arizona; the Phoenix metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan area in the zone. The largest city that observes daylight saving time is Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico.

==Canada==

One province and two territories are fully contained in the Mountain Time Zone:
*Alberta
*Northwest Territories
*Yukon (no DST)

On September 24, 2020, Yukon switched to the Mountain Standard Time year-round. Therefore, clocks in Yukon and Alberta are the same in the winter, and Alberta is one hour ahead in summer. Previously, the territory had used the Pacific Time Zone with daylight saving time: UTC−8 in winter and UTC−7 in summer.

One province and one territory are split between the Mountain Time Zone and the Pacific Time Zone:
*British Columbia – northeastern and southeastern regions
*Northwest Territories – Tungsten

One territory and one province are split between the Mountain Time Zone and the Central Time Zone:
*Nunavut: Kitikmeot Region 
*Saskatchewan: Lloydminster and vicinity

==Mexico==

As of October 30, 2022, Mexico abandoned daylight saving time, with certain exceptions. 
The following states have an offset equal to Mountain Standard Time:

:*Baja California Sur
:*Nayarit: except for the Bahía de Banderas municipality, which uses the Central Time Zone.
:*Sonora
:*Sinaloa
:*Chihuahua: Observes Daylight Savings Time, only in northwestern border municipalities (Janos, Ascensión, Juárez, Guadalupe, and Práxedis Gilberto Guerrero)
:*Revillagigedo Islands (Colima): three of the four islands have the same time as Mountain Time Zone: Socorro Island, San Benedicto Island and Roca Partida.

The following states have an offset equal to Mountain Daylight Time:

==United States==

Six states are fully contained in the Mountain Time Zone:
*Colorado
*Montana
*New Mexico
*Utah
*Wyoming
*Arizona (does not use daylight saving time except for Navajo Nation)
Three states are split between the Mountain Time Zone and the Pacific Time Zone. The following locations observe Mountain Time:
*Idaho: Southern Idaho and the portion of Idaho County south of the Salmon River
*Oregon: the majority of Malheur County
*Nevada: West Wendover
Five states are split between the Mountain Time Zone and the Central Time Zone. The following locations observe Mountain Time:
*Kansas: Sherman, Wallace, Greeley and Hamilton counties
*Nebraska: western one third
*North Dakota: the southwest corner counties (Adams, Billings, Bowman, Golden Valley, Grant, Hettinger, Slope, Stark) observe MST. The counties of McKenzie, Dunn, and Sioux are split.
*South Dakota: western half
*Texas: El Paso, Hudspeth, and northwestern Culberson counties

<text>Avranches (; ) is a commune in the Manche department, and the region of Normandy, northwestern France. It is a subprefecture of the department. The inhabitants are called &quot;Avranchinais&quot;.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
By the end of the Roman period, the settlement of &quot;Ingena&quot;, capital of the Abrincatui tribe, had taken the name of the tribe itself. This was the origin of the name &quot;Avranches&quot;. In 511 the town became the seat of a diocese (suppressed in 1790) and subsequently of a major Romanesque cathedral dedicated to Saint Andrew, Avranches Cathedral, which was dismantled during the French revolutionary period. As the region of Brittany emerged from the Roman region of Armorica, Avranchin was briefly held by Alan I, King of Brittany as part of the Kingdom of Brittany at the turn of the 10th century. The regions that later became the Duchies of Normandy and Brittany each experienced devastating Viking raids, with Brittany occupied by Vikings from 907 to 937. In 933 Avranches and its territory, the Avranchin, were ceded to the Normans.

Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, a magnate under William the Conqueror, was the son of Richard le Goz, Vicomte d&#x27;Avranches.

In 1172 (September 27–28) a council was held at Avranches in response to the murder of Anglo-Norman Saint Thomas Becket. Henry II, King of England, after due penance done at Avranches on 21 May 1172, was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of the holy prelate and reached the Compromise of Avranches with the Church, swearing fidelity to Pope Alexander III in the person of the papal legate.

The same council was forbidden to confer on children benefice, carrying with it the cure of souls, or on the children of priests for the churches of their fathers. Each parish was required to have an assistant (vicarius), and the Advent fast was commended to all who could observe it, especially to ecclesiastics.

The town was damaged in both the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Wars of Religion.

Álvaro Vaz de Almada was made 1st Count of Avranches by King Henry VI of England on August 8, 1444.

===Modern era===
The town lost some influence after the French Revolution during which the diocese was abolished, the bailif was removed and primary and secondary schools were closed. The town was also occupied and raided by troops both pro-republican and anti-revolutionary (Chouans). However, in 1802 the Avranches diocese was restored as part of the Diocese of Coutances.

Many English families settled here after the Treaty of Paris (1814).

A literary description of the town in the 19th century is recorded in Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s novel &quot;Notre Cœur&quot;, when the main character Mariolle meets his lover and sets out for Mont Saint-Michel:
&quot;The houses crowning the heights gave to the place from a distance the appearance of a fortification. Seen close at hand, it was an ancient and pretty Norman city, with small dwellings of regular and almost similar appearance built closely adjoining one another, giving an aspect of ancient pride and modern comfort, a feudal yet peasant-like air.&quot;

The liberation of Avranches during World War II was led by General George S. Patton and began on 31 July 1944.

On 1 January 2019, the former commune Saint-Martin-des-Champs was merged into Avranches.

==Geography==
Avranches is situated at the southern end of the Cotentin Peninsula on the E40 road connecting Saint-Lô with Brittany and on the rail line between Lison (linking to Caen) and Dol (linking to Rennes).

The town was founded on high ground overlooking the dunes and coastal marshes along the bay forming the corner between the peninsulas of the Cotentin and Brittany. From Avranches, it is possible to see the Mont Saint-Michel, which was founded by Saint Aubert, Bishop of Avranches in the 8th century.

==Population==
==Sights==
A museum, Le Scriptorial, houses the collection of manuscripts of Mont Saint-Michel, deposited in the municipal archives during the French Revolution. It is one of the largest collections of medieval illuminated manuscripts in France, outside national and university libraries.

Formerly dominated by the cathedral, where Henry II did penance, an open grassed area &quot;La Plate-Forme&quot; overlooking the bay towards Mont Saint-Michel displays only a few remnants of the destroyed building.

The major church Notre Dame des Champs (Avranches) was constructed in Gothic Revival style in the 19th century to restore the religious life of the town after the destruction of the cathedral. The basilica church of Saint Gervais houses a treasury, best known for the purported skull of Saint Aubert complete with hole where the archangel Michael&#x27;s finger pierced it (probably a prehistoric trepanned skull).

The botanical gardens were founded in the grounds of the former Franciscan convent in the late 18th century. The expansion and introduction of exotic species in the 19th century and the location of the gardens overlooking the bay made the gardens an important sight in the town.

The Manoir de Brion, an ancient Benedictine priory of Mont Saint-Michel, is located in Dragey.

Avranches is twinned with St. Helier in Jersey. On 2 March 2010 a Jersey-registered boat &quot;Archangel&quot; succeeded in reaching Avranches at Marcey-les-Grèves. It is believed this was the first instance of a foreign vessel reaching Avranches in modern times.
&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="496091" wikidata="Q8026565" url="?curid=496091" title="Winthrop Fleet">
<text>The Winthrop Fleet was a group of 11 ships led by John Winthrop out of a total of 16 funded by the Massachusetts Bay Company which together carried between 700 and 1,000 Puritans plus livestock and provisions from England to New England over the summer of 1630, during the first period of the Great Migration.

==Motivation==
The Puritan population in England had been growing for several years leading up to this time. They disagreed with the practices of the Church of England, whose rituals they viewed as superstitions. An associated political movement attempted to modify religious practice in England to conform to their views, and King James I wished to suppress this growing movement. Nevertheless, the Puritans eventually gained a majority in Parliament. James&#x27; son Charles came into direct conflict with Parliament, and viewed them as a threat to his authority. He temporarily dissolved Parliament in 1626, and again the next year, before dissolving it permanently in March 1629. The King&#x27;s imposition of Personal Rule gave many Puritans a sense of hopelessness regarding their future in that country, and many prepared to leave it permanently for life in New England, and a wealthy group of leaders obtained a royal charter in March 1629 for the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

A fleet of five ships had departed a month previously for New England that included approximately 300 colonists led by Francis Higginson. However, the colony leaders and the bulk of the colonists remained in England for the time being to plan more thoroughly for the success of the new colony. In October 1629, the group who remained in England elected John Winthrop to be Governor of the Fleet and the Colony. Over the ensuing winter, the leaders recruited a large group of Puritan families, representing all manner of skilled labor to ensure a robust colony.

==Voyage==
The initial group (&quot;Arbella&quot; and her three escorts)
departed Yarmouth, Isle of Wight on April 8, 
the remainder following in two or three weeks. Seven hundred men, women, and children were distributed among the ships of the fleet. The voyage was rather uneventful, the direction and speed of the wind being the main topic in Winthrop&#x27;s journal, as it affected how much progress was made each day. There were a few days of severe weather, and every day was cold. The children were cold and bored, and there is a description of a game played with a rope that helped with both problems. Many were sick during the voyage.

The Winthrop Fleet was a well-planned and financed expedition that formed the nucleus of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They were not the first settlers of the area; there was an existing settlement at Salem, started in about 1626 and populated by a few hundred Puritans governed by John Endicott, who had arrived in 1629 and seized control from Roger Conant. Winthrop superseded Endicott as Governor of the Colony upon his arrival in 1630. The flow of Puritans to New England continued for another ten years, during a period known as the Great Migration.

==Ships==

Winthrop&#x27;s journal lists the 11 ships in his fleet:

* &quot;Arbella&quot;: The flagship, designated &quot;Admiral&quot; in the consortship; named for Lady Arbella, wife of Isaac Johnson (see below)
* &quot;Talbot&quot;: Designated &quot;Vice Admiral&quot;; Henry Winthrop sailed on this ship, John Winthrop&#x27;s son and first husband of Elizabeth Fones 
* &quot;Ambrose&quot;: Designated &quot;Rear Admiral&quot;
* &quot;Jewel&quot;: Designated &quot;Captain&quot;
* &quot;Mayflower&quot; (not the &quot;Mayflower&quot; of the Pilgrims)
* &quot;Whale&quot;
* &quot;Success&quot;
* &quot;Charles&quot; 
* &quot;William and Francis&quot; 
* &quot;Hopewell&quot; 
* &quot;Trial&quot;

Six other ships arrived at Massachusetts Bay in 1630 for a total of seventeen that year.

==Notable passengers==

Nine leading men applied for the charter for the Massachusetts Bay Colony and came to New England in Winthrop&#x27;s Fleet.

*John Winthrop, Governor, and his sons Henry Winthrop and two minors
* Sir Richard Saltonstall, three sons, and two daughters
*Isaac Johnson and his wife Lady Arbella, daughter of Thomas Clinton, 3rd Earl of Lincoln
*Rev. George Phillips, co-founder of Watertown
*Charles Fiennes 
*Thomas Dudley, his wife, two sons, and four daughters
*William Coddington, a Governor of Rhode Island Colony and his wife
*William Pynchon and his wife and three daughters
*William Vassall, for whom Vassalboro, Maine was named, and his wife
*John Revell, merchant, who lent money to the Plymouth Colony, and who was chosen assistant to the Massachusetts Bay Colony
* Captain Thomas Wiggin, the first Governor of the Province of New Hampshire
Ezekiel Richardson, Converse and Mousall were some of the original founders of Woburn ( from Charlestown). 
Other passengers of historical significance include:
* Robert Abell
* Stephen Bachiler, founder of Hampton, New Hampshire
* Simon Bradstreet and his wife Anne Bradstreet
* Jehu Burr, ancestor of Aaron Burr
* Samuel Cole, purveyor of the first tavern in the new world

* William Hawthorne, Ancestor of Author Nathaniel Hawthorne 

*William Chesebrough (1595-1667) Founder &amp; Prominent Citizen of Stonington, CT, Farmer, Politician, &amp; Prominent member of Greater Boston Society

A complete list of passengers is maintained by The Winthrop Society, a hereditary organization of descendants of the Winthrop Fleet and later Great Migration ships that arrived before 1634.

Despite its not being cited as a reference herein, the definitive work on the Winthrop migration, its roots, structure, ships, and passengers is Robert Charles Anderson, &quot;The Winthrop Fleet: Massachusetts Bay Company Immigrants to New England, 1629–1630&quot; (Boston, 2012), 833 pp. All other accounts pale in comparison.

<doc id="496098" wikidata="Q204772" url="?curid=496098" title="Achaia (Roman province)">
<text>Achaia (), sometimes spelled Achaea, was a province of the Roman Empire, consisting of the Peloponnese, Attica, Boeotia, Euboea, the Cyclades and parts of Phthiotis, Aetolia and Phocis. In the north, it bordered on the provinces of Epirus vetus and Macedonia. The region was annexed by the Roman Republic in 146 BC following the sack of Corinth by the Roman general Lucius Mummius, who was awarded the surname &quot;Achaicus&quot; (&#x27;conqueror of Achaia&#x27;). Initially part of the Roman province of Macedonia, it was made into a separate province by Augustus.

Achaia was a senatorial province, thus free from military men and legions, and one of the most prestigious and sought-after provinces for senators to govern. Athens was the primary center of education for the imperial elite, rivaled only by Alexandria, and one of the most important cities in the Empire. Achaia was among the most prosperous and peaceful parts of the Roman world until late antiquity, when it first suffered from barbarian invasions. The province remained prosperous and highly urbanized, however, as attested in the 6th-century &quot;Synecdemus&quot;.

The Slavic invasions of the 7th century led to widespread destruction, with much of the population fleeing to fortified cities, the Aegean islands and Italy, while some Slavic tribes settled the interior. The territories of Achaia remaining in Byzantine hands were grouped into the theme of Hellas.

== History ==
=== Conquest and Republican period ===
In 150–148 BC the Romans fought the Fourth Macedonian War, after which they annexed Macedon, formerly the largest and most powerful state in mainland Greece. In 146 BC the Achaean League initiated the Achaean War against Rome. The contemporary historian Polybius blames the demagogues of the cities of the Achaean League for encouraging a rash decision and inciting a suicidal war. The League was quickly defeated by Lucius Mummius and its main city, Corinth, was destroyed. After the war, the Romans annexed mainland Greece. A group of ten commissioners &quot;put down democracies&quot; in the Greek cities (Pausanias) through a programme of &quot;constitutional restructuring&quot; which involved the introduction of property qualifications for participating in civic politics, temporarily abolished the Achaean, Boeotian, Locrian, and Phocaean Leagues, and levied tribute on the individual cities. However, the cities remained mostly self-governing. Athens and Sparta, which had not participated in the war remained autonomous and free. It is disputed whether Greece became part of the Roman province Macedonia or was left unincorporated. Interventions by the governor of Macedonia in Greek affairs are attested, but also the dispatch of separate legates direct from Rome. Roman governance over the following century remained &quot;rather ad hoc.&quot;

In the Dyme Affair of 144 BC, a faction in the city of Dyme passed laws &quot;contrary to the type of government granted by the Romans,&quot; staged a revolution, and destroyed their town hall and official records. At the request of the Dymaean town councillors, Quintus Fabius Maximus issued a ruling, sentencing the revolutionaries to death. An inscription recording judicial decisions made in the Greek city of Demetrias in the mid-second century BC says that the judgements were made in accordance with local law and &quot;the edicts and judgements of the Romans&quot;, indicating that Roman law was already considered to apply to the region only a few years after the Achaean War.

In the following decades, many Greek communities sought to establish treaty relationships of &quot;friendship and alliance&quot; with Rome, apparently finding this preferable to free status. Treaties are attested, mostly by inscriptions, with Epidaurus and Troezen in the late second century BC, Astypalaea in 105 BC, Thyrium in 94 BC. The cities probably sought these treaties as a way of safeguarding their territory from their larger neighbours. Rome was increasingly called upon by the Greek communities to arbitrate in disputes between them, instead of seeking inter-state arbitration as had been common in the Hellenistic period. In these disputes, &quot;friends and allies&quot; of the Romans were usually favoured.

====Mithridatic and civil wars====
The First Mithridatic War (89–85 BC) was fought in Attica and Boeotia, two regions which were to become part of the province of Achaia. In 89 BC, Mithradates VI Eupator, king of Pontus, seized the Roman Province of Asia (in western Anatolia). Mithridates then sent Archelaus (his leading military commander) to southern Greece, where he established Aristion as a tyrant in Athens. The Roman consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla landed in Epirus (in western Greece) and marched on Athens. He marched through Boeotia on his way to Attica. Sulla besieged Athens and Piraeus in 87-86 BC and then sacked Athens and destroyed Piraeus. He then defeated Archelaus at the Battle of Chaeronea and the Battle of Orchomenus, both fought in Boeotia in 86 BC. Roman rule was preserved. Following the war, Sulla pardoned the Greek cities that had followed Mithridates and restored the legal systems that had been given to them by the Romans previously. 

As the part of the Roman East closest to Italy, Greece was a central theatre of the civil wars of the Late Republic. The war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great culminated in Caesar&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Pharsalus in Thessaly in 48 BC. in 46 BC, southern Greece was separated out from Macedonia as a separate province for first time by Julius Caesar, who placed it under a proconsul, but this was reversed at some point after his assassination in 44 BC. Caesar also ordered the refoundation of Corinth, abandoned since 146 BC, as a Roman colony. Caesar&#x27;s assassins, led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, based themselves in Greece during the Liberators&#x27; civil war, until their defeat by Octavian and Mark Antony of the Second Triumvirate at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. After the battle, the Second Triumvirate assigned Greece along with the rest of the East to Mark Antony, who remained in control of it until his defeat by Octavian at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.

===Principate===
After the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium, the Emperor Augustus separated Greece, Thessaly, and part of Epirus from Macedonia in 27 BC. The new province was named Achaia and was a senatorial province (Macedonia remained a senatorial province as well). In AD 15, Emperor Tiberius, responding to complaints of mismanagement by the senatorial proconsul made Achaia and Macedonia Imperial provinces and placed both of them under the control of Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus, the Imperial procurator of Moesia. After Sabinus&#x27; death in AD 35, this situation continued under the new procurator, Publius Memmius Regulus, until AD 44, when Emperor Claudius separated Macedonia and Achaia once more and restored them to the Senate.

The Roman Emperor Nero visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the Ancient Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation. He was honoured with a victory in every contest, and in the following year, he proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at the Isthmian Games in Corinth, just as Flamininus had over 200 years previously. This grant of freedom was cancelled by Vespasian, who is meant to have quipped that &quot;the Greeks had forgotten how to be free.&quot;

Hadrian (117–138) was particularly fond of the Greeks, particularly Athens. He saw himself as an heir to Theseus and Pericles and had served as an eponymous archon of Athens before he became emperor. He carried out constitutional reforms at Athens in 126 and instituted a special &#x27;council of the Panhellenes&#x27;, where representatives of all Greek states met to discuss religious affairs, in Athens and under Athenian leadership. Hadrian was also responsible for large scale construction projects there, such as the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Athenians built the Arch of Hadrian in his honour nearby. Construction was also carried out by local notables, many of whom became Roman citizens and joined the Imperial elite, most notably Herodes Atticus.

During the Marcomannic Wars, in 170 or 171, the Costoboci invaded Roman territory, sweeping south through the Balkans to Achaia, where they sacked the sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis. Even though much of the invasion force was spent, the local resistance was insufficient and the procurator Lucius Julius Vehilius Gratus Julianus was sent to Greece with a small force to clear out the remnants of the invaders.
====Administration====
Many of the cities in the province, including Athens, Delphi, Thespis, and Plataea, were &quot;free cities&quot; and did not fall under the authority of the governor. From some time in the reign of Trajan a separate official the &quot;corrector&quot; was appointed to oversee their affairs. This office was increasingly merged with that of the provincial governor as time went on.

Legal cases could be appealed to the governor. He was advised by a &quot;council&quot; (&quot;consilium&quot;) and often delegated judicial powers to members of the council or other officials. There were also juries of provincials, composed of both Greeks and Roman citizens resident in the province. Cases regarding borders between provinces, free cities, and Roman colonies were usually decided by the emperor. Cases could only be appealed to these authorities if they involved more than a certain amount of money, involved status, or carried the death penalty.

====Culture====
The Pax Romana was the longest period of peace in Greek history, and Greece became a major crossroads of maritime trade between Rome and the Greek speaking eastern half of the empire. The Greek language served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the East and in Italy, and many Greek intellectuals such as Galen would perform most of their work in Rome. Roman culture was highly influenced by the Greeks; as Horace said, &quot;Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit&quot; (&quot;Captive Greece captured her rude conqueror&quot;). The epics of Homer inspired the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the Younger wrote using Greek styles. Some Roman nobles regarded the contemporary Greeks as backwards and petty, while still embracing the Greeks&#x27; literature, philosophy, and heritage.

During this time, Greece and much of the rest of the Roman east came under the influence of Early Christianity. The apostle Paul of Tarsus preached in Philippi, Corinth and Athens, and Greece soon became one of the most highly Christianized areas of the empire.

===Later Roman Empire===

Under Diocletian, the province of Achaia became a subdivision of the new diocese of Moesia. Under Constantine, the diocese was split and Achaia became part of the Diocese of Macedonia, which was itself assigned to the Praetorian prefecture of Italy or Illyricum at different points in the fourth century AD.

In 267, the Heruli led a naval invasion of the Aegean, before landing near Sparta and plundering the Peloponnese, including not only Sparta, but also Corinth, Argos, and the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. They then moved north and sacked Athens, before being defeated by a local force led by the Athenian Dexippus, whose writings were a source for later historians. In the aftermath of this invasion, much of the classical and imperial monuments of Athens were spoliated to build the Post-Herulian wall, which enclosed only a small area around the Acropolis. Although a smaller city, Athens remained a centre of Greek culture and especially of Neo-Platonist pagan philosophy.

Greece was again invaded in 395 by the Visigoths under Alaric I. Stilicho, who ruled as a regent for Emperor Arcadius, evacuated Thessaly and Arcadius&#x27; chief advisor Eutropius allowed Alaric to enter Greece, where he looted Athens, Corinth and the Peloponnese. Stilicho eventually drove him out around 397 and Alaric was made magister militum in Illyricum.

Greece remained part of the relatively cohesive and robust eastern half of the empire, which eventually became the center of the remaining Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman now referred to as Byzantine Empire. Contrary to outdated visions of Late Antiquity, the Greek peninsula was most likely one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman Empire. Older scenarios of poverty, depopulation, barbarian destruction, and civil decay have been revised in light of recent archaeological discoveries. In fact the polis, as an institution, appears to have remained prosperous until at least the 6th century. Contemporary texts such as Hierokles&#x27; &quot;Syndekmos&quot; affirm that late antiquity Greece was highly urbanised and contained approximately eighty cities. This view of extreme prosperity is widely accepted today, and it is assumed between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, Greece may have been one of the most economically active regions in the eastern Mediterranean.

==Economy==
Copper, lead, and silver mines were exploited in Achaia, though production was not as great as the mines of other Roman-controlled areas, such as Noricum, Britannia, and the provinces of Hispania. Marble from Greek quarries was a valuable commodity.

Educated Greek slaves were much in demand in Rome in the role of doctors and teachers, and educated men were a significant export. Achaia also produced household luxuries, such as furniture, pottery, cosmetics, and linens. Greek olives and olive oil were exported to the rest of the Empire.

<text>Kaupang was a Viking Age village that is generally considered to be the first town/marketplace in Norway. It is located near the present-day village of Tjøllingvollen in Larvik Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The village of &quot;Kaupang&quot; was located along the Viksfjorden, a branch off the main Larviksfjorden. The ancient Viking hall, &quot;Skiringssal&quot;, was located just inland from the fjord. Kaupang was an important merchant and craft center during the Viking Age and as yet the first known Norwegian trading outpost.

Kaupang is the site of the remains of one of Scandinavia&#x27;s earliest urban sites, established in year 800. Kaupang was abandoned in the mid-10th century. Kaupang has been described as Norway&#x27;s most important monument from the Viking Age.

==Name==
The name &quot;Kaupang&quot; was the Old Norse term for &quot;market-place&quot; composed of - (which means &quot;buy&quot;) and (which means &quot;fjord harbor&quot;), hence the name means something like &quot;buy fjord&quot; or &quot;buy harbor&quot; (similar to the literal translation of Copenhagen). 

==History==
Kaupang was founded in the 780s and abandoned for unknown reasons in the early 10th century. It was situated on a beach by Viksfjord in Larvik municipality. Documentary sources indicate that the area was an important royal seat in the 8th and 9th centuries.

There is a general perception that Kaupang is mentioned under the name of Skiringssal (Old Norse: &quot;Skíringssalr&quot;) in Ohthere of Hålogaland&#x27;s account of his travels. But the name of the port Ohthere visited at the end of the 9th century is only recorded as &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; in Old English, and there is no scientific evidence that &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; corresponded to Kaupang in Skiringssal.

==Excavation==
Archaeological evidence indicates that the site might have been the first proto-urban settlement of some significance in Norway. The excavations which have been conducted at Kaupang have found evidence for a handicraft and commercial center, with around 1,000 inhabitants. The settlement had diverse craft production and extensive trade with foreign countries. Commodities traded included iron, soapstone and perhaps fish.

In 1867 Nicolay Nicolaysen conducted the first excavations of the area, mapping one of the grave-fields around the settlement and excavating 79 grave mounds. He also uncovered a cremation cemetery, largely dated to the 10th century. Charlotte Blindheim started excavating in 1947 and completed her last publication in 1999, and Dagfinn Skre and his associates undertook a new program of work at Kaupang in 1997.

In the summer of 2000, the Institute for Archaeology, Conservation and Historical Studies at the University of Oslo began a new excavation program at Kaupang, under the direction of Dagfinn Skre, which ran until 2002, and a smaller excavation was conducted in Kaupang&#x27;s harbour area in 2003. In total, four possible houses were uncovered, as were a number of hearths, pits and postholes. Following the excavations, scholars worked on analysing both artifacts and environmental samples from the excavations.

The results from the post-excavation work have been published in a series of three books, the first of which became available in 2007, the last being published in 2011. Many of the approximately 100,000 finds from excavations have been on display at the University of Oslo, including Arab silver coins, gold coin from Dorestad, hundreds of glass beads, gold and bronze jewelry, pottery, weapons, and tools

<text>BirdWatch Ireland (BWI) is a voluntary conservation organisation and registered charity devoted to the conservation and protection of wild birds and their habitats in Ireland. It was formerly known as the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (IWC). Irish Wildbird Conservancy was founded in 1968, among others by Major Robert (Robin) Ruttledge, an Irish ornithologist who became its first president.

BWI has over 15,000 active members and supporters, and a network of 30 branches actively promoting the importance of birds and habitats, and general conservation issues. It publishes the annual journal &quot;Irish Birds&quot; and the quarterly magazine &quot;Wings&quot;. It manages a number of nature reserves including Little Skellig.

BirdWatch Ireland is a member of the Irish Environmental Network, the Sustainable Water Network (SWAN), Environmental (Ecological) NGOs Core Funding Ltd (EENGO), Working and Educating for Biodiversity (WEB) and the Irish Uplands Forum (IUF). They also work closely with the Irish National Biodiversity Data Centre in providing wildlife monitoring data.

==Controversy==
The Charities Regulator reported in November 2022 that there had been misuse of funds and inadequate internal controls. This followed revelations that the organisation had misspent restricted funds designated for specific projects on general expenditure including repairs to the chief executive&#x27;s wife&#x27;s car.

==Activities and programmes==
=== BirdTrack ===

BirdTrack is an online citizen science website, operated by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) on behalf of a partnership of the BTO, the RSPB, BirdWatch Ireland, the Scottish Ornithologists&#x27; Club and the Welsh Ornithological Society ().

=== Garden Bird Survey ===

The Garden Bird Survey (GBS) is one of BirdWatch Ireland&#x27;s most popular volunteer surveys which receives over 1,000 submissions annually when it takes place between December and February.

=== Report on declining Irish bird populations===
The organization released the &quot;Irish Wetland Bird Survey&quot; in the 1990s, when there were 1.2 million wintering waterbirds in Ireland. A recent analysis in April 2019 put the number at 760,000.

In July 2019, Birdwatch Ireland reported that the Irish bird population was in &quot;dramatic&quot; decline, with 40 percent of the country&#x27;s waterbirds, or half a million, lost in the prior 20 years. Loss of habitat was cited as the reason for the decline. Other reasons were climate changes, agriculture, hedge cutting, pollution, and the burning of scrub. Birdwatch Ireland called for Citizens&#x27; Assembly to examine the biodiversity loss. One of every five Irish bird species assessed in the survey was threatened with extinction. Lapwing numbers, according to Birdwatch Ireland, were down 67% in twenty years. It also said there had been an &quot;almost complete extermination&quot; of farmland birds, for example the corncrake. The curlew was reported on the verge of extinction in Ireland, with only 150 pairs remaining. In the 1960s, 5,000 pairs had been reported.

<text>Sir Matthew Crooks Cameron, (2 October 1822 – 25 June 1887) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1867 to 1878. He represented the riding of Toronto East. He served in the cabinet of the first Premier, John Sandfield Macdonald. After Macdonald&#x27;s defeat in 1871, he became leader of the Conservative Party and served as Leader of the Opposition until his retirement from politics in 1878. After the legislature, he served as Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas until his death in 1887. In 1887 he was made a Knight Bachelor.

==Background==
He was born in Dundas in Upper Canada, during his studies at Upper Canada College, he lost one leg after a shooting accident. Cameron later articled in law, was called to the bar in 1849 and entered practice with William Henry Boulton in Toronto, Ontario. He was created a QC on 27 March 1863, and elected a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada in April 1871. In 1887, he was created a Knight Bachelor shortly before his death.

==Politics==
In 1859, he was elected to Toronto City Council to represent St James&#x27; Ward. Two years, later, in January 1861, he was defeated in his effort to become Mayor of Toronto, but later that year, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for North Ontario. He was defeated in 1863 but was elected in an 1864 by-election when the incumbent, William McDougall, was forced to run for re-election after he was named to the executive council. Cameron was opposed to Confederation, preferring a legislative union. In 1867, he ran unsuccessfully in Ontario North in the federal election but was elected for Toronto East to the provincial legislature.

Cameron entered the Cabinet of Premier John Sandfield Macdonald in 1867 as Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Ontario.

In 1871, he became Commissioner of Crown Lands. With the defeat of the Macdonald government in the provincial election that December, Cameron became leader of the Ontario Conservative Party, but stepped down in 1878 to accept the appointment of Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas.

<doc id="496150" wikidata="Q1190533" url="?curid=496150" title="Botchan">
<text>is a novel written by Japanese author Natsume Sōseki in 1906. It is one of the most popular Japanese novels, read by many during their school years. The central theme of the story is morality, but there are generous amounts of humor and sarcasm alongside it.

== Background ==
The story is based on the author&#x27;s personal experience as a teacher dispatched to Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku. Sōseki was born in Tokyo, and dwelling in Matsuyama was his first experience living elsewhere. The novel is set at a middle school identified by critics as Matsuyama&#x27;s present day Ehime Prefectural Matsuyama Higashi High School.

== Plot summary ==
Botchan (young master) is the first-person narrator of the novel. He grows up in Tokyo as a reckless and rambunctious youth. In the opening chapter he hurts himself jumping from the second floor of his elementary school, fights the boy next door, and tramples a neighbor&#x27;s carrot patch by wrestling (sumo style) on the straw that covers the seedlings. His parents favor his older brother, who is quiet and studious. Botchan is also not well regarded in the neighborhood, having a reputation as the local roughneck. Kiyo, the family&#x27;s elderly maidservant, is the only one who finds anything redeeming in Botchan&#x27;s character.

After Botchan&#x27;s mother passes away, Kiyo devotes herself fervently to his welfare, treating him from her own allowance with gifts and favors. Botchan initially finds her affection onerous, but over time he grows to appreciate her dedication, and she eventually becomes his mother figure and moral role model.

Six years after his mother&#x27;s death, as Botchan is finishing middle school, his father falls ill and passes away. His older brother liquidates the family assets and provides Botchan with 600 yen before leaving to start his own career. Botchan uses this money to study physics for three years. On graduating, he accepts a job teaching middle school mathematics in Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku. He frequents Dōgo Onsen, a hot spring.

Botchan&#x27;s tenure in Matsuyama turns out to be short (less than two months) but eventful. His arrogance and quick temper immediately lead to clashes with the students and staff. The students retaliate excessively by tracking his every movement in the small town and traumatizing him during his &#x27;night duty&#x27; stay in the dormitory.

Mischief by the students turns out to be just the first salvo in a broader web of intrigue and villainy. The school&#x27;s assistant head teacher (Red Shirt) and English teacher (Squash) are vying for the hand of the local beauty (Madonna), and two camps have formed within the middle school staff. Botchan struggles initially to see through the guises and sort out the players. After several missteps, he concludes that Squash and the head mathematics teacher (Porcupine) hold the moral high ground in the conflict. Red Shirt, who presents himself as a refined scholar, turns out to be highly superficial and self-serving.

As the story progresses, Red Shirt schemes to eliminate his rivals. He begins by having Uranari (Squash) transferred to a remote post on the pretext of furthering his career. Next he uses a contrived street brawl and his newspaper connections to defame both mathematics teachers (Botchan and Porcupine) and to force Porcupine&#x27;s resignation.

Botchan and Porcupine realize that they cannot beat the system, so they scheme a way to get even. They stake out Red Shirt&#x27;s known haunt, an inn near the hot springs town, and catch him and his sidekick Hanger-on sneaking home in the morning after overnighting with geisha. With his usual eloquence, Red Shirt points out that they have no direct proof of any wrongdoing. Botchan and Porcupine overcome this technicality by pummeling both Red Shirt and Yoshikawa into submission on the spot.

After dispensing justice with his fists, Botchan drops a letter of resignation into the mail and immediately heads for the harbor. He returns to Tokyo, finds employment, and establishes a modest household with Kiyo. After Kiyo dies of pneumonia, he has her respectfully interred in his own family&#x27;s grave plot.

== Main characters ==
* Botchan (young master): The first-person narrator of the novel. Born and raised in Tokyo, he is fiercely proud of his Edokko (Tokyo man) pedigree. He graduates from the Tokyo Academy of Physics (currently Tokyo University of Science), and takes a job teaching middle school mathematics in Matsuyama on the Island of Shikoku.
* Kiyo (meaning &quot;pure&quot;): The old maidservant of Botchan&#x27;s family in Tokyo. She is a fallen aristocrat, dealing heroically with what life has dealt her. 
* Uranari (meaning &quot;unripe calabash&quot;): Nicknamed Uranari due to his plump face and pale complexion. His real name is Koga, and he is the middle school English teacher. Uranari is a very melancholic, but refined, gentleman. He is humble and self-effacing in the extreme, but his arranged engagement to the local beauty (Madonna) puts him in the eye of a tempest as a jealous rivalry unfolds.
* Yamaarashi (meaning &quot;porcupine&quot;): His real name is Hotta, and he is the middle school&#x27;s head mathematics teacher. Yamaarashi hails from Aizu. He has a strong physical presence and a booming voice. He sees himself as a champion of justice and does not shrink from confrontation. 
* Red Shirt: Nicknamed so because he always wears a red flannel shirt, even in hot weather. His real name is not given. Red Shirt is the middle school&#x27;s head teacher and the only staff member with a doctoral degree (in literature). He presents himself as the sophisticated scholar. He sets his sights on Uranari&#x27;s fiancée (Madonna), and his scheme to usurp her creates the central conflict of the novel.
* Nodaiko (Field radish): His real name is Yoshikawa, and he is the middle school art teacher. Nodaiko is Red Shirt&#x27;s obsequious sidekick and an eager cohort in his schemes. 
* Tanuki (Japanese raccoon dog): His real name is not given. He is the middle school principal and a pseudo-intellectual. He prides himself on his professional demeanor and adherence to protocol, but he often plays the role of a puppet who is manipulated behind the scenes by Red Shirt.

== Supporting characters ==
* Botchan&#x27;s older brother: His name is not given. He is studious, pale in complexion, and somewhat effeminate. He is the favorite of the parents and not on good terms with Botchan. This older brother gets the upper hand over Botchan in argument and in shogi (Japanese chess), but he comes out on the losing end of their physical altercations. 
* Ikagin: Botchan&#x27;s first landlord in Matsuyama. He helps himself freely to Botchan&#x27;s tea while pressure-selling him antiques and curiosities. When Botchan rejects his sales tactics, he has Botchan removed as a tenant on false pretenses.
* Madonna: Nickname used by the middle school staff to refer to Miss Toyama. She is the local beauty who is engaged to Uranari by previous arrangement but coveted by Red Shirt.

== Major themes ==
* Botchan&#x27;s observations and thoughts about Matsuyama, on Shikoku, one of the four main islands of Japan. Botchan grows up in the rapidly modernizing Meiji-era Tokyo before moving to the more traditional Matsuyama. He is often confounded by the culture and customs of Matsuyama.
* The battle for the heart and mind of Botchan between Yama Arashi and Red Shirt. Will Botchan&#x27;s common sense and moral grounding be corrupted by Red Shirt, or will he team up with Yama Arashi to battle the elitist culture and its break from tradition and morals, for purely selfish gain, that Red Shirt represents? This is the question posed through much of the novel.
* At the time of the writing of &quot;Botchan&quot;, Japan was in the midst of a rapidly accelerating westernization, where traditional Japanese values and way of life were disappearing, especially in big cities such as Tokyo. Soseki himself had spent three years in London as a student of English literature. In his later works, Soseki seems to imply that the antagonist Red Shirt represents the author himself; an elitist intellectual who has only a shallow understanding of European culture, at odds with Japanese values and morals.

== Adaptations ==

Jiro Taniguchi adapted parts of the novel into his ten-volume series—published in Japan beginning in 1986—called &quot;The Times of Botchan&quot; in English. Other translations have appeared in French (&quot;Au temps de Botchan&quot;), Italian (&quot;&#x27;Ai tempi di Bocchan&quot;) and Spanish (&quot;La epoca de Botchan&quot;), all published by Coconino Press. A new translation has also appeared in Spanish, published by Editorial Impedimenta.

There were film adaptations by Toho predecessor P.C.L. in 1935; Tokyo Eiga in 1953; and Shochiku in 1958, 1966, and 1977. Numerous television adaptations have included the 1980 TMS Entertainment film supervised by Osamu Dezaki and the 1986 animated version in the form of two episodes of the anime series , which was released in North America by Central Park Media.

<text>Archibald McKellar (3 February 1816 – 11 February 1894) was briefly leader of Canada&#x27;s Ontario Liberal Party from 1867 to 1868 and, unofficially, the first Leader of the Opposition in Ontario&#x27;s new provincial legislature (though he was not officially recognised as such) and went on to serve as Commissioner of Public Works in Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat&#x27;s first government.

He was born in Inveraray, Scotland in 1816 and came to Upper Canada with his parents in 1817. He helped on the family farm in Kent County and was also part owner of a large sawmill at Chatham. He served in the militia during the Upper Canada Rebellion. McKellar later moved to Chatham where he served on the town council and was also reeve from 1856 to 1857. He married Lucy McNab in 1836 but widowed in 1857. In 1857, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Kent and he served until Confederation. He was defeated by Rufus Stephenson when he ran in Kent in the 1867 election, but he was elected to the 1st Parliament of Ontario for Bothwell in 1867 and 1871. He married a second to Mary Catherine Powell in 1874.

He was elected in the new district of Kent East in 1875. However, the opposition had accused him of taking advantage of his position to award contracts to his friends. Although he was cleared of any wrongdoing, he retired from politics in 1875 and was appointed sheriff in Wentworth County. He died in Hamilton in 1894.

The township of McKellar in Parry Sound District was named in his honour.
