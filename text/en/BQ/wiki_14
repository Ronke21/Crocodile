<text>Börte Üjin (; Mongolian: ), better known as Börte (), was the first wife of Temüjin, who became Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire. Börte became the head of the first Court of Genghis Khan, and Grand Empress of his Empire. She was betrothed to Genghis at a young age, married at seventeen, and then kidnapped by a rival tribe. Her husband&#x27;s rescue of her is considered one of the key events that started him on his path to becoming a conqueror. She gave birth to four sons and five daughters, who, along with their own descendants, were the primary bloodline in the expansion of the Mongol Empire.

== Early life ==
Few historical facts are known about her early life, though she is a subject of a number of Mongolian legends. What little is known is generally from &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, the oldest surviving literary work in the Mongolian language, written for the Mongol royal family some time after the death of Genghis Khan in 1227.

Börte was born into the Olkhonud of Khongirad. This tribe was friendly to the Borjigin tribe, into which Temüjin was born. She was the daughter of Dei-Sechen and Chotan. She was described as having a &quot;fair complexion&quot;, with &quot;light in her face and fire in her eyes&quot;, a term signifying intelligence. The girls that came from the Olkhonud tribe were known for being particularly beautiful.

== Marriage ==
Börte was the first wife of Temüjin. When Temüjin was 9 years old, his father Yesügei went in search of a wife for him. He set out to find a girl from Temüjin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s people, the Olqunu&#x27;ut, but along the way ran into Börte&#x27;s father, Dei-Sechen. Dei-Sechen explained he had a dream the previous night about Yesügei arriving with his son and believed this was a good omen. He explained that the women of his people, the Onggirat, were known for having beautiful girls; and stated that his daughter Börte, who was then 10, would make a good wife for Temüjin. Upon meeting Börte, Yesügei described her as a girl &quot;who had light in her face, who had fire in her eyes&quot;, and after spending the night asked Dei-Sechen for Börte&#x27;s hand in marriage for his son. Dei-Sechen agreed, under the condition that Temüjin stay with Börte&#x27;s family as his bride price.

On his return from this trip, Yesügei encountered some Tatars having a feast and decided to join them, whereupon they poisoned his food. He completed his journey back home before collapsing and ultimately passing away. Before he died, Yesügei insisted Temüjin be called back home to take care of his siblings in the absence of their father. Dei-Sechen agreed to allow Temüjin to return to his family, and so Börte and Temüjin were separated quickly after their betrothal.

In 1178, after 7 years apart, Temüjin set out to be reunited with Börte. After finding her in the same village in which she lived before, he married her, and the two left for a new home on the Senggür Stream, located in the Gürelgü Mountains. Soon after, they moved to set up a new homestead on the Burgi Escarpment near the Keuren River. Here, Börte&#x27;s dowry, a black sable coat, was gifted to Yesügei&#x27;s old friend Ong Qan, reestablishing a friendship between the two families.

== Abduction ==
Soon after her marriage to Temüjin was made official, the Burgi Escarpment was attacked by the Three Merkit, who were a confederation of three tribes inhabiting the basin of the Selenga and Orkhon Rivers. Temüjin and his family were able to escape on horses, but there were no horses left for Börte. A servant at the camp tried to hide Börte in an old cart, which he harnessed to an ox to try to escape upstream with her. The cart eventually broke and when the servant tried to keep moving Börte on foot, they were surrounded by soldiers who discovered her within the cart. The Three Merkit believed their raid victorious as they had planned it in retaliation for the abduction of Hö&#x27;elün, Temüjin&#x27;s mother, from their people many years before.

Temüjin was distressed by the abduction of his wife and remarked that his bed &quot;was made empty&quot; and his breast was &quot;torn apart&quot;. Ong Qan, who had been gifted Börte&#x27;s dowry, promised to help Temüjin recover Börte from the Three Merkit, and together they came up with a plan to return her. Eight months later the pair led a charge into the Barqujin territory, and upon their arrival the Merkit people fled in numbers down the Selengge River. Börte and Temüjin were finally reunited, as described in &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;:

Later, as Khan, Temüjin exterminated the Merkit people and enslaved their women.

== Rule ==

Börte brought with her independent wealth, based on her dowry, and a shrewd and intelligent mind. She shared some responsibilities with her mother-in-law Hö&#x27;elün, including the management of human and animal resources and the economy of the camp overall.

Around 1179, the first of Börte&#x27;s children, Qojin, was born. Börte&#x27;s nine children were integral to Temüjin&#x27;s rule; her five daughters would go on to marry key political allies to cement diplomatic relationships, while her four sons aided in Temüjin&#x27;s conquests throughout Asia.

Additionally, Börte managed pan-Asian trade routes, and acted as advisor to officials and merchants traveling these roads. She maintained considerable power in this position as detailed by multiple documented events. In one particular instance, she had successfully advised Temüjin to cut ties with Jamqua, a military leader, once she had deemed that the alliance was no longer mutually beneficial. Additionally, she insisted that a shaman, Teb Tenggeri, be challenged for insulting his youngest brother, Temuge Otchigin. Both of these requests were dutifully followed by Temüjin.

She was revered by the Mongols after Temüjin became Genghis Khan, and she was crowned the Grand Empress.

Börte, on several occasions, influenced her husband&#x27;s decisions, as Genghis both respected and appreciated Börte&#x27;s insight on political relationships. One such incident was when Otchigin came into Genghis Khan&#x27;s tent while he was still in bed with Börte, and asked for help against the Qongqotan tribe. Before Genghis Khan could say anything, Börte &quot;sat up in bed, covering her breasts with the edge of the blanket&quot; and described the cruelty of the Qongqotan. After listening to his wife speak, Genghis Khan decided to help Otchigin. There is also evidence of Börte influencing how strict Genghis was with members of his cabinet.

As Genghis Khan continued to expand his influence and empire, Börte remained behind and assisted Genghis&#x27; brother Temüge in ruling the Mongol homeland. Other wives accompanied Genghis Khan on his campaigns, while she ruled her own territory and managed her own court. Most of the Kherlen River was assigned to her, land that had before belonged to the Tatars. Only her sons were considered to be candidates to succeed Temüjin as Khans. Meanwhile, she also adopted multiple orphans, including Qutqu Noyan and Buda Noyan, and raised them as her own – greatly improving her reputation and social status as a mother.

== Family ==
Sons
* Jochi
* Chagatai
* Ögedei
* Tolui 

Daughters
* Kua Ujin Bekhi, the eldest, was betrothed to Tusakha, son of Senggum, and grandson of Wang Khan, ruler of the Keraite tribe; she eventually married Botu, of the Ikires tribe, and widower of her paternal aunt Temulun.
* Alakhai Bekhi, married first to Alaqush Digit Quri, chieftain of the Ongüt tribe; then to his nephew and heir Jingue; and finally to her stepson Boyaohe.
* Tümelün, married to Chigu, son of Alchi, son of Dei Seichen, Börte&#x27;s father.
* Al Altan, married the powerful Uyghur ruler Barchuk.Shortly after the accession of Güyük Khan in the 1240s, she was tried and executed on charges that were later suppressed.
* Checheikhen, married to Törölchi, son of Quduka beki, of the Oirat tribe.
Börte and Temüjin placed great faith (and territory) unto their children, also supplying them with considerable wealth and positions to inherit. There was some family conflict over succession; there were doubts about the true father of Jochi, as it is feasible that Börte was raped during her kidnapping and, therefore, that Jochi&#x27;s father may be one of her captors. Chagatai, Jochi&#x27;s brother, often chided Jochi for these claims, which often led to quarrels between the two brothers. Temüjin reportedly wholeheartedly denied this accusation, calling them disrespectful and claiming Jochi as his son. As a result of this infighting, Genghis Khan opted for neither Jochi nor Chagatai to take over his legacy as Khan. Instead, Ogodei was selected to rule because he was a peacemaker between his two brothers. Ogodei and Tolui took the reins of their parents’ legacies and their children continued to rule as Khan in many later generations. Both Jochi and Chagatai would also go on to become rulers of territorial divisions, although not the entire empire. Jochi&#x27;s descendants, for example, would found and rule over the Golden Horde in the west.

== Legacy and modern representations ==
Börte died in 1230 after her husband passed away. Ultimately, throughout her life, Börte earned reverence and respect from the Mongols. She was an admired mother figure for the whole empire, an image which was bolstered by her relationships with both her biological and adopted children. She also cultivated political marriages for her daughters, solidifying diplomatic relations. Throughout history, the Onggiard would use political marriages to ensure amicable relations between the parties involved, with the daughters acting as &quot;intercessors&quot;. In this manner, Börte acted both as an advisor to her husband and as a trainer to her daughters, cultivating them to believe in their mission as &quot;representatives, diplomats, and active participants in affairs of state&quot;.

Given her significant role in Genghis Khan&#x27;s life, Börte has appeared as a prominent character in the many films and television series based on her husband&#x27;s life and conquests. The actresses who have portrayed her include Susan Hayward in &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, Françoise Dorléac in &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; and Chuluuny Khulan in the 2007 Oscar nominated Russian film &quot;Mongol&quot;. She has also appeared as a playable character in the video game &quot;Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast&quot;, created by the popular metal band of the same name.

<doc id="489483" wikidata="Q335080" url="?curid=489483" title="Makoto Shinkai">
<text>, known as
, is a Japanese filmmaker and novelist. He is known for his anime feature films produced with CoMix Wave Films.

Shinkai began his career as a video game animator with Nihon Falcom in 1996, and gained recognition as a filmmaker with the release of the original video animation (OVA) &quot;She and Her Cat&quot; (1999). Shinkai then released the science fiction OVA &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; in 2002 as his first feature with CoMix Wave, followed by his debut feature film &quot;The Place Promised in Our Early Days&quot; (2004).

Shinkai&#x27;s films have consistently received highly positive reviews from both critics and audiences, and he is considered to be one of Japan&#x27;s most commercially successful filmmakers. His three most recent films &quot;Your Name&quot; (2016), &quot;Weathering with You&quot; (2019), and &quot;Suzume&quot; (2022) are all among the highest-grossing Japanese films of all time, both in Japan and worldwide at the time of their release.

==Early life==
Makoto Shinkai was born in Koumi, Nagano. His family runs a construction company. Shinkai studied Japanese literature at Chuo University, where he was a member of the juvenile literature club and drew picture books. Shinkai traces his passion for creation to the manga, anime and novels he was exposed to in middle school.

== Career ==
After graduating from Chuo University Faculty of Literature in March 1996, Shinkai got a job at Nihon Falcom, a video game company. He worked there for 5 years, making video clips for games and graphic design, including web content. During this time Shinkai met musician Tenmon, who later scored many of his movies.

In 1999, Shinkai released &quot;She and Her Cat&quot;, a five-minute short piece done in monochrome. It won several awards, including the grand prize at the 12th DoGA CG Animation Contest (2000). The short details the life of a cat, entirely from the cat&#x27;s perspective, as it passes time with its owner, a young woman.

After winning the grand prize, Shinkai began thinking about a follow-up while he continued working for Falcom. In June 2000, Shinkai was inspired to begin working on &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; by drawing a picture of a girl in a cockpit grasping a mobile phone. Sometime later, he was contacted by &quot;Manga Zoo&quot; (today a smartphone app), which offered to work with him, giving him a grant to turn his idea into an anime they could sell. In May 2001, Shinkai quit his job at Falcom and began to work on &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot;. In an interview, Shinkai noted that production took around seven months of &quot;real work&quot;.

&quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; was followed by the 90-minute &quot;The Place Promised in Our Early Days&quot;, which was released in Japan on November 20, 2004. It was critically acclaimed, winning many honors. Shinkai&#x27;s next project was &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot;, which premiered on March 3, 2007 and consists of three short films: &quot;Cherry Blossom&quot;, &quot;Cosmonaut&quot;, and &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot;. In September 2007, Nagano&#x27;s leading newspaper, &quot;Shinano Mainichi Shinbun&quot;, released a TV commercial animated by Shinkai.
Shinkai spent 2008 in London, resting after the completion of &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot;. He returned to Japan in 2009 to start work on his next project. He released two concept drawings for this film in December 2009. Shinkai noted that it would be his longest animation film to date and described the story as a &quot;lively&quot; animated film with adventure, action, and romance centered on a cheerful and spirited girl on a journey to say &quot;farewell&quot;. In November 2010, he revealed that his next work would be titled &quot;Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below&quot;. A teaser trailer was released on November 9, and the film was released on May 7, 2011.

His next feature, &quot;The Garden of Words&quot;, was released on May 31, 2013.

On August 26, 2016, Shinkai released &quot;Your Name.&quot; The film received widespread acclaim from audiences and critics, praising the film for its narrative, imagery, animation, music, emotional weight, and skillful use of post-postmodernist themes. The film was also a commercial success, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in Japan. Then by 2019, the film became the highest-grossing anime film of all time worldwide, overtaking Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.

Shinkai&#x27;s next project &quot;Weathering with You&quot; was released on July 19, 2019 in Japan. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $192.9 million worldwide and making it the tenth highest grossing Japanese film of all time.

&quot;Suzume,&quot; Shinkai&#x27;s seventh feature-length film, was released in Japan on November 11, 2022. The film was a further critical and commercial success, grossing over $300 million worldwide.

==Personal life==
Shinkai is married to retired actress and producer , who is best known for starring in &quot;Versus&quot;; the couple has a daughter, child actress , who was born in 2010.

His favorite anime films are &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Nausicaä&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; by Hayao Miyazaki, &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; by Hideaki Anno, and &quot;Patlabor 2: The Movie&quot; by Mamoru Oshii.

An asteroid, 55222 Makotoshinkai, is named after him.

<text>Hindūstān () was a historical region, polity, and a name for India, historically used simultaneously for northern Indian subcontinent and the entire subcontinent, used in the modern day to refer to the Republic of India by some but not officially. Being the Iranic cognate of the Indic word &quot;Sindhu&quot;, it originally referred to the land of lower Indus basin (present-day Sindh) during the ancient era, but was later extended to refer to northern Indian subcontinent. It finally referred to the entire subcontinent since the early modern period. Since the Partition of India in 1947, &quot;Hindustan&quot; continues to be used to the present day as a historic name for the Republic of India.

The Arabic equivalent of the term is Hind. The two terms are used synonymously in Hindi-Urdu. Hindustan was also commonly spelt as Hindostan in English. 

== Etymology ==

Hindustan is derived from the Persian word &quot;Hindū&quot; cognate with the Sanskrit &quot;Sindhu&quot;.
The Proto-Iranian sound change &quot;*s&quot; &gt; &quot;h&quot; occurred between 850 and 600 BCE, according to Asko Parpola. Hence, the Rigvedic &quot;sapta sindhava&quot; (the land of seven rivers) became &quot;hapta hindu&quot; in the Avesta. It was said to be the &quot;fifteenth domain&quot; created by Ahura Mazda, apparently a land of &#x27;abnormal heat&#x27;.
In 515 BCE, Darius I annexed the Indus Valley including &quot;Sindhu&quot;, the present day Sindh, which was called &quot;Hindu&quot; in Persian. During the time of Xerxes, the term &quot;Hindu&quot; was also applied to the lands to the east of Indus.

In middle Persian, probably from the first century CE, the suffix &quot;-stān&quot; was added, indicative of a country or region, forming the present word &quot;Hindūstān&quot;. Thus, Sindh was referred to as &quot;Hindūstān&quot;, or &quot;Indus land&quot; in the Naqsh-e-Rustam inscription of Shapur I in 262 CE.

Historian B. N. Mukherjee states that from the lower Indus basin, the term &quot;Hindūstān&quot; got gradually extended to &quot;more or less the whole of the subcontinent&quot;. The Greco-Roman name &quot;India&quot; and the Chinese name &quot;Shen-tu&quot; also followed a similar evolution.

The Arabic term &quot;Hind&quot;, derived from Persian &quot;Hindu&quot;, was previously used by the Arabs to refer to the much wider Indianised region from the Makran coast to the Indonesian archipelago. But eventually it too became identified with the Indian subcontinent.

In the time of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal empire, the ruling elite and its Persian historiographers made a further distinction between &quot;Hindustan&quot; and &quot;Hind&quot;. Hindustan referred to the territories of Northern India in the Miyan-Doab and adjacent regions under Muslim political control, while &quot;Hind&quot; referred to the rest of India. For example, the army of Ghiyas ud din Balban was referred to as &quot;Hindustani&quot; troops, who were attacked by the &quot;Hindus&quot;.

==Current usage==

===Republic of India===
&quot;Hindustan&quot; is often an informal and colloquial term to refer to the modern-day Republic of India. Slogans involving the term are commonly heard at sports events and other public programmes involving teams or entities representing the modern nation-state of India. In marketing, it is also commonly used as an indicator of national origin in advertising campaigns and is present in many company names. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and his party the Muslim League, insisted on calling the modern-day Republic of India &quot;Hindustan&quot; in reference to its Hindu-majority population.

=== Language ===
The &quot;Hindustani language&quot; is the language of Hindustan and the lingua franca of the northern Indian subcontinent. Hindustani derives from the Old Hindi language of Western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi areas. Its literary standard forms—Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu—use different scripts. The Hindi register itself derives its name from shortened form, &quot;Hind&quot; (India).

==Historical usages==

Early Persian scholars had limited knowledge of the extent of India. After the advent of Islam and the Muslim conquests, the meaning of &quot;Hindustan&quot; interacted with its Arabic variant &quot;Hind&quot;, which was derived from Persian as well, and almost became synonymous with it. The Arabs, engaging in oceanic trade, included all the lands from &quot;Tis&quot; in western Balochistan (near modern Chabahar) to the Indonesian archipelago, in their idea of &quot;Hind&quot;, especially when used in its expansive form as &quot;Al-Hind&quot;. &quot;Hindustan&quot; did not acquire this elaborate meaning. According to André Wink, it also did not acquire the distinction, which faded away, between &quot;Sind&quot; (roughly what is now western Pakistan) and &quot;Hind&quot; (the lands to the east of the Indus River); other sources state that &quot;Sind&quot; and &quot;Hind&quot; were used synonymously from early times, and that after the arrival of Islamic rule in India, &quot;the variants Hind and Sind were used, as synonyms, for the entire subcontinent.&quot; The 10th century text &quot;Hudud al-Alam&quot; defined &quot;Hindustan&quot; as roughly the Indian subcontinent, with its western limit formed by the river Indus, southern limit going up to the Great Sea and the eastern limit at Kamarupa, the present day Assam. For the next ten centuries, both &quot;Hind&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot; were used within the subcontinent with exactly this meaning, along with their adjectives &quot;Hindawi&quot;, &quot;Hindustani&quot; and &quot;Hindi&quot;. Indeed, in 1220 CE, historian Hasan Nizami described &quot;Hind&quot; as being &quot;from Peshawar to the shores of the [Indian] Ocean, and in the other direction from Siwistan to the hills of Chin.&quot;

=== Ghaznavids ===
With the Turko-Persian conquests starting in the 11th century, an accurate meaning of &quot;Hindustan&quot; took shape, defining the land of the river Indus. The conquerors were liable to call the lands under their control &quot;Hindustan&quot;, ignoring the rest of the subcontinent.
In the early 11th century a satellite state of the Ghaznavids in the Punjab with its capital at Lahore was called &quot;Hindustan&quot;. After the Delhi Sultanate was established, north India, especially the Gangetic plains and the Punjab, came to be called &quot;Hindustan&quot;. Scholar Bratindra Nath Mukherjee states that this narrow meaning of &quot;Hindustan&quot; existed side by side with the wider meaning, and some of the authors used both of them simultaneously. 

=== Delhi Sultanate ===
The Delhi Sultanate established differences between &quot;Hindustan&quot; and &quot;Hind&quot;, where Hindustan referred to the territories of today&#x27;s Northern India and the Punjab, the lands of the Indus. In the Miyan-Doab and adjacent regions under Muslim political control. For example, the army of Delhi Sultanate was referred to as &quot;Hindustani&quot; troops, who were attacked by the &quot;Hindus&quot;. 

=== Mughal Empire ===
The Mughal Empire (1526–1857) called its lands &#x27;Hindustan&#x27;. The term &#x27;Mughal&#x27; itself was never used to refer to the land. As the empire expanded, so too did &#x27;Hindustan&#x27;. At the same time, the meaning of &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; as the entire Indian subcontinent is also found in &quot;Baburnama&quot; and &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;. The Mughals made a further distinction between &quot;Hindustani&quot; and &quot;Hindu&quot;. In Mughal sources, Hindustani commonly referred to Muslims in Hindustan, while non-Muslim Indians were referred to as Hindus.

=== Kingdom of Nepal usage ===
The last Gorkhali King Prithvi Narayan Shah self proclaimed the newly unified Kingdom of Nepal as Asal Hindustan (Real Hindustan) due to North India being ruled by the Islamic Mughal rulers. The self proclamation was done to enforce Hindu social code Dharmashastra over his reign and refer to his country as being inhabitable for Hindus. He also referred Northern India as &quot;Mughlan&quot; (Country of Mughals) and called the region infiltrated by Muslim foreigners.

=== Colonial Indian usage ===
The dual meanings of the terms &quot;India,&quot; &quot;Hindustan,&quot; and the &quot;Mughal Empire&quot; persisted with the arrival of Europeans. For instance, Rennel produced an atlas titled the Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan or the Mogul Empire in 1792, which actually depicted the Indian subcontinent. This conflation of terms by Rennel illustrates the complexity and overlap of these concepts during that period. J. Bernoulli, to whom &quot;Hindustan&quot; meant the Mughal Empire, called his French translation &quot;La Carte générale de l&#x27;Inde&quot; (General Map of India).
This &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; of British reckoning was divided into British-ruled territories (more often referred to as &#x27;British India&#x27;) and the territories ruled by native rulers. The British officials and writers, however, thought that the Indians used &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; to refer to only North India. An &quot;Anglo-Indian Dictionary&quot; published in 1886 states that, while &quot;Hindustan&quot; means India, in the native parlance it had come to represent the region north of Narmada River excluding Bihar and Bengal.

During the independence movement, the Indians referred to their land by all three names: &#x27;India&#x27;, &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; and &#x27;Bharat&#x27;. Mohammad Iqbal&#x27;s poem &quot;Tarānah-e-Hindī&quot; (&quot;Anthem of the People of Hind&quot;) was a popular patriotic song among Indian independence activists.

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Sāre jahāṉ se acchā Hindustān hamārā&quot;
(the best of all lands is our Hindustan)
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Partition of India ===

The 1940 Lahore Resolution of the All-India Muslim League demanded sovereignty for the Muslim-majority areas in the northwest and northeast of British India, which came to be called &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; in popular parlance and the Dominion of India came to be called &#x27;Hindustan&#x27;. The British officials too picked up the two terms and started using them officially.

However, this naming did not meet the approval of Indian leaders due to the implied meaning of &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; as the land of Hindus. They insisted that the new Dominion of India should be called &#x27;India&#x27;, not &#x27;Hindustan&#x27;. Probably for the same reason, the name &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; did not receive official sanction of the Constituent Assembly of India, whereas &#x27;Bharat&#x27; was adopted as an official name. It was recognised however that &#x27;Hindustan&#x27; would continue to be used unofficially.

The Indian Armed Forces use the salutary version of the name, &quot;Jai Hind&quot;, as a battle cry.

<text>Transportes Aeromar, S.A. de C.V, doing business as Aeromar, was a Mexican airline that operated scheduled domestic services in Mexico and international services to the United States, and Cuba. Its main base was Mexico City International Airport.

The airline ceased all operations on February 15, 2023, following a financial collapse.

==History==
===Foundation and development===
The airline was established on January 29, 1987, and started operations on November 7, 1987, as &quot;Transportes Aeromar&quot;.

It was owned by Grupo Aeromar (a private company) (99.99%) and had 864 employees in July 2010. On April 1, 2010, Aeromar signed a commercial alliance with Continental Airlines. Aeromar then announced it would lease two Bombardier CRJ200 regional jets. These twin-jet aircraft were subsequently removed from the airline&#x27;s fleet.

On August 30, 2010, Aeromar and Continental Airlines announced a frequent flyer partnership that allowed each carrier&#x27;s passengers to earn and redeem miles on either airline. In addition, Continental international first and business class passengers, Presidents Club members, and Star Alliance Gold customers were able to access Aeromar&#x27;s Salon Aeromar lounge in Mexico City at that time. When Continental Airlines merged into United Airlines, the codeshare agreement was transferred over to United.

As of 2018, Avianca had expressed interest in acquiring or merging with Aeromar to become &quot;Avianca Mexico&quot;. The airline awaited a 100 million USD injection from Avianca&#x27;s parent company, Synergy Group. Avianca would&#x27;ve had to first acquire up to 49% of the airline over the next five months. The deal did not go through.

===Demise===
As of 2023, it was reported that the airline was $600 million USD in debt, primarily due to efforts to avoid a Mexican government financial collapse, and faced the possibility of cessation of operations after February 14, 2023. Operations had declined since 2020, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, reports also emerged that Brazilian start-up carrier Nella Linhas Aéreas had acquired Aeromar, according to logo updates on its official website and social platforms. The deal was reported to be pending, but would not proceed if debts were not canceled by the Mexican Federal Government.

Aeromar announced on February 15, 2023, the definitive cessation of its operations, due to financial problems, after 35 years of flying uninterruptedly in Mexico, the United States, and Cuba. Aeromar owes over MX$5 billion pesos (US$268 million) to different creditors, including the Mexican authorities. Several laid off employees have been offered jobs for airlines such as Aeroméxico, Aerus, and Volaris.

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
On February 1, 2011, Aeromar and Continental Airlines implemented codesharing on all routes at Aeromar&#x27;s hub in Mexico City International Airport. Aeromar then started operating additional domestic services such as flights to Durango, Matamoros, Ixtapa, and Piedras Negras; and announced it would re-evaluate its international services. Currently, the only international destination served by the airline is McAllen, Texas although Aeromar previously served Austin, Texas and San Antonio, Texas. When Continental Airlines merged into United Airlines, the codeshare agreement was transferred over to United.

On August 1, 2019, Aeromar and Turkish Airlines signed a codeshare agreement, after the latter carrier commenced operations to Mexico City. On August 3, 2021, Aeromar and Emirates signed an interline partnership that will provide customers with connectivity between destinations in Mexico and the United States through Mexico City with the Emirates global network. On March 29, 2022, Aeromar and Air Canada signed an interline agreement to boost connectivity between Mexico and Canada. The agreement was planned to grow by the summer season.

==Fleet==
Over the years, the Aeromar fleet consisted the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
In early 2015, Aeromar decided to remove its Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet aircraft from operations. The airline then supplemented its fleet of fifteen ATR 42 turboprops with two new larger ATR 72-600 aircraft. In November 2016, the airline ordered eight new ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft and optioned another six ATR 72s. Aeromar&#x27;s first ATR 42-600 was handed over by the airframer in December 2016.

==Services==
===Frequent Flyer Programs===
Aeromar participated in the United Airlines MileagePlus program and the Air Canada Aeroplan program, despite not being owned by United Airlines Holdings or Air Canada, nor being a member of Star Alliance, of which those airlines are currently a member.

===Airport lounges===
Salon Aeromar was Aeromar&#x27;s private airport lounge.

<text>Derbent (; ; ; ; ), formerly romanized as Derbend, is a city in Dagestan, Russia, located on the Caspian Sea. It is the southernmost city in Russia, and it is the second-most important city of Dagestan. Derbent occupies the narrow gateway between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus Mountains connecting the Eurasian Steppe to the north and the Iranian Plateau to the south; covering an area of , with a population of roughly 120,000 residents.

Derbent claims to be the oldest city in Russia, with historical documentation dating to the 8th century BC, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Due to its strategic location, over the course of history, the city changed ownership many times, particularly among the Persian, Arab, Mongol, Timurid, and Shirvan kingdoms. In the 19th century, the city passed from Persian into Russian hands by the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813.

==Etymology==
Derbent is derived from Persian &quot;Darband&quot; (, from &quot;dar&quot; &quot;door/gate&quot; + &quot;band&quot; &quot;barrier/dam&quot;, lit., &quot;gate in the barrier&quot;), referring to the eastern-most pass in the high Caucasus Mountains (whence the putative &quot;barrier/dam&quot;) on the beaches of the Caspian Sea. (The other pass, the Darial Pass, is in the Central Caucasus Mountains, and likewise carries a Persian name, standing for &quot;the Alan Pass/gate&quot; with the Alans being the modern Iranic Ossetians.)

It is often identified with the Gates of Alexander, a legendary barrier supposedly built by Alexander the Great in the Caucasus. The Persian name for the city came into use at the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century AD, when the city was re-established by Kavadh I of the Sassanid dynasty of Persia, but Derbent was probably already in the Sasanian sphere of influence as a result of the victory over the Parthians and the conquest of Caucasian Albania by Shapur I, the second shah of the Sassanid Persians. The geographical treatise Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr written in Middle Persian mentions the old name of the fortress – &quot;Wērōy-pahr&quot; (The Georgian Guard):

šahrestan [ī] kūmīs [ī] panj-burg až-i dahāg pad šabestān kard. māniš [ī] *pārsīgān ānōh būd. padxwadayīh [ī] yazdgird ī šabuhrān kard andar tāzišn ī čōl wērōy-pahr [ī] an ālag. (The city of Kūmīs of five towers Aži Dahag made it his own harem. The abode of the Parthians was there. In the reign of Yazdgird, the son of Šabuhr made it during the invasion of the Čōl, at the boundary of the Georgian Guard.).
-Wėrōy-pahr: &quot;The Georgian Guard&quot; The old name of the fortress at Darband;...

In Arabic texts the city was known as &quot;&quot;Bāb al-Abwāb&quot; (), simply as &quot;al-Bāb&quot; () or as &quot;Bāb al-Hadid&quot;&quot; (). A similar name meaning &quot;Iron Gate&quot; was used by Turkic peoples, in the form &quot;Demirkapi&quot;.

==History==

Derbent&#x27;s location on a narrow, three-kilometer strip of land in the North Caucasus between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus Mountains is strategic in the entire Caucasus region. Historically, this position allowed the rulers of Derbent to control land traffic between the Eurasian Steppe and the Middle East. The only other practicable crossing of the Caucasus ridge was over the Darial Gorge.

===Persian rule===
A traditionally and historically Iranian city, the first intensive settlement in the Derbent area dates from the 8th century BC; the site was intermittently controlled by the Persian monarchs, starting from the 6th century BC. Until the 4th century AD, it was part of Caucasian Albania which was a satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, and is traditionally identified with Albana, the capital. The modern name is a Persian word ( &quot;Darband&quot;) meaning &quot;gateway&quot;, which came into use in the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century AD, when the city was re-established by Kavadh I of the Sassanid dynasty of Persia, however, Derbent was probably already into the Sasanian sphere of influence as a result of the victory over the Parthians and the conquest of Caucasian Albania by Shapur I, the second shah of the Sassanid Persians. In the 5th century Derbent also functioned as a border fortress and the seat of a Sassanid marzban.

The walls with thirty north-looking towers are believed to belong to the time of Kavadh&#x27;s son, Khosrau I, who also directed the construction of Derbent&#x27;s fortress.

Some say that the level of the Caspian was formerly higher and that the lowering of the water level opened an invasion route that had to be fortified. The chronicler Movses Kaghankatvatsi wrote about &quot;the wondrous walls, for whose construction the Persian kings exhausted our country, recruiting architects and collecting building materials with a view of constructing a great edifice stretching between the Caucasus Mountains and the Great Eastern Sea&quot;. Derbent became a strong military outpost and harbour of the Sassanid Empire. During the 5th and 6th centuries, Derbent also became an important center for spreading the Christian faith in the Caucasus.

During periods when the Sasanians were distracted by war with the Byzantines or protracted battles with the Hephthalites in the eastern provinces, the northern tribes succeeded in advancing into the Caucasus. The first Sasanian attempt to seal off the road along the Caspian seacoast at Darband by means of a mud-brick wall has been dated in the reign of Yazdegerd II (438–457 AD).

Movses Kagankatvatsi left a graphic description of the sack of Derbent by the hordes of Tong Yabghu of the Western Turkic Khaganate in 627. His successor, 

As mentioned by the &quot;Encyclopedia Iranica&quot;, ancient Iranian language elements were absorbed into the everyday speech of the population of Dagestan and Derbent especially during the Sassanian era, and many remain current. In fact, a deliberate policy of “Persianizing” Derbent and the eastern Caucasus, in general, can be traced over many centuries, from Khosrow I to the Safavid shahs Ismail I, and ʿAbbās the Great. According to the account in the later &quot;Darband-nāma&quot;, after construction of the fortifications Khosrow I “moved much folk here from Persia”, relocating about 3,000 families from the interior of Persia in the city of Derbent and neighboring villages. This account seems to be corroborated by the Spanish Arab Ḥamīd Moḥammad Ḡarnāṭī, who reported in 1130 that Derbent was populated by many ethnic groups, including a large Persian-speaking population.

===Arab conquest===
In 643, Derbent was captured by the Arab Muslims, who called it the Gate of Gates (&quot;Bab al-Abwab&quot;), following their invasion of Persia. They transformed it into an important administrative center and introduced Islam to the area. The impression of antiquity evoked by these fortifications led many Arab historians to connect them with Khosrow I and to include them among the seven wonders of the world. The Darband fortress was certainly the most prominent Sasanian defensive construction in the Caucasus and could have been erected only by an extremely powerful central government. Because of its strategic position on the northern branch of the Silk Route, the fortress was contested by the Khazars in the course of the Khazar-Arab Wars. The Sassanids had also brought Armenians from Syunik to help protect the pass from invaders; as Arab rule weakened in the region at the end of the ninth century, the Armenians living there were able to establish a kingdom, which lasted until the early years of the thirteenth century. The Holy Saviour Armenian Church still rises up in the skyline, though it is used as the Museum of Carpet, Arts and Crafts today due to the decline in the Armenian population. There was also a second Armenian church and two Armenian schools which served the Armenian community, which numbered about 3,000 in the census of 1913.

Excavations on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, opposite to Derbent, revealed the Great Wall of Gorgan, the eastern counterpart to the wall and fortifications of Derbent. Similar Sassanian defensive fortifications there—massive forts, garrison towns, long walls—also run from the sea to the mountains.

The Caliph Harun al-Rashid lived in Derbent and brought it into great repute as a seat of the arts and commerce. According to Arab historians, Derbent, with a population exceeding 50,000, was the largest city of the 9th century in the Caucasus. In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. Emirate of Derbent often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of Sarir, allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent&#x27;s politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the Mongol invasion in 1239. In the 14th century, Derbent was occupied by Timur&#x27;s armies.

===Shirvanshah era===
The Shirvanshahs dynasty existed as independent or a vassal state, from 861 until 1538; longer than any other dynasty in the Islamic world. They were renowned for their cultural achievements and geopolitical pursuits. The rulers of Shirvan, called the Shirvanshahs, had attempted, and on numerous times, succeeded, to conquer Derbend since the 18th Shirvanshah king, Afridun I, was appointed as the governor of the city. Over the centuries the city changed hands often. The 21st Shirvanshah king, Akhsitan I, briefly reconquered the city. However, the city was lost once again to the northern Kipchaks.

After the Timurid invasion, Ibrahim I of Shirvan, the 33rd Shirvanshah, managed to keep the kingdom of Shirvan independent. Ibrahim I revived Shirvan&#x27;s fortunes, and through his cunning politics managed to continue without paying tribute. Furthermore, Ibrahim also greatly increased the limits of his state. He conquered the city of Derbend in 1437. The Shirvanshahs integrated the city so closely with their political structure that a new branch of the Shirvan dynasty emerged from Derbend, the Derbenid dynasty. The Derbenid dynasty, being a cadet dynasty of Shirvan, inherited the throne of Shirvan in the 15th century.

In the early 16th century, the kingdom of Shirvan was conquered by Shah Ismail of the Safavid dynasty. As Shah Ismail incorporated all the Shirvan possessions, he also inherited Derbend.

===Russian conquest===
Derbent stayed under Iranian rule, while occasionally briefly taken by the Ottoman Turks such as in 1583 after the Battle of Torches and the Treaty of Constantinople, till the course of the 19th century, when the Russians occupied the city and wider Iranian-ruled swaths of Dagestan.

Being briefly taken by the Russians as a result of the Persian expedition of 1722–23 by Peter the Great, the 1735 Treaty of Ganja, formed by Imperial Russia and Safavid Iran (&quot;de facto&quot; ruled by Nader Shah), forced Russia to return Derbent and its bastion to Iran. In 1747, Derbent became the capital of the Derbent Khanate of the same name.

During the Persian Expedition of 1796, Derbent was stormed by Russian forces under General Valerian Zubov, but the Russians were forced to retreat due to internal political issues, making it fall under Persian rule again. 
As a consequence of the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and the resulting Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, Derbent and wider Dagestan were ceded by Qajar Iran to the Russian Empire. (For background, see Russian conquest of the Caucasus#Caspian Coast.)

In the 1886 census of Dagestan Oblast, as part of Russia&#x27;s Caucasus Viceroyalty, people of Iranian descent () were still an absolute majority at 8,994 out of 15,265, or 58,9%.

==Geography==
The modern city is built in the North Caucasus of Eastern Europe; near the western shores of the Caspian Sea, south of the Rubas River, on the slopes of the Tabasaran Mountains (part of the Bigger Caucasus range). Derbent is well served by public transport, with its own harbor, a railway going south to Baku, and the Baku to Rostov-on-Don road.

To the north of the town is the monument of the Kirk-lar, or forty heroes, who fell defending Dagestan against the Arabs in 728. To the south lies the seaward extremity of the Caucasian wall (fifty metres long), otherwise known as Alexander&#x27;s Wall, blocking the narrow pass of the Iron Gate or Caspian Gates (&quot;Portae Athanae&quot; or &quot;Portae Caspiae&quot;). When intact, the wall had a height of and a thickness of about and, with its iron gates and numerous watch-towers, defended Persia&#x27;s frontier.

===Climate===
Derbent has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are highly variable, with very cold nights interspersed with occasional bouts of sunshine and summerlike temperatures. Highest temperature was recorded 38.8°C (101.8°F) on August 29, 1995 and August 13, 1974 and lowest temperature was recorded -19.0°C (-2.2°F) on February 14, 1988 and February 3, 1994, and the highest lowest temperature recorded was 28.9°C (84.0°F) on July 6, 1990, July 12, 2010 and June 7, 1984, lowest high was -6.1°C (21.0°F) on January 15, 1993 and December 7, 2005.
==Administrative and municipal status==

Within the framework of administrative divisions, Derbent serves as the administrative center of Derbentsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Derbent—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Derbent is incorporated as Derbent Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==
According to the 1897 census, Derbent had 14,649 inhabitants, 9,767 of whom were Tatar (later known as Azerbaijani) speakers (66.7%) and 1,004 were Russian speakers (6.9%).

In 1916, Derbent had a population of 31,168 consisting of 7,919 Shia Muslims (25.4%), 7,567 Russians (24.3%), 6,879 Jews (22.1%), 5,138 Caucasian highlanders (16.5%), 2,604 Armenians (8.4%), and 1,061 Sunni Muslims (3.4%).

According to the 2021 Census, the main ethnic groups in the city are:
* Lezgins (36.4%)
* Azerbaijanis (35.1%)
* Tabasarans (12.2%)
* Dargins (5.0%)
* Russians (3.0%)
* Aghuls (3.0%)
* Rutuls (0.8%)

=== Jewish community ===

Jews began to settle in Derbent in ancient times. During the Khazars&#x27; reign, they played an important part in the life of the city. The Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela mentions Jews living in Derbent in the 12th century, and Christian traveler Wilhelm of Rubruquis writes about a Jewish community in the 13th century. The first mention of Jews in Derbent in modern times is by a German traveler, Adam Olearius, in the 17th century.

Derbent&#x27;s Jewry suffered during the wars in the 18th century. Nadir Shah of Persia forced many Jews to adopt Islam. After the Russian conquest, many Jews of rural Dagestan fled to Derbent, which became the spiritual center of the Mountain Jews. The Jewish population numbered 2,200 in 1897 (15% of total population) and 3,500 in 1903. In the middle of the 20th century, Jews constituted about a third of the population of Derbent. In 1989, there were 13,000 Jews in the city, but most emigrated after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 2002, there were 2,000 Jews with an active synagogue and community center. The chief rabbi of Derbent, Obadiah Isakov, was badly injured in an assassination attempt on July 25, 2013, sparking concerns of further acts of antisemitism targeting the Jewish community. In 2016, the Jewish population was down to 1,345. In the 2024 Dagestan attacks, a synagogue in Derbent was set on fire by armed gunmen, possibly affiliated with ISIS.

==Economy and culture==
The city is home to machine building, food, textile, fishing, and fishery supplies, construction materials, and wood industries. It is the center of Russian brandy production. The educational infrastructure includes a university as well as several technical schools. On the cultural front, there is a Lezgin drama theater (named after S. Stalsky). About two kilometers () from the city is the vacation colony of Chayka (Seagull).

The Soviet novelist Yury Krymov named a fictional motor tanker after the city in his book &quot;The Tanker &quot;Derbent&quot;&quot;.

===Museums===

===Theaters===
Derbent has 3 state and 1 municipal theaters.
*State Azerbaijan Drama Theater
*State Lezgin Music and Drama Theater named after S. Stalsky

===Citadel of Derbend===
Derbent resembles a huge museum and has magnificent mountains and shore nearby, and therefore possesses much touristic potential, further increased by UNESCO&#x27;s classification of the citadel, ancient city and fortress as a World Heritage Site in 2003; however, instability in the region has halted development.

The current fortification and walls were built by the Persian Sassanian Empire as a defensive structure against hostile nomadic people in the north, and continuously repaired or improved by later Arab, Mongol, Timurid, Shirvan, and Iranian kingdoms until the early course of the 19th century, as long as its military function lasted. The fortress was built under the direction of the Sassanid emperor Khosrow (Chosroes) I.

A large portion of the walls and several watchtowers still remain in reasonable shape. The walls, reaching to the sea, date from the 6th century, Sassanid dynasty period. The city has a well-preserved citadel (Narin-kala), enclosing an area of , enclosed by strong walls. Historical attractions include the baths, the cisterns, the old cemeteries, the caravanserai, the 18th-century Khan&#x27;s mausoleum, as well as several mosques.

<doc id="489497" wikidata="Q517270" url="?curid=489497" title="Ted Allen">
<text>Edward Reese Allen (born May 20, 1965) is an American author and television personality. He was the food and wine connoisseur on the Bravo network&#x27;s television program &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, and has been the host of the TV cooking competition series &quot;Chopped&quot; since its launch in 2009, as well as &quot;Chopped Junior&quot;, which began in mid-2015. On April 13, 2014, he became the host of another Food Network show, originally called &quot;America&#x27;s Best Cook&quot;. A retooled version of that show, retitled &quot;All-Star Academy,&quot; debuted on March 1, 2015. In early 2015, he also hosted a four-part special, &quot;Best. Ever.&quot;, which scoured America for its best burgers, pizza, breakfast, and barbecue. He is a longtime contributing writer to &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, an author of two cookbooks, and regularly appears on the Food Network show &quot;Beat Bobby Flay&quot; and other television cooking shows.

==Early life and education==
Allen graduated from Carmel High School in Carmel, Indiana in 1983 and was inducted into the school&#x27;s Alumni Hall of Fame in 2011. He received a degree in psychology from Purdue University in 1987. Subsequently, he enrolled in Purdue&#x27;s Krannert Graduate School of Management but left to accept a job as a copy editor at the Lafayette, Indiana, &quot;Journal &amp; Courier&quot;.

He later returned to graduate school, earning an MA in journalism from the Science and Environmental Reporting Program at New York University. He then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a reporter for Lerner Newspapers, a chain of community weekly newspapers. 
==Career==
Allen got his start in restaurant criticism there as one-quarter of a bi-weekly group-review team called &quot;The Famished Four,&quot; along with Barry Rice, then the chain&#x27;s entertainment editor (and now Allen&#x27;s husband), who initiated the concept with Lerner food editor Leah A. Zeldes.

Allen then became a freelancer for &quot;Chicago&quot; magazine, eventually signing on as a senior editor and often writing about food, wine, and luminaries of the culinary world. He joined &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1997 as a contributing editor, where he wrote features, food pieces, and profiles and co-authored the magazine&#x27;s popular &quot;Things a Man Should Know&quot; series. Allen wrote for Esquire for more than a decade and was nominated for a National Magazine Award for his 2007 story &quot;This Man Survived Breast Cancer.&quot; He also has written for &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Bon Appétit&quot;, &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot;, and &quot;Epicurious&quot;.

===Television===

Allen gained great visibility in 2003 when he became a cast member of the television makeover series &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;, serving as its food and wine specialist. He continued to make television appearances as a gourmet, including as a frequent guest judge on Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;. Allen hosted a six-part documentary, &quot;Uncorked: Wine Made Simple&quot;, on PBS starting May 7, 2007. Beginning June 13, 2007, Allen appeared as a regular judge on seasons 3 and 4 of Bravo&#x27;s reality television program &quot;Top Chef&quot;, following several guest judge appearances during the previous two seasons. In 2008, he left Bravo when Food Network offered him the host job on two shows: &quot;Food Detectives&quot;, which debuted on July 29, 2008, and &quot;Chopped&quot;, which launched a 13-episode season on January 13, 2009. &quot;Detectives&quot; returned for a second season of 13 episodes, also in January 2009. &quot;Chopped&quot; was renewed for 26 episodes and went back into production in March 2009 in New York. The show took off with viewers and was renewed for another 33 episodes, which were shot in January and February 2010. Now one of the highest-rated prime-time shows on the network, as of May 2022, &quot;Chopped&quot; has shot some 850 episodes, and &quot;Chopped Junior&quot; has shot 100.

In an interview with the Food Network about his favorite moments on &quot;Chopped&quot;, Allen stated, &quot;My favorite mystery basket ingredient remains the whole chicken in a can, not so much because I love the food, [but because] I love the sound it makes when it plops out of the can.&quot;

Since moving to the Food Network, Allen has made appearances on many of that channel&#x27;s programs, including &quot;Beat Bobby Flay&quot;, &quot;Best Ever&quot;, &quot;Cutthroat Kitchen&quot;, multiple episodes of &quot;The Best Thing I Ever Ate&quot;, &quot;Dear Food Network&quot;, and &quot;The Next Food Network Star&quot;. On November 16, 2008, Allen returned to &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; as a co-floor reporter for the show&#x27;s Thanksgiving special. Allen reprised the role as a co-floor reporter for the Thanksgiving special on November 20, 2011. On December 2, 2012, Allen served as a sous chef to Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto and chef Robert Irvine in a special &quot;Holiday Battle,&quot; pitting the Food Network stars against reps of the sister network Cooking Channel, Ben Sergeant, Nadia G, and Michael Symon. Morimoto&#x27;s team won.

In 2011, Allen played a &quot;celebrity chef&quot; parody of himself on an episode of &quot;Onion News Network&quot;.

<doc id="489500" wikidata="Q4810641" url="?curid=489500" title="Kyan Douglas">
<text>Kyan Douglas (born Hugh Edward Douglas Jr.; May 5, 1970) is an American television personality and stylist. He was the grooming expert on the American television program &quot;Queer Eye&quot; from 2003 to 2007.

==Biography==
Born Hugh Edward Douglas Jr. in Miami, Florida, Kyan Douglas was raised in Tampa and Tallahassee. He has a sister, Kelli (who first taught him about styling hair). After high school he moved first to Dallas, where he studied philosophy at Brookhaven College and first became interested in religion and the healing arts. He then moved to Austin, where he had initially planned to pursue his interest in acting by studying drama at the University of Texas at Austin, though he was precluded by his extreme shyness. In his mid-twenties, he moved to New Orleans, where he earned a degree in TV production and theater studies at Loyola University. In 1996 three of Douglas&#x27; close friends were murdered in a restaurant robbery where both they and Douglas worked. This motivated him to leave New Orleans.

Douglas was in a serious relationship with publicist and gay rights activist Gregory Durham from March 2004 to August 2006. In July 2006, they became briefly engaged. He was previously rumored to be dating (in fall 2003) &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; actor Robert Gant. Gant confirmed to &quot;TV Guide&quot; that the pair had dated briefly, but were just friends.

Douglas moved from New York to Los Angeles, California in 2007. He told the now defunct TV show &quot;Out in Dallas&quot; that he wanted to pursue acting, and was taking acting classes. In November 2007, he told Sirius satellite radio channel OutQ that he was in the process of purchasing land in Mexico, and was considering opening a yoga retreat there.

==Career==
Douglas moved to New York City in 1999 and started work in sales for Aveda, then helped them set up the &quot;Aveda Institute&quot;, a hairstyling and grooming school. He enrolled in its cosmetology program, and after graduating at the top of his class, he joined the New York-based hair salon Arrojo Studio as a colorist. He began working on the makeover TV shows &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; and &quot;While You Were Out&quot; as well. In 2002, a client at Arrojo told him about a makeover show that was being cast. Douglas sent a photo of himself and a short bio he&#x27;d written to the producers. They called him for an audition and quickly hired him as the show&#x27;s &quot;Grooming Guru&quot;.

As part of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; &quot;Fab Five&quot; Douglas has co-authored a book and appeared on a soundtrack CD and accompanying DVD based on the show, as well as appeared on many magazine covers and TV talk shows. In 2004 he published &quot;Beautified&quot;, his own book on grooming for women, and became a spokesman and product advisor for L&#x27;Oréal. He was also invited back to speak at his alma mater Loyola University New Orleans in 2004. 

In 2009, he took over as host of &quot;Ten Years Younger&quot; (starting with the show&#x27;s fourth season) on TLC.

==Awards==
&quot;Queer Eye&quot; won an Emmy in 2004 for Outstanding Reality Program, and received a nomination again in the same category in 2005. In 2006, Douglas was awarded the HRC&#x27;s Humanitarian Award for his work with a number of charities, including HRC, DIFFA, and AmFAR.

<text>California State Polytechnic University Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) is a public polytechnic research university in Pomona, California. It is the largest (by student body) of the three polytechnic universities in the California State University system.

Cal Poly Pomona began as a southern campus of the California Polytechnic School (now known as Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo) in 1938, following the donation of the Voorhis School for Boys and its adjacent farm in San Dimas by Charles and Jerry Voorhis. This Pomona campus expanded in 1949 when it was gifted the W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry from the University of California, which was originally Will Keith Kellogg&#x27;s horse ranch. Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis and Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo continued operations under unified administrative control until 1966, when Cal Poly Pomona was formed as an independent university.

Cal Poly Pomona currently offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 94 majors, 39 master&#x27;s degree programs, 13 teaching credentials, and a doctorate across nine distinct academic colleges. The university is one among a small group of polytechnic universities in the United States which tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences. Cal Poly, Pomona is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) and is eligible to be designated as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institution (AANAPISI).

Its sports teams are known as the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos and play in the NCAA Division II as part of the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). The Broncos sponsor 10 varsity sports and have won 14 NCAA national championships. Current and former Cal Poly Pomona athletes have won 7 Olympic medals (3 gold, 1 silver, and 3 bronze).

==History==



Events leading to the foundation of present-day Cal Poly Pomona began with the ending of the Voorhis School for Boys near Walnut Creek in San Dimas, California, and its acquisition by the San Luis Obispo–based California Polytechnic School in 1938.

The California Polytechnic School (Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo) was founded as a vocational high school when California Governor Henry Gage signed the Polytechnic School Bill on March 8, 1901, after its drafting by school founder Myron Angel. Voorhis School, on the other hand, had been established in 1928 as a private vocational school which provided elementary schooling for underprivileged boys and operated under the Christian religious principle, &quot;education coupled with the Kingdom of God&quot;. Its founder Charles B. Voorhis and headmaster Jerry Voorhis maintained the school opened throughout the worst years of the Great Depression but persistent economic pressures forced them to transfer control to Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo in 1938.

Voorhis School became the Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit and its educational offerings were raised to the same level as Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo&#x27;s, then a two-year college. The horticulture program was moved to the new satellite campus and the two units operated as one institution spanning two locations under the leadership of president Julian McPhee.

During World War II most of the student body was called to active military duty; enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943. Reopening after the war, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit operated in San Dimas until 1956 when it moved to Will Keith Kellogg’s former horse ranch in the neighboring city of Pomona, California. Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture. The inaugural class of 1957 at the new campus consisted of 57 students graduating with bachelor&#x27;s degrees in a ceremony held at the Rose Garden in Pomona and religious services at Voorhis Chapel in San Dimas. Also in 1957, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis introduced the College of Engineering, the second academic unit after the College of Agriculture. The California Master Plan for Higher Education added the two Cal Poly campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit opened its doors for the first time to 329 female students. President McPhee retired in 1966, and Cal Poly split into two different and independent universities. The partnership between the two campuses remains with their involvement in the annual Cal Poly Universities Rose Float.

To better reflect its new ties to the California State College system, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis changed its name to &quot;California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis&quot; in 1966 and became the 16th campus to officially join the CSC system. Robert C. Kramer assumed presidency of the independent campus in 1966 (second overall as the university recognizes McPhee as its first) and California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis finally adopted its present-day name California State Polytechnic University, Pomona on June 1, 1972.

In 1998, Cal Poly Pomona received criticism when it planned to grant an honorary degree to Robert Mugabe. Mugabe&#x27;s negative humanitarian record as president of Zimbabwe led to protests from staff, faculty and students, ultimately forcing the university to rescind the plan.

Cal Poly Pomona underwent further growth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the construction of the CLA Building (demolished in 2022), academic facilities, expansion to the Cal Poly Pomona University Library and the addition of programs such as the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies, the I-Poly High School and the U.R. Bronco undergraduate research program. Under then-president J. Michael Ortiz, Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment. Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the late-2000s recession resulted in increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and introduced a mandatory furlough calendar for most of its employees.

In April 2024, CPP students joined other campuses across the United States in protests against the humanitarian crisis and genocide in Gaza.

===Name===

The university is officially known as &quot;California State Polytechnic University, Pomona&quot; and &quot;Cal Poly Pomona&quot;, and is also referred to as &quot;CPP&quot;. The name &quot;Cal Poly&quot; is protected by trademark and state statute exclusively for California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Referring to Cal Poly Pomona simply as &quot;Cal Poly&quot; can cause confusion. To honor each institution&#x27;s unique identity and ensure clear communication, Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s Office of Public Affairs recommends using &quot;Cal Poly Pomona&quot; or &quot;CPP&quot; when mentioning the university. This practice recognizes Cal Poly Pomona as an independent and respected institution with distinct strengths within the California State University (CSU) system.

==Campus==

Cal Poly Pomona is located partially within the limits of Pomona, a largely suburban city that is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The city of Pomona is located in the eastern portion of Los Angeles County and borders the neighboring county of San Bernardino to the east. The university&#x27;s campus make it the second largest in the California State University system, a figure which includes various facilities scattered throughout Southern California such as a ranch in Santa Paula, California, campus at the former Spadra Landfill (now known as &quot;Spadra Ranch&quot;), and the Neutra VDL Studio and Residences in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The university is currently negotiating the transfer of the 302 acre Lanterman Developmental Center from the State of California. The land is to be used for academic purposes and expansion of the Innovation Village and also shared by the California Highway Patrol, the California Air Resources Board and the California Conservation Corps. 

Although part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the university is in close proximity to two other large metropolitan and culturally-defined regions, the Inland Empire and Orange County. The university has a tier 1 area, defined as a geographical admissions region surrounding the campus, roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, the city of Chino Hills to the south, Interstate 605 to the west, and Interstate 15 to the east. Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s campus buildings vary in age and style from the Mission Revival Kellogg Horse Stables and the Kellogg House (suggesting the Spanish colonial architectural heritage of Southern California) built in the 1920s; the modernist box-like portion of the library completed in 1969; to contemporary dormitories, engineering, science and library-expansion facilities completed in the early 21st century. Manor House serves as the official residence of the university president.

Leisure and recreational locations include a rose garden which dates back to the Kellogg horse ranch years; the Kellogg House designed by Los Angeles-based architects Charles Gibbs Adams, Myron Hunt and Harold Coulson Chambers in the 1920s; and a Japanese garden built in 2003 and designed by Takeo Uesugi. Kellogg&#x27;s House features grounds which were initially landscaped by Charles Gibbs Adams but were later completed by Florence Yoch &amp; Lucile Council. Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s George and Sakaye Aratani Japanese Garden is one among three under management by institutions of higher education in the County of Los Angeles, the others being the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden at Cal State Long Beach, and the Shinwa-En Garden at Cal State Dominguez Hills. At the center of the campus and atop Horsehill are the buildings of the Collins College of Hospitality Management and Kellogg West, a hotel and conference center and home of the student/faculty-run Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch.

At the northwest part of the campus is the Voorhis Ecological Reserve, which serves as a wildlife corridor containing Coastal Sage Scrub and Coast Live Oak trees among others. Contrasting some of these architecturally prominent facilities, there are various portable buildings on campus which are used to accommodate the growing enrollment of recent decades. Cal Poly Pomona operates the International Polytechnic High School, a college preparatory high school located on campus.

The letters &quot;CPP&quot; made of concrete are located on Colt Hill overlooking the campus. The letters &quot;CP&quot; were initially added in 1959, with the second &quot;P&quot; added in 2004 to distinguish it from the Cal Poly campus in San Luis Obispo.

Between 1993 and 2022, Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s dominant landmark was a futurist-styled administrative facility known as the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building&#x27;s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped &quot;skyroom&quot; atop its eight-story tower) became a symbol of the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as &quot;Gattaca&quot; and &quot;Impostor&quot;. In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building and replace it with a new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks, as determined when now reviewed in the context of more recent seismic research than was required by building codes at the time of its original design and building permit. Despite the fact that numerous other buildings on the CPP campus are much older, which brings into question their adequacy as they too sit on the same presumed fault line, only the CLA building was to be completely demolished by the end of summer 2022.

Noted modernist architect James Pulliam once served as campus architect and instructor and designed the Bookstore, W. Keith and Janet Kellogg Art Gallery, Interim Design Center (IDC) and Student Union building which architectural historian David Gebhard regarded as the best building on campus.

===Academic and research facilities===
The W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center is an academic and research facility serving one of the 22 terms and conditions to the donation of the Kellogg ranch by maintaining Kellogg&#x27;s purebred Arabian horses and their breeding program. Another academic facility highlighting the Kellogg legacy is the Horse Stables (also known as University Plaza) which contains a small research library specializing in equine studies along with offices for student services and various campus organizations.

Conceived in 1995 by then university president, Bob H. Suzuki, and initially financed by NASA and the Economic Development Administration, the Innovation Village is a public/private partnership research and business facility at the southern edge of the campus. Major tenants include the American Red Cross, Southern California Edison, and the NASA Commercialization Center. The project is currently at the halfway mark of building and leasing of the projected total building space. Once complete, it is estimated that the project would employ 2000 to 3000 people and provide half a billion dollars of economic benefits to the local, regional and state economies.

===Campus sustainability and transportation===
The university has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus. In November 2007, Cal Poly Pomona became a signatory member of the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment. Among other things, this committed the university to ensure that within one year, it would purchase or produce at least 15% of the institution&#x27;s electric consumption from renewable sources. The university, along with other members in the CSU, is also a member of the California Climate Action Registry. and lists on &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Guide to 375 Green Colleges&quot;. As a part of the campus&#x27; Climate Action Plan to reduce its carbon footprint, the campus offers incentive parking for students and faculty participating in its Rideshare program. The carpooling initiative gives users the opportunity to park in reserved spaces located closer to campus buildings.

Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s institute for sustainability education is the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies. The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research in the areas of sustainable technology and agriculture. As an example of Cradle to Cradle Design, it uses solar-powered dormitories, aquaculture ponds, and organic gardens while providing environmentally-sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students. In 2010, with the installation of a 210,000 kW hours CPV system by Amonix, the center became the first carbon neutral facility in the California State University system. The center is part of Agriscapes, a research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food, conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste. Agriscapes is home of the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch which sells locally and campus-grown foods and products. Cal Poly Pomona campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse, a California ethnobotany garden, and an aquatic biology center collectively known as BioTrek, which provides environmental education to all academic levels.

The entire campus community is served by a free campus shuttle system known as &quot;Bronco Express&quot;. The shuttle system has 3 lines and is run by the office of Transportation Services. In addition, PTS also offers a shuttle service known as &quot;Metrolink&quot; which provides both students and faculty a direct connection from the Pomona North and Downtown Pomona Metrolink stations to the CLA Building.

Foothill Transit lines 190, 194, 195, 289, 480, 482, and 486 serve the campus daily while Silver Streak only serves weekdays from 7AM to 7:17PM and will be later expanded to 9PM.

===Seismic risks and other challenges of campus development===
Although it is believed that the San Jose Fault (indicated by USGS as having a presumed period of 130,000 years) runs through campus, and geotechnical investigations have been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location. The CLA Building has been said to suffer from &quot;structural flaws&quot; that do not seem to have been clearly publicized, except that they had been &quot;most notably, water intrusion&quot;, which continues to be portrayed inaccurately as a &quot;structural flaw&quot;. In 2005, the university filed a lawsuit against a contractor, for which it was compensated $13.3 million in an out-of-court settlement. Amid these concerns, in September 2010, CSU&#x27;s board of trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed.

Hideo Sasaki&#x27;s architectural firm, Sasaki Associates, Inc., found in the February 2010 master plan that the campus&#x27;s seismic risk, uneven terrain, lack of parking spaces, small classrooms, and pedestrian-unfriendly roads are major constraints for future campus development. It also indicated the lack of identity, an undefined sense of arrival, and a desire to build a stronger on-campus community, among others, as recurrent themes among campus&#x27;s users. Nonetheless, the firm highlights campus ethnic diversity, its location-climate, and the natural beauty of campus, among others, as positive aspects of the physical campus as well as the campus life experience. It may be appropriate for the CSU 

==Organization and administration==

Cal Poly at Pomona is one of three polytechnics in the 23-member California State University system. The CSU system is governed by a 25-member board of trustees, including one faculty trustee, one alumni trustee, and two student trustees, and has authority over curricular development, campus planning, and fiscal management. The university system is currently governed by Chancellor Mildred García, who assumed the office in 2023.

The chief executive of the Cal Poly Pomona campus is President Soraya M. Coley.

Cal Poly Pomona is a member of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)

===University Educational Trust (UET)===
The University Educational Trust (UET) was a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization serving as a source of external fund-raising, funds-management and revenue-distribution at Cal Poly Pomona. According to meeting minutes from 2011, the &quot;Cal Poly Pomona University Educational Trust (UET) Board of Directors, the Chancellor&#x27;s Office and University Administration made the decision to dissolve the UET and transfer all of its net assets to the Cal Poly Pomona Foundation, Inc.&quot;

===Endowment===
Cal Poly Pomona financial endowment was valued at $85.6 million . In fall 2010, Cal Poly Pomona embarked on its first comprehensive fundraising campaign. Early major donors helped raise more than half of the campaign&#x27;s goal of $150 million before its formal launch. They included an anonymous benefactor who pledged $12 million, and $2 million from 1980 alumni Mickey and Lee Segal. Just before the campaign launch, on July 26, 2010, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded a $42 million challenge grant to the university to increase educational access to underrepresented communities, making it the largest cash gift in the history of the CSU system. On February 28, 2011, Panda Express founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng announced a $2.5 million pledge to Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s Collins College of Hospitality Management. The university expects that its permanent endowment at the conclusion of its first comprehensive campaign will top $100 million. On June 15, 2021, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott made a $40 million cash gift to Cal Poly Pomona, making it the largest donation or grant to Cal Poly Pomona given by an individual.

==Academics==

Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s academic offerings have evolved throughout the years. Prior to the ownership shift to Cal Poly SLO in 1938, the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas had been providing educational offerings in &quot;music, bookkeeping, agriculture, library work, carpentry, nature study, machine shop, and printing&quot; coupled with Christian religious fundamentals to an all-male student body with poor, underage boys. In 1938, the campus became the agricultural branch of Cal Poly SLO when a small staff was transfer from San Luis Obispo along with group of agricultural inspection students. Thus, Cal Poly at Pomona (then just Cal Poly) began offering Associate&#x27;s degrees in 1938 and Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1940 when, despite legislative opposition from pro-University of California members in Sacramento, president Julian McPhee asked allied members Armistead B. Carter and Daniel C. Murphy to introduce the bill when two opposing members were not present to vote. Following the governance breakup with the San Luis Obispo in 1966, and as outlined by the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, Cal Poly Pomona continued &quot;offer[ing] undergraduate and graduate instruction through the master&#x27;s degree in the liberal arts and sciences and professional education, including teacher education.&quot; Currently, Cal Poly Pomona promotes a &quot;learn by doing&quot; philosophy, where an essential part of the curriculum is hands-on application of knowledge.

Merriam-Webster mentions that &quot;polytechnic&quot;, a word first known to have been used in 1798, is derived from the French &quot;&quot; which contains the Greek-roots &quot;poly&quot; (&quot;English: many&quot;) and &quot;technē&quot; (&quot;art&quot;). Thus, Merriam-Webster defines &quot;polytechnic&quot; as, &quot;relating to or devoted to instruction in many technical arts or applied sciences&quot;. Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s polytechnic approach, and learn-by-doing philosophy, encourages students in all programs to get real-world experience and skills necessary to join the workforce upon graduation.

In addition, the university is among six other institutions of higher education in California that have been designated a &quot;Center of Academic Excellence&quot; by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency (NSA). While all majors are encouraged to participate in co-op opportunities and internships, all students must do a senior research project.

The Cal Poly Pomona University Library serves &quot;as the central intellectual and cultural resource of the campus community&quot; and contains 2.4 million items and serves as an important center for academic research. Built in 1969 for $4.2 million, the library underwent a major renovation and expansion completed in the summer of 2008 at a cost of over $46 million. The library participates in the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) Enhance program which allows it to correct or add information to bibliographic records in WorldCat.

===Distinctions===
With approximately 5,000 students, its college of Engineering is the second largest in the California State University system. The university has the largest Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Construction Engineering programs in the CSU, and is the only campus to offer an Engineering Technology focus.

Just behind Cal State Fullerton, the university has the second largest Business Administration major in the CSU with nearly 5,000 students. Its Hospitality program is the largest in the CSU and one of the largest in all of the US, with approximately 1,000 students enrolled. Overall, the university holds the fourth largest business college in the CSU.

===Admissions===

Fall Enrolled Freshman Statistics (Fall 2022-Fall 2011)

The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; describe Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s admissions process as &quot;selective&quot;. The CSU system lists Cal Poly Pomona among 16 of its institutions with higher admission standards for first-time freshmen. For the Fall of 2016 there were 32,917 first-time, first year applicants: 19,474 were admitted (51.9%) and 4,204 enrolled (an admissions yield of 21.6%). The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 440-560 for reading and 460–600 for math, while the middle 50% ACT Composite range was 20–27. Of the enrolled freshmen, 25.6% had a high school GPA of 3.75 or higher, while the average GPA was 3.45.

Freshmen applicants who graduate high school outside Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s Tier 1 area (known as Tier 2 applicants) are rank ordered by eligibility index and granted admission based on a year-specific cutoff score. Since academic year 2010–2011, Tier 1 applicants may no longer be guaranteed admissions based on the CSU Eligibility Index and may be subject to similar criteria as Tier 2 applicants.
====Demographics====

Cal Poly Pomona is an ethnically and culturally diverse university, self-described as &quot;Champions of Diversity&quot;, &quot;College Prowler&quot; states that &quot;Cal Poly is the melting pot of the Cal States&quot;.
As of 2018 Cal Poly Pomona has the third largest enrollment percentage of Asian Americans in the Cal State System.

Cal Poly Pomona has over 1,000 visa-bearing international students.

====Impaction====
During the fall admissions filing period, the CSU designates academic programs where more applications are received than can be accommodated by the campus, and designates them as &quot;impacted&quot;. At Cal Poly Pomona, impacted academic programs include: Animal Health Science, Animal Science, Aerospace Engineering, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Psychology, Sociology, Communication, Biology, Biotechnology, and undeclared programs. As such, applicants are rank ordered by eligibility index regardless of local admissions area and are accepted as space permits. Cal Poly Pomona students who wish to change majors to an impacted program must meet supplemental requirements required for that major. Requesting a change to an impacted major must be received by the end of the initial filing period for the term for which new majors are being accepted (i.e. By February 28, 2010, for summer 2011; November 30, 2010, for fall 2011; June 30, 2011, for winter 2012; or August 31, 2011, for spring 2012).

==Student life==

===Housing===
With an on-campus housing capacity of 3,519 students, Cal Poly Pomona has the fifth largest housing system in the California State University. In 2016, 39% of first-year students and 10% of all students live in college housing.

There are three residential styles on the Pomona campus. The oldest housing facilities consist of six residential halls, known as the &quot;Traditional Halls&quot;, located on University Drive. The four older red-brick halls are named &quot;Alamitos&quot;, &quot;Aliso&quot;, &quot;Encinitas&quot;, and &quot;Montecito&quot;, each providing accommodation for up to 212 residents. The other two housing halls (&quot;Cedritos&quot; and &quot;Palmitas&quot;), were the result of a 1968 development and each has room to accommodate up to 185 residents. These two halls were described as eligible for the California Historic Register as &quot;a significant example of the work of highly noted Southern California architectural firm, Smith and Williams&quot;.

Newer residential complexes include the &quot;University Village&quot; and the &quot;Suites&quot; which offer apartment-style living to non-freshman students. The &quot;Residence Halls, Traditional Halls,&quot; and the &quot;Suites&quot; are managed by the Division of Student Affairs, whereas the &quot;University Village&quot; is managed by the Cal Poly Pomona Foundation. Phase I of the construction of the Suites, housing 420 students, was completed in 2004 and Phase II, housing 622 students, opened in 2010.

In an effort to reduce commuting and raise academic performance and retention, starting with the 2010–2011 academic year, freshmen who did not graduate from a high school in the Tier 1 Local Admissions area (the area roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains and Chino Hills to the north and south and the 15 and 605 freeways to the east and west), are required to live on campus.

Currently, there have been ongoing efforts to grow the residential community on campus. In 2017, construction began on two new residential halls (&quot;Sicomoro&quot; and &quot;Secoya&quot;) along with a new dining hall (&quot;Centerpointe&quot; Dining Commons), which are intended to replace the aging and seismically unfit residential community along University Drive. The new &quot;Residence Halls&quot; opened to select first-year residents in January 2020. The &quot;Residence Halls&quot; can house 980 residents and are only open to first-year students.

The Bronco Sports Show is a quarterly television broadcast capturing the highlights and statistics from Bronco Athletics along with other featured events around the campus.

&quot;CPP News&quot; is the university&#x27;s official online magazine. CPP News features news, announcements of campus events, spotlights on various departments, and resources for faculty and staff. A web site also provides a comprehensive archival search for past articles and photos.

===Bronco Pep Band===
The Bronco Pep Band is a student-run band at Cal Poly Pomona. The band is a group within the athletic department. It follows the tradition of other student-run bands in the sense that it focuses on its members&#x27; individuality. The band attends athletic events during the year to encourage the school&#x27;s athletic teams and audience support/involvement. The pep band is entirely voluntary and all students at Cal Poly Pomona or anyone else in the area are free to join.

One of two children of Phillip and Rosalyn (née Bauman) Wein, he lived in The Bronx until age 7, when he moved with his family to Levittown, New York, on Long Island. There he graduated from Division Avenue High School in 1966, and went on to an art degree from nearby Farmingdale State College. Wein&#x27;s younger brother, Michael, died in 2007.

In a 2003 interview, Len Wein recalled having been &quot;a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age seven, my dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. And I was hooked. When my eighth grade art teacher, Mr. Smedley, told me he thought I had actual art talent, I decided to devote all my efforts in that direction in the hope that I might someday get into the comics biz.&quot;

Approximately once a month, as a teenager, Wein and his friend Marv Wolfman took DC Comics&#x27; weekly Thursday afternoon tour of the company&#x27;s offices. Wolfman was active in fanzine culture, and together he and Wein produced sample superhero stories to show to the DC editorial staff. At that point, Wein was more interested in becoming an artist than a writer. In a 2008 interview, Wein said his origins as an artist have helped him &quot;describe art to an artist so that I can see it all in my own head&quot;, and claimed he &quot;used to have artists, especially at DC, guys like Irv Novick and a few of the others, who would come into the office waiting for their next assignment and ask [editor] Julie Schwartz, &#x27;Do you have any Len Wein scripts lying around? He&#x27;s always easy to draw.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==
DC editor Joe Orlando hired both Wolfman and Wein as freelance writers. Wein&#x27;s first professional comics story was &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; in DC&#x27;s &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #18 (Dec. 1968), for which he co-created, with Wolfman, Red Star, the first official Russian superhero in the DC universe. Neal Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a &quot;Teen Titans&quot; story which had been written by Wein and Wolfman. The story, titled &quot;Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho!&quot;, would have introduced DC&#x27;s first African American superhero but was rejected by publisher Carmine Infantino. The revised story appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #20 (April 1969).

Later that year, Wein was writing anthological mystery stories for DC&#x27;s &quot;The House of Secrets&quot; and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot;. He additionally began writing for DC&#x27;s romance comic &quot;Secret Hearts&quot; and the company&#x27;s toyline tie-in &quot;Hot Wheels&quot;; Skywald Publications&#x27; horror-comics magazines &quot;Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot; and its short-lived Western comic books &quot;The Bravados&quot; and &quot;The Sundance Kid&quot;; and Gold Key Comics&#x27; &quot;Mod Wheels&quot;, &quot;Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery&quot;, the toyline tie-in &quot;Microbots&quot;, and the TV-series tie-ins &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

===DC and Marvel Comics===
Wein&#x27;s first superhero work for Marvel was a one-off story in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #71 (Dec. 1970) co-written with staff writer/editor Roy Thomas. Wein later began scripting sporadic issues of such DC superhero titles as &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (featuring Supergirl and Zatanna), &quot;The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot;, while continuing to write anthological mysteries, along with well-received stories for the semi-anthological occult title &quot;The Phantom Stranger&quot; #14–26 (Aug. 1971 – Sept. 1973).

Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson created the horror character the Swamp Thing in &quot;The House of Secrets&quot; #92 (July 1971). Over the next several decades, the Swamp Thing would star in DC series and miniseries – including an initial 1972–76 series begun by Wein and Wrightson, and the early 1980s &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot;, edited by Wein and featuring early work by writer Alan Moore—as well as two theatrical films, and a syndicated television series. Abigail Arcane, a major supporting character in the character&#x27;s mythos, was introduced by Wein and Wrightson in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #3 (March 1973). Wein wrote the second story featuring Man-Thing (written circa May 1971, published in June 1972), introducing Barbara Morse and the concept that &quot;Whatever Knows Fear Burns at the Man-Thing&#x27;s Touch!&quot;, and later edited Steve Gerber&#x27;s run on that title.

Wein wrote a well-regarded run of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (issues #100–114) wherein, together with artist Dick Dillin, he re-introduced the Seven Soldiers of Victory in issues #100–102 and the Freedom Fighters in issues #107–108. Libra, a supervillain created by Wein and Dillin in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #111 (June 1974), would play a leading role in Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline in 2008.

In the fall of 1972, Wein and writers Gerry Conway and Steve Englehart crafted a metafictional unofficial crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein&#x27;s first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in DC&#x27;s &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #103 (by Wein, Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Thor&quot; #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, &quot;It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It&#x27;s really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back – it didn&#x27;t matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel – I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do.&quot;

Wein co-created the Human Target with artist Carmine Infantino and wrote the character&#x27;s appearances as a backup feature in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, and &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. The character was adapted into a short-lived ABC television series starring Rick Springfield which debuted in July 1992, and was briefly revived in 2010 for a two-season series on Fox that starred Mark Valley, Chi McBride, and Jackie Earle Haley.

He briefly wrote the &quot;Batman&quot; feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and produced a storyline with artist Jim Aparo and in which Batman was framed for the murder of Talia al Ghul and battled Sterling Silversmith for the first time.

In the early 1970s, Wein began writing regularly for Marvel Comics. He succeeded Roy Thomas as editor-in-chief of the color-comics line in 1974, staying a little over a year before handing the reins to Wolfman. Remaining at Marvel as a writer, Wein had lengthy runs on &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, as well as shorter runs on such titles as &quot;The Defenders&quot; and &quot;Brother Voodoo&quot;. Wein co-created Wolverine with artist John Romita Sr. during his run on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. Wein&#x27;s story &quot;Between Hammer and Anvil&quot; from &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2, #182 (Dec. 1974) was later cited in Tony Isabella&#x27;s book &quot;1,000 Comics You Must Read&quot;.

In 1975, he and artist Dave Cockrum revived the Stan Lee / Jack Kirby mutant-superhero team the X-Men after a half-decade&#x27;s hiatus, reformatting the membership in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). Among the characters the duo created for the series were Nightcrawler, Storm, Colossus, and Thunderbird. Wein plotted the early &quot;new X-Men&quot; stories with artist Cockrum. These issues were then scripted as &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #94-95 by Chris Claremont, who subsequently developed the title into one of Marvel&#x27;s leading franchises. In 2009, Claremont said, &quot;The history of modern comics would be incredibly different if you took [Wein&#x27;s] contributions out of the mix. The fact he doesn&#x27;t get credit for it half the time is disgraceful. We owe a lot of what we are – certainly on the X-Men – to Len and to Dave [Cockrum]&quot;.

===Return to DC===
In 1977, following an offer to script the &quot;Batman&quot; feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Wein left Marvel to work exclusively at DC Comics as a scriptwriter and editor.
He scripted &quot;Batman&quot; and collaborated on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; with artists Dave Gibbons and Mark Farmer. On his first issue of &quot;Batman&quot;, #307 (Jan. 1979), he created Wayne Foundation executive Lucius Fox, later portrayed by Morgan Freeman in the movies &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. With artist Marshall Rogers, Wein co-created the third version of the supervillain Clayface in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #478 (Aug. 1978). He wrote &quot;The Untold Legend of the Batman&quot;, the first Batman miniseries, in 1980 and the following year wrote a DC-Marvel crossover between Batman and the Hulk in &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #27 (Fall 1981). &quot;Pandora Pann&quot; was a proposed series by Wein and artist Ross Andru which was to have been published in 1982 but other commitments prevented Wein from writing it and the project was cancelled. As editor, he worked on the first twelve-issue limited series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;, and such successful series as &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot;, and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27;s acclaimed and highly influential &quot;Watchmen&quot;. In 1986, he wrote a revival of the &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;, two issues of the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series, and dialogued the miniseries &quot;Legends&quot; over the plots of John Ostrander. The following year, Wein scripted the rebooted &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series over penciller George Pérez&#x27;s plots. With artist Steve Erwin, Wein co-created the superhero Gunfire.

===Later career===
Following his second stint at DC and a move to the West Coast, Wein served as editor-in-chief of &quot;Disney Comics&quot; for three years in the early 1990s. After leaving Disney, Wein began writing and story editing for such animated television series as &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;ExoSquad&quot;, &quot;Phantom 2040&quot;, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Pocket Dragon Adventures&quot;, &quot;ReBoot&quot; and &quot;War Planets: Shadow Raiders&quot;. In 2001, he and Wolfman wrote the screenplay &quot;Gene Pool&quot; for the production company Helkon, and later wrote a prequel to the screenplay for a one-shot comic book for IDW Publishing.

Wein collaborated with writer Kurt Busiek and artist Kelley Jones on the four-issue miniseries &quot;Conan: The Book of Thoth&quot; for Dark Horse Comics. He scripted the comics series &quot;The Victorian&quot; for Penny-Farthing Press and wrote comic-book stories for Bongo Comics&#x27; TV-series tie-ins &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;.

From 2005 to 2008, Wein appeared as a recurring panelist on the Los Angeles-based stage revival of the TV game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; He wrote episodes of the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Ben 10: Alien Force&quot;, &quot;Ben 10: Ultimate Alien&quot;, &quot;Ben 10: Omniverse&quot; and the &quot;Marvel Super Hero Squad.&quot;

Wein was interviewed for commentary tracks on comics-related DVDs, including the animated &quot;Justice League: The New Frontier&quot; film, the live-action &quot;Spider-Man, Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; films, the &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; film, the &quot;Watchmen&quot; film, the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; TV-series sets, the &quot;Human Target&quot; first season TV series, and the July 2008 History Channel specials &quot;Batman Unmasked&quot; and &quot;Batman Tech&quot;.

He wrote the storyline for the &quot;Watchmen&quot; video game, &quot;&quot;, which serves as a backstory to both the comic and the film adaptation.

Wein returned to comics writing for DC in the late 2000s, where he collaborated in the DC Comics nostalgic event &quot;DC Retroactive&quot; writing stories for the one-shot specials &quot;Batman – The &#x27;70s&quot; (September 2011) drawn by Tom Mandrake and &quot;Green Lantern – The &#x27;80s&quot; (October 2011) drawn by Joe Staton. The hardcover collection of his 10-issue &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot; was published in August 2011. In 2012, Wein worked on the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; project, writing the mini-series &quot;Ozymandias&quot; with art by Jae Lee and the serialized feature &quot;Curse of the Crimson Corsair&quot; with art by &quot;Watchmen&quot; colorist John Higgins. The hardcover collection of the &quot;Ozymandias&quot; storyline spent several weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List in 2013. In 2015, he and José Luis García-López produced &quot;Batman &#x27;66: The Lost Episode&quot;, a comics adaptation of a Two-Face story pitch by Harlan Ellison originally intended for the &quot;Batman&quot; television series. In 2016, DC published a six-issue limited &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series by Wein and artist Kelley Jones.

==Personal life==
Wein&#x27;s first wife was Glynis Oliver, a comics colorist who spent years on the &quot;X-Men&quot; titles; they were married some time prior to 1972. Following their 1985 divorce, he married Christine Valada, a photographer and attorney, in 1991, and became stepfather to Michael Bieniewicz-Valada.

On April 6, 2009, Wein&#x27;s California home burned down with considerable loss of property and mementos, including his Shazam Awards. He and his wife also lost their dog, Sheba, to the fire. Beginning October 26, 2009, Valada appeared on and won the television game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, becoming a four-time champion with winnings of over $60,000. She indicated on the show that she would use the money to recover or replace much of the artwork and books the couple lost in the fire.

Wein underwent triple-bypass heart surgery on February 10, 2015. He died on September 10, 2017.

<text>DeVry University () is a private for-profit university in the United States. It mainly offers online programs. The university was founded in 1931 by Herman A. DeVry and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It has been the subject of several government investigations and lawsuits alleging false or deceptive claims.

==History==
===Early history (1931–1970)===
DeVry was founded in 1931 as the De Forest Training School in Chicago, Illinois. School founder Herman A. DeVry, who had previously invented a motion picture projector and produced educational and training films, named the school after his friend Lee de Forest. De Forest Training School originally taught projector and radio repair, but later expanded to include other electronic equipment such as televisions. After its founder&#x27;s death in March 1941, the school was renamed DeVry Technical Institute in 1953 and gained accreditation to confer associate degrees in electronics in 1957.

Bell &amp; Howell completed its acquisition of DeVry Technical Institute in 1967. A year later, the company acquired the Ohio Institute of Technology and DeVry was renamed DeVry Institute of Technology, which was accredited to confer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in electronics in 1969.

===Keller Graduate School of Management (1970–1990)===
Dennis Keller and Ronald Taylor met one another in the early 1970s when the two were teachers at DeVry. Keller and Taylor learned the economics of for-profit education while at DeVry and, in 1973, the two founded the Keller Graduate School of Management with $150,000 in loans from friends and family. The school was originally conceived as a day school that granted certificates. In 1976, the Keller School became an evening program offering MBAs, focused on working adults. The school was fully accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1977, becoming the first for-profit school to be accredited by the body.

DeVry first received full accreditation in 1981. The Keller Graduate School of Management acquired DeVry from Bell &amp; Howell in 1987. The leveraged buyout was worth $147.4 million. The two schools were combined as DeVry Inc., with Keller acting as chairman and CEO and Taylor as president and COO.

===DeVry Education Group (1990–2018)===
DeVry Inc. successfully completed its initial public offering on June 21, 1991. In 1992, DeVry lost the highest scoring basketball game in history to Troy State University (now Troy University), 258 to 141.

In 1995, its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1996, DeVry acquired Becker CPA Review—a firm that prepared students for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination—for an undisclosed amount of cash, the tentative purchase price of which was US$18.685 million (about ). In 2003, DeVry acquired Ross University, a medical and veterinary school based in the Caribbean, for a price variously reported at $310 million (about $ in ) and $329 million ($ in ). DeVry moved into the nursing field in March 2005 with the acquisition of Deaconess College of Nursing, a St. Louis–based nursing college that conferred both associate&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in nursing, at a price variously reported at about $5.3 million ($ in ) and $5.4 million ($ in ). Deaconess College of Nursing was later renamed Chamberlain College of Nursing.

DeVry Inc. entered Brazil with its 2009 acquisition of Faculdade Nordeste (FANOR), Ruy Barbosa and ÁREA 1, which are universities located in the Northeast of Brazil.

In 2010, DeVry University had nearly 90 campus learning sites in 26 states and more than 7,000 employees. The parent company had more than 12,000 employees. DeVry University&#x27;s undergraduate enrollment reached 68,290 students by the summer of 2010.

In 2012, the university acquired Faculdade Boa Viagem and Faculdade do Vale do Ipojuca. DeVry acquired a sixth Brazilian university, Faculdade Differencial Integral, in 2013. DeVry Inc. was renamed DeVry Education Group later that year. DeVry Education Group changed its name to Adtalem Global Education in May 2017, and announced in December 2017 that they would hand off DeVry University and Keller Graduate School to Cogswell Education (a division of Palm Ventures) for no upfront cost, pending regulatory and accreditor approval.

In December 2018, the parent company Adtalem finalized the handover of both DeVry University and Keller Graduate School of Management to Cogswell Education.

===Cogswell Education (Since 2018)===
DeVry University&#x27;s parent company is Cogswell Education, LLC. Cogswell purchased DeVry at no original cost from Adtalem Education. However, Cogswell could pay up to US$20 million. Cogswell Education is headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. The principal investor is Bradley Palmer of Palm Ventures. Mr. Palmer has been involved in flipping Heald College, UEI College, and American Education Center.

In December 2018, in a report titled &quot;VA&#x27;s Oversight of State Approving Agency Program Monitoring for Post-9/11 GI Bill Students&quot;, the Department of Veterans Office of Inspector General mentioned DeVry&#x27;s use of false claims. However the Veterans Affairs office did not indicate that any action would be forthcoming.

In 2020, Tom Monahan III became president and CEO of DeVry.

In 2022, the US government discharged more than $71 million in student loan debt for 1,800 former students of DeVry University, asserting that the university deceived students in the enrollment process.

In 2023, Elise Awwad became the first female President and CEO of DeVry. The main campus and headquarters were moved to Lisle, Illinois.

Devry has a case pending in Illinois challenging borrower defense to repayment (fraud) claims against the school. More than 30,000 fraud claims have been filed against DeVry.

===Student outcomes===
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, DeVry University-Illinois has a six-year graduation rate of 28%, for first-time full-time students who began their studies in 2013. While the university&#x27;s 3-year student loan default rate is 11.2%, a Brookings Institution report found that DeVry&#x27;s five-year default rate was 43%. The College Scorecard reports of a graduation rate of 18% for DeVry University-Illinois. Of those students in repayment, 31% were in forbearance, 29% were not making progress, 10% were in deferment, 10% defaulted, 10% were making progress, 6% were delinquent, 3% were paid in full, and 1% were discharged. For the 2018–19 academic year, the amount that all undergraduate students received in federal student loans was $69.42 million. Median salary after attending ranges from $23,000 to $62,000 depending on the field of study and location.

==Investigations, lawsuits, and settlements==
DeVry University has been the subject of numerous investigations and lawsuits alleging a variety of false or deceptive practices. Some of the cases led to multi-million dollar settlements, though DeVry continued to deny the allegations. In 2014, accumulated student loan debt from DeVry University and Keller, its graduate school, was about $12.1 billion.

=== 1990s ===
In March 1995, DeVry&#x27;s ability to grant U.S. degrees through its Calgary facilities was discussed during a session of the Alberta Legislative Assembly. Therein, Grant Mitchell—then the Leader of the Opposition for the Alberta Liberal Party—accused the Premier of Alberta, Ralph Klein, of maintaining a conflict of interest with DeVry through his relationship with John Ballheim, who was at the time an executive at DeVry serving as both the president of DeVry&#x27;s Calgary campus and as a member of the Klein&#x27;s special advisory council on postsecondary education. Klein denied any conflict of interest. In 1995, DeVry was also suspended from the Ontario Student Assistance Program after a large number of its students misreported their income. DeVry was reinstated after paying fines of CA$1.7 million (equivalent to CA$ in ) to Ontario and putting up a letter of credit totalling CA$2 million (CA$ in ).

In 1996, students of DeVry&#x27;s Toronto campus filed a class-action suit of CA$400,000 (CA$ in ) claiming poor educational quality and job preparation; the suit was dismissed on technical grounds.

===2000s===
In November 2000, Afshin Zarinebaf, Ali Mousavi, and another graduate of one of DeVry University&#x27;s Chicago-area campuses filed a class-action lawsuit accusing DeVry of widespread deception, unlawful business practices, and false advertising, alleging that students were not being prepared for high-tech jobs. The lawsuit contributed to a 20% slide in the company&#x27;s stock. The suit was not certified and the case was resolved for less than US$25,000 (US$ in ) in June 2006.

In 2001, DeVry became the first for-profit college or university to obtain permission from the Alberta Canada provincial government to grant degrees, on recommendation by the Private Colleges Accreditation Board. This decision was opposed by the Alberta New Democrats (sitting in opposition), the University of Calgary Faculty Association, the Canadian Federation of Students, and the Canadian Association of University Teachers.

In January 2002, Royal Gardner, a graduate of one of DeVry University&#x27;s Los Angeles–area campuses, filed a class-action complaint against DeVry Inc. and DeVry University, Inc. on behalf of students in the post-baccalaureate degree program in Information Technology. The suit alleged that the nature of the program was misrepresented by the advertising. The lawsuit was dismissed and refiled. During the first quarter of 2004, a new complaint was filed in the same court by Gavino Teanio with the same general allegations. This action was stayed pending the outcome of the Gardner lawsuit. The lawsuits were being settled in late 2006.

In April 2007, the states of New York, Illinois, and Missouri settled with three institutions that were participating in questionable student-loan practices. DeVry, Career Education Corporation, and Washington University in St. Louis were involved with the settlement. DeVry agreed to refund US$88,122 (US$ in ) it received in revenue sharing from Citibank to students.

In 2008, DeVry was accused of filing false claims and statements about recruitment pay and performance to the government of the United States.

===2010s===
DeVry was one of the universities highlighted in the 2018 documentary &quot;Fail State,&quot; which followed several stories of students who struggled with student loan debt after attending for-profit colleges. Murray Hastie, an Iraq War veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, told his story about how he ended up with $50,000 in student loan debt after his experience at DeVry.

In January 2013, a lawsuit was filed by a former manager at DeVry which alleged that the college bribed students for positive performance reviews and worked around federal regulations on for-profit colleges. In April 2013, the attorneys general of Illinois and Massachusetts issued subpoenas to DeVry to investigate for violations of federal law and filing false information about loans, grants, and guarantees. In July 2014, DeVry stated that the office of the New York Attorney General was investigating whether the company&#x27;s marketing violated laws against false advertising.

In March 2016, the Veterans Administration reprimanded DeVry over allegations of deceptive marketing practices made by the Federal Trade Commission and suspended DeVry University from its &quot;Principles of Excellence&quot; status under the G.I. Bill. On December 15, 2016, the Federal Trade Commission settled a US$100 million suit against DeVry, which alleged that DeVry&#x27;s advertisements deceived consumers about the likelihood that students would find jobs in their fields of study, and would earn more than those graduating with bachelor&#x27;s degrees from other colleges or universities. Students were eligible for a refund who: enrolled in a bachelor&#x27;s or associate degree program at DeVry University between January 1, 2008, and October 1, 2015; paid at least US$5,000 with cash, loans, or military benefits; did not get debt or loan forgiveness as part of this settlement; and completed at least one class credit.

Separately, on June 16, 2016, two former DeVry students filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. DeVry responded by suing the students, claiming the dispute belongs in court and not in arbitration.

In May 2017, the Higher Learning Commission designated DeVry &quot;under governmental investigation&quot; as a result of a Massachusetts Attorney General investigation alleging &quot;fraudulent or deceptive practices&quot;. In September 2017, the Higher Learning Commission removed this designation after DeVry negotiated a settlement.

In August 2018, the Associated Press reported that according to United States Department of Education documents, DeVry received more than 3,600 (over 15%) of the 24,000 federal fraud complaints lodged against for-profit colleges between January 20, 2017, and April 30, 2018. This is in conjunction with a &quot;nearly 20 percent&quot; decrease in enrollment in the last year.

In March 2019, former DeVry student Eric Luongo was invited to testify before the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies about his experience at the university. Luongo, a disabled veteran, said he thought he would attend DeVry for free by using his GI Bill benefits. Luongo alleged that he was coerced into filling out federal loan paperwork and signing promissory notes. The result was that the veteran was left with over $100,000 in debt and a degree in graphic design that couldn&#x27;t get him gainful employment.

===2020s===
In 2022, DeVry University was one of 153 institutions included in student loan cancellation due to alleged fraud. The class action was brought by a group of more than 200,000 student borrowers, assisted by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, part of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. A settlement was approved in August 2022, stating that the schools on the list included &quot;substantial misconduct by the listed schools, whether credibly alleged or in some instances proven.&quot; In April 2023, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the settlement and allowed to proceed the debt cancellation due to alleged fraud.

==Past partnerships and political interests==
In 2011, DeVry University partnered with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to become an official education provider for the United States&#x27; Olympic teams. In April 2016, the USOC announced an extension of its partnership with DeVry through 2020. According to the USOC, more than 125 Team USA student athletes were enrolled in DeVry programs.

In April 2014, DeVry University was named the &quot;official education provider&quot; for NFL Pro Legends, a group supporting players, coaches and other professionals who worked for NFL teams.

DeVry University was the official education and career development partner of Minor League Baseball. DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management will provide higher education opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate levels for players, their spouses, umpires and National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL) employees and alumni through 2017.

The peak year for DeVry&#x27;s lobbying in Congress was 2011, when it spent more than $720,000. The largest amount went to Thompson Coburn LLP. Democratic lobbyist Heather Podesta was a major lobbyist for DeVry University from 2010 to 2015.

Adtalem&#x27;s stock price rebounded after the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017. This has been attributed to deregulation by the U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos, which contrasted with the more prosecutorial approach of the Obama administration.

<text>ITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech) was a private for-profit technical institute with its headquarters in Carmel, Indiana and many campuses throughout the United States. Founded in 1969 and growing to 130 campuses in 38 states of the United States, ITT Tech was one of the largest for-profit educators in the US before it closed in 2016.

The institute was owned and operated by ITT Educational Services, Inc., a publicly traded company headquartered in Carmel. The company also owned and operated the Breckinridge School of Nursing and Health Sciences schools.

In 1999, two former ITT employees brought forth a lawsuit alleging the school used illegal recruitment practices, saying the school was &quot;abusing that system for years and ripping off the government for billions of dollars.&quot; In 2004,
the Justice Department initiated a criminal investigation into ITT colleges in eight states.

Following state and federal investigations, the United States Department of Education prevented students from using federally guaranteed student loans at ITT Tech locations in August 2016. All ITT Tech campuses were closed the following month and ITT Tech filed for bankruptcy.

In 2018, ITT Tech&#x27;s court-appointed bankruptcy trustee sued the United States Department of Education and lenders to repay $1.5 billion in claims against ITT alleging that regulators took advantage of low-income students and neglected their oversight duties. Three years later, the US Department of Education allocated $1.1 billion in relief to an additional 115,000 former ITT Tech students.

==History==

In 1946, ITT Tech was established as Educational Services, Inc. From 1965 until its IPO in 1994, ITT Tech was a wholly owned subsidiary of the ITT Corporation (as &quot;ITT/ESI&quot;). During its years in operation, it was based in Carmel, Indiana. By 1986, all its institutions had become known by the common name &quot;ITT Technical Institute.&quot; By 1999, ITT Corporation had divested itself completely of ITT Tech&#x27;s shares. The schools were allowed to continue using the &quot;ITT&quot; name under license.

In the mid-2000s, CEO Rene Champagne cashed out more than $50 million in stock, before stepping down from the position in 2007. Kevin Modany was appointed as CEO, while maintaining all of the positions (president, COO, and director) he had held from early June 2002.

It acquired the financially struggling Daniel Webster College (DWC) in Nashua, New Hampshire in June 2009 for $29.3 million. The nonprofit college converted into a for-profit institution. In 2013, ESI began operating public charter schools in three cities: Indianapolis, Tempe, and Troy, Michigan. In charter documents, the company referred to potential students as &quot;educational have-nots.&quot;

ITT Technical Institute charged among the highest tuition fees in the industry - between $45,000 to $85,000 in 2014 - and had the industry&#x27;s highest rate of loans that went into default within two years of attendance.

In 2016, Chinese investors Zhifeng Zhang and Yude Zhang became ESI insiders, purchasing more than 3,000,000 shares of ITT Educational Services stock. In July 2016, ESI reported that enrollment was projected to drop by 30% to 40% from 2015 to 2016. In August 2016, the U.S. Department of Education barred the company from enrolling new students who use government loans. On the 30th of the same month, ITT Technical Institute stopped accepting applications for new enrollment. At that time, ITT Tech said that existing students could still finish their studies. ITT Tech also said that they would continue to operate until the last of its enrolled students either graduate or drop out. However, on September 6, 2016, ITT Technical Institute announced that it was shutting down all of its campuses, effective immediately.

At the time of its system-wide closure on September 6, 2016, the school had more than 130 ITT Technical Institute campuses across the United States, with more than 40,000 students and 8,000 employees. ITT Educational Services filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation on September 16, 2016.

As for DWC, Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), a nonprofit college in Manchester, New Hampshire, hired most of the college&#x27;s faculty and staff. This arrangement allowed the 2016–17 academic year to proceed as usual. DWC&#x27;s aviation and engineering programs were effectively transferred into SNHU, which had offered to buy the Nashua campus. However, its bid got rejected, and SNHU instead opted to build a new on-campus science and engineering building.

==Student loan debt and debt relief==
In 2014, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked ITT Technical Institute No. 2 on its list of &quot;The 5 Colleges That Leave the Most Students Crippled By Debt&quot;. Among ITT Tech graduates with loans due in 2011, 22% had defaulted by 2014. This statistic compares with a default rate of about 13.7% for student loans generally. According to the &quot;Time&quot; magazine report, ITT Tech&#x27;s default rate ranked second. The for-profit University of Phoenix had a lower default rate by percentage (19% at Phoenix versus ITT Tech&#x27;s 22%). However, the total number of students in default from Phoenix was much higher (45,123 Phoenix students versus 11,260 ITT Tech students).

According to the College Scorecard, , 39% of ITT Tech graduates were paying off their debt, compared to the national average of 66% among all U.S. schools. This percentage represented the number of graduates able to repay at least $1 in student loan debt in the three years after their graduation.

In 2018, a settlement to a class-action lawsuit was tentatively reached to wipe out student loans for attendees from 2006 to 2016. Students who attended ITT Tech may be able to have their debt forgiven by applying to the United States Department of Education for borrower defense to repayment. However, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced on July 25, 2018, that the borrower defense rule would be rewritten and replaced with a stricter repayment policy starting July 1, 2019. On December 13, 2018, a US federal court ruled that the department&#x27;s decision to do this was &quot;arbitrary and capricious.&quot; The court sided with plaintiffs in invalidating the stay put in place by the Department of Education. There will be an additional hearing on December 14, 2018, to &quot;address remedies.&quot;

In June 2019, Student CU Connect CUSO, a private lender for ITT Tech, settled with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 44 states and the District of Columbia. The settlement called for CUSO to forgive a reported $168 million in private student loans. CUSO agreed to stop collecting on, and discharge, all of the loans.

==Academics==
The school characterized ITT Tech students as &quot;older and balancing family obligations with underemployment.&quot; The company&#x27;s web site stated: &quot;The programs employ traditional, applied and adult-learning pedagogies and are delivered through traditional, accelerated and distance methodologies in a learner-centered environment of mutual respect.&quot;

ITT Tech offered associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s (business-only, online) degrees. The commonwealth of Pennsylvania was the only state which forbade ITT Tech to offer master&#x27;s degrees. , the ITT Technical Institutes were offering 49 education programs in various fields of study.

At the vast majority of campuses, ITT Tech organized the academic schedules based on four 12-week academic quarters in a calendar year, with new students beginning at the start of each academic quarter. Using that calendar, students taking a full course load could complete associate degree programs in seven or eight academic quarters, bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in 14 or 15 academic quarters, or a master&#x27;s degree program in seventeen academic quarters.

Depending on student enrollment, class sessions at ITT Technical Institute campuses were generally available during the day and evening. The courses for education programs taught online were delivered through an asynchronous learning network and had a prescribed schedule for completion of the coursework. At the vast majority of ITT Technical Institute campuses, the class schedule for education program residence courses and the coursework completion schedule for online courses generally provided students with the flexibility to maintain employment concurrently with their studies. Student surveys indicated that a majority of ITT Technical Institute students worked at least part-time during their programs. A significant portion of classes involved practical study in a lab environment.

===Accreditation===
ITT Tech was nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). According to ITT Educational Services&#x27; annual report for the fiscal year 2015, 31 campuses and more than 400 programs were not meeting ACICS standards for student retention. Per the ITT Tech web site, &quot;it is unlikely that any credits earned at an ITT Technical Institute will be transferable to or accepted by any institution other than an ITT Technical Institute.&quot; In April 2016, ACICS issued the company a &quot;show cause&quot; order to request information establishing why the accreditor should continue to accredit the institution. This order was in response to its programs being non-compliant with specific standards.

===Rankings===
In 2015, financial news site TheStreet.com ranked ITT Technical Institute-Seattle on a list of &quot;10 Best U.S. Two-Year Colleges That Actually Pay Off.&quot; According to TheStreet.com, ITT&#x27;s Seattle campus ranked fourth in terms of alumni reporting rewarding careers, only after its sister ITT Technical Institute schools in San Antonio, West Houston, and San Diego.

==Legal issues==

In September 1998, ITT Tech agreed to settle eight legal proceedings involving 40 former students arising out of their recruitment and education practices at ITT Tech campuses. The settlements cost $12.9 million, which included legal fees.

In Daniel Graves filed a whistleblower lawsuit against ITT Tech after a short stint working for the company, alleging compensation for some ITT staff violated the Higher Education Act of 1965 by incentivizing recruiters based on the number of students they enrolled with the school. The case alleged a culture of corruption at ITT, and was litigated for about 17 years until ITT prevailed when the US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of earlier rulings that the case was dismissed for failure to state a claim.

In 2004, federal agents served search warrants at the company&#x27;s headquarters and ten of its campuses in Indiana, Texas, Virginia, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, California, and Oregon, seeking various student records. No civil or criminal charges were made at this time. The investigation negatively affected the company&#x27;s stock and triggered several class-action lawsuits by investors. The same year, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California (CAG) investigated ITT Technical Institutes in California. The CAG&#x27;s investigation was in response to &quot;qui tam&quot; actions filed against the company under either state, federal, or both False Claims Acts. (&quot;Qui tam&quot; actions are writs through which private individuals who assist a prosecution can receive part or all of the damages or financial penalties recovered by the government as a result of the prosecution). The probe alleged that ITT Tech falsified records relating to student attendance, grades, and academic progress. It also said that ITT Tech falsified student grade point average calculations used to qualify students for financial aid under the State&#x27;s Cal Grant Program and retaliated against employees who may have complained about those alleged acts. Omer Waddles, ESI&#x27;s CEO, and a former counsel for Edward Kennedy, also resigned.

In October 2005, ITT agreed to pay $730,000 to settle a lawsuit with California. The involved employees alleged that it inflated students&#x27; grade point averages to qualify them for more financial aid from the State of California.

A February 2011 investigative report by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee found evidence of widespread grade inflation at the school&#x27;s Milwaukee area location in Greenfield. In one instance a student received a score of 100% on a computer forensics assignment by emailing the professor a noodle recipe. The station&#x27;s reporters believed tactics such as these increased federal student aid funding.

In 2013, a complaint was filed against ESI and two ESI executive officers in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York regarding securities. The Massachusetts Laborers&#x27; Annuity Fund filed a similar complaint and the cases were consolidated. The Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Retirement Fund were the lead plaintiffs. Students continue to allege that private loans with JP Morgan Chase and other banks are predatory loans. In 2013 &quot;USA Today&quot; listed more than 50 ITT campuses as &quot;red flag&quot; schools because their student loan default rates were higher than their graduation rates.

On February 26, 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sued ITT. The CFPB alleged ITT used high-pressure tactics to coerce students into obtaining high-interest private loans that were likely to end in default. ESI is also being investigated by at least a dozen state attorneys general for allegations of fraud and deceptive marketing. According to a July 2014 Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) committee report, 57% of ITT programs would fail the Department of Education&#x27;s proposed Gainful Employment rule.

On October 19, 2015, the US Department of Education announced that because of the company&#x27;s failure &quot;to meet its fiduciary obligations&quot; it was placed under additional scrutiny.

In a 2015 federal whistleblower lawsuit, former ITT employee Rodney Lipscomb alleged the company used coercive tactics to enroll students who were unlikely to pass classes at the school; unlawfully paid sales commissions to recruiters; and lied to students about their financial obligations and transferability of ITT credits to other schools and career prospects. The same year, The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) temporarily ordered ITT Tech to stop enrolling new or returning students who fund their educations with GI Bill benefits. In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission also announced fraud charges against ITT Educational Services Inc., its chief executive officer Kevin Modany, and its chief financial officer Daniel Fitzpatrick.

In 2016, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sued ITT Educational Services for allegedly &quot;misleading and harassing students.&quot; Breckinridge nurses also sued ITT Education for fraud. Between 2004 and 2014, several states issued subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands against ITT Tech under the authority of their consumer protection statutes: Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Washington.

On August 25, 2016, the U.S. Department of Education banned ITT Tech from enrolling students who receive federal aid. The department also doubled the surety funds that ITT Tech was required to have, and to produce those funds within 30 days. ITT stock soon dropped by 35% which triggered a halt in trading and raised concerns about whether ITT Educational would be able to survive this latest decision.

On September 6, 2016, ITT Tech ceased operations and closed all of its locations, issuing a statement that attributed the closing to the Department of Education&#x27;s actions.

In 2022, ITT Technical Institute was one of 153 institutions included in student loan cancellation due to alleged fraud. The class action was brought by a group of more than 200,000 student borrowers, assisted by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, part of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. A settlement was approved in August 2022, stating that the schools on the list were included &quot;substantial misconduct by the listed schools, whether credibly alleged or in some instances proven.&quot; In April 2023, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the settlement and allowed to proceed the debt cancellation due to alleged fraud.

<doc id="489526" wikidata="Q51615" url="?curid=489526" title="History of the Middle East">
<text>The Middle East, or the Near East, was one of the cradles of civilization: after the Neolithic Revolution and the adoption of agriculture, many of the world&#x27;s oldest cultures and civilizations were created there. Since ancient times, the Middle East has had several lingua franca: Akkadian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Arabic. The Sumerians, around the 5th millennium BC, were among the first to develop a civilization. By 3150 BC, Egyptian civilization unified under its first pharaoh. Mesopotamia hosted powerful empires, notably Assyria which lasted for 1,500 years. For centuries after the 7th century BC, the region was dominated by Persian powers like the Achaemenid Empire.

In the 1st century BC, the Roman Republic conquered most of the region, and its successor, the Roman Empire (its rule from the 6th to 15th centuries AD referred to as the Byzantine Empire), grew significantly more. Roman pagan religions were replaced by Christianity in the 4th century AD. From the 3rd to 7th centuries, Rome ruled alongside the Sasanian Empire. From the 7th century, Islam spread rapidly, expanding Arab identity in the region. The Seljuk dynasty displaced Arab dominance in the 11th century, followed by the Mongol Empire in the 13th century.In the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire invaded most of Anatolia, and dissolved the Byzantine Empire by capturing Constantinople in 1453. The Ottomans and the Safavid dynasty were rivals from the early 16th century. By 1700, the Ottomans were pushed out of Hungary. The British Empire gained control over the Persian Gulf in the 19th century, while French colonial empire extended into Lebanon and Syria. Regional rulers sought modernization to match European powers. A key moment came with the discovery of oil, first in Persia (1908), then in Saudi Arabia (1938), and other Gulf states, leading to increased Western interest in the region. In the 1920s to 1940s, Syria and Egypt pursued independence.

The British, French, and Soviets withdrew from much of the region during and after World War II. The Arab–Israeli conflict in Palestine culminated in the 1947 United Nations plan to partition Palestine. Amid Cold War tensions, pan-Arabism emerged in the region. The end of European colonial control, the establishment of Israel, and the rise of the petroleum industry shaped the modern Middle East. Despite economic growth, many countries faced challenges like political restrictions, corruption, cronyism and overreliance on oil. The wealthiest per capita are the small, oil-rich Gulf states, namely Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.

Several key events shaped the modern Middle East, such as the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 OPEC oil embargo in response to US support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War, and the rise of Salafism/Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia that led to rise of Islamism. Additionally, the Iranian Revolution contributed to a significant Islamic revival. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War, and regional conflict was soon made part of the War on Terror. In the early 2010s, the Arab Spring triggered major protests and revolutions in the region. Clashes in western Iraq in 2013 set the stage for the Islamic State (IS)&#x27;s expansion.

==Prehistoric period==
The earliest human migrations out of Africa occurred through the Middle East, namely over the Levantine corridor, with the pre-modern &quot;Homo erectus&quot; about 1.8 million years BP. One of the potential routes for early human migrations toward southern and eastern Asia is Persia.

Haplogroup J-P209, the most common human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup in the Middle East today, is believed to have arisen in the region 31,700 ± 12,800 years ago. The two main current subgroups, J-M267 and J-M172, which now comprise between them almost all of the population of the haplogroup, are both believed to have arisen very early, at least 10,000 years ago. Nonetheless, Y-chromosomes F-M89* and IJ-M429* were reported to have been observed in the Iranian plateau.There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium BC, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishermen was replaced by a grain-grinding culture. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 6000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile, where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralized society.

Neolithic agriculturalists, who may have resided in Northeast Africa and the Middle East, may have been the source population for lactase persistence variants, including 13910*T, and may have been subsequently supplanted by later migrations of peoples. The Sub-Saharan West African Fulani, the North African Tuareg, and European agriculturalists, who are descendants of these Neolithic agriculturalists, share the lactase persistence variant 13910*T. While shared by Fulani and Tuareg herders, compared to the Tuareg variant, the Fulani variant of 13910*T has undergone a longer period of haplotype differentiation. The Fulani lactase persistence variant 13910*T may have spread, along with cattle pastoralism, between 9686 BP and 7534 BP, possibly around 8500 BP; corroborating this timeframe for the Fulani, by at least 7500 BP, there is evidence of herders engaging in the act of milking in the Central Sahara.

==Ancient period==

The ancient Near East was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture and currency-mediated trade (as opposed to barter), gave the rest of the world the first writing system, invented the potter&#x27;s wheel and then the vehicular and mill wheel, created the first centralized governments and law codes, served as birthplace to the first city-states with their high degree of division of labor, as well as laying the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics. However, its empires also introduced rigid social stratification, slavery, and organized warfare.
===Cradle of civilization, Sumer and Akkad===
The earliest civilizations in history were established in the region now known as the Middle East around 3500 BC by the Sumerians, in southern Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), widely regarded as the cradle of civilization. The Sumerians and the Akkadians—who extended their empire to northern Mesopotamia (now northern Syria)—and later Babylonians and Assyrians all flourished in this region.

&quot;In the course of the fourth millennium BC, city-states developed in southern Mesopotamia that were dominated by temples whose priests represented the cities&#x27; patron deities. The most prominent of the city-states was Sumer, which gave its language to the area (presumably the first written language), and became the first great civilization of mankind. About 2340 BC, Sargon the Great (c. 2360–2305 BC) united the city-states in the south and founded the Akkadian dynasty, the world&#x27;s first empire.&quot;

During this same time period, Sargon the Great appointed his daughter, Enheduanna, as High Priestess of Inanna at Ur. Her writings, which established her as the first known author in world history, also helped cement Sargon&#x27;s position in the region.

===Egypt===

Soon after the Sumerian civilization began, the Nile valley of Lower and Upper Egypt was unified under the Pharaohs approximately around 3150 BC. Since then, Ancient Egypt experienced 3 high points of civilization, the so-called &quot;Kingdom&quot; periods:
* The Old Kingdom (2686–2181),
* The Middle Kingdom (2055–1650) and, most notably,
* The New Kingdom (1550–1069).
The history of Ancient Egypt is concluded by the Late Period (664–332 BC), immediately followed by the history of Egypt in Classical Antiquity, beginning with Ptolemaic Egypt.
===The Levant and Anatolia===

Thereafter, civilization quickly spread through the Fertile Crescent to the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and throughout the Levant, as well as to Anatolia. Ancient Levantine kingdoms and city states included Ebla City, Ugarit City, Kingdom of Aram-Damascus, Kingdom of Israel, Kingdom of Judah, Kingdom of Ammon, Kingdom of Moab, Kingdom of Edom, and the Nabatean kingdom. The Phoenician civilization, encompassing several city states, was a maritime trading culture that established colonial cities in the Mediterranean Basin, most notably Carthage, in 814 BC.

===Assyrian empires===

Mesopotamia was home to several powerful empires that came to rule almost the entire Middle East—particularly the Assyrian Empires of 1365–1076 BC and the Neo-Assyrian Empire of 911–605 BC. The Assyrian Empire, at its peak, was the largest the world had seen. It ruled all of what is now Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, and Bahrain—with large swathes of Iran, Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Sudan, and Arabia.
&quot;The Assyrian empires, particularly the third, had a profound and lasting impact on the Near East. Before Assyrian hegemony ended, the Assyrians brought the highest civilization to the then known world. From the Caspian to Cyprus, from Anatolia to Egypt, Assyrian imperial expansion would bring into the Assyrian sphere nomadic and barbaric communities, and would bestow the gift of civilization upon them.&quot;

===Neo-Babylonian and Persian empires===

From the early 6th century BC onwards, several Persian states dominated the region, beginning with the Medes and non-Persian Neo-Babylonian Empire, then their successor the Achaemenid Empire known as the first Persian Empire, conquered in the late 4th century BC by the very short-lived kingdom of Macedonia of Alexander the Great, and then successor kingdoms such as Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid state in Western Asia.

After a century of hiatus, the idea of the Persian Empire was revived by the Parthians in the 3rd century BC—and continued by their successors, the Sassanids from the 3rd century AD. This empire dominated sizable parts of what is now the Asian part of the Middle East and continued to influence the rest of the Asiatic and African Middle East region, until the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia in the mid-7th century AD. Between the 1st century BC and the early 7th century AD, the region was completely dominated by the Romans and the Parthians and Sassanids on the other hand, which often culminated in various Roman-Persian Wars over the seven centuries. Eastern Rite, Church of the East Christianity took hold in Persian-ruled Mesopotamia, particularly in Assyria from the 1st century AD onwards, and the region became a center of a flourishing Syriac–Assyrian literary tradition.

===Greek and Roman Empire===
In 66–63 BC, the Roman general Pompey conquered much of the Middle East. The Roman Empire united the region with most of Europe and North Africa in a single political and economic unit. Even areas not directly annexed were strongly influenced by the Empire, which was the most powerful political and cultural entity for centuries. Though Roman culture spread across the region, the Greek culture and language first established in the region by Macedonia continued to dominate throughout the Roman period. Cities in the Middle East, especially Alexandria, became major urban centers for the Empire and the region became the Empire&#x27;s &quot;bread basket&quot; as the key agricultural producer. Ægyptus was by far the most wealthy Roman province.

During the time that mystery cults were introduced to the region, traditional religions were often criticized and the cults gained societal influence. These cults formed around gods like Cybele, Isis, and Mithra.

As the Christian religion spread throughout the Roman and Persian Empires, it took root in the Middle East, and cities such as Alexandria and Edessa became important centers of Christian scholarship. By the 5th century, Christianity was the dominant religion in the Middle East, with other faiths (gradually including &quot;heretical&quot; Christian sects) being actively repressed. The Middle East&#x27;s ties to the city of Rome were gradually severed as the Empire split into East and West, with the Middle East tied to the new Roman capital of Constantinople. The subsequent Fall of the Western Roman Empire therefore, had minimal direct impact on the region.

====Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire)====

The Eastern Roman Empire, today commonly known as the Byzantine Empire, ruling from the Balkans to the Euphrates, became increasingly defined by and dogmatic about Christianity, gradually creating religious rifts between the doctrines dictated by the establishment in Constantinople and believers in many parts of the Middle East. By this time, Greek had become the &#x27;lingua franca&#x27; of the region, although ethnicities such as the Syriacs and the Hebrew continued to exist. Under Byzantine/Greek rule the area of the Levant met an era of stability and prosperity.

==Medieval period==
===Pre-Islam===
In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the Sasanian Empire of the Persians in what is now Iran and Iraq, and the Byzantine Empire in Anatolia and the Levant. The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The Byzantine-Sasanian rivalry was also seen through their respective cultures and religions. The Byzantines considered themselves champions of Hellenism and Christianity. Meanwhile, the Sasanians thought themselves heroes of ancient Iranian traditions and of the traditional Persian religion, Zoroastrianism.

The Arabian peninsula already played a role in the power struggles of the Byzantines and Sasanians. While Byzantium allied itself with the Kingdom of Aksum in the horn of Africa, the Sasanian Empire assisted the Himyarite Kingdom in what is now Yemen. Thus the clash between the kingdoms of Aksum and Himyar in 525 displayed a higher power struggle between Byzantium and Persia for control of the Red Sea trade. Territorial wars soon became common, with the Byzantines and Sasanians fighting over upper Mesopotamia and Armenia and key cities that facilitated trade from Arabia, India, and China. Byzantium, as the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire, continued control of the latter&#x27;s territories in the Middle East. Since 527, this included Anatolia, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Egypt. In 603 the Sasanians invaded, conquering Damascus and Egypt. It was Emperor Heraclius who was able to repel these invasions, and in 628 he replaced the Sasanian Great King with a more docile one. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power.

The nomadic Bedouin tribes dominated the Arabian desert, where they worshipped idols and remained in small clans tied together by kinship. Urbanization and agriculture was limited in Arabia, save for a few regions near the coast. Mecca and Medina (then called Yathrib) were two such cities that were important hubs for trade between Africa and Eurasia. This commerce was central to city-life, where most inhabitants were merchants. Nevertheless, some Arabs saw it fit to migrate to the northern regions of the Fertile Crescent, a region so named for its place between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that offered it fertile land. This included entire tribal chiefdoms such as the Lakhmids in a less controlled area of the Sasanian Empire, and the Ghassanids in a similar area inside of Byzantine territory; these political units of Arab origin offered a surprising stability that was rare in the region and offered Arabia further connections to the outside world. The Lakhmid capital, Hira was a center for Christianity and Jewish craftsmen, merchants, and farmers were common in western Arabia as were Christian monks in central Arabia. Thus pre-Islamic Arabia was no stranger to Abrahamic religions or monotheism, for that matter.

===Islamic caliphates===

While the Byzantine Roman and Sassanid Persian empires were both weakened by warfare (602–628), a new power in the form of Islam grew in the Middle East. In a series of rapid Muslim conquests, Arab armies, led by the Caliphs and skilled military commanders such as Khalid ibn al-Walid, swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory and completely engulfing the Persian lands. In Anatolia, they were stopped in the Siege of Constantinople (717–718) by the Byzantines, who were helped by the Bulgarians.

The Byzantine provinces of Roman Syria, North Africa, and Sicily, however, could not mount such a resistance, and the Muslim conquerors swept through those regions. At the far west, they crossed the sea taking Visigothic Hispania before being halted in southern France in the Battle of Tours by the Franks. At its greatest extent, the Arab Empire was the first empire to control the entire Middle East, as well three-quarters of the Mediterranean region, the only other empire besides the Roman Empire to control most of the Mediterranean Sea. It would be the Arab Caliphates of the Middle Ages that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant ethnic identity that persists today. The Seljuk Empire would also later dominate the region.

Much of North Africa became a peripheral area to the main Muslim centres in the Middle East, but Iberia (Al-Andalus) and Morocco soon broke away from this distant control and founded one of the world&#x27;s most advanced societies at the time, along with Baghdad in the eastern Mediterranean. Between 831 and 1071, the Emirate of Sicily was one of the major centres of Islamic culture in the Mediterranean. After its conquest by the Normans the island developed its own distinct culture with the fusion of Arab, Western, and Byzantine influences. Palermo remained a leading artistic and commercial centre of the Mediterranean well into the Middle Ages.

===Islamic culture and science===

Religion always played a prevalent role in Middle Eastern culture, affecting learning, architecture, and the ebb and flow of cultures. Muhammad&#x27;s introduction of Islam inspired achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Islam primarily consisted of the five pillars of belief, including confession of faith; the five prayers a day; to fast during the holy month of Ramadan; to pay the tax for charity (the zakat); and the hajj, the pilgrimage that a Muslim needed to take at least once in their lifetime. Islam also created the need for spectacularly built mosques which created a distinct form of architecture. Some of the more magnificent mosques include Al-Aqsa and the former Mosque of Cordoba. 

Islam unified the Middle East and helped the empires there to remain stable. Missionaries and warriors spread the religion from Arabia to Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Mesopotamia. This created a mix of cultures, especially in Africa, and the mawali demographic. Although the mawali would experience discrimination from the Umayyad, they would gain widespread acceptance from the Abbasids and it was because of this that allowed for mass conversions in foreign areas. &quot;People of the book&quot; or dhimmi were always treated well; these people included Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Zoroastrians. However, the crusades started a new thinking in the Islamic empires, that non-Islamic ideas were immoral or inferior; this was primarily perpetrated by the ulama (علماء) scholars.

Arabian culture took off during the early Abbasid age, despite the prevalent political issues. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in medicine, algebra, geometry, astronomy, anatomy, and ethics that would later find its way back to Western Europe. The works of Aristotle, Galen, Hippocrates, Ptolemy, and Euclid were saved and distributed throughout the empire (and eventually into Europe) in this manner. Muslim scholars also discovered the Hindu–Arabic numeral system in their conquests of south Asia. The use of this system in Muslim trade and political institutions allowed for the eventual popularization of it around the world; this number system would be critical to the Scientific Revolution in Europe. Muslim intellectuals became experts in chemistry, optics, and mapmaking during the Abbasid Caliphate. In the arts, Abbasid architecture expanded upon Umayyad architecture, with larger and more extravagant mosques. Persian literature grew based on ethical values. Astronomy was stressed in art. Much of this learning would find its way to the West. This was especially true during the Crusades, as warriors would bring back Muslim treasures, weapons, and medicinal methods.

== 11th century ==

===Arrival of the Seljuk Turks===
The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the Seljuk Turks, migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the Hejaz. Egypt held out under the Fatimid caliphs until 1169, when it too fell to the Turks.

Despite massive territorial losses in the 7th century, the Christian Byzantine Empire continued to be a potent military and economic force in the Mediterranean, preventing Arab expansion into much of Europe. The Seljuks&#x27; defeat of the Byzantine military in the Battle of Manzikert in the 11th century and settling in Anatolia effectively marked the end of Byzantine power. The Seljuks ruled most of the Middle East region for the next 200 years, but their empire soon broke up into a number of smaller sultanates.

=== First Crusade (1096–1099) ===

The Seljuk victory at the Battle of Manzikert led to them controlling the cities of Edessa and Antioch. Around 1078, the Seljuks formed the Sultanate of Rum, whose capital was at Nicaea in northwest Anatolia. The Seljuks controlled Jerusalem by 1087. Alexios I Komnenos, who became Byzantine emperor in 1081, realized that the Seljuks&#x27; growth could help him in his battle for control of Anatolia. 

In March 1095, Komnenos appealed to the states west of the Byzantine Empire for help. In November, in the Council of Clermont in France, Pope Urban II called for soldiers from across Europe to go east to take back the &quot;Holy Land&quot; for Christianity. This was an opportunity to strengthen the Catholic Church, and for the Pope to become the head of a unified Catholic and Orthodox church. 60,000 Christians, including thousands of knights, joined the cause, partially in order to protect Christian sites such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This mission, the First Crusade, began in 1096. This was the first of the Crusades, a series of religious wars in Europe and the Middle East from the 11th to the 13th centuries.

Four large armies headed east: the first was headed by Godfrey of Bouillon, the duke of Lower Lotharingia, and they arrived at Constantinople in December 1096. The second, headed by a Norman from Italy named Bohemond. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse was the most prominent Crusader at the start of the expedition; he led the third army. The fourth was led by Robert Curthose. The latter three armies reached Constantinople in April 1097. In May, the armies reached Nicaea, which surrendered to the Byzantines. In July, the armies headed for Antioch, reaching the city in October. The city, with strong defensive walls, was beseiged by the Crusaders until they took the city in June 1098. In January 1099, three of the armies headed for Jerusalem, while Bohemond stayed in Antioch. In June, the 1099 Siege of Jerusalem started, and the Crusaders took the city in July. The Crusaders massacred the non-Christian population of the city. The First Crusade ended with the establishment of multiple Crusader states in the region: from north to south, the County of Edessa, Principality of Antioch, County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

=== 1138 Aleppo earthquake ===
In October 1138, an earthquake struck Aleppo (located on the Dead Sea Transform), which had hundreds of thousands of residents at the time. The city&#x27;s walls and citadel were destroyed, killing an estimated 230,000 people. Crusader and Muslim forts, at Harem and Atarib respectively, were also destroyed.
=== Second Crusade (1147–1153) ===

In 1144, the Seljuks took back the city of Edessa, prompting Pope Eugenius III in December 1145 to call for the Second Crusade, protecting the achievements the Crusaders had made decades prior. Unlike the first war, these Crusaders were led by kings; two armies were commanded by Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France. In 1147, their armies reached Constantinople. Upon entering the Levant, the Crusaders faced heavy Seljuk resistance, and their war effort began collapsing after failing to take Damascus in 1148. Bernard of Clairvaux, an influential French saint who had advocated for the war, determined that its failure lied in the &quot;sinfulness of Europeans&quot;, and only through the &quot;purification and prayers of Christian[s]&quot; would God allow crusading knights to succeed; this became a core tenant of popular piety in medieval Europe.

=== Founding of the Ayyubid dynasty (1171—1187) ===
Najm al-Din Ayyub was the patriarch of a Kurdish warrior family in the mid-12th century. He was appointed by the Seljuks as governor of Damascus, and with his brother Shirkuh, he united the Syrians as one front in preparation for another war with the Crusaders. In 1171, Ayyub&#x27;s son Saladin, a Sunni living in Egypt, abolished the unpopular and failing Shi&#x27;ite Fatimid Caliphate, and founded the Ayyubid dynasty. He was a vassal of his father until Ayyub died in 1173, and then he moved to Syria and proclaimed himself as his father&#x27;s successor. From 1174 to 1186, in an act of &quot;jihad&quot;, a type of Islamic religious struggle, Saladin conquered and united the Muslims of Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine under the Ayyubid banner. He was seen as a &quot;a generous and virtuous but firm ruler, devoid of pretense, licentiousness, and cruelty&quot;. In 1187, at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin trapped and destroyed a Crusader army, giving the Ayyubids the opportunity to overrun the Kingdom of Jerusalem and take back its capital.

=== Third Crusade (1189—1192) ===

In response to the recapture of Jerusalem, in October 1187, Pope Gregory VII called for the Third Crusade, with similar goals to the previous wars. The new Crusader leaders were Frederick Barbarossa, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (HRE); Philip II of France; and Richard I of England. In 1190, as Barbarossa&#x27;s army traveled through Cilicia, he died. Lacking leadership, his soldiers either died, returned to Germany, or, in rare cases, made it to the Levant. 

In 1191, the English landed at Cyprus, ending the local rebellion against Byzantine rule led by a man named Isaac Komnenos who proclaimed himself ruler of the island. The Cypriots were forced to pay taxes to the Crusader war effort, and generations of Crusaders controlled the island until 1571. In the Levant in 1191, the English captured the cities of Acre and then Jaffa. In 1192, as the English were garrisoned in Acre, Saladin launched a siege of Jaffa. The English returned to the city and fought the Ayyubids; the battle ended in a stalemate. The English left for home, as Richard I had to deal with domestic affairs, and the Third Crusade ended. Saladin died in 1193.

=== Crusade of 1197 === 

Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s successor, Henry VI, set out for the Levant with an army in the Crusade of 1197. The Germans successfully captured Beirut from the Ayyubids, but later that year, Henry VI died in Sicily. In 1198, while the Germans were besieging Toron, they received the news of the emperor&#x27;s death, and abandoned the siege to return to Germany.

== 13th century ==

=== Fourth Crusade (1202—1204) ===
Jerusalem was still controlled by the Ayyubids in August 1198, when Pope Innocent III called for the Fourth Crusade to once again try recapturing the city for Christianity. At the time, the English, French, German, and Spanish monarchs were dealing with their own domestic affairs; Richard I of England vowed to return to the Middle East to finish the job of taking Jerusalem, but he died in 1199. The Crusader armies were thus commanded by &quot;second-tier&quot; noblemen from France, led by the Italian Boniface I, Marquis of Montferrat.
Boniface; his liege Philip of Swabia; and Alexios IV Angelos—son of Isaac II Angelos, who was Byzantine emperor before he was deposed by his successor, Alexios III Angelos, in 1195; agreed to use the Crusade as an opportunity to storm Constantinople and depose Alexious III. The Crusaders declared war on the Byzantines, and entered Constantinople. In July 1203, Isaac II and Alexios IV were made co-emperors. Alexios III&#x27;s son-in-law, Alexios V Doukas, was installed as emperor in January 1204. Doukas had Alexious IV strangled to death, and Isaac II imprisoned; the latter died in prison. In April 1204, Doukas demanded the Crusaders leave Constantinople. Instead, they committed the Sack of Constantinople, robbing the city of its wealth and goods. Parts of the Byzantine Empire were given to the Republic of Venice and its allies. Doukas fled the city and met up with Alexios III to join him as fugitives. However, Alexios III blinded him. Doukas was then captured by the Crusaders, who killed him as revenge for ordering Alexious IV&#x27;s death.

=== Fifth Crusade (1217—1221) ===
In 1215, Pope Innocent III called for another crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Ayyubids. The Fifth Crusade began in 1217. This time, the Crusaders decided to weaken the Ayyubids by capturing their cities in North Africa and Egypt, predicting the dynasty had a weak hold over that area. The Crusaders captured Damietta in Egypt, but in general, their plan did not work, as they had less soldiers, military equipment, and ships than needed; the Crusader leaders also disagreed over how to go about the war. The Ayyubids defeated them on the banks the Nile in August 1221. The Crusaders were forced to abandon Damietta, and once again return to Europe without taking Jerusalem.

=== Mongol invasion of Persia (1218—1223) ===

The Mongol Empire was founded in modern-day Mongolia in 1206, led by Genghis Khan. He was the first &quot;Khagan&quot;, the ruler of all the Mongol peoples. Over 12 years, the Mongols spread out from the eastern Eurasian Steppe into west and east Asia, brutally conquering much of the continent&#x27;s land with a large army of effective cavalry and archers. In 1218, 100,000 Mongol soldiers entered the Khwarazmian Empire in Persia, and captured the Khwarazmian cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. Muslims were massacred; their irrigation systems and some of their cities were completely destroyed, leading them to nickname Genghis Khan the &quot;Accursed One&quot;. From 1221 to 1223, the Mongols conquered the lands encircling the Caspian Sea.

In 1227, Genghis Khan died, and his son Ögedei Khan became the new Khagan. Ögedei split the empire into four areas; one owned by him, and the others individually owned by his three brothers. Tolui received the Middle Eastern quadrant. Initially, this did not mean Ögedei&#x27;s brothers led the government in their respective areas; he ultimately governed the whole empire for decades.

=== Sixth Crusade (1228—1229) ===
Frederick II became Holy Roman Emperor in 1220, during the Fifth Crusade. His legitimacy as emperor was questioned by Pope Innocent III and Innocent&#x27;s successor, Honorious III. Before the crusade was over, Frederick promised to go south and join the Crusaders, but this did not happen. After the Crusade ended, he expanded the Holy Roman Empire into central Europe and Sicily, encircling the country of the Papal States which the Pope ruled. Honorious III asked Frederick to honor his pledge to retake Jerusalem, for its own religious sake and to take pressure off of the Papal States. Frederick agreed to start the Sixth Crusade in August 1227, but delayed his departure to illness. Honorious&#x27; successor, Gregory IX, then excommunicated Frederick from the Catholic Church as punishment for not following his pledge to go.
This incident did not demotivate Frederick, and he sailed to the Levant with a well-equipped army of 12,000: 10,000 infantry and 2,000 knights. They landed at Acre in September 1228. Frederick entered negotiations with Levantine religious leaders such as those in the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, but they would not negotiate with someone who was now outside the church. Frederick was able to talk with them through military commanders associated with him, but who were seen as technically independent of him. Promising the religious leaders hereditary land and military promotions, Frederick was able to make an agreement in 1229 to expand the Kingdom of Jerusalem&#x27;s Levantine territory and allow Christians to reoccupy most of Jerusalem.

=== Seventh Crusade (1248—1254) ===
In the fifteen years following the Sixth Crusade, many Ayyubid cities on the Mediterranean coast started allying with the local Crusader states out of convenience. This was because, after the Ayyubid sultan al-Kamil died in 1238, his successors started fighting over control of the region which destabilized these cities. In August 1244, the Muslim Khwarazmians took Jerusalem back from the Christians, and in October, a Christian army was defeated by the Ayyubids at the Battle of Forbie in Gaza, which stabilized and strengthened Ayyubid control. The Christians remaining in Jerusalem were massacred, and their holy sites were destroyed. Pope Innocent IV called for the Seventh Crusade, which was led by Louis IX of France. Louis wanted to take both Jerusalem and Egypt from the Muslims. The Crusaders captured Damietta in 1249, and then went to Mansourah in 1250, where they were routed by a Muslim army. Louis was captured and ransomed back to the Crusaders, who returned home once again.

=== Founding of the Mamluk Sultanate (1250) ===
Mamluks were enslaved Muslim soldiers who made up armies in the Abbasid Caliphate. These armies had Mamluk generals, who, in 1250, formed the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria. The sultanate was officially a part of the Abbasid government, and ruled for centuries. These Mamluks had no relation to the Mamluk dynasty in India, which also existed in the 13th century.

=== Siege of Baghdad (1258) ===

The siege of Baghdad and the death of Abbasid Caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim in 1258 temporarily ended the caliphate. When the Khagan Möngke Khan died in 1259, any further Mongol expansion in the region was halted, as the regional military leader Hulegu Khan had to return to the Mongol capital Karakorum for the election of a new khagan. His absence resulted in the first defeat of the Mongols by the Egyptian Mamluks during the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. Issues began to arise when the Mongols were unable to reach a consensus as to whom to elect Khagan. Additionally, conflict occurred between traditionalists who wished to retain their nomadic culture and Mongols moving towards sedentary agriculture. All of this led to the fragmentation of the empire in 1260. Hulegu carved out his Middle Eastern territory into the independent Ilkhanate, which included most of Armenia, Anatolia, Azerbaijan, Mesopotamia, and Iran.

The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuk Turks. 

== 14th century ==

=== Black Death (1346—1353) ===

The Black Death was a pandemic of the plague that spread throughout the Old World—but mostly Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa—from 1346 to 1353. The disease was caused by bacteria &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, carried to humans by fleas on rodents, and then from human to human. It originated in Central Asia, and was unknowingly brought to Crimea via Mongol warriors, as well as traders (Mongols and others) who used the trade routes that connected Europe and Asia (such as the Silk Road). It is likely that Genoese trading ships—with either infected humans or flea-carrying rats onboard—brought the plague from Crimea to the Byzantine Empire in 1347, when sailing back to Italy through Constantinople. From then until 1349, the Black Death spread from Byzantine territory down through the rest of the Middle East. Around 30% to 50% of the population in any infected area died from the disease.

== 15th century ==
In 1401, the region was further hit by the Turko-Mongol, Timur, and his ferocious raids.

=== Fall of Constantinople (1453) ===

The Ottomans conquered almost all of Anatolia and the Balkans in the late 14th century, forcing Constantinople into vassalage and then fighting the Hungarians. In 1422, Ottoman sultan Murad II besieged Constantinople, but stopped to deal with another rebellion in the Ottoman Empire. In 1444, Murad suffered a defeat in the Balkans, prompting him to abdicate his throne to his son, Mehmed II. In 1446, Murad returned to being the sultan, and remained as such until he died in 1451, again succeeded by Mehmed. 

By the 1450s, a weakened Byzantine Empire had lost much of its territory in wars with the Balkan states and Roman Catholic armies. The population of Constantinople, weakened by two centuries of sporadic raids, had dropped in population from 400,000 in the 12th century to 40,000 to 50,000. Mehmed planned to finish Murad&#x27;s goal of conquering the city, and in 1452, he made peace with Hungary and Venice. In April 1453, he led an army to Constantinople, and besieged the city. In May, the city fell to the Ottomans, ending the Roman Empire after 1500 years of continuous existence.

== 16th to 17th centuries ==

By the early 15th century, the Ottomans had become the region&#x27;s largest power. The Mamluks held them out of the lower Middle East for a century, but in 1514 Selim the Grim began the Ottoman conquest of the region. Syria was occupied in 1516 and Egypt in 1517, extinguishing the Mamluk line. Iraq was conquered almost in 40 years from the Iranian Safavids, who were successors of the Aq Qoyunlu.

The Ottomans united the whole region under one ruler for the first time since the reign of the Abbasid caliphs of the 10th century, and they kept control of it for 400 years, despite brief intermissions created by the Safavids and Afsharids. By this time the Ottomans also held Greece, the Balkans, and most of Hungary, setting the new frontier between east and west far to the north of the Danube. Regions such as Albania and Bosnia saw many conversions to Islam, but Ottoman Europe was not culturally absorbed into the Muslim world.

By 1699, the Ottomans had been driven out of Hungary, the Polish—Lithuanian Commonwealth, and parts of the western Balkans in the Great Turkish War. In the Great Divergence, Europe had overtaken the Muslim world in wealth, population and technology. Some historians argue that science had already been in decline in the Muslim world since the 14th century while other argue that sciences still continued until the 17th century. The Industrial Revolution and growth of capitalism magnified the divergence, and from 1768 to 1918, the Ottomans gradually lost territory.

== 18th century ==

=== French invasion of Egypt and Syria (1798—1799) ===
In February 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the general Napoleon—a leader of the French Directory, the new French government—requested the Directory, who were at war with the United Kingdom, to cancel their planned invasion of Britain. He instead began planning a French invasion of Egypt, then ruled by the Mamluks. This would halt British trade in the Levant, make France pose a threat to the British army in India, and &quot;obtain assets for bargaining in any future peace settlement&quot;. France also planned to make a progressive government in Egypt to bring them [the Egyptians] back to their former status. To achieve this, France brought along scholars and scientists to study and report on Egyptian society. Napoleon and his army sailed to Egypt in May 1798.

The British Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, sailed to Egypt to fight the French navy. On land, in July 1798, the French won against the Mamluks at the Battle of the Pyramids. However, at the Battle of the Nile in August, Napoleon&#x27;s fleet at Abu Qir was greatly damaged by the Mediterranean Fleet. French communication lines were severed, and Napoleon worked to make his commandable soldiers self-sufficient. The Egyptians resented French occupation, and were further angered in September, when Ottoman sultan Selim III declared war on France. In February 1799, Napoleon marched the French into Ottoman Syria and besieged Acre, a strategic position beneficial for them to capture. The siege failed, and in May, the Napoleon brought his forces back into Egypt. In July, Ottoman naval forces arrived at the shore of Abu Qir, but failed to maintain a bridgehead so they could fight the French on land. Napoleon decided to return to France, and in August, the French fleet successfully sailed past the British and went home.

The French researchers who had been studying Egyptian society discovered the Rosetta Stone during their work. It is a stone from ancient Egypt inscribed with the same message written in five different writing systems: two forms of the Greek language, the Egyptian language, and two forms of hieroglyphs. The latter two writing systems were hardly understood by European researchers. They were compared with the Greek and Egyptian alphabets—which European researchers did know—and decoded, leading to new understanding of hieroglyphs.

== 19th century ==
Greece, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria achieved independence during the 19th century, and the Ottoman Empire became known as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;, increasingly under the financial control of European powers. Domination soon turned to outright conquest: the French annexed Algeria in 1830 and Tunisia in 1878 and the British occupied Egypt in 1882, though it remained under nominal Ottoman sovereignty.

In 1878, as the result of the Cyprus Convention, the United Kingdom took over the government of Cyprus as a protectorate from the Ottoman Empire. While the Cypriots at first welcomed British rule, hoping that they would gradually achieve prosperity, democracy and national liberation, they soon became disillusioned. The British imposed heavy taxes to cover the compensation they paid to the Sultan for conceding Cyprus to them. Moreover, the people were not given the right to participate in the administration of the island, since all powers were reserved to the High Commissioner and to London.

The British also established effective control of the Persian Gulf, and the French extended their influence into Lebanon and Syria. In 1912, the Italians seized Libya and the Dodecanese islands, just off the coast of the Ottoman heartland of Anatolia. The Ottomans turned to Germany to protect them from the western powers, but the result was increasing financial and military dependence on Germany.

==20th century==
===Final years of the Ottoman Empire===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Middle Eastern rulers tried to modernize their states to compete more effectively with Europe. In the Ottoman Empire, the Tanzimat reforms re-invigorated Ottoman rule and were furthered by the Young Ottomans in the late 19th century, leading to the First Constitutional Era in the Empire that included the writing of the 1876 constitution and the establishment of the Ottoman Parliament. The authors of the 1906 revolution in Persia all sought to import versions of the western model of constitutional government, civil law, secular education, and industrial development into their countries. Throughout the region, railways and telegraph lines were constructed, schools and universities were opened, and a new class of army officers, lawyers, teachers, and administrators emerged, challenging the traditional leadership of Islamic scholars.

This first Ottoman constitutional experiment ended soon after it began, however, when the autocratic Sultan Abdul Hamid II abolished the parliament and the constitution in favor of personal rule. Abdul Hamid ruled by decree for the next 30 years, stirring democratic resentment. The reform movement known as the Young Turks emerged in the 1890s against his rule, which included massacres against minorities. The Young Turks seized power in the 1908 Young Turk Revolution and established the Second Constitutional Era, leading to pluralist and multiparty elections in the Empire for the first time in 1908. The Young Turks split into two parties, the pro-German and pro-centralization Committee of Union and Progress and the pro-British and pro-decentralization Freedom and Accord Party. The former was led by an ambitious pair of army officers, Ismail Enver Bey (later Pasha) and Ahmed Cemal Pasha, and a radical lawyer, Mehmed Talaat Bey (later Pasha). After a power struggle between the two parties of Young Turks, the Committee emerged victorious and became a ruling junta, with Talaat as Grand Vizier and Enver as War Minister, and established a German-funded modernisation program across the Empire.

Enver Bey&#x27;s alliance with Germany, which he considered the most advanced military power in Europe, was enabled by British demands that the Ottoman Empire cede their formal capital Edirne (Adrianople) to the Bulgarians after losing the First Balkan War, which the Turks saw as a betrayal by Britain. These demands cost Britain the support of the Turks, as the pro-British Freedom and Accord Party was now repressed under the pro-German Committee for, in Enver&#x27;s words, &quot;shamefully delivering the country to the enemy&quot; (Britain) after agreeing to the demands to give up Edirne.

=== World War I (1914–1918) ===
In 1914, Enver Pasha&#x27;s alliance with Germany led the Ottoman Empire into the fatal step of entering World War I on the side of the Central Powers against the Entente, an alliance that included Russia, Great Britain and France. The British saw the Ottomans as the weak link in the enemy alliance, and concentrated on knocking them out of the war. When a direct assault failed at Gallipoli in 1916, they turned to fomenting revolution in the Ottoman domains, exploiting the awakening force of Arab, Armenian, and Assyrian nationalism against the Ottomans.

The British found an ally in Sharif Hussein, the hereditary ruler of Mecca believed by many to be a descendant of Muhammad, who led an Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule, after being promised independence.

The Entente won the war and the Ottoman Empire was abolished with most of its territories ceded to Britain and France; Turkey just managed to survive. The war transformed the region in terms of shattering Ottoman power which was supplanted by increased British and French involvement; the creation of the Middle Eastern state system as seen in Turkey and Saudi Arabia; the emergence of explicitly more nationalist politics, as seen in Turkey and Egypt; and the expansion of oil industry, particularly in the Gulf States.

=== Aftermath of World War I ===

==== Ottoman defeat and partition ====
When the Ottoman Empire surrendered to the Allies in 1918, the Arab patriots did not get what they had expected. Islamic activists of more recent times have described it as an Anglo-French betrayal. The governments of the European Entente had concluded a secret treaty before the armistice, the Sykes–Picot Agreement, partitioning the Middle East amongst themselves. The British had in 1917, endorsed the Balfour Declaration promising the international Zionist movement their support in re-creating the historic Jewish homeland in Palestine.

After the Ottomans withdrew, Arab leaders proclaimed an independent state in Damascus, but were swiftly defeated by the forces of Great Britain and France who soon after establishing control, re-arranged the Middle East to suit themselves.

Syria became a French protectorate as a League of Nations mandate. The Christian coastal areas were split off to become Lebanon, another French protectorate. Iraq and Palestine became British mandated territories. Iraq became the &quot;Kingdom of Iraq&quot; and one of Sharif Hussein&#x27;s sons, Faisal, was installed as the King of Iraq. Iraq incorporated large populations of Kurds, Assyrians and Turkmens, many of whom had been promised independent states of their own.

Meanwhile, the fall of the Ottomans and the partitioning of Anatolia by the Allies led to resistance by the Turkish population, under the Turkish National Movement led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Turkish victory against the invading powers during the Turkish War of Independence, and the founding of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923. Atatürk, the Republic&#x27;s first President, embarked on a program of modernisation and secularisation that pushed Turkey both economically and culturally closer to Europe and away from the Arab world. He abolished the caliphate, emancipated women, enforced western dress and the use of a new Turkish alphabet based on Latin script in place of the Arabic alphabet, and abolished the jurisdiction of the Islamic courts.

==== Palestine, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt ====
Another turning point came when oil was discovered, first in Persia (1908) and later in Saudi Arabia (1938) as well as the other Persian Gulf states, Libya, and Algeria. The Middle East, it turned out, possessed the world&#x27;s largest easily untapped reserves of crude oil, the most important commodity in the 20th century. The discovery of oil in the region made many of the kings and emirs of the Middle East immensely wealthy and enabled them to consolidate their hold on power while giving them a stake in preserving western hegemony over the region.

As the West became dependent on Middle Eastern oil exports and British influence steadily declined, American interest in the region grew. Initially, Western oil companies established a dominance over oil production and extraction. However, indigenous movements towards nationalizing oil assets, oil sharing, and the advent of OPEC ensured a shift in the balance of power towards the Arab oil states.

Britain was granted a Mandate for Palestine in April 1920 at the San Remo Conference, and, in July 1922, this mandate was approved by the League of Nations. Palestine became the &quot;British Mandate of Palestine&quot; and was placed under direct British administration. The Jewish population of Palestine, consisting overwhelmingly of recent migrants from Europe, numbered less than 8 percent in 1918. Under the British mandate, Zionist settlers were granted wide rein to immigrate initially, buy land from absentee landlords, set up a local government and later establish the nucleus of a state all under the protection of the British Army, which brutally suppressed multiple Palestinian Arab revolts in the years that followed, including in 1936. The Territory East of the Jordan River and west of Iraq was also declared a British Mandate when the Council of the League of Nations passed the British written Transjordan Memorandum in September 1922. Most of the Arabian peninsula, including Mecca and Medina, though not incorporated into either a British or French colonial mandate, fell under the control of another British ally, Ibn Saud, who in 1932, founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

In the early 20th century, Syria and Egypt made moves towards independence. In 1919, Egypt&#x27;s Saad Zaghloul orchestrated mass demonstrations in Egypt known as the First Revolution. While Zaghloul would later become Prime Minister, the British repression of the anticolonial riots led to around 800 deaths. In 1920, Syrian forces were defeated by the French in the Battle of Maysalun and Iraqi forces were defeated by the British when they revolted. In 1922, the (nominally) independent Kingdom of Egypt was created following the British government&#x27;s issuance of the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===

In 1939, World War II began when fascist Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. It was mainly fought between the Allies (including the U.K., United States, and Soviet Union) against the Axis powers (including Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire of Japan). Germany occupied much of Europe. In the Holocaust, Germany murdered millions of people in concentration camps throughout occupied Europe, including six million Jews.The French Third Republic, an Allied power, was invaded by Germany in May 1940. In June, Germany won and split France into two governments, the northern half of the country under direct German control, and the southern under the semi-autonomous Vichy France, which collaborated with Germany. Syria was put under the administration of Vichy France.

The Middle East was essential to the British Empire, so Germany and Italy worked to undermine British influence there. Hitler allied with the Muslim leader Amin al-Husseini—in exile since he participated in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine—as part of promoting Arab nationalism to destabilize regional British control. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran since 1941, tried to keep his country neutral in the presence of Axis agents. The handover of Syria to Vichy France threatened British communication lines between Europe and India, which was a British colony; this was exacerbated by Germany&#x27;s successful invasion of Greece. 

In accordance with the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, Egypt allowed the U.K. to operate facilities related to the war effort in Egypt&#x27;s territory, though few Egyptians supported the British. In 1940, the U.K. pressured King Farouk of Egypt into forming a government more cooperative with the British. In 1942, as the U.K. predicted a German invasion of Egypt, British again intervened in Egypt in the Abdeen Palace incident, and installed a pro-British prime minister there. The U.K.&#x27;s actions furthered Farouk&#x27;s hostility towards the British. Egypt declared war on Germany and Japan in 1945. 

In Iraq, successive prime ministers Nuri al-Said and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani were unsuccessful in allying Iraq with the U.K. against Germany and Italy, as the British seemed to be losing the war. Meanwhile, pan-Arabist leaders throughout the Middle East encouraged Iraqi leaders to free Syria and Palestine from British control. al-Gaylani, initially reluctant to do so, eventually succumbed to pan-Arabism and began negotiations with the Axis in 1940. In response, Britain sent a limited occupation force to Iraq, which al-Gaylani allowed. In the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, al-Gaylani was ousted by other Iraqi leaders; he was soon reinstated as prime minister, though opposed to the U.K. again. 

In April 1941, the Anglo-Iraqi War began as the U.K. invaded Iraq. al-Gaylani and the pan-Arabists fled the country, and the U.K. installed pro-British leaders once more. The British also successfully invaded Syria and Lebanon, to secure their regional control and provide security for the British in Egypt. Meanwhile, the Allies were worried Germany would try to access Iranian oil reserves, and the Soviets needed new supply routes to other Allied states after Germany invaded the western Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. These factors prompted the successful Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in August 1941.

When World War II ended, the British, French, and Soviets, withdrew from most parts of the regions they had occupied both before and during the War II and seven Middle East states gained or regained independence: Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Israel, and Cyprus.
=== Establishment of the State of Israel (1948) ===
In Palestine, conflicting forces of Arab nationalism and Zionism created a situation the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. The Holocaust created a new urgency in the Zionist quest to immigrate to Palestine and create a Jewish state. A Palestinian state was also an attractive alternative to the Arab and Persian leaders, instead of the de facto British, French, and perceived Jewish colonialism or imperialism, under the logic of &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;. 

The Arab—Jewish struggle culminated in the 1947 United Nations plan to partition Palestine. This plan sought to create an Arab state and a separate Jewish state in the narrow space between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. Jewish leaders accepted the plan, but Arab leaders rejected it.

In May 1948, when the British Mandate expired, the Zionist leadership declared the State of Israel. In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War which immediately followed, the armies of Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia intervened and were defeated by Israel. About 800,000 Palestinians fled from areas annexed by Israel and became refugees in neighbouring countries, thus creating the &quot;Palestinian problem&quot;, which has troubled the region ever since. Approximately two-thirds of 758,000–866,000 of the Jews expelled or who fled from Arab lands after 1948 were absorbed and naturalized by the State of Israel.

=== 1952 Egyptian revolution ===

In Egypt, civil conflict between left- and right-wing radicals, and the continued British and French occupation of the Suez Canal, led to the 1952 Egyptian revolution. In July 1952, Farouk was overthrown in a coup by the Free Officers, a group of Egyptian nationalist military officers led by Major General Mohamed Naguib and General Gamal Abdel Nassar. 

The Egyptian monarchy was dissolved, and in June 1953, Egypt became a republic. A council of eleven military officers led by Nassar, the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council, governed the country with &quot;carefully controlled manipulation&quot; of the populace. Political parties were banned. Naguib was made Egypt&#x27;s president, but was effectively a puppet ruler, answering to the council. However, his position threatened Nassar&#x27;s influence, so in 1954, Nassar mobilized a coalition of supporters (including the working class, the Muslim Brotherhood, police officers, and members of the former political parties) and overthrew Naguib, placing him under house arrest. Nassar was made prime minister.

&quot;Britannica&quot; writes that in Nassar&#x27;s 1954 book &quot;Philosophy of the Revolution&quot;, he &quot;outlined his aspiration to be the leader of the 55 million Arabs, then of the 224 million Africans, then of the 420 million followers of Islam&quot;. He initially had a moderate diplomatic approach with Israel; the U.K.; and the Sudanese people in southern Egypt, who wanted independence. In 1953, Egypt agreed to a Sudanese provisional self-government, and Sudan became an independent republic in 1956.

=== 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état ===
After World War II, the U.K. continued its presence in Iran, effectively controlling Iran&#x27;s oil industry through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh became Iran&#x27;s prime minister, and his democratic and nationalist government took control of the Iranian parliament. The parliament voted to nationalize Iran&#x27;s oil industry, leading the U.K. to &quot;secret[ly] campaign to weaken and destabilize Mosaddegh&quot;. The Shah was influenced by the U.K. to attempt to oust Mosaddegh from government with a parliamentary decree. This failed and only strengthened Mosaddegh, while weakening the Shah. The U.K. then used anti-communist rhetoric to persuade the U.S.—now in the Cold War against the Soviets—into overthrowing Mosaddegh.

In the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état, the U.S.&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.K. funded agents in Iran who were &quot;used to foment unrest&quot; against Mosaddegh through &quot;harassment of religious and political leaders and a media disinformation campaign&quot;. In August 1953, Mosaddegh was overthrown after deadly fighting in Tehran, and the CIA sanctioned the Shah becoming the singular leader of Iran. Mosaddegh was put under house arrest until his death. The coup and its effects created the conditions for the 1979 Iranian revolution.
=== Suez Crisis (1956) ===
The Suez Crisis in 1956 originated in Egypt&#x27;s growing support for Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, communist allies. In response, the U.S. and U.K. decided not to finance Egypt&#x27;s construction of the Aswan Dam across the Nile. This provoked Gamal Abdel Nassar into nationalizing the Suez Canal in July 1956, seizing the British and French Suez Company. The U.K. and France, thinking that Nassar might close off the canal—thus cutting off petroleum shipments to Europe—began a military response against Egypt. In October, Israel joined the conflict, advancing towards the canal. This interfered with the British and French plan, and they forced Israel to stand down. In November, the two countries occupied the canal; the U.S., disapproving of this, led a campaign in the United Nations (UN) to force the British and French out of the canal. Egypt ultimately won control over the canal, and the U.K. and France lost much influence in the Middle East.

=== Modern Middle East ===
The modern Middle East was shaped by three things: departure of European powers, the founding of Israel, and the growing importance of the oil industry. These developments eventually led to increased U.S. involvement in the region. The U.S. was the ultimate guarantor of the region&#x27;s stability as well as the dominant force in the oil industry after the 1950s. When revolutions brought radical anti-Western regimes to power in Egypt (1954), Syria (1963), Iraq (1968), and Libya (1969), the Soviet Union, seeking to open a new arena of the Cold War, allied itself with Arab socialist rulers.

In the mid-to-late 1960s, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar took power in both Iraq and Syria. Iraq was first ruled by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, but was succeeded by Saddam Hussein in 1979. Syria was ruled first by a Military Committee led by Salah Jadid, and later Hafez al-Assad until 2000, when he was succeeded by his son, Bashar al-Assad.

=== Cyprus independence and conflict (1960—present) ===
In August 1960, Cyprus gained its independence from the British Empire. Archbishop Makarios III, a charismatic religious and political leader, was elected its first independent president, and in 1961 it became the 99th member of the United Nations. Between 1955 and 1974, conflict arising between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots led to Cypriot intercommunal violence and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The Cyprus dispute remains unresolved.

=== Six-Day War (1967) ===

Tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors rose in 1966 and 1967, as Palestinian armed groups and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attacked each other in bursts. In May 1967, Soviet intelligence released a report falsely claiming that Israel was going to start an offensive against Syria, which prompted Gamal Abdel Nasser to mobilize his forces in solidarity with Syria and prepare for war. In the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel invaded and captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt; the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria. The war ended with Israel&#x27;s continued control of the territories when all countries involved agreed to a ceasefire. The Arab countries had 18,000 casualties in the war, while Israel had 700. In November 1967, UN Resolution 242 called for Israel to return the conquered territories in exchange for a lasting peace, which the country did not do. One million Palestinians now lived under Israeli occupation. With an overwhelming Israeli victory, many viewed the defeat as the failure of Arab socialism. Militant and fundamentalist Islam filled the &quot;political vacuum&quot; that was made.

=== War of Attrition (1967—1970) ===
The Arab position, as it emerged in September 1967 at the Khartoum Summit, later become known as the &quot;three nos&quot;: no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel. In 1968, Nasser announced his plans to take back the Sinai Peninsula, receiving aid from the Soviets to make up for Egyptian losses in the war. The War of Attrition started with limited fighting. The war paused with a mutual ceasefire as both countries built up their forces. In 1969, a larger-scale war began, minorly involving Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, and Syria in an eastern front. In 1970, Nasser asked for direct military support from the Soviets, who began air strikes on Israelis in Egypt. This led to the U.S. mediating another ceasefire, ending the war with no territorial changes.

=== Yom Kippur War, the PLO, and the Camp David Accords (1973—1979) ===
After the War of Attrition, new Egyptian president Anwar Sadat expressed willingness to reach an accord with Israel based on UNSC resolution 242, but Golda Meir rejected the proposal, leading to the Yom Kippur War. In October 1973, Egypt and Syria invaded the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights to take them back. The U.S. sided with Israel, and the Soviet Union with Egypt and Syria. In 1974, the three warring states agreed to ceasefires and the construction of a UN buffer zone between Egypt and Syria. The Sinai Peninsula stayed under Israeli occupation.

In 1964, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was created as an umbrella organization for underground anti-Israel Palestinian rebels. They grew in the post-1967 occupation, and in 1969, Yasser Arafat was made their chairman. PLO&#x27;s many factions have different ideologies, from wanting to destroy the state of Israel and replace it with a religiously-equal state, or negotiating with Israel for peace. In the 1970s, some PLO factions engaged in guerrilla warfare against Israel and elsewhere from the PLO&#x27;s headquarters in Jordan, before Jordan forced them out in 1971. The PLO moved to Lebanon. In 1974, Arafat ordered the end of attacks outside of Israel, and Arab states recognized the PLO as the legitimate Palestinian governmental body.

The 1978 Camp David Accords mediated by the U.S. led to the 1979 Egypt—Israel peace treaty, in which Israel agreed to stop occupying the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt unsuccessfully tried to get Israel to recognize a Palestinian state which governed Gaza and the West Bank; Israel still sought to destroy the PLO. The accords&#x27; &quot;Framework for Peace in the Middle East&quot; put off peace between Israel and Palestine for a later time.

=== White Revolution and the Iranian revolution (1963—1979) ===
From 1963 to 1979, the Shah reformed Iran in the White Revolution. A Western ally, he rapidly urbanized, secularized, and Westernized the country, while forgoing democracy and human rights. Women received more liberties, land was redistributed to families, literacy increased, tribal groups were given greater autonomy, and the economy boomed from oil. Contrarily, political opposition was marginalized and censored, and dissidents were surveilled, harassed, or tortured. &quot;Ulama&quot; Shia scholars were undermined by secular leaders, and the economic changes did not reach everyone equally.

Shi&#x27;ite leaders disliked secularization and women&#x27;s rights—one leader was the populist and anti-Western Ruhollah Khomeini, who was exiled from Iran in 1964 by the Shah. However, he still had influence there, and called for the Shah&#x27;s overthrow. During the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown. The Shah died from health issues in Egypt, and Khomeini became the country&#x27;s leader. He made Iran a Shi&#x27;ite theocratic state, cut ties with the West, and rolled back women&#x27;s rights. He stayed in power until 1989.

Shi&#x27;ite militants held 66 Americans hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981. The hostage takers wanted the U.S. to extradite the Shah to Iran to be put on trial for human rights abuses. The U.S. did not comply, and stopped buying Iranian oil, which hurt the U.S. economy. The Shah&#x27;s death did not end the crisis, and U.S. president Jimmy Carter lost the 1980 presidential election amidst an oil-related recession. In 1981, when Carter&#x27;s successor Ronald Reagan took office, the hostages were freed.

=== Lebanese Civil War (1975—1990) ===
The PLO&#x27;s move to Lebanon, and Israel&#x27;s wish to destroy the PLO, partially led to the Lebanese Civil War, which was fought from 1975 to 1990. Fighting was between the Lebanese Army; Israel; Syria; the PLO; the Lebanese Front, representing the country&#x27;s traditional Christian elites; the Lebanese National Movement of leftists, Arab nationalists, and Sunnis; and the Amal Movement of Shi&#x27;ite populists. The war ultimately led to Israel and Syria occupying different parts of Lebanon until 2000 and 2005, respectively.During the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel invaded Lebanon, seven years into the civil War. The invasion was ostensibly because of attacks launched on Israel by PLO members located in Southern Lebanon. Israel reached as far as west Beirut, where the PLO had its main stronghold, putting that part of the city under siege. 19,000 people died under the siege. Those PLO members made an agreement with Israel to leave Lebanon for Tunisia, while Israel occupied Southern Lebanon until 2000, supporting proxy wars there. 

In September 1982, Lebanese president-elect Bachir Gemayel was assassinated by a Syrian nationalist potentially under orders from Hafez al-Assad. Soon after, the Kataeb Party right-wing Lebanese militia, coordinating with the IDF, carried out the Sabra and Shatila massacre of 2,000 to 3,500 Lebanese and Palestinian civilians. Out of this conflict came Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi&#x27;ite political party and militant organization opposed to Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia, and supported by Iran. In October 1983, a terrorist attack by the Islamic Jihad Organization on an American military barrack in Beirut killed 300 American and French soldiers.

=== Iran—Iraq War (1980—1988) ===

Saddam Hussein became the president of Iraq in July 1979. The Shi&#x27;ite revolution in Iran concerned Hussein, who thought that majority-Shi&#x27;ite Iraq would face a similar uprising. He also wanted to overturn the 1975 Algiers Agreement, which let Iran control the Shatt al-Arab waterway in exchange for Iran withdrawing support for an insurgency by northern Iraqi Kurds. The Shatt al-Arab had been Iraq&#x27;s only way to access the Persian Gulf. Hussein had begun relying on Iraq&#x27;s minority Sunni population when in September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, starting the Iran—Iraq War. Hussein considered this militarily viable because Iran&#x27;s military was considered to be weakened after the revolution. Iraq first captured the oil-producing region of Khuzestan, but Iranians intensely resisted, and by early 1982, all the Iranian territory that Iraq had taken was reclaimed. Nevertheless, the war continued for another six years at great cost for both sides.

=== Assassination of Anwar Sadat (1981) ===
In October 1981, on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, Anwar Sadat was assassinated by a group of Islamic extremists while he was inspecting troops in Cairo. They disliked that Sadat negotiated with Israel and let the Shah die in Egypt instead of extraditing him to Iran. The perpetrators were led by Khaled el Islambouli, who had connections to the terrorist group Takfir Wal-Hajira. Takfir Wal-Hajira was partially funded by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Sadat in 1980. Sadat was succeeded by his vice president Hosni Mubarak, who put hundreds of people on trial for conspiracy in the assassination. In the following years, Mubarak continued following the terms of the Camp David Accords, and improved relations with other Arab states, Israel, and the U.S.
=== Iran—Contra affair (1985—1987) ===
In the 1980s, the U.S. supported the Contras—fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan government—financially and militarily, as Ronald Reagan feared Marxism spreading through Central America. Supporting the Contras was soon banned by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Americans in Lebanon were being held captive by Shi&#x27;ites supporting Iran; the U.S. publicly denied negotiating with terrorists or aiding Iran during its war with Iraq, labeling Iran a terrorist state. Secretly, starting in 1985, Reagan sold Iran weapons in exchange for the hostages&#x27; release, diverting some sales revenue to the Contras. This was publicized in 1986, but Reagan was not punished for the illegal act.

=== First Intifada (1987—1993) ===

In 1977, the right-wing political party Likud won the Israeli elections, leading to Israel expropriating more land and furthering settlements in the West Bank. Palestinian protests following the invasion of Lebanon increased Israel&#x27;s repression in Gaza and the West Bank. The conditions for a Palestinian uprising were greater as certain Palestinians challenged the PLO&#x27;s leadership and viewed Israel, which in the mid-1980s had a significant number vying for peace, as more receptive to Palestinian protests. 

In December 1987, an Israeli caused a vehicle crash that killed four Palestinians, as revenge for the fatal stabbing of an Israeli in Gaza years prior. The crash led to the First Intifada, a Palestinian uprising—involving the PLO—against Israel. It started as protests and turned into a military conflict against the occupiers. 2,000 people died, around three quarters being Palestinian deaths. In 1988, the PLO denied the U.S.&#x27; deal of making peace with Israel on the condition that the PLO acknowledge &quot;Israel’s right &#x27;to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries&#x27;&quot;. The Intifada politically and economically hurt Israel, who elected politicians favoring peace in the 1992 elections.

=== Dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991) ===
The fall of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism in the early 1990s had several consequences for the Middle East. It allowed large numbers of Soviet Jews to emigrate from Russia and Ukraine to Israel, further strengthening the Jewish state. It cut off the easiest source of credit, armaments, and diplomatic support to the anti-western Arab regimes, weakening their position. It opened up the prospect of cheap oil from Russia, driving down the price of oil and reducing the west&#x27;s dependence on oil from the Arab states. It discredited the model of development through authoritarian state socialism, which Egypt, Algeria, Syria, and Iraq had followed since the 1960s, leaving these regimes politically and economically stranded. Rulers such as Saddam Hussein increasingly relied on Arab nationalism as a substitute for socialism.

In most Middle Eastern countries, the growth of market economies was said to be limited by political restrictions, corruption, and cronyism, overspending on arms and prestige projects and over-dependence on oil revenues. The successful economies were countries that had oil wealth and low populations, such as Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the ruling emirs allowed some political and social liberalization, but without giving up any of their own power.
=== Yemeni unification and civil war (1990—1994) ===
In 1990, North and South Yemen unified as the Republic of Yemen, whose constitution outlines a liberal parliamentary democracy led by a popularly elected president and a bicameral legislature, one house being popularly elected and the other elected by the president. The first president of the republic was Ali Abdullah Saleh. In the following years, southern Yemenis felt they had a lesser status than the northerners, and tried to split off from the north. Saleh disallowed this, starting the Yemeni civil war of 1994. He ultimately maintained the union. In the 2000 Treaty of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia ceded land to northern Yemen.

=== Gulf War, 1991 Iraqi uprisings, and the 1998 bombing of Iraq ===

In August 1990, Iraq—with the world&#x27;s fifth-largest army—invaded Kuwait in retaliation for oil-related economic disputes between the two countries. The Kuwaitis strongly resisted Iraq, but within days, the capital of Kuwait City was captured. Kuwaiti emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah fled to Saudi Arabia and established a government-in-exile, to which 350,000 Kuwaitis fled. Iraq was supported by Algeria, Jordan, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen, while Kuwait was supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and other Gulf states. As Iraqi troops neared Saudi Arabia, Saudi King Fahd asked his allies to respond militarily, which the Soviets supported.

The U.S. launched Operation Desert Shield, deploying more than 400,000 troops and backed by an international coalition. Iraq stopped plans to invade Saudi Arabia. Iraq then established the Republic of Kuwait occupation government led by Colonel Alaa Hussain Ali. The occupiers &quot;began a systematic campaign of pillage, rape, torture, murder, and theft&quot;. Hussein used the Kuwaiti crisis to end the Iran—Iraq War, as Iraq accepted Iranian terms and stopped occupying parts of Iran. In January 1991, the coalition&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm started, led by U.S. General Norman Schwarzkopf. It involved air, ground, and naval offenses. Iraq, outnumbered and using ineffective weaponry, was quickly defeated. Iraqi casualties vastly outnumbered the coalition&#x27;s. Iraq was forced into making peace and recognizing the re-established Kuwaiti emirate&#x27;s soveriegnty.

In the war&#x27;s aftermath, Kurds in northern Iraq started a rebellion against Hussein&#x27;s government, which was brutally suppressed. This caused the coalition countries to establish a no-fly zone over parts of Iraq. As part of the war&#x27;s peace terms, Iraq had to cooperate with UN investigators who would search the country for the presence of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Iraq refused to cooperate with the UN, leading to the 1998 bombing of Iraq by the U.S. and U.K.

=== Oslo Accords (1993—1995) ===
The 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO were initially a significant step towards peace between Israel and Palestine. The accords advocated a two-state solution, and in a slight weakening of Israel&#x27;s post-1967 occupation of Palestine, Gaza and the West Bank were allowed limited self-governance by the Palestinian Authority. The agreement had the goal of ending the Israel—Palestine conflict by May 1999, but this did not happen. In November 1995, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist who was against the accords. This brought up concerns about Israel&#x27;s national security, which led to the 1996 election of Benjamin Netanyahu, who was against the accords, as prime minister. Netanyahu refused to negotiate with Yasser Arafat. While Netanyahu&#x27;s successor Ehud Barak resumed negotiations, tensions between Israel and Palestine had once again started to rise.

== 21st century ==

=== Second Intifada (2000–2005) ===

The 2000 Camp David Summit, meant to further peace between Israel and Palestine, failed. Also that year, Israeli politician Ariel Sharon, leader of Likud, visited the Temple Mount—a holy site for both Jews and Muslims in the Old City of Jerusalem—to promote Israeli sovereignty over the site. Sharon&#x27;s visit and rioting by Israeli Arabs led to the Second Intifada, an uprising by Palestinians against Israeli security forces in Palestine which lasted until 2005. The Intifada and the failure of the Camp David summit, &quot;Britannica&quot; writes, &quot;convinced a majority of Israelis that they lacked a partner in [Yasser] Arafat to end the [Israel-Palestine] conflict&quot;. 

In June 2002, at the height of the uprising, Israel built a barrier between and Israel and the West Bank, and inside of the West Bank, which Israeli security forces still continued to patrol. 10% of the West Bank&#x27;s territory effectively became under the control of Israel through the barrier&#x27;s construction. In 2003, Sharon, then the prime minister of Israel, announced Israeli security forces would withdraw from Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Arafat died in 2004, leading to negotiations between Israel and a more moderate Palestinian government, which led to an agreement for a ceasefire in 2005. In September 2005, Israel withdrew its military and settlers from the Gaza Strip, but still patrolled the territory&#x27;s borders and airspace.

=== Al-Qaeda and the Iraq War (2001–2011) ===

In 1988, Osama bin Laden—an Islamist, pan-Islamist, and jihadist of the wealthy bin Laden family which had connections to the Saudi royal family—founded al-Qaeda, a militant terrorist organization. In 1996 and 1998, he declared war on the U.S. in response to their foreign policy in the Middle East, such as their permanent military presence in countries like Saudi Arabia. On 11 September 2001 (9/11), al-Qaeda launched a series of major terrorist attacks on various targets in the U.S., killing almost 3000 people. U.S. president George W. Bush launched a &quot;war on terror&quot; against terrorist organizations worldwide, including al-Qaeda and their supporters. In October, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to find Osama bin Laden and dissolve the Taliban government which had been harboring al-Qaeda in the country. Bush soon proclaimed that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea constituted an &quot;axis of evil&quot; which supported anti-American terrorism. His administration worked to falsely tie Iraq to 9/11, and claim Iraq too was harboring al-Qaeda. This was while the U.S. maintained relations with Saudi Arabia, who have been more credibly accused of working with the perpetrators.
In 2002, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld developed a plan to invade Iraq, remove Hussein from power, and turn Iraq into a democratic state with a free-market economy, which he hoped would serve as a model for the rest of the Middle East. The Bush administration falsely claimed that Iraq was developing and hiding WMDs which could be used to harm the U.S. or other western democracies. British Prime Minister Tony Blair sided with the U.S. In March 2003, a U.S.-led international coalition invaded Iraq, toppling Hussein&#x27;s government in April. Hussein was captured in December 2003, put on trial for crimes against humanity in 2005, and was found guilty before being executed in December 2006.

When Hussein&#x27;s government collapsed, Iraq&#x27;s major cities were subject to widespread looting, and the occupation soldiers came under attack by a new Iraqi insurgency. The insurgency was driven by Al-Qaeda, now present in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The return of formerly-persecuted Shi&#x27;a Muslims to the country created a civil war with the Sunnis, who had just lost significant power with the dissolution of the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party and were radicalized by al-Zarqawi. 

U.S. troop deaths rose, while they tried to recreate Iraq as a democratic country with free elections. In the U.S. in 2004, it was publicized that U.S. soldiers working at the Iraqi Abu Ghraib prison—which held Iraqi prisoners of war—had engaged in widespread torture and abuse of the inmates; these soldiers were prosecuted by the military, but it still had a negative effect on the war&#x27;s popularity. In 2006, al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing. In 2007, amidst greater numbers of U.S. deaths in a &quot;grave and deteriorating&quot; war, Bush started a surge of American troops in Iraq; it is debatable if successive U.S. gains in Iraq were due to the troop surge or other concurrent factors.

=== Further conflict involving Israel, Gaza, and Lebanon (2000–2009) ===

Starting in 2000, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in skirmishes over land disputes and the detention of Lebanese nationals by Israel. In July 2006, Hezbollah fired a series of rockets into northern Israel and had ground troops cross the border into Israel, where eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two were kidnapped. This began the 2006 Lebanon War, which lasted until August, when Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah agreed to follow UN Resolution 1701.

The Palestinian militant organization Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. Israel recognized the West Bank&#x27;s administration as being led by the moderate Fatah, who came in second in the election. Hamas, who only succeeded in governing the Gaza Strip, was declared a hostile group. Israel started a blockade around the Gaza Strip, closing border crossings and limiting imports into the strip. Hamas attacked Israel multiple times, before they made a six-month ceasefire agreement that lasted from June to December 2008. Once the agreement was over, the military conflict restarted with greater intensity, starting the Gaza War of 2008 to 2009. The war ended with another ceasefire agreement, but the blockade by Israel as well as Egypt has continued until the present day.

=== Dubai growth in the 21st century ===
In the first decades of the 21st century, the Emirati city of Dubai underwent rapid development in previously barren desert land. This included the 2010 opening of the Burj Khalifa, the world&#x27;s tallest building at 2,717 feet. In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote that Dubai could be &quot;the most important city&quot; of the century, noting that its growth increased the population of the UAE by around 1.3 million in the previous decade.

=== Arab Spring (2010–2012) ===
In the early 2010s, the Arab Spring revolutionary wave created major protests and uprisings to several Middle Eastern and Arab-majority countries&#x27; governments. It started in December 2010 with the Tunisian revolution, which forced the resignation of the country&#x27;s president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. In January 2011, the Egyptian Revolution started which forced the resignation of Hosni Mubarak in February. In Bahrain, protests against the government in February and March 2011 were violently suppressed by the government. In March, protests in Syria against Bashar al-Assad were violently suppressed, leading to the Syrian civil war that year. In Yemen, protests forced the resignation of Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was succeeded by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi in November; Hadi&#x27;s government was similar unstable, which led to the Yemeni civil war which started in 2014.

=== Modern Yemeni conflicts (2003–present) ===
In 2003, the Iran-backed Yemeni Houthi movement began an insurgency against Saleh&#x27;s government—which persecuted Zaydi Shi&#x27;ites—as well as Saudi Arabia. In 2009, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula formed in Yemen, causing Saudi Arabia to secure their border with Yemen. The Yemeni civil war, ongoing since 2014, has been fought between the Republic of Yemen government; the Houthis and their Supreme Political Council government; al-Qaeda; and each faction&#x27;s allies. In September 2014, the Houthis took over the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, and Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was put under house arrest. He escaped to Saudi Arabia in 2015. Saudi Arabia and the UAE fought alongside the Republic of Yemen, but the Houthis maintained their holdings. The Houthis captured the city of Aden in 2018, influencing the UAE to withdraw from Yemen.

=== Syrian civil war and the Islamic State (2011–present) ===

2012 was successful for Syrian rebel groups opposing al-Assad, establishing a foothold in Aleppo. The Battle of Aleppo became a stalemate in early 2013. The civil war soon became a proxy war, as al-Assad received support from Hezbollah, Iran, and Russia, while rebel groups—starting to have their own infighting—received support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the U.S. In August 2013, hundreds of civilians in Damascus were killed in a chemical attack by the al-Assad regime. This caused debate in the U.S., U.K., and France over whether or not they should militarily intervene in Syria. This was opposed by China, Iran, and Russia. In September, Syria, the U.S., and Russia made an agreement that al-Assad would rid Syria of chemical weapons, which was successfully carried out. Meanwhile, the Al-Nusra Front, an Islamist al-Qaeda affiliate, had military success in Syria.

In 2013, a Sunni insurgent terrorist group, the Islamic State (IS), started an offensive that took large amounts of territory in Iraq and Syria, fighting both the Iraqi government and, in Syria, al-Assad and his opposing rebels. In June 2014, IS proclaimed themselves a caliphate led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They launched many terrorist attacks worldwide. IS&#x27; growth overshadowed the successes of the Al-Nusra Front. In 2016, the Al-Nusra Front cut ties with al-Qaeda and soon dissolved, succeeded by the group Tahrir al-Sham in 2017.

There was an international military campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria from 2013 to 2017, which fed into the Syrian civil war. The U.S. and a coalition of Arab countries bombed IS; Russia bombed IS and unrelated Syrian rebel groups, falsely claiming they [Russia] were mostly targeting IS. The U.S. allied with Kurdish-aligned forces such as the Syrian Democratic Forces. Turkey and the Kurds continued their decades-long war with each other, while both were allied with the U.S. and fighting IS. Turkey backed Syrian rebels along the Syria–Turkey border, and the Turkish military directly occupied part of northern Syria in August 2016 to fight IS and the Kurds. IS was thus fighting three simultaneous fronts: al-Assad, Kurds, and Turkey, as well as each of their allies.

Outnumbered, IS lost control of three major cities: Aleppo, Raqqa, and Deir al-Zour. The group was &quot;effectively defeated&quot; by November 2017, though they kept a small territory until 2019. In 2018, Israel targeted Iranian soldiers stationed in Syria. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died in Syria in October 2019, when he committed suicide amidst an attack on him by U.S. forces. While the original IS organization declined, a branch of IS based in south-central Asia named Islamic State – Khorasan Province became more powerful in the 2020s.

=== 2014 Gaza War ===
In 2014, Hamas militants kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers, and two Israelis retaliated by murdering a Palestinian teenager. Large demonstrations by both sides led to exchanges of rocket fire by both sides. Israel launched a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas&#x27; underground tunnel network that was used to store their missiles. Israel successfully destroyed them, limiting Hamas&#x27; ability to greatly attack Israel for around a decade. Israel and Hamas then agreed to a ceasefire.

=== 2020 Beirut explosion ===
In August 2020, the city of Beirut was greatly damaged when a stockade of ammonium nitrate that had been negligently left in the city&#x27;s port for years exploded, creating a shockwave. At least 200 people were killed, 6,000 injured, and 300,000 made homeless. The explosion worsened an national economic crisis that had already been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Israeli conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, and Iran (2023–present) ===

In 2022, Benjamin Netanyahu returned as Israeli prime minister, cementing what CNN referred to as &quot;Israel’s likely most right-wing government ever&quot;. On 7 October 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale surprise attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people, the majority Israeli civilians. Hundreds were taken hostage by Hamas. It was the deadliest day in the history of Israel, who declared war on Hamas. Hezbollah began rocket attacks on Israel, and Israel responded with air strikes. Israeli also conducted air strikes on Gaza, followed by a full land invasion. By November 2024, 43,000 Gazan civilians and militants have been killed in the war and most of the strip has been destroyed.

There were multiple peace talks between Israel and Hamas—involving the U.S.—but most of these failed. The U.S. minorly held back Israel&#x27;s plans for Gaza, while at the same time supplying Israel with weapons. Israel was accused by multiple countries and international organizations of committing a genocide of Palestinians. Iran formed an anti-Israel &quot;axis of resistance&quot; with Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria, and Yemeni Houthis. Iran and Israel launched air strikes at each other. The Houthis attacked shipping in the Red Sea, leading to a U.S.-led military response.

In September 2024, Israeli intelligence launched a widespread attack in Lebanon, by flooding the country with electronic devices such as pagers which had been rigged to explode. The devices were intended to be sold to Hezbollah members, though some civilians were killed. In October, Israel invaded Lebanon, escalating their conflict with Hezbollah.

=== Dissolution of Ba&#x27;athist Syria (2024) ===
In December, a coalition of Syrian opposition armies captured Damascus, forcing Bashar al-Assad to flee the country—likely to Russia—ending Ba&#x27;athist Syria. Since 2022, al-Assad had received less support from Russia, who were &quot;bogged down&quot; in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of Tahrir al-Sham from 2017 to 2025, became president of Syria&#x27;s new national government.

<text>Ryu (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a character and the protagonist of Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. Introduced in &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987), Ryu appears as the game&#x27;s lead character alongside his best friend and friendly rival Ken Masters. Other games in the series show Ryu&#x27;s training and dedication to being the strongest fighter he can be, befriending new fighters. Unable to control his dark nature, Ryu develops two alter egos throughout the series: and . Mastering the dark nature is Ryu&#x27;s main objective in order to become stronger. He has appeared as a playable character in several crossover game franchises, including &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros&quot;. Additionally, he is featured in manga and anime adaptations, as well as the 1994 live-action film.

Ryu was created by game designer Takashi Nishiyama, who was inspired by the martial artist Mas Oyama while designing the character. For his second appearance, Ryu&#x27;s design changed from a young fighter to a skilled karate practitioner. However, because of issues in the making of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, he possessed a major weakness within the cast. For the next titles, Ryu&#x27;s fighting style was modified, so he had different skills, with Evil Ryu and Kage possessing more diverse moves. Multiple Japanese and English actors have voiced him. While his appearance remained mostly intact, &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; gave Ryu a major redesign in reference to his master Gouken.

A pop culture icon, Ryu has become one of the most iconic fighting game characters ever, inspiring several other fighters through his alter egos while his friendship and rivalry with Ken were praised for how different they developed despite being nearly the same in their introductions. The character also received mixed responses for recycling an archetype of the corrupted protagonist in the form of Evil Ryu and Kage. In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Ryu&#x27;s appearance attracted critics for his sex appeal.

== Creation and development ==
===Origins===

Before the creation of Ryu as the main protagonist of the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, Capcom designer Takashi Nishiyama had initially envisioned a different character for the role. The original concept was for a Caucasian man donning a leather jacket, who even makes an appearance during the opening sequence of the game. However, this idea was eventually set aside in favor of creating a character who practiced karate and wore a traditional dougi, leading to the creation of Ryu. Still wanting to utilize the concept, after subsequently transitioning to SNK, Nishiyama later implemented the character as Terry Bogard, who debuted as the protagonist of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;.

Nishiyama&#x27;s inspiration for Ryu was Mas Oyama, who was depicted as the protagonist in the kung fu manga and anime series &quot;Karate Master&quot; by Ikki Kajiwara. Nishiyama grew up watching the animated series, which was influenced by Oyama&#x27;s life. Nishiyama was impressed by Oyama&#x27;s martial arts skills and philosophies, and this inspired him to create the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game. Nishiyama wanted the game to have a story similar to a film, anime, or novel. Whereas Ryu was based on Oyama, his rival Sagat was also influenced by the protagonist&#x27;s rivalry with a bald Muay Thai martial artist from the series. Ryu&#x27;s name was based on Nishiyama&#x27;s name because the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese pronunciation) of the character &quot;Takashi&quot; is &quot;Ryū&quot; (Mandarin: &quot;Lóng&quot;, 隆).

In an interview with &quot;Game On!&quot;, Capcom Research and Development head Noritaka Funamizu said that of the series&#x27; characters, Ryu was one of the most popular with American audiences, alongside Zangief and Guile. Ryu&#x27;s Shoryuken was noted to be highly difficult to execute, something which the team wanted to fix. Although Ryu and Ken had the same moves, Yoshiki Okamoto said Ryu was the weaker of the two. This was because Capcom wanted to add a weak point to their Shoryukens. They later decided not to do so, but a mistake resulted in Ryu becoming the weaker character. Ryu and Ken were mainly handled by Shoei, who had clear memories of designing the Hadoken and Shoryuken. Shoei Okano recalled they were originally going to be Y.S.-san&#x27;s characters in the early stages of development. He noted Ryu and Ken are the &quot;so-called standard characters in the &quot;SFII&quot; world, and since they were coming from &quot;SFI&quot;, we could have the other characters be weirdos.&quot; As a result, the duo was redesigned to have a stoic feel.

The first decision when making the prequel &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; was keeping Ken, Ryu and Chun-Li. Capcom did not want to end up with just Japanese and Asian characters. As much as they could, they wanted to think in terms of creating a good balance, with all sorts of different skin colors. The secret of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; is the Ryu and Ken vs. Bison team-up mode, where if word did not get out, we figured we would just stay silent. However, the staff spoiled it. While they found such an idea fun, it eventually became a troublesome mode. This eventually inspired more team-up fights involving characters who wear opposing colors like Ryu and Ken. While &quot;Street Fighter&quot; keeps giving Ryu&#x27;s quest for self-improvement, &quot;Alpha 2&quot; introduced the concept of a darker alter-ego influenced by Akuma, Evil Ryu. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Ryu and Ken were meant to have an acrobatic bald slender black male wearing a &quot;gi&quot; named &quot;King Cobra&quot;, who became Rufus.

=== Designs ===

Ryu wears a white gi, as a symbol of his Japanese heritage, with the Japanese symbols for the Fūrinkazan (風林火山 (Hepburn: &quot;Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain&quot;)) on his belt as well as a stylised version on his gloves. While many &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters have been redesigned, Ryu&#x27;s design has stayed largely the same. In &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, the character was included because of presence in the first game, symbolizing the concept of a Japanese martial artist. As the series progressed, his design was made more muscular to coincide with the concept, while his white gi, considered his most defining characteristic by the development team, let viewers know he was &quot;a karate master at first sight&quot;. For the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; games, Ryu was redesigned as a younger character. Artist Naoto &quot;Bengus&quot; Kuroshima noted that the expectations that come with drawing him or Chun-Li were greater compared to newcomers like Sakura Kasugano. When picking the cast of &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, producer Yoshinori Ono said he wanted Ryu and the cast to differ from their previous characters although Ryu retained his original look in contrast to Ken. In the three &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; games, the designers described the older Ryu as a more hardcore fighter. Despite being Japanese, Capcom described him as an American martial artist which led to the creation of Makoto whose design was based on an Eastern point of view. The original white bandana became red in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; due to an oversight. Despite the bandana aiming to cover long hair, Akiman claimed that Capcom decided to keep his hair shorter to make him cooler. In &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; he was given a swap costume of him looking like a devil reflecting powers he has to control while an unused design gave him a futuristic style.

In previews of &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, Ryu was noted to have a more realistic look to the point of being compared to the &quot;Tekken&quot; characters. Capcom said this approach to &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;″s artistic design, focused on two main points: making the art &quot;easy to follow and understand&quot; and creating a &quot;personality with artistic accents&quot;. Ryu had multiple costumes in &quot;V&quot; including his &quot;Alpha&quot;, one with a notable sex appeal. In 2020, Ryu received a Kairi costume. For the &quot;Championship Edition&quot; of the game, new moves were added to make Ryu a more defensive fighter.

To update Ryu&#x27;s image while staying true to his character, Capcom created his alternative alter ego Evil Ryu. However, it was not until &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; that the staff decided to give him a more unique design though the designer was worried if he exaggerated too much with his look. In retrospect, Capcom felt that Evil Ryu was a success among players. While Bison was introduced as the series&#x27; main nemesis, the inclusion of Akuma added more conflict to Ryu&#x27;s story, allowing him to develop Evil Ryu.

For &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Kyle Hebert was chosen to play the role of Ryu in anticipation of the revival of his &quot;Evil Ryu&quot; alter ego. The director of localization, Taliesin Jaffe, informed Hebert that he gave him the role because of Evil Ryu. In further elaborating on this idea, Jaffe mentioned that Ryu was originally meant to be a character similar to Lancelot, and he was expecting the character to undergo corruption right from the start. During Kyle&#x27;s initial audition, he was requested to read a few lines in a darker tone. The team aimed to prevent Ryu from being portrayed as a typical Japanese hero and create a differentiation between his and Ken&#x27;s personalities.

As downloadable content, Capcom created another alter ego of Ryu in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; named Kage who represents the &quot;Satsui no Hado&quot; Ryu rejected. In the early stages of development, Kage had a noticeably different design. His entire body showed no skin as it was covered in purple. Designing the character did not take too much time according to Takayuki Nakayama. His &quot;design was nailed down pretty quick, so there aren&#x27;t many prototype images that can be shown.&quot; He was loosely based on Ryu&#x27;s dark persona from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; game&#x27;s Evil Ryu. According to developers, Ryu rejecting Kage ends the chapter of the Satsui no Hado as Ryu became able to control such inner darkness.

In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Ryu is bearded and wears a kasaya, a Buddhist robe, which is similar to his master, Gouken, as well as inspired by his alternate design from &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; that helped to expand his sex appeal. While game is set after the events of &quot;3rd Strike&quot; which ends with Ryu becoming wiser, director Takayuki Nakayama said &quot;not there yet&quot; - though he seems to have gained some dignity. He is also no longer barefoot and wears sandals instead.

===Fighting style===
Capcom regularly calls Ryu&#x27;s fighting style &quot;Ansatsuken Karate&quot;, despite also mentioning others such as Kyokushin, Shotokan, Kempo, Taekwondo and Judo.

Ryu has three special techniques. The first is the energy attack was based on the wave motion gun from the titular spacecraft in the sci-fi anime series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, which Nishiyama watched during the seventies. His other two techniques from the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, and were inspired by actual martial arts moves, which were exaggerated for the character. Because Ryu was the only playable character in the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, his designer Manabu Takemura wanted him to be easy for players to relate to. These three moves were reused in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; by Ryu&#x27;s master Gouken but stronger based on Kamei&#x27;s desire to make the master more skilled in comparison. In general, Ryu became a challenging character to master as he relies on projectiles and leg sweeps.

Ryu develops stronger versions of the Hadoken due to a desire of Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda in regards to the size of the move in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Shoei Okano animated the new Hadoken. While Ryu and Ken have the same moves in every game, Ken was given flashier combos. Sagat was also designed as another of Ryu&#x27;s rivals as both have similar uppercut in the form of Ryu&#x27;s Shoryuken and Sagat&#x27;s Tiger Uppercut. The first enhanced Hadoken is the in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; which &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; describes as Gouken&#x27;s creation but Ryu learned it on his own after defeating Sagat. In &quot;Undisputed Street Fighter: A 30th Anniversary Retrospective&quot;, it was noted that while Ken nearly the same as Ryu, his redesign in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; helped to improve his popularity thanks to its more original take. This also was helped by the fact that Ken&#x27;s special moves have flames in contrast to Ryu&#x27;s electric moves like the originally introduced in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;. The color of the electricity generated from inside the body is yellow, while artificial or electricity generated from the outside is blue. Ryu and Gouken utilize both Hadou and electric current when using Denjin Hadoken. The Denjin Hadoken is said to be learned once Ryu becomes able to master the &quot;Satsui no Hado.&quot; Meanwhile, Kage uses the which is far more enhanced than previous Hadokens.

Director Hideaki Itsuno remembers he was not allowed to work on Ryu because of his inexperience in making games. As a result, Itsuno worked on creating new characters for the series which could rival Ryu and Ken. While Ryu has retained his original white gi outfit in most games, Capcom tried using an alternate high school uniform for &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; where he was presented as a rebel. The concept for Ryu was &quot;leader&quot;—leader of a student group or a bunch of delinquents. Super deformed versions of this image were used by the company as April Fool&#x27;s jokes.

While originally conceived as a character for fighting game newcomers, Ryu has been balanced across the series with &quot;3rd Strike&quot; focusing on his defense. This balancing affected the character negatively to the point multiple expert players said that in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; he was unsuitable for competitive fights. In 2019, Capcom patched the character, which garnered a positive response from fans. In the manga based on &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, Ryu also develops a stronger version of the Shoryuken against M. Bison he calls . The same technique was incorporated into the games as Ryu&#x27;s new moves. The &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; persona of Ryu was noted to be more complex by Red Bull for his new as well as the electric which opens strategies for new combos and can be followed up with a Tatsumaki for a major combat.

=== Spin-offs and other media ===
Comic book writer Len Strazewski wanted to tell a more dramatic storyline for Ryu based in a comic book narrative. Like storylines involving chaos, Strazewski wrote a comic in which Ryu was the center of attention as he sought revenge. As a result, to find a motivation for Ryu&#x27;s character, he planned to kill his best friend Ken Masters. However, since the comic book was cancelled after its third issue, this plot was never fully explored. Mangaka Masahiko Nakahira, the creator of Evil Ryu, wrote his own take on Ryu during his career, aiming for a more serious take on Ryu&#x27;s personality in his works.

Actor Byron Mann said in the making of the live-action Ryu he had no knowledge of Ryu&#x27;s identity or what &quot;Street Fighter&quot; was originally about. Director Steven E. de Souza wanted Mann to play Ryu, but Capcom was not keen because they had their own actor, Kenya Sawada, who had played the character in various promotions in Japan. Sawada would play a more serious Ryu in contrast to Mann&#x27;s portrayal. Nevertheless, DeSouza was able to use Mann in the film as Sawada&#x27;s English was not good. Sawada played a character written for him: Captain Sawada. Ken Masters&#x27; actor, Damian Chapa, said the name is pronounced &quot;Rye-you&quot; as opposed to &quot;Ree-you&quot;. Despite issues with this, DeSouza decided to use &quot;Rye-you&quot; believing it would be easier to pronounce for Western audiences.

Ryu&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; was deemed natural by the studio, Arika, with producer Ichiro Mihara describing him as one of the three essential &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters along with Chun-Li and Ken. Ansah talked about Ryu and Ken&#x27;s story in &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; and said &quot;a good analogy with Ryu is that he&#x27;s not actually ever competing with anyone else; he&#x27;s competing with himself. Whereas Ken is driven fiercely by competition.&quot; For the game, &quot;Tekken X Street Fighter&quot;, producer Katsuhiro Harada commented that while Ryu might be able to perform his classic moves like the Hadouken reassuring his fans, most of his normal moves would be changed to play more like a &quot;Tekken&quot; character and fit the cast. Game designer Masahiro Sakurai said that for &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, Ryu was recreated to showcase his &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; persona while having new moves because the controller had more buttons. Nevertheless, he was given a technique from &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; and new techniques exclusive to &quot;Smash&quot;. The Shoryuken was implemented as his strongest technique.

== Appearances ==
=== In &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games ===

Ryu debuted in the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; as the primary playable character, with his best friend, rival, and sparring partner Ken Masters serving as the second player&#x27;s character. Both compete to test their strength against the tournament&#x27;s champion, Sagat. His next appearance was in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Set several years after Ryu defeated Sagat in the first tournament, Ryu participates in a second tournament. In his ending in the game, Ryu wins the tournament but does not stay for the ceremony, already seeking his next challenge. The &quot;Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers&quot; version of the game added Evil Ryu as a hidden character although the narrative does not explore this take on Ryu.

Ryu″s backstory, along with those of other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters, would be explored in the subsequent &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; prequel series. The first game, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors&#x27; Dreams&quot; (1995), features Ryu confronting Sagat as his last opponent in a rematch following their first game. &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; (1996) depicts Ryu on a quest to confront Akuma, his master″s brother and enemy. After their match, Akuma reveals that Ryu possesses the within him, the same power Akuma uses.

In the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, there is an alternative selectable version of Ryu known as &quot;Evil Ryu&quot;. Like Akuma, Ryu takes this form when succumbing to the evil intent and becomes more violent. It was not until the international versions of the game, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, that Evil Ryu was introduced as a playable secret character. Evil Ryu was originally introduced in a 1996 &quot;Street Fighter Zero&quot; manga series by Masahiko Nakahira and later adapted in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; canon by Capcom. In &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; (1998), a man named M. Bison seeks Ryu to use him as his next host body. The two clash and Ryu emerges victorious, causing Bison to retreat. If Evil Ryu is used, he clashes with Akuma to decide who is the strongest user of Dark Hadou.

Ryu and Ken return in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; (1997) and its updates. While Ryu″s motivation and rivalry with Ken would remain the same, he was also shown getting acquainted with several of the new characters featured in the game. Ryu appears in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, which takes place after &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; but before &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;. Still conflicted by the Dark Hadou, Ryu fights a criminal organization while meeting his old rivals. A new appearance of Evil Ryu in a &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game was confirmed in &quot;Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition&quot; by a teaser trailer, and he was later confirmed as a secret boss and playable character in leaked video footage. Ryu later appears in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, set between &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, where he destroys Bison once and for all with help from Charlie Nash after purging himself of the &quot;Satsui no Hado&quot; within him using the . However, the evil energy manifested as its own entity, taking the form of an Oni version of Evil Ryu, referring to itself as Kage. Kage attempts to overpower Ryu but fails to shake his convictions and fades from existence. In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Ryu mentors an unofficial student, Avatar, sharing his Japan adventures and inspirations. Training the Avatar helps him learn smartphone usage and an offensive technique, with Ryu aiming to pass his knowledge on to future generations.

Ryu has appeared in spin-offs related to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series such as the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; series produced by Arika, &quot;Street Fighter Duel&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter VR Shadaloo Enhancement Plan&quot;. Byron Mann portrays the character in the separately produced arcade and console games based on the American film of the series, both titled &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;, where he wears Ryu&#x27;s characteristic white karate gi and red headband. The 1994 animated movie also inspired a movie where Ryu is featured.

=== In other games ===

Ryu has also been featured in Capcom&#x27;s inter-company crossovers such as the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series, the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series, &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;, and &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;. Some games in the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series also include Evil Ryu as an unlockable character. Ryu is also an unlockable character in &quot;Free Fire&quot;. In &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, Ryu can change his moveset to the ones by Ken or Akuma while fighting. He appears in &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot;, a puzzle video game featuring super deformed characters, the sequel fighting game &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot;, and the mobile puzzle game &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot;. Ryu is a playable fighter in the crossover fighting game &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, and is also seen in the &quot;Tekken X Street Fighter&quot; poster along with Jin Kazama.

&quot;&quot; features Ryu as an unlockable costume swap for the game&#x27;s protagonist Soki. Ryu has a cameo in the shooting game &quot;&quot;. He was also to appear in the now-cancelled game &quot;Mega Man Universe&quot;. A Ryu-inspired costume for players to use in Sony&#x27;s &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; was released in 2008 as downloadable content for the title. A special downloadable episode in &quot;Asura&#x27;s Wrath&quot; allows players to fight both Ryu and Evil Ryu. Ryu also appears as a playable character via downloadable content in the Nintendo crossover fighting games &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; along with a stage based on his arena from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; known as Suzaku Castle. Ryu returns in the sequel &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;—this time available in the initial release—along with every other returning fighter in the series&#x27; history. A spirit of Evil Ryu was also added to the game for the celebration of Street Fighter&#x27;s 35th anniversary. He appears as a party member for a limited time event in the smartphone RPG, &quot;Granblue Fantasy&quot;, in a collaboration event titled &quot;Ultra Granblue Fighter&quot;. Additionally, he made an appearance in Capcom&#x27;s mobile card game &quot;Teppen&quot;. Ryu is also a guest character in &quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars&quot;, appearing both in his traditional form and in an original &quot;Power Rangers&quot; form called the &quot;Ryu Ranger&quot;. This same version of Ryu, now dubbed the &quot;Crimson Hawk Ranger&quot;, appears as a playable character in &quot;Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid&quot; via downloadable content.

A playable Ryu outfit has also been added to &quot;Fortnite&quot;. A playable Ryu skin was also added to &quot;Exoprimal&quot;. Ryu was added to &quot;Ubisoft&quot; &quot;Brawlhalla&quot; as a part of the collaboration between Street Fighter and &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;, along with Chun-Li and Akuma. In addition, Ryu&#x27;s classic stage, Suzaku Castle, was also included. In 2023, &quot;PUBG&quot;, a battle royale game, featured Ryu as one of the purchasable skins available from July 26 to September 20. Ryu was added to &quot;Minecraft&quot; as a skin in the &quot;World Warrior&quot; DLC skin pack, which included 35 other characters from the Street Fighter series. &quot;Monster Hunter World&quot; included Ryu as a costume; in fact, Ryu can also perform some of his signature moves in the game, such as hadouken and shoryuken. Ryu and Chun-Li were included in &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot; as &quot;Elite skins&quot;.

=== In other media ===
==== Live-action ====

Ryu is played by Byron Mann in the 1994 film version of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, where he serves as a supporting protagonist, as Guile is the main character. In this depiction, Ryu is given the surname &quot;Hoshi&quot; and is presented as an American of Japanese ethnicity. Ryu and Ken are con artists who steal money from crime lords. They work with Guile to infiltrate M. Bison&#x27;s headquarters, defeating Vega in battle. Ryu, along with other participants, contributes to Bison&#x27;s downfall by luring Guile to Bison&#x27;s base. Despite not appearing in &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li&quot;, Ryu is mentioned at the end of the movie by a person named Gen. Jon Foo played Ryu (given the surname &quot;Takashi&quot;) in the fan film &quot;Street Fighter: Legacy&quot;. Ryu appears as a main lead alongside Ken in &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; portrayed by martial arts actor/stuntman Mike Moh. The film is set before the events of the games, and focuses on Ryu and Ken&#x27;s training under Gouken, while flashbacks show Gouken&#x27;s past with his brother Gouki/Akuma and their mentor, Goutetsu. Moh reprised his role as Ryu in the five-part mini series &quot;Street Fighter: Resurrection&quot;. Ryu appears in the 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Ernest Cline. In the 2018 film &quot;Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween&quot;, Slappy the Dummy uses magic to bring actions figures of Ryu and Ken to life. Peter Jang portrays Ryu in the official crossover between the Power Rangers and Street Fighter titled &quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars—Street Fighter Showdown&quot;. In the short, Ryu morphs into the Ryu Ranger and Chun-Li teams with Tommy Oliver, Ninjor and Gia Moran to battle M. Bison and evil Power Rangers.

==== Animation ====

In &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, Ryu is the central character. After Ryu defeats and scars Sagat in the film&#x27;s opening, Bison commands a worldwide manhunt for him. Ryu&#x27;s ability to travel and suppress power makes him untraceable to Bison&#x27;s monitors. He encounters fighters like Fei-Long and E. Honda, and eventually, Bison brainwashes Ken. Guile and Interpol intercept Ryu, but Bison follows and sets Ken on Ryu. Ken breaks free, and they work together to defeat Bison. He was voiced by Kōjirō Shimizu in the Japanese version and Skip Stellrecht in the English dub.

Ryu also appears in the American TV series and is once again replaced by Guile as the protagonist since it is a continuation of the 1994 live-action film. Near the end of the series, however, the story shifts focus to Ryu and Ken, making them more prominent as they face several enemies such as the Mad Gear gang. In both the film and the series, Ryu&#x27;s name is incorrectly pronounced &quot;Raiyu&quot;, though in the movie Guile and Bison are the only ones who pronounce his name correctly. The premise of the 1995 Japanese TV series &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot; centers on a young Ryu and Ken, who travel the world with Chun-Li to improve their martial art skills by challenging other fighters. He was voiced by Kōji Tsujitani in the Japanese version and again by Skip Stellrecht in the English Animaze dub. In the ADV Films dub he was portrayed by Brett Weaver and later by Tommy Drake.

The 1999 OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot; focuses on Ryu&#x27;s struggle with the Dark Hadou, accompanied by new elements such as Ryu&#x27;s supposed brother Shun and their conflict with Professor Sadler and Rosanov. Sadler and Bison both seek out powerful fighters to absorb their abilities, particularly Ryu&#x27;s Dark Hadou. Ryu searches for Shun after he is kidnapped by Rosanov, confronting Akuma in the process. Ryu eventually tracks Sadler down and defeats him with the help of his allies, but Shun dies in the process. Ryu forgives Shun for his actions. The 2005 OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Generations&quot; features a similar storyline, but is unrelated to the previous &quot;Alpha&quot; anime. In 2008, Capcom released a new OVA where Crimson Viper is sent to capture Ryu on orders from Seth, who knows about Ryu&#x27;s &quot;Satsui no Hado&quot; and wants it for himself. Ryu fights Seth and remains victorious. Ryu made cameo appearances in the Disney animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, with Kyle Hebert reprising his role.

==== Comics ====

Ryu also appears in many printed adaptations of the series. In the manga &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; by Masaomi Kanzaki, Ryu believes M. Bison murdered both Gouken and Ken and goes on a quest to avenge them. In &quot;Street Fighter (Malibu Comics)&quot; Ryu and his friendly rivals Ken and Chun-Li were trained by the same master. The beginning of the comics focuses on Ken&#x27;s current life, in which he has given up fighting and decided to pursue acting as a career. Later on, Ken gets into conflict with villain Balrog and his hood, although Ken manages to fight back but gets stabbed by Sagat. After a while, Ryu discovers Ken&#x27;s scalp in a box that is covered in blood. The manga &quot;Street Fighter: Sakura Ganbaru!&quot; by Masahiko Nakahira has Ryu as a central character from the storyline where the title character, Sakura Kasugano, wishes to meet him. Nakahira also wrote and illustrated &quot;Street Fighter III: Ryu Final&quot;, which chronicles Ryu&#x27;s ongoing quest for enlightenment during the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; storyline that culminates into a decisive battle against Akuma.

Udon Entertainment&#x27;s comic book adaptation of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; plot follows Ryu, a skilled fighter trained in Ansatsuken. He struggles to resist the dark power of &quot;Satsui no Hadō&quot; while honing his skills. When he learns of his master&#x27;s death at the hands of his brother Akuma, Ryu teams up with Ken to seek revenge. Ryu&#x27;s victory in the Street Fighter tournament attracts the attention of Bison, Chun-Li, and Guile, who suspect criminal ties. Ryu trains with &quot;Sakura&quot; and other fighters to improve. During a battle with Akuma, Ryu resists the corrupting power of &quot;Satsui no Hadō&quot;, but Gouken suddenly arrives and finishes the battle with Akuma. Ryu passes out before the fight can conclude, and he is rescued from the sinking island by Dhalsim. Following the battle, Ryu vows to no longer rely on the dark power for victory.

In the Street Fighter Unlimited series, Ryu takes on Sakura as his pupil after graduating. After being kidnapped by Urien and the Society, Sakura is manipulated into succumbing to the Satsui no Hadō. Ryu absorbs the Dark Hado and transforms into Evil Ryu, fighting Akuma in his Oni form. Gill arrives and uses his powers to defeat them. Ryu struggles to maintain the Dark Hado and learns techniques from Gouken. He learns to balance his light and dark ki and participates in Gill&#x27;s fighting tournament. Ryu transforms into Shin Ryu, defeats Gill, and wins a rematch against Akuma. After defeating Akuma, Ryu returns to Brazil to resume his training with Oro to master his new powers.

== Promotion and reception ==
=== Popularity ===
Ryu is consistently ranked as one of the most popular and memorable characters from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise and gaming overall among critics. &quot;GameSpot&quot; featured him in their article &quot;All Time Greatest Game Hero&quot;, while Stone Sam of CBR regarded him as a &quot;video game icon&quot; alongside Chun-Li thanks to their character development since their first appearances. &quot;IGN&quot; placed Ryu at the top spot in their &quot;Top 25 Street Fighter Characters&quot; article, praising his character design for being simple yet effective, which includes a white gi, dark gloves, and red headband, adding a subtle touch of color, making it uncommon to see many fancy items used to create an &quot;icon&quot;. He has also been recognized as one of the best all-time gaming characters. He was voted one of the best video game characters both in a &quot;Famitsu&quot; issue and in the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; in 2011. In the February 1992 issue of &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine in Japan, Ryu ranked third Best Character of 1991. In 2010, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked him as the 27th greatest video game character, adding, &quot;Cheaters use Sagat, real men use Ryu! The face of the greatest fighting franchise ever to grace a console, Ryu is an icon who has spanned decades. While synonymous with the Street Fighter franchise, he&#x27;s also gone toe-to-toe with SNK&#x27;s finest, The Darkstalkers line-up and half of the Marvel stable, only to emerge unscathed and victorious nine bouts out of ten.&quot; Ian Walker of &quot;Kotaku&quot; described Ryu as a Kevin Bacon of video games. Ryu artwork was featured on an officially licensed NubyTech/UDON joypad for the PlayStation 2, announced on September 27, 2004. 

=== Critical response ===

Although in early appearances, Ryu and Ken were nearly identical to the unnamed characters from &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, Capcom&#x27;s handling of the character would turn Ryu into a character similar to a protagonist from a &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga character such as Son Goku from &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Gon Freecss from &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, Yoh Asakura from &quot;Shaman King&quot;, Tanjiro Kamado from &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;, Naruto Uzumaki from &quot;Naruto&quot;, Izuku Midoriya from &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;, Asta from &quot;Black Clover&quot;, Monkey D. Luffy from &quot;One Piece&quot;, or Ichigo Kurosaki from &quot;Bleach&quot;. The Hadoken was also a highly influential move in fighting games as seen in &quot;Smash&quot; or &quot;Naruto&quot; games. Adaptations of the franchise would go to further develop the character. Despite being nearly identical in the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, Ryu gradually develops his own distinct identity as a character in Capcom&#x27;s various games. This evolution is exemplified by his unique traits, which set him apart from his initial counterpart Ken, who was portrayed as his American equivalent. Additionally, Ryu&#x27;s character arc is further enriched by the introduction of Akuma, a dark and intense character who serves as a reflection of Ryu&#x27;s own potential darkness. The character&#x27;s popularity and large number of appearances was noted to be effective as Ryu appeared in crossover games having striking rivalries with characters from other games like &quot;Tekken&quot;″s Kazuya Mishima, &quot;X-men&quot;″s Wolverine, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;″s Kyo Kusanagi, among others.

&quot;GamesRadar&quot; writer Tyler Wilde published an article focusing on Ken&#x27;s and Ryu&#x27;s development across the franchise under the title &quot;The evolution of Ken and Ryu&quot; which discusses the similarities in their designs and moves as well as what parts of their personalities sets them apart; while Ryu is devoted only to his training, Ken spends his appearances focusing on his love life and eventual family. &quot;The Guardian&quot; recommended Ryu and Ken for beginners in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;. Ryu was deemed better at fights from distances because of his projectiles moves. In &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Great Loves&quot; article Ryu was described as &quot;one of the most independent men in the world of video games&quot; as he is interested only in training to become a stronger fighter in contrast to other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters who have romantic interests. Henry Gilbert wrote in a 2009 &quot;GamesRadar&quot; article that Ryu was &quot;the heart and soul of the Street Fighter series&quot; and &quot;probably the most well known fighting game character in the world&quot;. Lucas Sullivan of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; described him as the perfect representation of fighting game characters due to his constant desire to push his limits and face tougher rivals. They also noted his humble, calm, and modest nature, mentioning that Ryu possesses the abilities of throwing plasma-like fireballs from his hands, performing continuous spin kicks in mid-air, and launching someone with an uppercut while remaining humble and avoiding conflicts with those weaker than him. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; argued the character is appealing because of his wish to engage strong enemies and his growth since the &quot;Alpha&quot; series, most notably in Masahiko Nakahira&#x27;s manga centered on Ryu which shows the character&#x27;s appeal.

Evil Ryu was noted to be a trope of protagonist gaming characters who reveal an evil alter-ego. Evil Ryu, shown in &quot;Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition&quot;, was noted to share traits from both Ryu and Akuma. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that since he uses modified versions from known techniques, he was one of the least interesting additions to the game. The stronger damage he can inflict has been commented on by &quot;Game Informer&quot;, which mentioned he was even stronger than Seth, the &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; boss. In a &quot;GamesRadar&quot; article by Michael Grimm, a fight between Evil Ryu and Devil Jin was described as one players wanted to see in &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; as the two are evil alter egos from two existing characters sharing similar designs and movesets with their original forms. The website Den of Geek also praised such form for giving the origins of Ryu a major twist and having a major part in the narrative as Akuma is interested in the protagonist reaching this form. On the other hand, &quot;Destructoid&quot; criticized the handling of Ryu in the story mode of &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; for having actions that do not make much sense. Eurogamer also criticized the expansion of Ryu&#x27;s character in the form of Kage which repeats the subplot of the hero trying to battle his inner darkness. Kage faced criticism for his design and moveset being perceived as recycled from Evil Ryu. The similarities between the two characters, including their appearance and fighting style, led to accusations of lack of originality in Kage&#x27;s creation.

With the release of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, there was much focus around Ryu&#x27;s new design polished by Capcom&#x27;s visual engine with Kotaku highlighting his primitive classic design as Ryu never covered his feet until the latest game even though in previous games he suggested he can afford them. Polygon found the large built of Ryu in the trailer to be ridiculous at first glance, pointing at the size of his shoulders and that his head looks small in comparison. This led to joke about his built in social media, giving parallels to other characters like Chris Redfield from &quot;Resident Evil&quot; among others. GamesRadar said the design was notable among the fandom for his sex appeal as tweeted in social media. This went as far as people claiming they could see the character&#x27;s crotch region upon his body reveal as the design of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was highly detailed to the point of showing more Ryu&#x27;s facial hair as an example of detail given. leading to fan nicknames like &quot;Hot Ryu&quot; or &quot;Dad Ryu&quot;. This eventually became an internet meme with PCGamer joking about his long competition with Ken Masters&#x27; appeal. Briana Lawrence of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; said that she was leaning on Ryu&#x27;s screencap on &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; trailer being more unintentional moment than Lady Dimitrescu, a character from the horror game &quot;Resident Evil: Village&quot; notable for her sex appeal. The character was also praised for exploring his own social life to the player&#x27;s avatar when training, such as the way he gets along with fellow fighters Ken or Chun-Li. Kotaku also recommended players to listen to Ryu&#x27;s new musical themes accompanied with vocals taken from a &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; that will atrract several people.

=== Cultural impact ===
Ryu&#x27;s original designer, Takashi Nishiyama, revealed that &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;″s Ryo Sakazaki was created as an homage to the original Ryu. After the release of the game some members of the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game development team at Capcom moved to SNK. This is further explored in the crossover games SNK developed with the Capcom franchises where Ryu often interacts with Ryo. While in charge of developing the character &quot;Kyo Kusanagi&quot;, Yuichiro Hiraki carefully considered how to differentiate Kyo from Ryu. Hiraki understood the importance of creating a character with a unique personality and design in order to stand out and appeal to players on a similar level. With this in mind, he delved deep into Kyo&#x27;s backstory and characteristics, ensuring that every aspect of the character was distinct from Ryu. From Kyo&#x27;s fighting techniques to his fashion sense. Years later, when working on &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, Hiraki revisited the idea of creating a character that would rival Ryu&#x27;s popularity. Ryu served as the primary inspiration for the creation of the character Gouki. The game designers were particularly drawn to Ryu&#x27;s design and fighting style, which they wanted to incorporate into the character of Akuma. This decision was made in contrast to the other villain of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, M. Bison, as the designers felt that Akuma&#x27;s design should be more closely aligned with Ryu&#x27;s. As a result, Gouki was developed to embody the essence of Ryu&#x27;s character. Sheng Long appears as a non-playable character in the &quot;World Tour&quot; mode of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; whom players fight atop the SiRN building at night after completing the game. Using Ryu&#x27;s fighting style, he has been described as one of the mode&#x27;s hardest opponents.

In 1993, Hong Kong artist Situ Jianqian based characters in his comic &quot;Supergod Z: Cyber Weapon&quot; on Ryu, Ken, and Chun-li. However, due to a warning from Capcom, he ultimately decided to rename the characters. Despite this setback, Situ Jianqian&#x27;s comic still drew inspiration from these characters. It is interesting to note that Ryu, in particular, was considered one of the most popular Japanese gaming characters at the time. Benjamin Wai-ming Ng from the University of Hong Kong further added that while characters like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-li may have been popular in Japan and other parts of the world, in China, they were overshadowed by the main characters from SNK&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series. In a scientific study conducted in 2019, researchers reached a conclusion regarding the physical requirements for Ryu to successfully execute one of his signature moves, the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku. According to their findings, it was determined that Ryu would need to achieve a speed of nearly 70 miles per hour (equivalent to 110 kilometers per hour) while moving through the air in order to perform the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku.

<text>The Southern California News Group (SCNG), formerly the San Gabriel Valley News Group and the Los Angeles News Group, is an umbrella group of local daily newspapers published in the greater Los Angeles area of southern California by Digital First Media, which is owned by the hedge fund Alden Global Capital.

==History==
Originally named the San Gabriel Valley News Group (SGVN), the organization was formed as an umbrella name for MediaNews Group–operated newspapers in the Los Angeles area. SGVN began when MediaNews Group purchased the &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot;, &quot;San Gabriel Valley Tribune&quot;, and &quot;Whittier Daily News&quot; from Thomson Corporation in 1996. Thomson had already operated all three newspapers as a unit, sharing news and sports sections among the three papers (which cover geographically adjacent territories) with different story placement based on the region being served. Subsequently, in 1997 the &quot;Long Beach Press-Telegram&quot; was purchased from Knight-Ridder and in 1998 the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; was purchased from Jack Kent Cooke, and the organization was renamed the Los Angeles News Group (LANG). In 1999, LANG acquired three newspapers in the Inland Empire – the &quot;Inland Valley Daily Bulletin&quot; serving the Pomona Valley/Ontario area and &quot;Redlands Daily Facts&quot; from Donrey Media, and &quot;The San Bernardino Sun&quot; from Gannett. Finally, in 2006, LANG acquired the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot; serving the South Bay area of Los Angeles County from Copley Press.

On March 21, 2016, a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of Freedom Communications and its two major newspapers, the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; and the &quot;Riverside Press-Enterprise&quot; to Digital First Media. Thus, LANG was renamed Southern California News Group. The sale closed on March 31, 2016. Reports from former Freedom Communications writers began appearing in other SCNG newspapers, and vice versa, the next day.

The news coverage of the newspapers are mainly local and state stories, including Los Angeles area news provided by City News Service. The newspapers contain some national and international news, often from the Associated Press. The newspapers share coverage and printing presses, with a central copy editing and design desk, and staff writers file the same stories for all members of the group, including sharing sports beat writers, which has caused controversy. The newspapers also share editorials and speak as one voice on regional issues. Some have stated that the former Freedom Communications&#x27; distinctive conservative-libertarian editorial voice may be lost in the process.

==Newspapers==
The newspapers include:
* &quot;Daily Breeze&quot; – Torrance and the South Bay (acquired from the San Diego–based Copley Press in 2007)
* &quot;Inland Valley Daily Bulletin&quot; – Pomona Valley and Ontario; originally were two separate papers: the &quot;Pomona Progress-Bulletin&quot; and the &quot;Ontario Daily Report&quot; (merged in April 1990) (acquired in 1999 from Donrey).
* &quot;Press-Telegram&quot; – Long Beach serving the greater Long Beach area
* &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; – Los Angeles metropolitan area (San Fernando Valley) and Northern Los Angeles County, and the flagship newspaper of the group.
* &quot;Orange County Register&quot; – serving Orange County, California
* &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot; – Pasadena serving the greater Pasadena area
* &quot;Redlands Daily Facts&quot; – Redlands (acquired in 1999 from Donrey) serving the Redlands area
* &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot; – Riverside serving western and central Riverside County
* &quot;The San Bernardino Sun&quot; – San Bernardino County serving the San Bernardino Valley
* &quot;San Gabriel Valley Tribune&quot; – Monrovia serving the central and east San Gabriel Valley
* &quot;Whittier Daily News&quot; – Whittier serving the Pico Rivera and Whittier areas
* &quot;San Diego Union Tribune&quot; serving San Diego County (purchased July 10, 2023).

Also included are the community weeklies, which include the &quot;Palos Verdes Peninsula News&quot; and &quot;The Beach Reporter&quot;, which publishes on Thursdays with the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot;, the &quot;Gazette&quot; weeklies cover the Long Beach neighborhoods north and east of downtown, also on Thursdays. The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; publishes a total of seventeen community weeklies covering most of Orange County, with the exception of Santa Ana.

Spanish-language weeklies include &quot;Excelsior&quot; which have two editions for Los Angeles and Orange counties and &quot;La Prensa&quot;, which covers the Inland Empire.

The inland newspapers (&quot;Daily Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Daily Facts&quot;, &quot;Press-Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;Sun&quot;) are further subdivided into the Inland Newspapers Group with combined business operations. The former SGVN newspapers are also operated as an integrated business unit, out of the &quot;San Gabriel Valley Tribune&quot; offices in Monrovia (with the Pasadena office serving as a bureau for the greater Pasadena area). The &quot;Daily Breeze&quot; and &quot;Press-Telegram&quot; also have integrated business operations. The union for the &quot;Press-Telegram&quot;, which was inherited from Knight-Ridder operation, has criticized the demotion of the &quot;Press-Telegram&quot; Long Beach offices to a bureau, with most work done out of the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot; in Torrance. In 2021, journalists at all SCNG newspapers organized under the NewsGuild-CWA, and ratified their first contract in November 2024. A compensation study in 2022 found that the median compensation of bargaining unit employees was $51,300, which would be considered low income under federal guidelines for a single person household.

Prior to the merger with the Freedom newspapers, LANG identified themselves as editions of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; in order to make LANG a &quot;Top Ten&quot; media buy as ranked by the Alliance for Audited Media. The combined readership of SCNG newspapers is 3.8 million, which if combined would make it the third largest newspaper group in the country. Effective April 1, 2018, all ten daily newspapers covering Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, along with seventeen community weeklies covering Orange County now identify themselves as editions of the &quot;Register&quot; on the front page.

On July 10, 2023, SCNG announced it had purchased the San Diego Union Tribune from billionaire owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, for an undisclosed amount.

All SCNG newspapers, as well as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, various community newspapers, and regional editions of the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, are printed from the &quot;Press-Enterprise&quot; printers in Riverside.

<text>The Pasadena Star-News is a paid local daily newspaper for the greater Pasadena, California area. The Pasadena &quot;Star-News&quot; is a member of Southern California News Group (formerly the Los Angeles Newspaper Group), since 1996. It is also part of the San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Group, along with the &quot;San Gabriel Valley Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Whittier Daily News&quot;.

== History ==

First published in 1884, the paper was originally located at the corner of Colorado Boulevard and Oakland Avenue for years. That building is now home to Technique at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts and 24 Hour Fitness. The first radio broadcast of the Rose Parade in 1926 aired from the newspaper&#x27;s radio station KPSN, which broadcast out of a pair of radio towers that the building once hosted. From 1904 to 1940 Charles H. Prisk, was one of the first publishers and owner of the Pasadena Star-News. Charles was also the owner of Pasadena Post and the Long Beach Press-Telegram. William F. Prisk, his brother, was a publisher. William Paddock, Prisk&#x27;s son-in-law, was the vice president and general manager of the Star-News, Pasadena-Post and the Press-Telegram. Willam Paddock married Prisk&#x27;s daughter Neva Prisk Malaby, then began working at the newspapers as a result. William Paddock, also known as Olympic Champion Charles &quot;Charley&quot; Paddock, ran the world record for the 100-yard dash in 1921 at 9.5 seconds, giving him the title &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Human&quot;. Editors in the historical Star-News Building included Ed Essertier, Charles Cherniss, Bill Winter, Larry Wilson, and Frank Girardot. Publishers after Bernard J. Ridder included Bill Applebee.

Ridder Newspapers bought the &quot;Star-News&quot; in 1956 and Bernard J. Ridder took over as publisher. Ridder merged with Knight to form Knight Ridder in 1974. The paper was sold off in 1989 to a company owned by William Dean Singleton; the Thomson Corporation bought majority control of the paper a year later. Thomson sold the &quot;Star-News&quot; to Singleton&#x27;s MediaNews Group in 1996, which went on to become part of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group.

The newspaper also publishes the &quot;Rose Magazine&quot; which provides coverage of the Tournament of Roses Parade and the Rose Bowl Game since 1994.

<text>A handheld TV game or plug and play game is an integrated home video game console and game controller, usually battery powered, which connects directly to a television. The game software is built directly into the unit, which is typically designed to look like a toy or classic game console controller with the addition of a composite video cable to connect the unit. These systems usually contain either a collection of classic games or original games based on licensed properties. Because the game software is integrated into the game unit and almost never designed to be changed by the user, these game systems are typically marketed as electronic toys or collectibles rather than game consoles.

Several manufacturers produced these devices beginning in the 1990s, though the concept became best known with the release in 2002 of Jakks Pacific&#x27;s Atari Classic 10-in-1 TV. Most manufacturers have their own trademarked names for these systems, such as Radica&#x27;s Play TV or Majesco&#x27;s TV Arcade; however, most retailers refer to them as &quot;TV games&quot; or &quot;plug and play&quot; games.

==History==

From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, three things happened: the retro game movement started to gain momentum, the price of system on a chip technology fell dramatically, and car television sets became popular. Several unlicensed family games, such as the TV Boy, were produced. These factors led to manufacturers officially licensing classic games. The first TV games include collections of classic games; one of the earliest is the Toymax Activision 10-in-1, released in 2001. The first TV games contain collections of classic games, and many manufacturers started incorporating original content and controls. Jakks Pacific reached licensing deals with Disney, DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and others. 

Criticism that video games were contributing to obesity in children led to the development of TV games with motion controls such as the Play TV series, including Play TV Baseball, Play TV Football, and Play TV Barbie Dance Craze in 2003. In 2004, Tiger Electronics created paintball and a &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sword-fighting game, using a toy sword as the controller. In that year, Radica started producing collections of Sega games, such as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, &quot;Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle&quot;, &quot;Columns&quot;, and &quot;Gain Ground&quot;. The C64 Direct-to-TV was released in 2004 by Toy:Lobster and Mammoth Toys with a copy of the Commodore 64 operating system and a virtual keyboard as a hidden extra. In 2005, Jakks Pacific produced original game content for the new &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; films, and Tiger produced a Jedi lightsaber fighting game using a lightsaber as the controller. In 2005, Milton Bradley started producing TV game versions of Whack-a-Mole and Miniature Golf.

==Sales==
By 2002, the original TV Games device from Jakks Pacific sold over 350,000 units. By 2004, the TV Games series had sold 1 million units. , &quot;Pac-Man&quot; TV Games sold over 15 million units.

<text>East West Bank is an American bank that is the primary subsidiary of East West Bancorp. It is the largest publicly traded bank headquartered in Southern California. The company has been ranked the #1 performing U.S. bank with more than $10 billion in assets by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, and the top performing bank in its asset size (in excess of $50 billion) by &quot;Bank Director&quot;.

East West was founded in 1973 in Los Angeles to serve the Chinese American community. As of 2024, the company is involved in commercial banking, residential lending, private equity, media, entertainment, infrastructure, healthcare, clean energy, technology, manufacturing, commercial real estate, and other sectors.

==History==

In 1973, East West Federal Bank was founded as a federal savings and loan association, focused on serving the Chinese American community in Southern California.

In 1991, during the savings and loan crisis, the company acquired Pacific Coast Savings,&lt;ref name=&quot;bizjournals/2000/04/03/story2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/7218364708800/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which increased the bank&#x27;s assets from $600 million to $1 billion and expanded operations to San Francisco, California.

In 1992, Dominic Ng was named CEO of the company. East West became a state-chartered commercial bank on July 31, 1995. In 1999, the company acquired First Central Bank for $13.5 million in cash.

In 2004, East West acquired Trust Bank, a Chinese American bank based in Monterey Park, California, with four branches and $235 million in assets, for $32.9 million. In 2005, the company acquired United National Bank, a commercial bank headquartered in San Marino, California, with 11 branches and $665 million in loans receivable, for $177.9 million. In 2006, the company acquired Standard Bank, a Chinese-American bank headquartered in Monterey Park, California, with 6 branches and $923 million in assets, for $200 million.

In 2007, the company acquired Desert Community Bank, a community bank operating in the Victor Valley region of California. Desert Community Bank branches remained branded as such and did not change to East West. In November 2017, East West agreed to sell Desert Community Bank to Flagstar Bank; the deal was completed in March 2018. 

In 2009, East West acquired the assets of San Francisco-based United Commercial Bank (UCB), via a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This expanded East West’s reach by 63 branches, including 17 in Southern California, and branches in Houston, Boston, and Atlanta, as well as branches in Hong Kong and China.

In 2010, the company acquired the assets, including four branches, of Washington First International Bank of Seattle, Washington, via a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In 2014, East West acquired MetroCorp Bancshares, which operated as MetroBank, for $268 million in cash and stock.

In 2023, the company was named the top public bank in the United States with more than $10 billion in assets by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. That same year, East West celebrated its 50th anniversary and became the largest state-chartered bank in California, surpassing $68 billion in assets.

In 2023 and 2024, East West earned recognition as the top performing bank in the $50 billion and above asset size category by &quot;Bank Director&quot;. As of May 2024, East West has more than $70 billion in assets and over 100 locations in the U.S. and Asia. In September 2024, the company marked its 25th anniversary on the Nasdaq stock exchange, with CEO Dominic Ng ringing the opening bell.

East West is also known for helping finance major films and television shows, including &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;, &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;.

==Sponsorships==

In 2005, East West signed figure skater Michelle Kwan to be a spokesperson and purchased the naming rights to East West Ice Palace, an ice rink arena in Artesia, California.

In 2023, the company signed professional golfer Rose Zhang to a sponsorship deal.

In 2024, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) announced a new multi-year partnership with East West, which supports exhibitions and educational programs at the museum. East West has also helped LACMA expand its collection.

<doc id="489554" wikidata="Q981976" url="?curid=489554" title="Roy Thomas">
<text>Roy William Thomas Jr. (born November 22, 1940) is an American comic book writer and editor. He was Stan Lee&#x27;s first successor as editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics and possibly best known for introducing the pulp magazine hero Conan the Barbarian to American comics. Thomas is also known for his championing of Golden Age comic-book heroes – particularly the 1940s superhero team the Justice Society of America – and for lengthy writing stints on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and DC Comics&#x27; &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, among other titles.

Among the comics characters he co-created are Vision, Doc Samson, Carol Danvers, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Ultron, Yellowjacket, Defenders, Man-Thing, Red Sonja, Morbius, Ghost Rider, Squadron Supreme, Invaders, Black Knight (Dane Whitman), Nighthawk, Havok, Banshee, Sunfire, Thundra, Arkon, Killraven, Wendell Vaughn, Red Wolf, Red Guardian, Daimon Hellstrom, and Valkyrie.

Thomas was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2011 and into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Jackson, Missouri, United States. As a child, he was a devoted comic book fan, and in grade school he wrote and drew his own comics for distribution to friends and family. The first of these was &quot;All-Giant Comics&quot;, which he recalls as having featured such characters as Elephant Giant. He was enrolled at a parochial Lutheran school and attended St. Paul Lutheran Church in Jackson. As an adult, Thomas is &quot;not religious&quot; and has been described as a &quot;lapsed Lutheran&quot;. He graduated from Southeast Missouri State University in 1961 with a BS in education, having majored in history and social science.

Thomas became an early and active member of Silver Age comic book fandom in the early 1960s. Enthusiasm for the rebirth of superhero comics during that period led Jerry Bails to found the fanzine &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, and Thomas, then a high school English teacher, took over as editor in 1964. Letters from Thomas appeared regularly in the letters pages of both DC and Marvel Comics, including &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #1 (August 1960), &quot;The Flash&quot; #116 (Nov. 1960), &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #5 (July 1962), &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #15 (June 1963), &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #22 (Jan. 1964), and &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #211 (Aug. 1965).

==Career==
===Marvel Comics===
In 1965, Thomas moved to New York City to take a job at DC Comics as assistant to Mort Weisinger, then the editor of the Superman titles. Thomas said he had just accepted a fellowship to study foreign relations at George Washington University when he received a letter from Weisinger, &quot;with whom I had exchanged one or two letters, tops&quot;, asking Thomas to become &quot;his assistant editor on a several-week trial basis.&quot; Thomas had already written a &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; script &quot;a few months before, while still living and teaching in the St. Louis area,&quot; he said in 2005. &quot;I worked at DC for eight days in late June and very early July of 1965&quot; before accepting a job at Marvel Comics. The Marvel &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot; in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #61 (April 1967) describes Thomas &quot;admitting that he gave up a scholarship to George Washington University just to write for Marvel!&quot;

This came after his chafing under the notoriously difficult Weisinger, to a point, Thomas said in 1981, that he would go &quot;home to my dingy little room at, coincidentally, the George Washington Hotel in Manhattan, during that second week, and actually feeling tears well into my eyes, at the ripe old age of 24.&quot; Familiar with editor and chief writer Stan Lee&#x27;s Marvel work, and feeling them &quot;the most vital comics around&quot;, Thomas &quot;just sat down one night at the hotel and – I wrote him a letter! Not applying for a job or anything so mundane as that – I just said that I admired his work, and would like to buy him a drink some time. I figured he just might remember me from &quot;Alter Ego&quot;.&quot; Lee did, and phoned Thomas to offer him a Marvel writing test.

The writer&#x27;s test, Thomas said in 1998, &quot;was four Jack Kirby pages from &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #2 ... [Stan Lee] had Sol [Brodsky] or someone take out the dialogue. It was just black-and-white. Other people like Denny O&#x27;Neil and Gary Friedrich took it. But soon afterwards we stopped using it.&quot; The day after taking the test, Thomas was at DC, proofreading a Supergirl story, when Steinberg called asking Thomas to meet with Lee during lunch, where Thomas agreed to work for Marvel. He returned to DC to give &quot;indefinite notice&quot; to Weisinger, but Weisinger ordered him to leave immediately and &quot;I was back at Marvel less than an hour after I first left, and had a &quot;Modeling with Millie&quot; assignment to do over the weekend. It was a Friday.&quot; His employment was announced in the &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot; section of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #47 (Feb. 1966) under the heading &quot;How About That! Department&quot; (&quot;Roy&#x27;s a fan who&#x27;s made it!&quot;). Thomas later described his early days at Marvel:

To that point, editor-in-chief Lee had been the main writer of Marvel publications, with his brother, Larry Lieber, often picking up the slack plotting of Lee-scripted stories. Thomas soon became the first new Marvel writer to sustain a presence at a time when comics veterans such as Robert Bernstein, Ernie Hart, Leon Lazarus, and Don Rico, and fellow newcomers Steve Skeates (hired a couple of weeks earlier) and O&#x27;Neil (brought in at Thomas&#x27; recommendation a few months later) did not. His Marvel debut was the romance-comics story &quot;Whom Can I Turn To?&quot; in the &quot;Millie the Model&quot; spin-off &quot;Modeling with Millie&quot; #44 (Dec. 1965) – for which the credits and the logo were inadvertently left off due to a production glitch, resulting in this being left off most credit lists. Thomas&#x27; first Marvel superhero scripting was &quot;My Life for Yours&quot;, the &quot;Iron Man&quot; feature in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #73 (Jan. 1966), working from a Lee plot as well as a plot assist from secretary Steinberg. Thomas estimates that Lee rewrote approximately half of that fledgling attempt.

Thomas&#x27; earliest Marvel work also included the teen-romance title &quot;Patsy and Hedy&quot; #104–105 (Feb.-April 1966), and two &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; stories, plotted by Lee and Steve Ditko, in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #143–144 (April–May 1966). Two previously written freelance stories for Charlton Comics also saw print: &quot;The Second Trojan War&quot; in &quot;Son of Vulcan&quot; #50 (Jan. 1966) and &quot;The Eye of Horus&quot; in &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; #54 (March 1966). &quot;When Stan saw the couple of Charlton stories I&#x27;d written earlier in more of a Gardner Fox style, he wasn&#x27;t too impressed,&quot; Thomas recalled. &quot;It&#x27;s probably a good thing I already had my job at Marvel at that point! I think I was the right person in the right place at the right time, but there are other people who, had they been there, might have been just as right.&quot;

Thomas took on what would be his first long-term Marvel title, the World War II series &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot;, starting with #29 (April 1966) and continuing through #41 (April 1967) and the series&#x27; 1966 annual, &quot;Sgt. Fury Special&quot; #2. He also began writing the mutant-superteam title &quot;[Uncanny] X-Men&quot; from #20–43 (May 1966 – April 1968), and, finally, took over &quot;The Avengers&quot;, starting with #35 (Dec. 1966), and continuing until 1972. That notable run was marked by a strong sense of continuity, and stories that ranged from the personal to the cosmic – the latter most prominently with the &quot;Kree-Skrull War&quot; in issues #89–97 (June 1971 – March 1972). Additional work included an occasional &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D&quot; and &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; story in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;. When that title became the solo comic &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, he wrote the entire run of new stories, from #169–183 (June 1968 – Nov. 1969), mostly with the art team of penciler Gene Colan and inker Tom Palmer.

As Thomas self-evaluated in a 1981 interview, shortly after leaving Marvel for rival DC Comics, &quot;One of the reasons Stan liked my writing ... was that after a few issues he felt he could trust me enough that he virtually never again read anything I wrote – well, at least not more than a page or two in a row, just to keep me honest.&quot;

Thomas eloped in July 1968 to marry his first wife, Jean Maxey, returning to work a day late from a weekend comic-book convention in St. Louis, Missouri. Thomas said in 2000 that Brodsky, in the interim, had assigned &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; to the writer Archie Goodwin, newly ensconced at Marvel and writing &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but Thomas convinced Brodsky to return it to him. &quot;I got very possessive about &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;,&quot; Thomas recalled. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled], we were selling in the low 40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to sell even more.&quot; He eventually did have a Caribbean honeymoon, where he scripted the wedding of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #60 (Jan. 1969).
Thomas, who had turned over &quot;X-Men&quot; to other writers, returned with issue #55 (April 1969) when the series was on the verge of cancellation. While efforts to save it failed – the title ended its initial run with #66 – Thomas&#x27; collaboration with artist Neal Adams through #63 (Dec. 1969) is regarded as a Silver Age creative highlight. Thomas won the 1969 Alley Award that year for Best Writer, while Adams and inker Tom Palmer, netted 1969 Alley Awards for Best Pencil Artist and Best Inking Artist, respectively.

Thomas and artist Barry Smith launched &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; in October 1970, based on Robert E. Howard&#x27;s 1930s pulp-fiction sword-and-sorcery character. Thomas, who stepped down from his editorship in August 1974, wrote hundreds of Conan stories in a host of Marvel comics and the black-and-white magazines &quot;Savage Tales&quot; and &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot;. During that time, he and Smith also brought to comics Howard&#x27;s little-known, sword-wielding woman-warrior Red Sonja, initially as a Conan supporting character. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that, &quot;&quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; was something of a gamble for Marvel. The series contained the usual elements of action and fantasy, to be sure, but it was set in a past that had no relation to the Marvel Universe, and it featured a hero who possessed no magical powers, little humor and comparatively few moral principles.&quot;

In 1971, with Stan Lee, Gerry Conway and Gray Morrow, Thomas created Man-Thing and wrote the first Man-Thing story in color comics, after Conway and Len Wein had introduced the character in the black-and-white comics magazine &quot;Savage Tales&quot;. Later that year, Thomas wrote the &quot;Kree–Skrull War&quot; storyline across multiple issues of &quot;The Avengers&quot; penciled variously by Sal Buscema, Neal Adams, and John Buscema. Thomas was the first person other than Stan Lee to receive a writer&#x27;s credit for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, and he and artist Ross Andru launched the Spider-Man spin-off title &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; in March 1972.

Thomas, with Marvel writers and artists, co-created many other characters, among them Ultron (including the fictional metal adamantium), Carol Danvers, Morbius the Living Vampire, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, Doc Samson, Valkyrie, Werewolf by Night, Banshee and Killraven. Thomas also co-created several characters based on pre-existing characters, including the Vision, Yellowjacket, the Black Knight, and Adam Warlock.

====Editor-in-chief====
In 1972, when Lee became Marvel&#x27;s publisher, Thomas succeeded him as editor-in-chief. Thomas also continued to script mainstream titles, including Marvel&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. He launched such new titles as the &quot;non-team&quot; &quot;The Defenders&quot;, as well as &quot;What If&quot;, a title that explored fictional alternate histories of Marvel&#x27;s existing characters and stories. In addition, he indulged his love of Golden Age comic-book heroes in the World War II-set superhero series &quot;The Invaders&quot;. He was instrumental in engineering Marvel&#x27;s comic-book adaptation of the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, without which, 1980s Marvel editor Jim Shooter believed, &quot;[W]e would have gone out of business&quot;. In 1975, Thomas wrote the first joint publishing venture between Marvel and DC Comics – a 72-page &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; movie adaptation in an oversized &quot;Treasury Edition&quot; format with art by John Buscema. He and Buscema crafted a comics adaptation of Tarzan for Marvel in June 1977.

===DC Comics===
In 1981, after several years of freelancing for Marvel and a dispute with then editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, Thomas signed a three-year exclusive writing/editing contract with DC. He marked his return to that company with a two-part &quot;Green Lantern&quot; story in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #138–139 (March–April 1981), and briefly wrote &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;, and the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;. DC gave Thomas&#x27; work a promotional push by featuring several of his series in free, 16-page insert previews.

Thomas married his second wife, Danette Couto, in May 1981. Danette legally changed her first name to Dann and would become Thomas&#x27; regular writing partner. He credits her with the original idea for the &quot;Arak, Son of Thunder&quot; series drawn by Ernie Colón. Writer Gerry Conway would also be a frequent collaborator with Thomas; together they wrote a two-part Superman-Shazam team-up in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;; a series of &quot;Atari Force&quot; and &quot;Swordquest&quot; mini-comics packaged with Atari 2600 video games; and three Justice League-Justice Society crossovers. Conway also contributed ideas to the talking animal comic &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!&quot;, created by Thomas and Scott Shaw. Thomas and Conway were to be the co-writers of the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; intercompany crossover but editorial disputes between DC and Marvel caused the project&#x27;s cancellation. During that era, Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway collaborated on the screenplays for two movies: the animated feature &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983) and &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984). The duo also worked on a live-action &quot;X-Men&quot; film for production company Nelvana that never went into production.

As a solo writer, Roy Thomas wrote &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and, with artist Gene Colan, updated the character&#x27;s costume and introduced a new supervillainess, the Silver Swan. His final work on the series, issue #300 (Feb. 1983), was co-written with his wife Dann Thomas, who, as Roy Thomas noted in 1999 &quot;became the first woman ever to receive scripting credit on the world&#x27;s foremost super-heroine.&quot;

Thomas realized a childhood dream in writing the Justice Society of America (JSA). Reviving the Golden Age group in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #193 and continuing in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, he wrote retro adventures, like those of The Invaders, set in World War II. In addition to the JSA&#x27;s high-profile heroes, Thomas revived such characters as Liberty Belle, Johnny Quick, Robotman, Firebrand, the Tarantula, and Neptune Perkins. He used the series to address the complicated and sometimes contradictory continuity issues surrounding the JSA.

In 1983, Thomas and artist Jerry Ordway created &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot;, a group composed of the JSA&#x27;s children. The characters debuted in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #25 (Sept. 1983) and were launched in their own series in March 1984. Thomas wrote several limited series for DC including &quot;America vs. the Justice Society&quot;, &quot;Jonni Thunder a.k.a. Thunderbolt&quot;, &quot;Shazam!: The New Beginning&quot;, and &quot;Crimson Avenger&quot; as well as two issues of &quot;DC Challenge&quot;. From 1986 to 1988, Thomas contributed to the &quot;Secret Origins&quot; series and wrote most of the stories involving the Golden Age characters including Superman and Batman. In 1986, DC decided to write off the JSA from active continuity. A one-shot issue titled &quot;The Last Days of the Justice Society&quot; involved most of the JSA battling the forces of evil while merged with the Norse gods in an ever-repeating Ragnarok-like Limbo was written by Thomas, with art by David Ross. &quot;Young All-Stars&quot; replaced &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; following the changes to DC&#x27;s continuity brought about by the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series. Thomas&#x27; last major project for DC was an adaptation of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle drawn by Gil Kane and published in 1989–1990. Since then, Thomas has written a trio of Elseworlds one-shots combining DC characters with classic cinema and literature: &quot;Superman&#x27;s Metropolis&quot; (1996), &quot;Superman: War of the Worlds&quot; (1998), and &quot;JLA: The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (2002).

===Return to Marvel and other comic work===

In 1984, Thomas sent Jim Shooter a letter in which he hoped ...
By 1986, Thomas wrote for Marvel&#x27;s New Universe line, beginning with &quot;Spitfire and the Troubleshooters&quot; #5 (Feb. 1987), followed by a multi-issue run of &quot;Nightmask&quot;, co-scripted by his wife Dann Thomas. He scripted titles starring Doctor Strange, Thor, the Avengers West Coast, and Conan, often co-scripting with Dann Thomas or Jean-Marc Lofficier.

Over the next ten years Thomas did less work for the mainstream comics press. For a series of independent publishers, he wrote issues of the TV-series tie-ins &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; for Topps Comics. He also wrote for television, and relaunched &quot;Alter Ego&quot; as a formal magazine published by TwoMorrows Publishing in 1999. In 2005, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in humanities from California State University.

With Marvel&#x27;s four-issue miniseries &quot;Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (Oct. 2004 – May 2005), Thomas and artist Dick Giordano completed an adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, which the duo had begun 30 years earlier in 10- to 12-page installments, beginning with Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazine &quot;Dracula Lives!&quot; #5 (March 1974). They had completed 76 pages, comprising roughly one-third of the novel, through issues #6–8 and 10–11 and &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #8 (&quot;The Legion of Monsters&quot;), before Marvel canceled &quot;Dracula Lives&quot; and later many of its other black-and-whites.

&quot;Anthem&quot;, a comic book series by Thomas and artists Daniel Acuña, Jorge Santamaria Garcia and Benito Gallego, about World War II superheroes in an alternate reality, was published by Heroic Publishing in January 2006. Thomas returned to Red Sonja in 2006, writing the one-shot &quot;Red Sonja: Monster Isle&quot; for Dynamite Entertainment. In 2007 Thomas wrote a Black Knight story for Marvel&#x27;s four-issue miniseries &quot;Mystic Arcana&quot;.

From 2007 to 2010, Thomas wrote adaptations of classic literature for the Marvel imprint Marvel Illustrated, including &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (2007), &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (2007–2008), &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (2007–2008), &quot;The Iliad&quot; (2008), &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (2008), &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (2008), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (2008–2009), and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (2009). In 2010, Marvel Illustrated released a collection of all the &quot;Dracula&quot; material adapted by Thomas and Giordano, originally published in the 1970s and mid-2000s.

===Later career===
In 2011, Roy Thomas wrote the one-shot &quot;DC Retroactive: Wonder Woman – The &#x27;80s&quot; with art by Rich Buckler. In 2012, Thomas teamed with artists Mike Hawthorne and Dan Panosian on Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;Conan: The Road of Kings&quot;, which lasted 12 issues. In 2014, he wrote &quot;75 Years of Marvel: From the Golden Age to the Silver Screen&quot; for Taschen, a 700-page hardcover history of Marvel Comics. The following year, he compiled three volumes of World War II-era comics stories featuring Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman for Chartwell Books.

Thomas had a cameo appearance as a prison inmate on the third season of &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Daredevil&quot;, released in October 2018 on Netflix, and wrote a blog entry about this experience.

On November 10, 2018, Thomas visited Stan Lee at Lee&#x27;s home in Beverly Hills to discuss Thomas&#x27; book &quot;The Stan Lee Story&quot;. Lee told Thomas&#x27; manager, John Cimino, &quot;Take care of my boy Roy&quot; before Lee and Thomas were photographed together. Lee died less than 48 hours later.

On February 23, 2019, Jackson, Missouri, declared Roy Thomas Day. In a ceremony, he was awarded the key to the city.

On March 23, 2019, the final &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; newspaper comic strip was published. Thomas had been the ghost writer for Stan Lee on the strip since 2000.

Thomas made a return to Marvel Comics in 2019 with the release of the &quot;Captain America and The Invaders: Bahamas Triangle&quot; one-shot drawn by Jerry Ordway, wrote a Wolverine origin page for the &quot;Marvel 1000&quot; celebration issue and did a two-part &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; story with artist Alan Davis. In 2020, Thomas wrote a 10-page story in the Marvel one-shot &quot;King-Size Conan&quot; #1.

On February 23, 2021, Thomas criticized Abraham Riesman&#x27;s controversial Stan Lee biography &quot;True Believer: The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee.&quot; In a guest column in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Thomas took issue with Riesman&#x27;s assessment of conflicting accounts of the work of Lee and Jack Kirby, who is credited with co-creating many classic Marvel characters. Thomas stated, &quot;Something like 95 percent of the time, [the book] is a very good biography. However, the remaining (and crucial) 5 percent of its content, scattered amid all that painstaking research and well-written prose, renders it often untrustworthy...i.e., a very bad biography. Because the author often insists, visibly and intrusively, on putting his verbal thumb on the scales, in a dispute he seems ill-equipped to judge.&quot;

In 2022, Thomas returned to write Wolverine, in the first two issues of a new Marvel Comics ongoing series called &quot;X-Men: Legends&quot; which tells new in-continuity stories of early X-Men adventures. Thomas&#x27;s two-part story takes place right after &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #181 and right before &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 and reveals a missing link mystery about Wolverine&#x27;s costume.

Thomas serves on the Disbursement Committee of the comic-book industry charity The Hero Initiative.

==History==

=== First half of 20th century ===

=== Sports ===

The university is located on the site of one of California&#x27;s 36 original adobes, built in 1776 by Franciscan missionaries and destroyed by fire in 1908. When the Spanish Franciscans founded the San Gabriel Mission in 1771, they dubbed the small river El Rio Rosa de Castillo. These lands once were part of a Mexican land grant known as Rancho Rosa Castilla. Juan Batista Batz, a Basque rancher from northern Spain and his wife, Catalina settled here in the 1852. Batz used the land for farming and intensive sheep ranching. The inspiration for the name of the ranch, according to local historians, was the abundant amount of native wild Wood roses (&quot;Rosa californica&quot;) that grew near the ranch home along the creek. The Tongva Indians named this area, &quot;Ochuunga&quot; (Place of Roses). The main drive through the campus is known as Paseo Rancho Castilla, in acknowledgment of the university&#x27;s historic heritage.

Cal State LA was founded on July 2, 1947, by an act of the California legislature and opened for classes as Los Angeles State College on the campus of Los Angeles City College (LACC). LACC is a public community college in East Hollywood, Los Angeles located on Vermont Avenue south of Santa Monica Boulevard the former campus of UCLA and originally a farm outside Los Angeles. As president of LACC, P. Victor Peterson became the acting president of the state college. Since the college had opened in September, 1947, with 136 students, it had grown in two years to over 2,000 students. Most were studying under the GI Bill, which had been largely responsible for establishment of the college. The first class of seven students graduated in 1948.

In 1949, when Howard S. McDonald became president of both Los Angeles State College and Los Angeles City College, the state college upper division classes were being taught in borrowed spaces on the City College campus by mostly part-time faculty. He hired administrators to help him formally organize the colleges. Then he found a site within Los Angeles to house the new &quot;Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences,&quot; which replaced the Los Angeles State College also in 1949 after being reconstituted by the Legislature. Howard S. McDonald enjoyed telling how some influential supporters of the University of Southern California opposed his selection of a piece of land in Baldwin Hills, and how the then Los Angeles Mayor Norris Poulson ran him out of Chavez Ravine so that he could lure the Dodger baseball team to Los Angeles. The college opened in its new location in 1958, Howard S. McDonald becomes first full-time president. When McDonald retired in 1962, seven academic buildings on the new campus were completed and an eighth structure (North Hall, later named King Hall) was nearing completion. North Hall opened in September 1962.

=== Second half of 20th century ===
In 1952, the state proposed a new satellite campus for Cal State LA, at the time known as Los Angeles State College, and in July 1958, the campus separated from Cal State LA and was renamed San Fernando Valley State College (now known as California State University, Northridge). The first master&#x27;s degrees were awarded in 1952.

Since 1954, Cal State LA has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The university&#x27;s credential programs are approved by the Commission for Teacher Credentialing Committee on Accreditation.

In 1955, officials broke ground on the current location, dubbed the Ramona site at the time. The college then moved to its present campus in the northeastern section of the City of Los Angeles, east of the Civic Center.

In 1962, the college welcomed its third president Albert D. Graves who was vice president of Academic Affairs of LASCAAS. The college also entered into its first contract to prepare students for the United States Peace Corps. The first group of 65 volunteers was trained for service in the Dominican Republic in the areas of teacher training, music teacher training and urban community action. The first Commencement at new site takes place in June 1963.

On December 6, 1963, the California State College (now California State University) Board of Trustees named the library after the late 35th president of the United States John F. Kennedy. An edifice plaque was unveiled during the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library naming ceremony on February 12, 1964, and in November 1969 the library North Wing is dedicated.

In 1964, the Board of Trustees of the California State Colleges changed the name of the college to the &quot;California State College at Los Angeles&quot; (CSCLA), and in 1968 to &quot;California State College, Los Angeles&quot;, when it became part of the California State College (CSC) system. In 1972, CSCLA was awarded university status and was renamed California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA).

In 1968, Cal State LA established the nation&#x27;s first Chicano Studies department.

In fall 1970, the South Tower and South Hall were completed and opened. July 1976 the CSU Board of Trustees approved the renaming of South Tower to Simpson Tower, in memory of Floyd R. Simpson, first dean of the School of Business and Economics. South Hall was renamed Salazar Hall in memory of slain Los Angeles Times journalist and news director for KMEX-DT Ruben Salazar.

The original mascot of the school was the Diablo. In 1980, new university president James Rosser adopted a new mascot, Eddie the golden eagle, designed to be more reflective of the campus&#x27; highly diverse community. The theme was extended to student facilities such as the student union and bookstore.

In 1993, the California State University Chancellor and Trustees approved development of Cal State LA&#x27;s Charter College of Education, creating the first such college of higher education in the nation.

In October 1998, the Center for Environmental Analysis, first of its kind funded by the National Science Foundation on the West Coast, opened on campus.

=== 21st century ===
In September 2000, Governor of California Gray Davis chose the Cal State LA campus to hold a press conference at which he signed the historic bills expanding the Cal Grant program.

Cal State LA departments of Social Work and Nursing, located within the university&#x27;s College of Health and Human Services, were granted the status of School in Winter 2002.

Cal State LA Downtown is a satellite campus opened in January 2016. Programs are provided through the university&#x27;s College of Professional &amp; Global Education.

Naming of the Rongxiang Xu College of Health and Human Services took place during the university&#x27;s 69th Commencement on June 11, 2016. The naming recognized the largest gift in the university&#x27;s history and named in honor of the late Dr. Rongxiang Xu, who was a surgeon and expert in regenerative medicine.

The Patricia A. Chin School of Nursing was dedicated as the first named school at Cal State L.A. in April 2018. Patricia Chin taught nursing at the university, later serving as director and, upon her retirement, professor emerita.

A statue of Cal State LA alumna and world champion tennis legend Billie Jean King was installed on the grassy area in front of the Physical Education building. When Billie Jean King was in school at Cal State LA, she had already won Wimbledon.

Construction on a $30 million University-Student Union (U-SU) building began in 2005; it opened in January 2009. The facility offers a place for students and faculty to congregate and interact before or after class. It replaced the 1975 U-SU building that was closed in 2004 due to seismic concerns. The U-SU offers a theater, a fitness center, and an array of other services dedicated to the student body. Its meeting rooms connect to those of The Golden Eagle building via a third floor bridge. The Golden Eagle includes a food court, a Barnes &amp; Noble-operated bookstore and major conference facilities. The university food court is owned by the Coca-Cola Company, offering a selection of fast food restaurants that include El Pollo Loco, Carl&#x27;s Jr., The Spot, and Juice It Up. The U-SU facility houses additional fast food options.

Cal State LA is one of only eight institutions in North and South America selected as a Rockefeller Foundation humanities fellowship residency site.

As of fall 2018 Cal State LA has the second largest enrollment percentage of Mexican Americans and Other Latino Americans that are not Mexican-American in the Cal State University system. Other Latinos Americans having heritage from Central America, South America and the Caribbean.

The HBO show &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; used the face of the U-SU as the building for the Hooli company.
===Associated Students===
Associated Students Incorporated (ASI) is the student government of California State University, Los Angeles. ASI is governed by a student board of directors who are elected each year by the student body of Cal State LA. ASI represents the interests of the student body and acts as the officially recognized voice of the students. In addition, ASI sponsors a number of campus events and activities using mandatory student fees.

===Eagle Advocates===
Eagle Advocates, or ASI&#x27;s Lobby Corps, is the sole student advocacy group representing the entire student body of the school. Each CSU campus has a lobby corps and is open to all students. Students are trained in advocacy and lobbying throughout the school year. A focus is aimed at the state legislature although local and federal issues are followed as well.
===Janice Cordova Garden of Well-Being===
Cal State LA dedicated the Janice Cordova Garden of Well-Being on April 21, 2022, named in honor of the late wife of alumnus Richard Cordova. The garden is located in the heart of campus, between the Center for Engagement, Service, and the Public Good and the Student Health Center. It is a peaceful space that features a meditative walking path, artwork, and more than 50 types of plant life that promote relaxation, healing, and transcendence. The idea for the garden initially came from students participating in WellBeingU roundtables, during which students in the university&#x27;s Introduction to Higher Ed courses developed action plans for improving well-being on campus. &quot;Student teams repeatedly imagined the creation of a space on campus defined by natural beauty where they could reflect, recharge and come together,&quot; said First Lady Covino said at the garden dedication. In many gardens, people have a practice of &quot;forest bathing&quot; in order to experience physical and mental well-being. The Garden can generate a sense of wonder and awe from experiencing something bigger than ourselves. Nature therapy, or ecotherapy, can strengthen the immune, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. Relaxation can also improve blood sugar, mood, concentration, and sleep. Students can relax by sitting quietly in the garden and looking at the beautiful nature around them. The images in the garden have been reproduced from original oil paintings with permission from the artist Mika Cho. Mika M. Cho is a faculty member at Cal State LA and the director for the Ronald H. Silverman Fine Arts Gallery at the university.

==Student housing==

From 1964 to 1972, developer Louis Lesser built six off-campus, 10-story high-rise residential halls to house 3,600 students. The campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university&#x27;s housing capacity, making Cal State LA the largest in the California State University system. Maxwell Starkman &amp; Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc. The first residential life complex phase I on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex Phase II was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009). During 1984 Summer Olympics that took place in Los Angeles, Cal State LA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Lesser also pioneered underground parking, with his Cal State LA development, at the time considered unusual enough to merit a separate newspaper section header, &quot;Parking Underground&quot;, which described a two-level underground parking lot as a &quot;concept&quot; of &quot;subterranean spaces&quot;. 
The Student Housing East project was completed in 2021. The North Campus Project provides for new student housing facilities, new soccer fields, and a parking structure within the northern portion of the Cal State LA campus. Scope of the Work: The student housing facilities provide 1,500 beds for freshmen and sophomore students, as well as an associated dining facility. 
===Themed-living communities===

Resident Scholars Housing
The goal of Resident Scholars Housing is to provide Cal State LA Honors College and academically achieving students with themed housing that supports the mission and vision of the Honors College and the Institutional Learning Outcomes by forming a strong community of students through shared Honors classes, providing learning opportunities and social engagement beyond the classroom and engaging in a student-directed community. It also increases the following: student interaction with Honors faculty, staff and fellow students; involvement in the larger Los Angeles and Cal State LA community; and retention and graduation rates.

Halisi Scholars Living Learning Community The Halisi Scholars Living Learning Community is designed to enhance the residential experience for students who are a part of or interested in issues regarding the Black community living on campus by offering the opportunity to connect with faculty and peers, and engage in programs that focus on academic success, cultural awareness and civic engagement.

==Parking and public transportation==
Cal State LA&#x27;s parking received press coverage for pioneering the concept of underground parking to deal with the limitations of ground space for expansion under the initial California State expansion plans of the early 1960s. Developer Louis Lesser developed &quot;underground parking&quot; in his off campus residential housing development for the university in 1964, with only a two level underground parking structure considered so unusual as to merit a separate newspaper section header, &quot;Parking Underground&quot;, and calling the parking &quot;subterranean spaces.&quot;

Structure E, a 5-story open parking garage provides over 2,000 parking spaces and hosts electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, including 3 fast chargers for the Cal State LA community.

<text>The General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a land-mobile FM UHF radio service designed for short-range two-way voice communication and authorized under part 95 of the US FCC code. It requires a license in the United States, but some GMRS compatible equipment can be used license-free in Canada. The US GMRS license is issued for a period of 10 years. The United States permits use by adult individuals who possess a valid GMRS license, as well as their immediate family members. Immediate relatives of the GMRS system licensee are entitled to communicate among themselves for personal or business purposes, but employees of the licensee who are not family members are not covered by the license. Non-family members must be licensed separately.

GMRS radios are typically handheld portable (walkie-talkies) much like Family Radio Service (FRS) radios, and they share a frequency band with FRS near 462 and 467 MHz. Mobile and base station-style radios are available as well, but these are normally commercial UHF radios as often used in the public service and commercial land mobile bands. These are legal for use in this service as long as they are certified for GMRS under USC 47 Part 95. Older radios that are certified under USC 47 Part 90 are &quot;grandfathered in&quot;, and can also be used legally for GMRS.
GMRS licensees are allowed to establish repeaters to extend their communications range. However repeaters cannot be linked together over the internet nor connected to the public switched telephone network.

==Licensing==
Any individual in the United States who is at least 18 years of age and not a representative of a foreign government may apply for a GMRS license by completing the application form, online through the FCC&#x27;s Universal Licensing System. No exam is required. A GMRS license is issued for a 10–year term.
The fee was reduced to $35 for all applicants on April 19, 2022.

A GMRS individual license extends to immediate family members and authorizes them to use the licensed system. GMRS license holders are allowed to communicate with FRS users on those frequencies that are shared between the two services. GMRS individual licenses do not extend to employees.

New GMRS licenses are being issued only to individuals. Prior to July 31, 1987, the FCC issued GMRS licenses to non-individuals (corporations, partnerships, government entities, etc.). These licensees are grandfathered and may renew but not make major modifications to their existing licenses.

In any case, each GMRS station must be identified by transmission of its FCC-assigned call sign at the end of a transmission or a series of transmissions, and at least once every 15 minutes for a series lasting more than 15 minutes. The call sign may be spoken or sent with audible tones using Morse code. A repeater station handling properly identified transmissions of others is not required to send its own station identification.

==Range==
As with other UHF radio services, reliable range is considered to be line-of-sight and the distance to the radio horizon can be estimated based on antenna height. Theoretically, the range between two hand-held units on flat ground would be about one or two miles (about 1.5–3 km). Mobile units might have a slightly farther range when mounted on a car roof. A GMRS repeater with an antenna mounted high above the surrounding terrain can extend the usable range to 20 miles or more (30+ km) depending on height. Obstructions such as hills, trees, and buildings will reduce range. Higher power does not give much increase in range although it may improve the reliability of communication at the limits of line-of-sight distance.

== Frequency assignments ==
GMRS is allotted 30 frequency channels in the vicinity of 462 MHz and 467 MHz. They are divided into 16 main channels and 14 interstitial channels.

Licensees may use the eight main 462 MHz channels for simplex communication or repeater outputs.

The eight main 467 MHz channels may only be used as repeater inputs, in conjunction with the 462 MHz channels as outputs. The repeater input frequencies are exclusive to GMRS, and may be used only by licensed GMRS operators.

GMRS operators are permitted to transmit at up to 50 watts transmitter power output, on the 16 main channels, but transmitting 1 to 5 watts is more common in practice.

The interstitial frequencies are in-between the main channels, and the 462 MHz interstitial frequencies may be used for simplex as long as the effective radiated power (ERP) does not exceed 5 watts. The 467 MHz interstitial frequencies have a power limit of 500 milliwatts ERP, and only hand-held portable units may transmit on these channels.

=== Sharing with FRS ===
All 22 Family Radio Service (FRS) frequencies are shared with GMRS, and users of the two services may communicate with each other. With the exception of FRS channels 8 through 14, GMRS licensees may use higher power radios with detachable or external antennas.

=== Frequency table ===
;Table notes:(1) Shared FRS and GMRS simplex.&lt;br&gt;(2) Shared FRS and GMRS simplex; GMRS repeater output.&lt;br&gt;(3) GMRS repeater input. The output frequency of this repeater input is the input frequency minus 5 MHz.&lt;br&gt;(4) FRS transmissions are limited to bandwidth of 11 kHz with a transmitter deviation of +/- 2.5 kHz. Channels are on 12.5 kHz centers. &lt;br&gt; (5) GMRS transmissions may have a bandwidth of 16 kHz with a transmitter deviation of +/- 5.0 kHz. Channels are on 25 kHz centers. &lt;br&gt; (6) GMRS transmissions are limited to a bandwidth of 11 kHz with a transmitter deviation of +/- 2.5 kHz. Channels are on 12.5 kHz centers. &lt;br&gt; (7) National GMRS calling channel (CTCSS tone 141.3 Hz).

Note: Some inexpensive GMRS mobiles and portables do not fully comply with FCC permissible modulation bandwidth for GMRS and thus have weak transmitter audio and reduced range.

Conditions: Effective February 16, 1999, the GMRS rules have been amended and one may operate on any of the primary or interstitial channels shown in section 95.1763. Exception: Licensees who operate North of Line A and East of Line C may not operate on channels 462.650 MHz, 467.650 MHz, 462.700 MHz and 467.700 MHz (ch. 19 and 21), unless one&#x27;s previous license authorized such operations.

====Bandwidth vs channel spacing====
The FCC stipulates a specific channel bandwidth for FRS and GMRS. The bandwidth is constrained by the modulation which is FM deviation (GMRS = +/- 5.0 kHz, FRS = +/- 2.5 kHz) plus the uncertainties of the filtering of the transmitter and receiver. Additionally receivers and transmitters may drift over time or temperature so the bandwidth is further constrained to prevent interference to the adjacent channel. Channel spacing is 25 kHz for GMRS and so a 20 kHz bandwidth fits into that channel with protection on each side. FRS channels are spaced within a 12.5 kHz space directly between two GMRS channels. FRS radios generally utilize an 11 kHz transmitter bandwidth and a power lower than GMRS so the interference to an adjacent GMRS channel is minimized.

==History==
The predecessor to GMRS was named Class A Citizens Radio Service when it was commissioned in the 1940s. Tube-type transceivers were used, and transmitter power was limited to 60 watts (plate input power to the final amplifier tube). The original service ran wideband FM with ±15 kHz transmitter deviation and 50 kHz channel spacing. At the time, this was the norm for all U.S. land mobile services. There was also a Class B Citizens Radio Service which used a different set of 461 MHz channels and was limited to five watts output. Business users were permitted to license in this radio service. Radios were built by consumer electronics firms and commercial two-way radio vendors.

In the 1960s, the UHF 450–470 MHz band was re-allocated to 25 kHz channels. This meant transmitter deviation was reduced to ±5 kHz. This doubled the number of channels available across the entire 450–470 MHz band. Class B Citizens Radio Service channels were re-allocated to other radio services.

In the 1970s, allowed power was again changed to 50 watts across the output terminals of the transmitter. In 1987, licensing of business users was discontinued and businesses were allowed to continue operating until their licenses expired. There was congestion on all channels in larger metropolitan statistical areas and moving businesses to Business Radio Service channels would provide some relief. The radio service was changed to its present name; General Mobile Radio Service or GMRS.

In 2010 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed removing the individual licensing requirement. In 2015, the FCC ruled to keep the license requirement, but to remove the regulator fee for licensing. Adopted on May 20, 2015, the ruling would be in effect after a 90–day notification period to Congress; the fee will not be eliminated before August 18, 2015. The fee for a 5–year license was $90, with the regulatory fee portion of the license at $5 per year (or $25 for the 5–year life of the license). After the notification period, the fee for a 5–year license was to become $65. The change became effective on September 3, 2015. 

Effective September 28, 2017, FCC revised the definition of the FRS service. FRS operation is now permitted with up to 2 watts on the shared FRS/GMRS channels. The FCC will not grant certification for hybrid radios that would exceed the limits for the FRS service on the FRS channels. Current &quot;hybrid&quot; FRS/GMRS radios will not require a GMRS license for power up to 2 watts, but FRS radios will still not be permitted to use the input frequencies of GMRS repeaters. Any radio exceeding the limits of the new FRS service will be classified as a GMRS radio.

On September 30, 2019, it became unlawful in the United States to import, manufacture, sell, or offer to sell radio equipment capable of operating under both GMRS and FRS.

==Use of GMRS equipment in other countries==
The use of radio transmitters is regulated by national laws and international agreements. Often radio equipment accepted for use in one part of the world may not be operated in other parts due to conflicts with frequency assignments and technical standards. Some of the roles that the licensed GMRS service fills in the United States are, in other countries, filled by unlicensed or class-licensed services. Generally these services have strict technical standards for equipment to prevent interference with licensed transmitters and systems.

In Canada, hand-held GMRS radios up to 2 watts have been approved for use without a license since September 2004. Typically these are dual FRS and GMRS units, with fixed antennas, and operating at 2 watts on some GMRS channels and 0.5 watts on the FRS-only channels. Mobile units (permanently mounted in vehicles), base stations and repeaters are not currently permitted on the GMRS channels in Canada.

Other countries have licensed and unlicensed personal radio services with somewhat similar characteristics, but technical details and operating conditions vary according to national rules. Many European countries use a similar 16–channel system near 446 MHz known as PMR446, as well as a 69–channel low-power LPD433 which is shared with the 433.92 MHz ISM band. GMRS equipment that is approved for use in the United States will not communicate with PMR446 radios due to using different frequency ranges.

==GMRS License fee change==
Currently, the application fee for a GMRS license is $35. An FCC Report and Order released December 23, 2020, and in a subsequent notice issued by the FCC on March 23, 2022, the fee dropped from $70 to $35 starting on April 19, 2022. The license is still valid for 10 years and covers an entire family.

==Repeater Linking==
GMRS use to be regularly linked to other repeaters. The common practice for this linking was done via internet. This was commonly referred to GMRS Nodes.

Around January 24, 2024 the FCC changed the wording on GMRs operations page that said &quot; You cannot directly interconnect a GMRS station with the telephone network.&quot; to now include (among other things) &quot;or any other network&quot;. As of November 1, 2024 it now has this added to the operations tab: &quot;In other words, repeaters may not be linked via the internet—an example of an “other network” in the rules—to extend the range of the communications across a large geographic area. Linking multiple repeaters to enable a repeater outside the communications range of the handheld or mobile device to retransmit messages violates sections 95.1733(a)(8) and 95.1749 of the Commission&#x27;s rules, and potentially other rules in 47 C.F.R. Repeaters may be connected to the telephone network or other networks only for purposes of remote control of a GMRS station, not for carrying communication signals. &quot; Wording changes did not affect local repeaters. This change did shut down several major nodes. This change was not an official act; it was instead done through interpretation set forth by the Chevron Defense. The changes and shutdowns of nodes has drawn mixed reactions.

<text>The New Hampshire Grants or Benning Wentworth Grants were land grants made between 1749 and 1764 by the colonial governor of the Province of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth. The land grants, totaling about 135 (including 131 towns), were made on land claimed by New Hampshire west of the Connecticut River, territory that was also claimed by the Province of New York. The resulting dispute led to the eventual establishment of the Vermont Republic, which later became the U.S. state of Vermont.

==Background==
The territory of what is now Vermont was first permanently settled by European settlers when William Dummer, acting governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, ordered the construction of a fort roughly where Brattleboro is located. Massachusetts laid claim to the territory west of the Merrimack River at the time, and it had settlers on the Connecticut River who were prepared to move further north. The border between Massachusetts and the neighboring Province of New Hampshire was fixed by royal decree in 1741 at a line north of Pawtucket Falls, where the Merrimack River turns north. This decision eliminated claims by Massachusetts to the north of that line. The territory between the Connecticut River and Lake Champlain, however, was also claimed by the Province of New York, the claims of which extended eastward to the Connecticut River.

Also in 1741, New Hampshire native Benning Wentworth was appointed the first governor of New Hampshire of the 18th century who was not also a governor of Massachusetts. Wentworth chose to read New Hampshire&#x27;s territorial claims broadly. He construed the decree setting the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border to mean that New Hampshire&#x27;s jurisdiction extended as far west as the jurisdiction of Massachusetts extended. Since the Massachusetts boundary extended to a point east of the Hudson River, Wentworth assumed the area west of the Connecticut belonged to New Hampshire. New York based its claim on the letters patent, which granted Prince James, Duke of York, brother of King Charles II, all of the lands west of the Connecticut River to Delaware Bay.

==Grants==

===New Hampshire===
Wentworth made the first grant, Bennington, a township west of the Connecticut River, on January 3, 1749. Cautioned by New York to cease and desist, Wentworth promised to await the judgment of the king, and refrain from making more grants in the claimed territory until it was rendered, but in November 1753, New York reported that he continued to grant land in the disputed area. Grants briefly ceased in 1754, because of the French and Indian War, but in 1755 and 1757, Wentworth had a survey made up the Connecticut River, and 108 grants were made, extending to the line east of the Hudson, and north to the eastern shore of Lake Champlain.

The grants were usually six miles square (the standard size of a U.S. survey township, i.e. 23,040 acres or 93 km2) and cost the grantee(s) 20 pounds. The grants were then subdivided amongst the proprietors, and six of the lots were set aside—one for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (a missionary organization of the Church of England), one for the Church of England, one for the first clergyman to settle in the township, one for a school, and two for Wentworth himself. The permanent annual tax on each grant, called a quitrent, was one shilling, paid directly to the King or his representative.

===New York===
While Wentworth&#x27;s land sales were underway, New York also issued land patents in the same area. However, in contrast to the New Hampshire grants, the New York patents were generally irregularly shaped and issued to wealthy landowners. The New Hampshire grants were &quot;town-sized,&quot; and generally settled by middle-class farmers. Most of the New York boundaries were ignored in favor of the New Hampshire boundaries and designations once Vermont achieved statehood, and some of these New York patents are now referred to as &quot;paper towns&quot; because they existed only on paper.

==Royal adjudication==
In September 1762, New York found New Hampshire surveyors working on the east side of Champlain, provoking the former colony&#x27;s government to reiterate its claim to the area, citing both its own patent and the New Hampshire letters patent of 1741. In March 1764, Wentworth released a statement to the effect that the resolution of jurisdictional dispute required a royal verdict, which he was certain would be made in his favor. Meanwhile, he encouraged his grantees to settle in the land and to cultivate and develop it.

New York appealed to the Board of Trade, requesting a confirmation of their original grant, which finally resolved the border dispute between New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. The royal order of July 26, 1764, affirmed that &quot;the Western bank of the Connecticut, from where it enters the province of Massachusetts Bay as far north as the 45th degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary line between the said two provinces of New Hampshire and New York.&quot; Wentworth issued his final two grants on October 17 of that year: Walker and Waltham.

==Invalidation==

New York interpreted the decision as invalidating Wentworth&#x27;s grants entirely—to the great dismay of area residents—and subsequently divided the territory into four counties, Albany, Charlotte, Cumberland and Gloucester. New York required that grantees surrender their charters, and in many cases buy their lands back from New York at greatly increased prices. Those who would not pay lost legal title to their lands, which New York then reassigned to others. The people, who would later become Vermonters, petitioned the governor of New York to confirm the New Hampshire Grants; he complied, in part, by declaring that no other grants should be made until the King&#x27;s wishes were known. Land not previously granted by New Hampshire was considered open for distribution by New York&#x27;s government.

In 1770, the New York Supreme Court declared all of Wentworth&#x27;s grants invalid, thereby asserting the province&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; control over the region. This infuriated residents, including Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys, who rose up to resist those efforts. While the resistance faded, so did New York&#x27;s desire to assert its claim on the land around the Upper Connecticut, as a more pressing issue—revolution—moved to center stage.

==Independence and statehood==

In January 1775 Committees of Safety from over twenty towns in the New Hampshire Grants area met in Manchester to discuss the need for local self-governance independent from New York. The Manchester meeting created a &quot;civil and political Body&quot; to regulate their community. Two months later, another convention meeting at Westminster renounced the authority of New York&#x27;s government. On March 13, 1775, two men were killed in Westminster by officers from New York. News of the first clash between American militia and British troops at Lexington and Concord interrupted the Westminster convention, but settlers gathered at yet another convention at Dorset in 1776 and petitioned the Continental Congress to recognize Vermont as a state and seat its delegates. The New York delegation convinced the Congress to deny the petition.

Some former Green Mountain Boys companies served in the American Revolutionary War, including in the effort to capture Fort Ticonderoga on May 10, 1775, and the invasion of Canada later that year. Ethan Allen and his then subordinate, Seth Warner, induced the Continental Congress at Philadelphia to create a &quot;Green Mountain&quot; ranger regiment. Having no treasury, the Congress directed that New York&#x27;s Provincial Congress pay for the newly authorized regiment; which it did. 

In 1777 the citizens of Vermont declared their full independence from Great Britain and established a constitution. The first elections under this constitution were held on March 3, 1778, and on March 12, the new government was organized at Windsor. 

During the later stages of the Revolutionary War (early 1780s) several Vermont officials engaged in negotiations with British officials, including Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, about Vermont officially returning to the British side. Just as Haldimand offered generous terms for reunion in 1781, the main British army surrendered at Yorktown, and it was clear that the United States would achieve independence. 

Following the Revolutionary War, Vermont was excluded (primarily due to objections from New York) from the loose confederation established among the 13 former colonies. The state remained outside until 1791. In 1790 New York finally consented to Vermont&#x27;s admission to the Union. New York ceded its New Hampshire Grants claim to Vermont for 30,000 dollars. A convention was held from January 6 through 10, 1791 at Bennington to consider joining the federal Union. The convention voted 105–2 in favor of seeking admission. Congress gave unanimous approval to Vermont statehood the following month, and on March 4, 1791, the New Hampshire Grants, as Vermont, became the 14th state, the first admitted to the Union after adoption of the federal Constitution.

<text>Socotra, locally known as Saqatri, is a Yemeni island in the Indian Ocean. Situated between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea, it lies near major shipping routes. Socotra is the largest of the six islands in the Socotra archipelago as it comprises around 95% of the landmass of the archipelago. It lies south of the Arabian Peninsula and east of the Horn of Africa, making it geographically a part of Africa. The inhabitants of the island are called Socotrans, and they speak Arabic and Soqotri. 

Socotra is home to a high number of endemic species. Up to a third of its plant life is endemic. Due to the island&#x27;s unusual geography, it has been described as &quot;the most alien-looking place on Earth&quot;. The island measures in length and across at its widest. In 2008, Socotra was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The island is under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Southern Transitional Council, a United Arab Emirates-backed, pro-Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), &quot;secessionist&quot; faction in Yemen&#x27;s ongoing civil war.

==Etymology==
Scholars&#x27; views vary regarding the origin of the name of the island. The name Socotra may derive from: 
* A Greek name that is derived from the name of a South Arabian tribe mentioned in Sabaic and Ḥaḍraumitic inscriptions as &quot;Dhū-Śakūrid&quot; ().
* The Arabian terms &quot;suq&quot;, market, and &quot;qutra&quot;, a vulgar form of qatir, which refers to dragon&#x27;s blood.

==History==
There was initially an Oldowan lithic culture in Socotra. Oldowan stone tools were found in the area around Hadibo in 2008. Socotra played an important role in the ancient international trade and appears as &quot;Dioskouridou&quot; (Διοσκουρίδου νῆσος), meaning &quot;the island of Dioscurides&quot; in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a first-century CE Greek navigation aid.

The Hoq Cave contains a large number of inscriptions, drawings and archaeological objects. Further investigation showed that these had been left by sailors who visited the island between the first century BCE and the sixth century CE. The texts are written in the Indian Brāhmī, South Arabian, Ethiopic, Greek, Palmyrene and Bactrian languages. This corpus of nearly 250 texts and drawings constitutes one of the main sources for the investigation of Indian Ocean trade networks in that time period.

In 880, an Aksumite expeditionary force conquered the island, and an Oriental Orthodox bishop was consecrated. The Ethiopians were later dislodged by a large armada sent by Imam Al-Salt bin Malik of Oman. According to the Persian geographer Ibn al-Mujawir, who testifies having arrived in Socotra from India in 1222, there were two groups of people on the island, the indigenous mountain dwellers and the foreign coastal dwellers. There were large settlements of Indian traders from Sindh and Balochistan.
In 1507, a Portuguese fleet commanded by Tristão da Cunha with Afonso de Albuquerque landed at Suq and captured the port after a stiff battle against the Mahra Sultanate. Their objective was to set a base in a strategic place on the route to India. The lack of a proper harbor and the infertility of the land led to famine and sickness in the garrison, and the Portuguese abandoned the island in 1511. The Mahra sultans took back control of the island, and the inhabitants were converted to Islam.

In 1834, the East India Company stationed a garrison on Socotra, in the expectation that the Mahra sultan of Qishn and Socotra would accept an offer to sell the island. The lack of good anchorages proved to be as much a problem for the British as the Portuguese. The sultan refused to sell, and the British left in 1835. After the capture of Aden by the British in 1839, they lost interest in acquiring Socotra. In 1886, the British government decided to conclude a protectorate treaty with the sultan in which he promised this time to &quot;refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or power, except with the knowledge and sanction of the British Government&quot;. In October 1967, in the wake of the departure of the British from Aden and southern Arabia, the Mahra Sultanate was abolished. 

On 30 November of the same year, Socotra became part of South Yemen. Between 1976 and 1979, the island served as a base for the Soviet Navy. Although the South Yemeni government and president, Ali Nasir Muhammad, had denied their existence. Slavery in the island was abolished under the rule of the Yemeni Socialist Party.

Since Yemeni unification in 1990, Socotra has been a part of the Republic of Yemen, affiliated first to Aden Governorate. Then in 2004, it was moved to be a part of the Hadhramaut Governorate. Later in 2013, it became a governorate of its own.

Socotra was ravaged by the 26 December 2004 tsunami causing a child&#x27;s death and the wreckage of 40 fishing boats although the island is away from tsunami epicentre off the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia. In 2015, the cyclones Chapala and Megh struck the island, causing severe damage to its infrastructure.

Beginning in 2015, the UAE began increasing its presence on Socotra, first with humanitarian aid in the wake of tropical cyclones Chapala and Megh, and eventually establishing a military presence on the island. On 30 April 2018, the UAE, as part of the ongoing Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen, landed troops on the island and took control of Socotra Airport and seaport. On 14 May 2018, Saudi troops were also deployed on the island, and a deal was brokered between the UAE and Yemen for a joint military training exercise and the return of administrative control of the airport and seaport to Yemen.

==Geography==
Socotra is one of the most isolated landforms on Earth of continental origin (i.e. not of volcanic origin). The archipelago was once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana and detached during the Miocene epoch, in the same set of rifting events that opened the Gulf of Aden to its northwest. The island is culturally and administratively a part of Yemen, but it geographically belongs to Africa as it represents a continental fragment that is geologically linked to the Somali Plate.

The archipelago consists of the main island of Socotra (), three smaller islands, Abd al Kuri, Samhah and Darsa, and two rocky islets, Ka&#x27;l Fir&#x27;awn and Sābūnīyah, both uninhabitable by humans but important for seabirds. The island is about long and north to south. and has three major physical regions:
* The narrow coastal plains with its characteristic dunes, formed by monsoon winds blowing during three summer months. The wind takes up the coast sand in a spiral and, as a result, forms the snow-white Socotran sand dunes.
* The limestone plateaus of Momi, Homhil and Diksam with its characteristic karst topography based on limestone rock areas intersected with inter-hill plains. For centuries until recently Socotra&#x27;s main economic activity was subsistent transhumant animal husbandry, predominantly goats and sheep on these plateaus. The outcome is a unique and still active cultural landscape of agro-pastoralism with its characteristic rainwater harvesting systems.
* A central massif, the Hajhir Mountains, composed of granite and metamorphic rocks. rising to .

==Climate==

The climate of Socotra is classified in the Köppen climate classification as &quot;BWh&quot; and &quot;BSh&quot;, meaning a transitional hot desert climate and a semi-desert climate with a mean annual temperature over . Yearly rainfall is light but is fairly spread throughout the year. Orographic lift provided by the interior mountains, especially during the northeast monsoon from October to December, results in the highest inland areas averaging as much as per year and receiving over per month during November and December. The southwest monsoon season from June to September brings strong winds and high seas. 

In an extremely unusual occurrence, the normally arid western side of Socotra received more than of rain from Cyclone Chapala in November 2015. Cyclones rarely affect the island, but in 2015 Cyclone Megh became the strongest, and only, major cyclone to strike the island directly.

==Demographics==

Most of the inhabitants are indigenous Soqotri people from Al-Mahrah tribe, who are of Southern Arabian descent from Al Mahrah Governorate, and are said to be especially closely related with the Qara and Mahra groups of Southern Arabia. Some of the inhabitants are African, descending from former slaves who settled on the island. The majority of male residents on Socotra are reported to be in the J* subclade of Y-DNA haplogroup J. Several of the female lineages, notably those in mtDNA haplogroup N, are unique to the island.

Almost all inhabitants of Socotra, numbering about 50,000, live on the main island of the archipelago. The principal city, Hadibu (with a population of 8,545 at the census of 2004); the second largest town, Qalansiyah (population 3,862); and Qād̨ub (population 929) are all located on the north coast of the island of Socotra. Only about 450 people live on &#x27;Abd-al-Kūrī and 100 on Samha; the island of Darsa and the islets of the archipelago are uninhabited.

===Language===
The island is home to the Semitic language Soqotri, which is related to such other Modern South Arabian languages on the Arabian mainland as Mehri, Harsusi, Bathari, Shehri, and Hobyot, which became the subject of European academic study in the nineteenth century.

There is an ancient tradition of poetry and a poetry competition is held annually on the island. The first attested Socotran poet is thought to be the ninth-century Fatima al-Suqutriyya, a popular figure in Socotran culture. Socotra Swahili is extinct.

===Religion===

The earliest account concerning the presence of Christians in Socotra stems from the early-medieval 6th century CE Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes Later the Socotrans joined the Assyrian church. During the 10th century, Arab geographer Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani recorded during his visits that most of the islanders were Christian.

Christianity went into decline when the Mahra sultanate took power in the 16th century, and the populace had become mostly Muslim by the time the Portuguese arrived later that century. An 1884 edition of &quot;Nature&quot; writes that the disappearance of Christian churches and monuments can be accounted for by a Wahhabi excursion to the island in 1800. Today the only remnants of Christianity are some cross engravings from the first century CE, a few Christian tombs, and some church ruins.

==Transport==

Public transport on Socotra is limited to a few minibuses; car hire usually means hiring a 4WD car and a driver. Transport is a delicate matter on Socotra as road construction is considered locally to be detrimental to the island and its ecosystem. In particular, damage has occurred via chemical pollution from road construction while new roads have resulted in habitat fragmentation.

The only port on Socotra is east of Hadibu. Ships connect the port with the Yemeni coastal city of Mukalla. The journey takes 2–3 days, and the service is used mostly for cargo. The UAE funded the modernization of the port on Socotra. 

Yemenia and Felix Airways flew from Socotra Airport to Sana&#x27;a and Aden via Riyan Airport. As of March 2015, due to ongoing civil war involving Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Air Force, all flights to and from Socotra were cancelled. During the deployment of Emirati troops and aid to the Island, multiple flight connections were made between Abu Dhabi and Hadibu as part of Emirati effort to provide Socotra residents with access to free healthcare and provide work opportunities. Currently, there are scheduled flights from Cairo and Abu Dhabi to Socotra once per week.

==Tourism==

Among 19th-century visitors to the island came British celebrity explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent, and their party, from mid December 1896 to mid February 1897.

Prior to the construction of the Socotra airport, the island could only be reached by a cargo ship. The ideal time to visit Socotra is from October to April; the remaining months usually have heavy monsoon rainfall, making it difficult for tourists; flights also usually get cancelled. The island lacks any well-established hotels, although there are a few guesthouses for the travelers to stay during their short visits. The island received over 1,000 tourists each year until 2014, which has since been affected by the civil war.

Tourism to the island has increased over the years as many operators have started offering trips to the island, which &quot;Gulf Today&quot; claimed “will become a dream destination despite the country&#x27;s conflict”. In May 2021, the Ministry of Information stated that the UAE is violating the island and has been planning to control it for years. It is running illegal trips for foreign tourists without taking any permission from the Yemeni government.

<text>Holi () is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, and Spring.
It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.
Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu. 
Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.

Holi also celebrates the arrival of spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love. It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season. It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar.

==Names==

&quot;Holi&quot; (, , , , , , ) is also known as &quot;Dol Jatra&quot; (swing festival&quot;) and &quot;Bôshonto Utshôb&quot; () (&quot;spring festival&quot;) in Bengal (West Bengal and Bangladesh), &quot;Phakua&quot; () and &quot;Dôl Jātrā&quot; () in Assam, &quot;Phāgu Pūrṇimā&quot; () in the hilly region of Nepal, &quot;Dola jātra&quot; () in Odisha, &quot;Fagua&quot; or &quot;Phagua&quot; () in eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Bihar, and northwestern Jharkhand, &quot;Phagwah&quot; or &quot;Phagwa&quot; (Caribbean Hindustani: पगवा) in the Caribbean (namely Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica), and &quot;Phagua&quot; () in Fiji.

The main day of the celebration is known as &quot;Holi&quot;, &quot;Rangwali Holi&quot;, &quot;Dol Purnima&quot;, &quot;Dhuleti&quot;, &quot;Dhulandi&quot;, &quot;Ukuli&quot;, &quot;Manjal Kuli&quot;, &quot;Yaosang&quot;, &quot;Shigmo&quot;, &quot;Phagwah&quot;, or &quot;Jajiri&quot;.

==Description==
Holi is a sacred ancient tradition of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional holidays in other countries. It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to have fun banter with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is also observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle. The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian calendar.

The festival has many purposes; most prominently, it celebrates the beginning of spring. In 17th century literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring harvests, and the fertile land. Hindus believe it is a time to enjoying spring&#x27;s abundant colours and say farewell to winter. To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark an occasion to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end conflicts, and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the past.

It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as &quot;Dhuli&quot; in Sanskrit, or &quot;Dhulheti&quot;, &quot;Dhulandi&quot; or &quot;Dhulendi&quot;, is celebrated.

In northern parts of India, children and youth spray coloured powder solutions (&quot;gulal&quot;) at each other, laugh, and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (&quot;abir&quot;) on each other&#x27;s faces. Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as &quot;gujhia, shakkarpaare, matri, and dahi vada&quot;), desserts and drinks. After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.

 Like Holika Dahan, &quot;Kama Dahanam&quot; is celebrated in some parts of India. The festival of colours in these parts is called &quot;Rangapanchami&quot;, and occurs on the fifth day after Poornima (full moon).

==History==


The Holi festival is an ancient Hindu festival with its own cultural rituals which emerged before the Gupta period. The festival of colours finds mentioned in numerous scriptures, such as in works like Jaimini&#x27;s &quot;Purva Mimamsa Sutras&quot; and &quot;Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras&quot; with even more detailed descriptions in ancient texts like the &quot;Narada Purana&quot; and &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;. The festival of &quot;holikotsav&quot; was also mentioned in the 7th century work, &quot;Ratnavali&quot;, by King Harsha. It is mentioned in the &quot;Puranas&quot;, &quot;Dasakumara Charita&quot; by Daṇḍin, and by the poet Kālidāsa during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta II.

The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama &quot;Ratnavali&quot;. The festival of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old editions of the Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: &quot;Houly&quot; (1687), &quot;Hooly&quot; (1698), &quot;Huli&quot; (1789), &quot;Hohlee&quot; (1809), &quot;Hoolee&quot; (1825), and &quot;Holi&quot; in editions published after 1910.

== Legends ==

=== Radha Krishna ===
In the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love. &quot;Garga Samhita&quot;, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi. There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour. His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna&#x27;s faces has been commemorated as Holi. Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (&quot;Phagwah&quot;), which is common in some Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa.

=== Vishnu ===
There is a symbolic legend found in the 7th chapter of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; explaining why Holi is celebrated as a festival of triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his devotee Prahlada. King Hiranyakashipu, the father of Prahlada, was the king of demonic Asuras and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by &quot;astra&quot; (projectile weapons) nor by any &quot;shastra&quot; (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air. Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him.
Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s own son, Prahlada, however, remained devoted to Vishnu. This infuriated Hiranyakashipu. He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally, Holika, Prahlada&#x27;s evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her. Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire spread, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada, who survived while Holika burned. Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha – half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).

The Holika bonfire and Holi signifies the celebration of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika.

=== Kama and Rati ===
Among other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation. Goddess Parvati wanting to bring Shiva back into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kamadeva on Vasant Panchami. The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama&#x27;s wife Rati (&quot;Kamadevi&quot;) and his own wife &quot;Parvati&quot;. &quot;Rati&quot; performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after the Vasant Panchami festival as Holi. The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India.

==Cultural significance==

The Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, an occasion for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new friends.

Holi is of particular significance in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally associated with Radha Krishna: Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandgaon, Barsana, and Gokula. These places are popular tourist attractions during Holi.

Outside India, Holi is observed by Hindus in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan as well as in countries with large diaspora populations from India around the world. The Holi rituals and customs can vary with local adaptations.

===Other Indian religions===

The festival has traditionally been also observed by non-Hindus, such as by Sikhs, Jains and Newars (Nepal).

In Mughal India, Holi was celebrated with such exuberance that people of all castes could throw colour on the Emperor. According to Sharma (2017), &quot;there are several paintings of Mughal emperors celebrating Holi&quot;. Grand celebrations of Holi were held at the Lal Qila, where the festival was also known as &quot;Eid-e-gulaabi&quot; or &quot;Aab-e-Pashi&quot;. Mehfils were held throughout the walled city of Delhi with aristocrats and traders alike participating. This changed during the rule of Emperor Aurangzeb. He banned the public celebration of Holi using a &quot;Farman&quot; issue in November 1665. However, the celebration were later restarted after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb. Bahadur Shah Zafar himself wrote a song for the festival, while poets such as Amir Khusrau, Ibrahim Raskhan, Nazeer Akbarabadi and Mehjoor Lakhnavi relished it in their writings.

Sikhs have traditionally celebrated the festival, at least through the 19th century, with its historic texts referring to it as &quot;Hola&quot;. Guru Gobind Singh – the last human guru of the Sikhs – modified Holi with a three-day Hola Mohalla extension festival of martial arts. The extension started the day after the Holi festival in Anandpur Sahib, where Sikh soldiers would train in mock battles, compete in horsemanship, athletics, archery and military exercises.

Holi was observed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his Sikh Empire that extended across what are now northern parts of India and Pakistan. According to a report by Tribune India, Sikh court records state that 300 mounds of colours were used in 1837 by Ranjit Singh and his officials in Lahore. Ranjit Singh would celebrate Holi with others in the Bilawal gardens, where decorative tents were set up. In 1837, Sir Henry Fane who was the commander-in-chief of the British Indian army joined the Holi celebrations organised by Ranjit Singh. A mural in the Lahore Fort was sponsored by Ranjit Singh and it showed the Hindu god Krishna playing Holi with &quot;gopis&quot;. After the death of Ranjit Singh, his Sikh sons and others continued to play Holi every year with colours and lavish festivities. The colonial British officials joined these celebrations.

== Celebrations ==
=== Holika Dahan ===


The night before Holi is called Holika Dahan or &quot;Chhoti Holi&quot; whereby people gather around a lit bonfire, symbolising the victory of good over evil as well as the removal of the old and arrival of the new. Various rituals are performed around the fire such as singing and dancing. This ritual is derived from the story of Holika, who attempted to kill Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakashipu, through the flames of a bonfire. Although Holika was endowed with a boon to remain immune to fire, she was burned to ashes, while Prahlada remained unharmed.

=== Main day ===
The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi (Dhuleti) where people smear and drench each other with colours. Water guns and water-filled balloons are often used to play and colour each other, with anyone and any place being considered fair game to colour. Groups often carry drums and other musical instruments going from place to place, singing and dancing. Throughout the day, people visit family, and friends and foes come together to chat, enjoy food and drinks, and partake in Holi delicacies. Holi is also a festival of forgiveness and new starts, which ritually aims to generate harmony in society. Many cities in Uttar Pradesh also organise Kavi sammelan in the evening.

Groups sing and dance, some playing drums and &quot;dholak&quot;. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer gujiya, mathri, malpuas and other traditional delicacies. Cold drinks, including drinks made with marijuana, are also part of the Holi festivity.

=== India ===
==== Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand ====
Holi is known as &quot;Phaguwa&quot; or &quot;Fagua&quot; in the Bhojpuri language. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a purohit initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and much frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.

Holi Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well-wishers visit each other&#x27;s family, apply colours (abeer) on each other&#x27;s faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually, this takes place on the evening of Holi, day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon. Due to large-scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently, this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.

Children and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places, people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the dholak (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi. Intoxicating bhang, made from cannabis, milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering delicacies, such as pakoras and thandai, to enhance the mood of the festival.

In the Kanpur, Holi lasts for seven days. On the last day, a fair called &quot;Ganga Mela&quot; or the &quot;Holi Mela&quot; is celebrated. The fair was started by freedom fighters who fought British rule.

In Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a special event called &quot;Holi Milan&quot; is celebrated.

==== Goa ====

Holi is locally called Ukkuli in Konkani. It is celebrated around the Konkani temple called Gosripuram temple. It is a part of the Goan or Konkani spring festival known as Śigmo or शिगमो in Koṅkaṇī or &quot;Śiśirotsava&quot;, which lasts for about a month. The colour festival or Holi is a part of longer, more extensive spring festival celebrations. Holi festivities (but not Śigmo festivities) include: &quot;Holika Puja&quot; and &quot;Dahan&quot;, &quot;Dhulvad&quot; or &quot;Dhuli vandan&quot;, &quot;Haldune&quot; or offering yellow and saffron colour or &quot;Gulal&quot; to the deity.

==== Gujarat ====
In Gujarat, Holi is a two-day festival. On the evening of the first day, a bonfire is lit and raw coconut and corn is offered to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or &quot;Dhuleti&quot;, celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other. Dwarka, a coastal city of Gujarat, celebrates Holi at the Dwarkadhish temple with citywide music festivities. Holi marks the agricultural season of the rabi crop.

In some places, there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage and tries to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.

==== Jammu and Kashmir ====
In Jammu and Kashmir, Holi celebrations are much in line with the general definition of Holi celebrations: a high-spirited festival to mark the beginning of the harvesting of the summer crop, with the throwing of coloured water and powder and singing and dancing.

==== Karnataka ====
Traditionally, in rural Karnataka, children collect money and wood in the weeks prior to Holi, and on &quot;Kamadahana&quot; night, all the wood is put together and lit. The festival is celebrated for two days. People in northern parts of Karnataka prepare special food on this day.

In Sirsi, Karnataka, Holi is celebrated with a unique folk dance called &quot;Bedara Vesha&quot;, which is performed during the nights beginning five days before the actual festival day. The festival is celebrated every alternate year in the town, which attracts a large number of tourists from different parts of India.

==== Maharashtra ====

In Maharashtra, Holi Purnima is also celebrated as Shimga, festivities that last five to seven days. A week before the festival, youngsters go around the community, collecting firewood and money. On the day of Shimga, the firewood is heaped into a huge pile in each neighbourhood. In the evening, the fire is lit. Every household brings a meal and dessert, in the honour of the fire god. Puran Poli is the main delicacy and children shout &quot;Holi re Holi puranachi poli&quot;. Shimga celebrates the elimination of all evil. The colour celebrations here take place on the day of Rang Panchami, five days after Shimga. During this festival, people are supposed to forget and forgive any rivalries and start new healthy relations with all.

==== Manipur ====
Manipuris celebrate Holi for 6 days. Here, this holiday merges with the festival of Yaosang. Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as &quot;nakadeng&quot; (or &quot;nakatheng&quot;), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called Thabal chongba on the full moon night of Lamta (Phalgun), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and fluorescent lamps. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with &quot;aber&quot; (&quot;gulal&quot;) wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near Imphal where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, Yaosang, a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.

==== Odisha ====

The people of Odisha celebrate &quot;Dola&quot; or &quot;Pushpadola&quot; on the day of Holi where the icons of Jagannath replace the icons of Krishna and Radha. Dola Melana, processions of the deities are celebrated in villages and bhoga is offered to the deities. &quot;Dola yatra&quot; was prevalent even before 1560 much before Holi was started where the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra used to be taken to the &quot;Dolamandapa&quot; (podium in Jagannath temple). People used to offer natural colours known as &quot;abira&quot; to the deities and apply on each other&#x27;s feats.

==== Punjab ====
In Punjab, the eight days preceding Holi are known as luhatak. Sekhon (2000) states that people start throwing colours many days before Holi.

Holi is preceded by Holika Dahan the night before when a fire is lit. Historically, the Lubana community of Punjab celebrated holi &quot;with great pomp and show. The Lubanas buried a pice and betel nut. They heaped up cow-dung cakes over the spot and made a large fire. When the fire had burnt out, they proceeded to hunt for the pice and betel-nut. Whosoever found these, was considered very lucky.&quot; Elsewhere in Punjab, Holi was also associated with making fools of others. Bose writing in Cultural Anthropology: And Other Essays in 1929 noted that &quot;the custom of playing Holi-fools is prevalent in Punjab&quot;.

On the day of Holi, people engage in throwing colours on each other. For locals, Holi marks the end of winter. The Punjabi saying &quot;Phaggan phal laggan&quot; (&quot;Phagun&quot; is the month for fructifying) exemplifies the seasonal aspect of Holi. Trees and plants start blossoming from the day of Basant and start bearing fruit by Holi.

During Holi in Punjab, walls and courtyards of rural houses are enhanced with drawings and paintings similar to rangoli in South India, &quot;mandana&quot; in Rajasthan, and rural arts in other parts of India. This art is known as &quot;chowk-poorana&quot; or &quot;chowkpurana&quot; in Punjab and is given shape by the peasant women of the state. In courtyards, this art is drawn using a piece of cloth. The art includes drawing tree motifs, flowers, ferns, creepers, plants, peacocks, palanquins, geometric patterns along with vertical, horizontal and oblique lines. These arts add to the festive atmosphere.

Folk theatrical performances known as swang or nautanki take place during Holi, with the latter originating in the Punjab. According to Self (1993), Holi fairs are held in the Punjab which may go on for many days. Bose (1961) states that &quot;in some parts of Punjab, Holi is celebrated with wrestling matches&quot;.

==== Telangana ====
Holi is called as &quot;Kamuni Punnami/Kama Purnima&quot; or &quot;Jajiri&quot; in Telugu. Hindus celebrate Holi as it relates to the legend of Kamadeva. Holi is also known by different names: Kamavilas, Kamuni Panduga and Kama-Dahanam.

It is a 10-day festival in Telangana, of which last two days are of great importance. As in other parts of India, in rural Telangana, the 9 days preceding Holi, children celebrate &quot;kamuda&quot; by playing Kolata sticks along with singing folk songs called &quot;jajiri&quot; and collect money, rice, corn and wood. For this reason Holi is well known for &quot;Jajiri Paatalu Kamudi aatalu&quot;, which means festival of &quot;Jajiri songs and Kamudi games&quot; and on 9th night i.e. Holy eve, all the wood is put together and set on fire representing Kama Dahanam.

Next morning i.e. 10th day is celebrated as Holi, with colours traditionally extracted from Moduga/Gogu Flowers (Palash/Butea monosperma).

==== Tripura ====
In Tripura Holi is known as &quot;Pali&quot; which means colour in Tripuri language, it&#x27;s celebrated all over Tripura.

==== Western Uttar Pradesh ====
Barsana, a town near Mathura in the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh, celebrates Lathmar Holi in the sprawling compound of the Radha Rani Temple. Thousands gather to witness the Lath Mar Holi when women beat up men with sticks as those on the sidelines become hysterical, sing Holi songs and shout &quot;Radhe Radhe&quot; or &quot;Sri Radhe Krishna&quot;. The Holi songs of Braj Mandal are sung in pure Braj, the local language. Holi celebrated at Barsana is unique in the sense that here women chase men away with sticks. Males also sing provocative songs in a bid to invite the attention of women. Women then go on the offensive and use long staves called lathis to beat the men, who protect themselves with shields.

Mathura, in the Braj region, is the birthplace of Krishna. In Vrindavan this day is celebrated with special puja and the traditional custom of worshipping Radha Krishna; here the festival lasts for sixteen days. All over the Braj region and neighbouring places like Hathras, Aligarh, and Agra, Holi is celebrated in more or less the same way as in Mathura, Vrindavan and Barsana.

A traditional celebration includes &quot;Matki Phod&quot;, similar to &quot;Dahi Handi&quot; in Maharashtra and Gujarat during Krishna Janmashtami, both in the memory of god Krishna who is also called &quot;makhan chor&quot; (literally, butter thief). This is a historic tradition of the Braj region as well as the western region of India. An earthen pot filled with butter or other milk products is hung high by a rope. Groups of boys and men climb on each other&#x27;s shoulders to form pyramids to reach and break it, while girls and women sing songs and throw coloured water on the pyramid to distract them and make their job harder. This ritual sport continues in Hindu diaspora communities.

==== Uttarakhand ====

Kumaoni Holi in Uttarakhand includes a musical affair. It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi (बैठकी होली), also known as &quot;Nirvan Ki Holi&quot;, begins from the premises of temples, where &quot;Holiyars&quot; (होल्यार) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The Khari Holi (खड़ी होली) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who, sporting traditional white &quot;churidar payajama&quot; and &quot;kurta&quot;, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the &quot;dhol&quot; and &quot;hurka&quot;.

In the Kumaon region, the Holika pyre, known as &quot;Cheer&quot; (चीर), is ceremonially built in a ceremony known as &quot;Cheer Bandhan&quot; (चीर बंधन) fifteen days before Dulhendi. The &quot;Cheer&quot; is a bonfire with a green &quot;Paiya&quot; tree branch in the middle. The &quot;Cheer&quot; of every village and neighbourhood is rigorously guarded as rival &quot;mohallas&quot; try to playfully steal each other&#x27;s &quot;cheer&quot;.

The colours used on Holi are derived from natural sources. Dulhendi, known as &quot;Charadi&quot; (छरड़ी) (from &quot;Chharad&quot; (छरड़)), is made from flower extracts, ash and water. Holi is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way all across North India.

==== West Bengal ====
In West Bengal, the tradition of &quot;Dol Jatra&quot; (meaning &quot;Swing procession)&quot; or &quot;Dolotsava&quot; (meaning &quot;Swing Festival&quot;) or &quot;Dol Purnima&quot; - (&quot;Swing Full Moon)&quot; is common among Gaudiya Vaishnavs just like among Vaishnavs in Braj region and other Krishna centric sampradays all over India. However, several Bengali Vaishnava padavalis also use the term Holi (Bangla : হোলী) for the festival.

In Shantiniketan, West Bengal, Holi is additionally also known as &quot;Basanta Utsab&quot;. The festival is celebrated by worshipping the icons of Radha and Krishna by placing them on a decorated swing. On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, students (mainly in Shantiniketan) dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the ektara, dubri, and veena. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing songs. During these activities, the people keep throwing coloured water and dry colours, abir, at them.

Around 500 years ago, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu went to Vrindavan in present-day Uttar Pradesh to witness the festival there at the birthplace of Lord Sri Krishna. After his return to Bengal, he thought of starting the festival here. So he asked his followers to smear color or abir to Lord Krishna&#x27;s idol and then put that abir on each other. He also instructed them to give the other person a treat with a local sweet called malpoa. The biographies of Sri Chaitanya say that he was very fond of this sweet.

=== Nepal ===

Holi, also known as Phagu Purnima, along with many other Hindu festivals, is celebrated in Nepal as a national festival. It is an important major Nepal-wide festival along with Dashain and Tihar (Dipawali). It is celebrated in the Nepali month of Falgun (Terai region celebrates on the same date as Indian Holi, while rest of the country celebrates it a day earlier), and signifies the legends of the Hindu god Krishna. They worship Saraswati shrine in Vajrayogini temples and celebrate the festival with their Hindu friends.

Traditional concerts are held in most cities in Nepal, including Kathmandu, Narayangarh, Pokhara, Itahari, Hetauda, and Dharan, and are broadcast on television with various celebrity guests.

People walk through their neighbourhoods to celebrate Holi by exchanging colours and spraying coloured water on one another. A popular activity is the throwing of water balloons at one another, sometimes called &quot;lola&quot; (meaning water balloon). Many people mix &quot;bhang&quot; (made from cannabis, milk and spices) in their drinks and food, as is also done during Shivaratri. It is believed that the combination of different colours at this festival takes all sorrow away and makes life itself more colourful. 
=== Pakistan ===

Holi is celebrated by the minority Hindu population in Pakistan. Community events by Hindus have been reported by Pakistani media in various cities such as Karachi, Hazara, Rawalpindi, Sindh, Hyderabad, Multan and Lahore. The Hindu tribes of Cholistan in the Punjab province of Pakistan play the game called Khido in the days leading up to the Holi. The game Khido is considered sacred by them as it is believed that Parhlad used to play this game during his childhood.

Holi was not a public holiday in Pakistan from 1947 to 2016. Holi along with Diwali for Hindus, and Easter for Christians, was adopted as public holiday resolution by Pakistan&#x27;s parliament in 2016, giving the local governments and public institutions the right to declare Holi as a holiday and grant leave for its minority communities, for the first time. This decision has been controversial, with some Pakistanis welcoming the decision, while others criticising it, with the concern that declaring Holi a public holiday advertises a Hindu festival to Pakistani children.

== Indian diaspora ==
Over the years, Holi has become an important festival in many regions wherever Indian diaspora were either taken as indentured labourers during colonial era, or where they emigrated on their own, and are now present in large numbers such as in Africa, North America, Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia such as Fiji.

== Holi colours ==
=== Traditional sources of colours ===
The spring season, during which the weather changes, is believed to cause viral fever and cold. The playful throwing of natural coloured powders, called gulal has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of palash, neem, kumkum, haldi, bilva, and other medicinal herbs suggested by Āyurvedic doctors.

Many colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant-based sources of colours are:

==== Orange and red ====
The flowers of palash or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red sandalwood, dried hibiscus flowers, madder tree, radish, and pomegranate are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing lime with turmeric powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling saffron (kesar) in water.

==== Green ====
Mehendi and dried leaves of gulmohur tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as a source of green pigment.

==== Yellow ====

&quot;Haldi&quot; (turmeric) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with chickpea (gram) or other flour to get the right shade. Bael fruit, amaltas, species of chrysanthemums, and species of marigold are alternate sources of yellow.

==== Blue ====
Indigo plant, Indian berries, species of grapes, blue hibiscus, and jacaranda flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.

==== Magenta and purple ====
Beetroot is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.

==== Brown ====
Dried tea leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain clays are alternate source of brown.

==== Black ====
Species of grapes, fruits of amla (gooseberry) and vegetable carbon (charcoal) offer grey to black colours.

== Issues ==

=== Health impact ===
A 2007 study found that malachite green, a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.

Another 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labelling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several non-governmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.

These reports have galvanised a number of groups into promoting more natural celebrations of Holi. Development Alternatives, Delhi&#x27;s CLEAN India campaign, Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group, Pune, Society for Child Development through its Avacayam Cooperative Campaign have launched campaigns to help children learn to make their own colours for Holi from safer, natural ingredients. Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market &quot;herbal&quot; dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.

In urban areas, some people wear nose masks and sunglasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.

===Environmental impact===
An alleged environmental issue related to the celebration of Holi is the traditional Holika bonfire, which is believed to contribute to deforestation. According to a local tabloid, 30,000 bonfires burn every year during Holi, with each fire burning approximately of wood.

The use of heavy metal-based pigments during Holi is also reported to cause temporary wastewater pollution, with the water systems recovering to pre-festival levels within 5 days.

==Influence on other cultures==

Holi is celebrated as a social event in parts of the United States. For example, at Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Utah, &quot;NYC Holi Hai&quot; in Manhattan, New York and &quot;Festival of Colors: Holi NYC&quot; in New York City, New York.

===Holi-inspired events===
A number of Holi-inspired social events have also surfaced, particularly in Europe and the United States, often organised by companies as for-profit or charity events with paid admission, and with varying scheduling that does not coincide with the actual Holi festival. These have included Holi-inspired music festivals such as the Festival Of Colours Tour and Holi One (which feature timed throws of Holi powder), and 5K run franchises such as The Color Run, Holi Run and Color Me Rad, in which participants are doused with the powder at per-kilometre checkpoints. The BiH Color Festival is a Holi-inspired electronic music festival held annually in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In recent years, schools across Australia have also adopted Holi inspired fund raising activities which leverage fundraising platforms such as Australian Fundraising, School Fun Run, Colour Frenzy and Go Raise It Australia to conduct such events. New Zealand schools have also followed the trend with holi powder Colour Run fundraisers run by local company Go Raise It NZ.

There have been concerns that these events appropriate and trivialise aspects of Holi for commercial gain—downplaying or completely ignoring the cultural and spiritual roots of the celebration. Organisers of these events have argued that the costs are to cover various key aspects of their events, such as safe colour powders, safety and security, and entertainment.

<doc id="489576" wikidata="Q35757" url="?curid=489576" title="Láadan">
<text>Láadan () is a gynocentric constructed language created by Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982 to test the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, specifically to determine if development of a language aimed at expressing the views of women would shape a culture; a subsidiary hypothesis was that Western natural languages may be better suited for expressing the views of men than women. The language was included in her science fiction &quot;Native Tongue&quot; series. Láadan contains a number of words that are used to make unambiguous statements that include how one feels about what one is saying. According to Elgin, this is designed to counter male-centered language&#x27;s limitations on women, who are forced to respond &quot;I know I said that, but I meant this&quot;.

== Phonology ==

=== Tones ===
Láadan is a tonal language. It utilises two distinct tones:
* or , a short, medium or low tone, represented by a single unmarked vowel
* , a short, high tone, represented by a single marked vowel
The word &quot;Láadan&quot; has three syllables: &quot;lá-&quot; with the short vowel /a/ plus high tone; &quot;-a&quot; with the short vowel /a/ and no tone; and &quot;-dan&quot;. 

Láadan doesn&#x27;t allow any double (i.e. long) phonemes. Whenever two identical short vowels would occur side by side in a single morpheme, one of them has to be marked for high tone. When adding an affix would result in two identical vowels side by side, an epenthetic /h/ is inserted to prevent the forbidden sequence. The language will allow either or , but not *maa. These combinations can be described as:
* , a long, low-rising tone, represented by a double vowel, the second of which is marked
* , a long, high-falling tone, represented by a double vowel, the first of which is marked
Some people analyze these tone sequences as tonemic as well, for a total of four tones. By this analysis, the word &quot;Láadan&quot; would thus be considered to have two syllables, and /dan/.

Elgin preferred an analysis of the language as having no long vowels and a single tone, the high tone (distinguished from &quot;neutral, baseline pitch&quot;), but she acknowledged that linguists using other formalisms would be justified in saying that there are two tones, high and low (or unmarked or mid).

=== Vowels ===
Láadan has five vowels:
* &quot;a&quot;, an open back unrounded vowel (as English &quot;calm&quot;),
* &quot;e&quot;, an open-mid front unrounded vowel (as English &quot;bell&quot;),
* &quot;i&quot;, a near-close near-front unrounded vowel (as English &quot;bit&quot;),
* &quot;o&quot;, a close-mid back rounded vowel (as English &quot;home&quot;),
* &quot;u&quot;, a close back rounded vowel (as English &quot;boon&quot;).

=== Consonants ===
Láadan lacks the consonants . It uses &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;sh&quot; (), &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;y&quot; (), &quot;h&quot; with the same phonetic value as English. Three digraphs require further explanation:
* &quot;th&quot;, a voiceless dental fricative (always as in English &quot;think&quot;, never as &quot;then&quot;),
* &quot;zh&quot;, a voiced postalveolar fricative (as English &quot;pleasure&quot;),
* &quot;lh&quot;, a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (as Welsh ).

== Grammar ==

Most Láadan sentences contain three particles:

* The &quot;speech-act&quot; particlethis occurs at the beginning of the sentence and marks it as either a statement (), a question (), &quot;et cetera&quot;; in connected speech or writing, this particle is often omitted. They are:
*; : Indicates a declarative sentence (usually optional)
*; : Indicates a question
*; : Indicates a command; very rare, except to small children
*; : Indicates a request; this is the usual imperative/&quot;command&quot; form
*; : Indicates a promise
*; : Indicates a warning
* The grammatical tense particlethis occurs second in the sentence and marks it as either present tense (), past tense (), future tense () or hypothetical (); without the tense particle, the sentence is assumed to have the same tense as the previous sentence.
* The evidence particlethis occurs at the end of statements and indicates the trustworthiness of the statement. They are:
*; : Known to speaker because perceived by speaker, externally or internally
*; : Known to speaker because self-evident
*; : Perceived by speaker in a dream
*; : Assumed true by speaker because speaker trusts source
*; : Assumed false by speaker because speaker distrusts source; if evil intent by the source is also assumed, the form is 
*; : Imagined or invented by speaker, hypothetical
*; : Used to indicate that the speaker states a total lack of knowledge as to the validity of the matter

Láadan is a verb–subject–object (VSO) language. Verbs and adjectives are interchangeable. There are no articles, and the object is marked by the or suffix. The plural number is shown only by the prefix to the verb. The particle following a verb makes it negative. Separate clauses are joined by the particle .

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
OBJ:object
REQ:request
ST
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;

=== Morphology ===
Láadan has an agglutinative morphology, and uses a number of affixes to indicate various feelings and moods that many natural languages can only indicate by tone of voice, body language or circumlocution.

The &quot;speech-act&quot; particle, at the beginning of a sentence, can also carry several suffixes, which expand on the overall state of the sentence. For example, begins a statement, but begins a statement that is part of a narrative; begins a request made in pain; begins a question that is meant in jest.

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns in Láadan are built up from a number of constituent parts. The consonant &quot;l&quot; marks the first person, &quot;n&quot; the second person and &quot;b&quot; the third person. Usually, these are followed by the vowel &quot;e&quot;. The vowel &quot;a&quot; is used to designate someone who is loved ( is prefixed to describe someone who is despised). The suffix is used to mark a plural pronoun for numbers up to four, and for numbers beyond that. Therefore, means &quot;we, several beloved&quot;, and means &quot;they, many despised&quot;.

<doc id="489577" wikidata="Q948917" url="?curid=489577" title="Backhoe">
<text>A backhoe is a type of excavating equipment, or excavator, consisting of a digging bucket on the end of a two-part articulated arm. It is typically mounted on the back of a tractor or front loader, the latter forming a &quot;backhoe loader&quot; (a US term, but known as a &quot;JCB&quot; in Ireland and the UK). The section of the arm closest to the vehicle is known as the , while the section that carries the bucket is known as the dipper (or dipper-stick), both terms derived from steam shovels. The boom, which is the long piece of the backhoe arm attached to the tractor through a pivot called the king-post, is located closest to the cab. It allows the arm to pivot left and right, typically through a range of 180 to 200 degrees, and also enables lifting and lowering movements.

==Description==

The term &quot;backhoe&quot; refers to the action of the bucket, not its location on the vehicle. That is, a backhoe digs by drawing earth backwards, rather than lifting it with a forward motion like a person shovelling, a steam shovel, or a bulldozer. The buckets on some backhoes may be reconfigured facing forward, making them &quot;hoes&quot;.

A tractor-loader backhoe (TLB) is a tractor-like vehicle with a backhoe at the rear, a front loader on the other and a swivelling seat to position the operator facing whichever direction is needed at the time. In North America, this arrangement is often referred to as simply a backhoe, or when on a chassis originally derived from farm tractors, a tractor-loader backhoe. To differentiate, a backhoe on its own dedicated chassis may then be referred to as an excavator.

Backhoe loaders can be designed and manufactured from the start as such, or can be the result of a farm tractor equipped with a front end loader (FEL) and rear backhoe. Though similar looking, the purpose-designed backhoe loaders are much stronger, with the farm variation unsuitable for heavy work.

With the advent of hydraulic powered attachments such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the backhoe is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment serves as an effective tool carrier. Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine&#x27;s utilization on the job site. Backhoes are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Excavators that use a backhoe are sometimes called &quot;trackhoes&quot; by people who do not realize the name is due to the action of the bucket, not its location on a backhoe loader.

Backhoe loaders are general-purpose tools, and are being displaced to some extent by multiple specialist tools like the excavator and the speciality front-end loader, especially with the rise of the mini-excavator. On many job sites which would have previously seen a backhoe used, a skid-steer loader and a mini excavator will be used in conjunction to fill the backhoe&#x27;s role. However, backhoes are still in general use. The difference between the backhoe and the skid-steer loader, are that the backhoe has attachments back and front, where as the skid-steer loader only has front attachments, however, the attachment versatility on a skid-steer loader is much greater.

Sometimes a backhoe bucket is reversed to work in a power shovel configuration.

Sometimes a backhoe arm is used as a crane, by slinging the lifted object from the support linkages behind the scoop (advisably not from the teeth, preferably from a hook welded on a bucket, quick coupler or tiltrotator).

==History==

The backhoe swing frame was invented in 1947 by Vaino (pronounced &quot;Waino&quot;) J. Holopainen and Roy E. Handy Jr. The swing frame &quot;allowed the hydraulic digging arm to swing to the side to dump the bucket under US patent # 2,698,697&quot;. In April 1948 Wain-Roy Corporation sold the first hydraulic backhoe, mounted to a Ford Model 8N tractor, to the Connecticut Light and Power Company for $705. 

The first tractor-loader backhoe was a Wain-Roy backhoe mounted to a Frank G. Hough model &quot;HE&quot; in 1952 in Holden, Massachusetts, US, for the Holden Water Department. The F.G. Hough Company was a subsidiary of the International Harvester Company. By early 1954, two Hough &quot;Payloader&quot; model wheel loaders, the HE and the HF, were available with Wain-Roy backhoes. In 1954 the Wain-Roy Corporation negotiated a deal with IH for the Hough TLB full-scale production on several other models of Hough loaders.

In the same year, JCB launched the first European hydraulic loader, followed by a backhoe with a 180° slew, fitted to a tractor, in 1953. In 1957, Case developed the first integrated tractor backhoe loader at the Case New Holland plant in Burlington, Iowa, helping contractors complete their work more efficiently.

JCB introduced the first dedicated backhoe loader, incorporating the excavator and the major loader in a single, all-purpose tool.

In 1960, Vaino Holopainen was introduced as &quot;Mr. Backhoe&quot; to Henry Ford II. Wain-Roy continued to produce them for Ford until 1963, when Ford started making their own. Wain-Roy Corporation later bought the AC Anderson Company. Although the Wain-Roy Corporation no longer exists, the Wain-Roy product line of backhoe attachments and couplers is still available through the Woods Equipment Company of Rockford, Illinois, US. In 1965, Kelly G. Cunningham used the 7.6 Gravely Tractor to create the Terramite Model 1 compact backhoe, known as the T1.

Because of the long-time predominance of the JCB marque in the United Kingdom and Ireland, it has become a genericized trademark there, and backhoe-equipped diggers are commonly called &quot;JCBs&quot;, while the term &quot;backhoe&quot; as an excavator component is almost unknown to the general public in this context. The founder of the JCB company, Joseph Cyril Bamford, is the only Briton to be honored in the Association of Equipment Manufacturers Hall of Fame.

Backhoe sales in the United States have decreased in recent years due to advances in other technologies, like the compact track loader and compact excavator.

==Backhoe fade==
&quot;Backhoe fade&quot; or &quot;JCB fade&quot; is a term coined by the telecommunications field to refer to accidental damage or complete severing of a communications cable by a backhoe or similar construction activity.

The term is a play on other types of signal loss, especially on wireless networks. Most of these cause a reduction in the signal, such as rain fade. A cable subjected to &quot;backhoe fade&quot; is instead a sudden and initially inexplicable loss of signal experienced when a cable is accidentally dug up and damaged or cut.

<doc id="489580" wikidata="Q6603412" url="?curid=489580" title="List of Vancouver SkyTrain stations">
<text>The Vancouver SkyTrain is a three-line urban mass transit system in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, managed by TransLink. The Expo Line was built for the Expo 86 World&#x27;s Fair; the Millennium Line opened in 2002, followed by the Canada Line in 2009, which was built for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Expo and Millennium Lines are operated by the British Columbia Rapid Transit Company on behalf of TransLink. The Canada Line is owned by InTransitBC, and operated by ProTrans BC, an AtkinsRéalis company. The Expo and Millennium Lines use Bombardier&#x27;s Advanced Rapid Transit technology, while the Canada Line technology is provided by Hyundai Rotem. The SkyTrain is the oldest and longest fully automated driverless rapid transit system in the world.

The SkyTrain was conceived as a legacy project of Expo 86; its first line, the Expo Line, was finished in 1985, in time to showcase the fair&#x27;s theme: Transportation and Communication. The line connected Vancouver with the cities of Burnaby and New Westminster, with the terminus stations at Waterfront and New Westminster station. In 1989, the line was extended one station east to Columbia station. The Skybridge, the only cable-stayed bridge built for transit use in the world, was completed in 1990, extending the Expo Line eastward to the city of Surrey with the addition of Scott Road station. The line was extended eastward again with the opening of Gateway, Surrey Central, and King George stations in 1994.

TransLink, which took over BC Transit&#x27;s responsibility for the operation of the SkyTrain in 1998, proposed a two-phase expansion of the system: the first phase consisted of a new line from New Westminster to the Broadway campus of Vancouver Community College in Vancouver via Lougheed Town Centre in Burnaby. The second phase was a $730-million extension eastward from Lougheed Town Centre to Coquitlam Centre in Coquitlam via Port Moody and another extension westward from Vancouver Community College to Granville Street via the Broadway corridor. The expansion line, now known as the Millennium Line, began operating in 2002. The line connected to the Expo Line at Columbia and originally added eleven new stations to the system; the twelfth, Lake City Way, opened in 2003. The Millennium Line&#x27;s thirteenth station and current western terminus, VCC–Clark, opened in 2006. The second phase was subsequently cancelled, later revived and eventually branded the Evergreen Extension. The extension opened in 2016, expanding service into Coquitlam via Burnaby and Port Moody with 6 new stations, adding to the existing Millennium Line. The extension stretches from Lougheed Town Centre station to Lafarge Lake–Douglas station, which is located beside Lafarge Lake and across from the David Lam campus of Douglas College in Coquitlam City Centre.

In 2004, TransLink approved a line connecting Vancouver with Richmond and the Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The line, now known as the Canada Line, opened in 2009, a few months ahead of the 2010 Olympics. The line added 15 stations to the system, and has two branches that split off at Bridgeport; one branch heads south to the city of Richmond, while the other heads west toward the main terminal at YVR.

There are 54 stations on the SkyTrain system. 20 stations are served exclusively by the Expo Line, 14 exclusively by the Millennium Line, 15 exclusively by the Canada Line, 1 by both the Expo and Canada Lines, and 3 by both the Expo and Millennium Lines. Vancouver and Burnaby have a total of 31 stations, 20 and 11 respectively, consisting of 58 percent of the system&#x27;s stations. Commercial–Broadway was originally two separate stations—Broadway station and Commercial Drive station; Broadway was completed with the Expo Line, while Commercial Drive was completed with the Millennium Line. The stations combined in 2009 in order to avoid confusion with Broadway–City Hall. From the Millennium Line&#x27;s start of operation in 2002 until 2016, all Expo Line stations outside of Surrey were also serviced by the Millennium Line until TransLink changed the operating patterns of both lines. Since 2016, Braid and Sapperton have been serviced by the Expo Line instead of the Millennium Line via a branch from Columbia heading north towards Production Way–University, a major bus transfer point for Simon Fraser University&#x27;s Burnaby campus. The Millennium Line heads east from VCC–Clark to Larfarge Lake–Douglas, connecting with the Expo Line at Production Way–University and Lougheed Town Centre stations. Waterfront is the terminus for both the Expo and Canada Lines. Richmond–Brighouse and YVR–Airport are the outbound terminuses for the two Canada Line branches.

<doc id="489585" wikidata="Q1810468" url="?curid=489585" title="Kool (cigarette)">
<text>Kool (stylized as KOOL) is an American brand of menthol cigarette, currently owned and manufactured by ITG Brands LLC, a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco Company. Kool cigarettes sold outside of the United States are manufactured by British American Tobacco.

== History ==
In 1931, Brown and Williamson launched &quot;Penguin&quot; as an unfiltered 70-millimeter &quot;regular&quot; menthol cigarette, with a package featuring &quot;a Penguin with its beak raised and its heavy wings raised in a sort of mid-flourish.&quot; In 1933, the brand was renamed &quot;Kool&quot;, though it retained the as-yet unnamed penguin mascot.

Kool enjoyed continued success through the 1950s, with a 1953 Roper survey showing that two percent of white Americans and five percent of African Americans preferred the Kool brand.

Growing public concern about the health risks associated with smoking prompted Brown and Williamson responded to release filtered varieties of Kool: an 85-millimeter &quot;king-sized&quot; version in the 1960s, followed by a 100-millimeter or &quot;long&quot; version in the 1970s. The 1980s saw the introduction of Kool lights and a loss of market share to other menthol brands, such as Newport.

In 2003, Brown and Williamson purchased the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, making Kool a Reynolds brand. The iconic green and white pack, virtually unchanged for some seventy years, was overhauled, and the original unfiltered Kool cigarette was discontinued. These changes did little to boost sales.

In 2015 a merger between Reynolds American and the Lorillard Tobacco Company brought the Kool brand into the Imperial Tobacco Company portfolio of properties.

== Marketing ==

Kool cigarette advertising began with the character of &quot;Willie&quot; the penguin, who was portrayed as several different professions, among which were a doctor, a soldier and a chef. In the early 1950s, the company placed a number of decal signs at entrance doors reading &quot;Come in... it&#x27;s Kool inside&quot;, indicating that the space was air-conditioned.

In the early 1960s, the image of the cartoon penguin was no longer used, and Kool instead began marketing their cigarettes by linking the taste of menthol to outdoor scenes portraying water or snow. Elaine Devry and John Clarke (actor) featured in Kool&#x27;s advertisement at this time, as the female smoker whose day was improved by a passer-by who changed her car&#x27;s flat tire. This was decades before whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand exposed Brown and Williamson&#x27;s deliberate lacing of their tobacco with harmful substances.

In 1971, Kool initiated an advertising campaign where consumers could mail order a Snark sailboat with the Kool logo on the sail—for $88 (later $99) along with one Kool carton flap—including delivery. The sailboats retailed at the time for $120. As one of Kool&#x27;s highest scoring ads, the company received over 18,000 orders for &quot;Sea Snarks&quot; in 1971.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Kool sponsored jazz festivals and many advertisements from the era featured a musician or an actor, playing a saxophone. Also, Kool was notoriously targeted to African-Americans, as were many menthol cigarettes.
In 1975, Kool held a sweepstakes with a Rolls-Royce Corniche as the prize.

At one time also Kool sponsored a hot-air balloon, which went on tours.

== Sport sponsorship ==
Kool was the main sponsor of Team KOOL Green in the CART series from the 1997 season until the 2002 season. In 2002, after the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement passed, Kool cigarettes could not be displayed on the cars for the IRL&#x27;s Indianapolis 500, and the logo was replaced with 7-Eleven.

== Markets ==
Kool cigarettes are mainly sold in the United States, but also were or still are sold in Canada, Honduras, Antigua, Bahamas, Jamaica, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Japan and Australia. The Estonian Patent Office denied permission for the Kool trademark to be used in Estonia because the name means &quot;school&quot; in the Estonian language.

== Current varieties ==
Kool is available in the following styles in the United States:
* Green - Filter Kings &amp; Super Longs (formerly Full Flavor)
* Blue - Filter Kings &amp; Super Longs (100s) (formerly Milds)

In 2023, ITG Brands introduced four new non-menthols to prepare for a possible flavored tobacco ban by the FDA and to expand their sales to states that already have a ban in place. The green and blue boxes look identical to the menthol version to appeal to smokers who are used to the brand. 
* Green Non-Menthol - Filter Kings &amp; Super Longs (100s)
* Blue Non-Menthol - Filter Kings &amp; Super Longs (100s)
* Luxe Non-Menthol Bold - Filter Kings &amp; 100s
* Luxe Non-Menthol Smooth - Filter Kings &amp; 100s
Previously, Kool XL, a wider cigarette, was available.

<doc id="489586" wikidata="Q2513167" url="?curid=489586" title="Province of South Carolina">
<text>The Province of South Carolina, originally known as Clarendon Province, was a province of the Kingdom of Great Britain that existed in North America from 1712 to 1776. It was one of the five Southern colonies and one of the Thirteen Colonies in America of the British Empire. The monarch of Great Britain was represented by the Governor of South Carolina, until the colonies declared independence on July 4, 1776.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Carolina&quot; is taken from the Latin word for &quot;Charles&quot; (Carolus), honoring King Charles I, and was first named in the 1663 Royal Charter granting to Edward, Earl of Clarendon; George, Duke of Albemarle; William, Lord Craven; John, Lord Berkeley; Anthony, Lord Ashley; Sir George Carteret, Sir William Berkeley, and Sir John Colleton the right to settle lands in the present-day U.S. states of North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.

== History ==
Charles Town was the first settlement, established in 1670. King Charles II had given the land to a group of eight nobles called the lords proprietor; they planned for a Christian colony. Originally a single proprietary colony, the northern and southern sections grew apart over time, due partly to neglect by the legal heirs of the original lords proprietor. Dissent over the governance of the province led to the appointment of a deputy governor to administer the northern half of the Province of Carolina in 1691. The partition of the province into North and South Carolina became complete in 1712.

The Yamasee War (1715–1717) ravaged the back-country of the province. Complaints that the proprietors had not done enough to protect the provincials against either the Indians or the neighboring Spanish, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War (1702–1713), convinced many residents of the necessity of ending proprietary rule. A rebellion broke out against the proprietors in 1719. Acting on a petition of residents, King George I appointed the governor of South Carolina later in that year (the governors of North Carolina would continue to be appointed by the lords proprietor until 1729). After nearly a decade in which the British monarchy sought to locate and buy out the lords, both North and South Carolina became royal colonies in 1729.

== Government ==

The Court of King&#x27;s Bench and Common Pleas was founded c.1725, based in Charles Towne. List of Chief Justices:

<doc id="489589" wikidata="Q1889100" url="?curid=489589" title="University of Phoenix">
<text>University of Phoenix (UoPX) is a private for-profit university headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Founded in 1976, the university confers certificates and degrees at the certificate, associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degree levels. It is institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and has an open enrollment admissions policy for many undergraduate programs. The school is owned by Apollo Global Management and Vistria Group.

==History==
===Foundation and rapid growth (1970s–2000s)===
University of Phoenix was founded in 1976 by John Sperling and John D. Murphy. In 1980, it expanded to San Jose, California, and launched its online program in 1989. Much of UoPX&#x27;s revenue came from employers who were subsidizing the higher education of their managers. Academic labor underwent a process of unbundling, in which &quot;various components of the traditional faculty role (e.g., curriculum design) are divided among different entities, while others (e.g., research) are eliminated altogether&quot;.

In 1994, UoPX leaders made the parent company, Apollo Group, public. Its enrollment exceeded 100,000 students by 1999. Senator Tom Harkin, who chaired hearings on for-profit colleges, said, &quot;I think what really turned this company is when they started going to Wall Street.&quot; The sentiment was echoed by Murphy in his book &quot;Mission Forsaken: The University of Phoenix Affair with Wall Street&quot;. In 2004, Murphy thought that &quot;the University of Phoenix abandoned its founding mission of solely serving working adult learners to admit virtually anyone with a high school diploma or GED.&quot; In terms of revenue, UoPX began to rely less on corporate assistance and more on government funding. In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the school&#x27;s graduation rate had plummeted and that educational quality had eroded.

In 2000, the federal government fined the university $6 million for including study-group meetings as instructional hours. In 2002, the Department of Education relaxed requirements on instructional hours.

A 2003 lawsuit filed by two former university recruiters alleged that the school improperly obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in financial aid by paying its admission counselors based on the number of students they enrolled, a violation of the Higher Education Act. The university&#x27;s parent company settled by paying the government $67.5 million, plus $11 million in legal fees, without admitting any wrongdoing.

In 2004, the Department of Education alleged that UoPX violated Higher Education Act provisions that prohibit financial incentives to admission representatives, and pressured its recruiters to enroll students. UoPX disputed the findings but paid a $9.8 million fine as part of a settlement where it admitted no wrongdoing and was not required to return any financial aid funds. The university also paid $3.5 million to the Department of Labor to settle a violation of overtime compensation regarding hours worked by UoPX&#x27;s recruiters. UoPX settled a false claims suit for $78.5 million in 2009 over its recruiter-pay practices.

In 2008, Pereira O&#x27;Dell became the lead ad agency for UoPX for a reported $220 million. During the 2008–2009 fiscal year, the UoPX student body received more Pell Grant money ($656.9 million) than any other university and was the top recipient of student financial aid funds, receiving almost $2.48 billion. The university&#x27;s graduation rate was 17 percent, according to federal data that measures first-time, full-time (FTFT) undergraduate students who complete their programs at 150% of the normal time. University of Phoenix has been the largest recipient of federal G.I. Bill tuition benefits and the largest for-profit recipient by Pell Grant assistance funding.

In 2009, the Department of Education produced a report claiming the untimely return of unearned Title IV funds for more than 10 percent of sampled students. The report also expressed concern that some students register and begin attending classes before completely understanding the implications of enrollment, including their eligibility for student financial aid. In January 2010, the parent company Apollo Group was required to post a letter of credit for $125 million by January 30 of the same year. In 2010, UoPX came under government scrutiny after its Phoenix and Philadelphia campuses were found to have engaged in deceptive enrollment practices and fraudulent solicitation of FAFSA funds.

===Enrollment decline, transition to online courses (2010s)===
In 2010, UoPX claimed a peak enrollment of more than 470,000 students with a revenue of $4.95 billion. A 2010 report found that its online graduation rate at the time was only five percent. Later in the year, the university paid $154.5 million for 20-year naming rights for advertising purposes of the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The company terminated the naming rights deal on April 11, 2017, and on September 4, 2018, the stadium&#x27;s naming rights were acquired by State Farm. 

In August 2010, an ABC News investigation identified a UoPX recruiter who sought new students from Y-Haven, a homeless shelter in Cleveland, Ohio. Another University of Phoenix recruiter falsely claimed that the university&#x27;s Bachelor of Science in Education degree would be sufficient to qualify the television producer taking part in an investigation of the university to teach in Texas or New York.

In a December 2010 Bloomberg article, former UoPX senior vice president Robert W. Tucker noted that &quot;at critical junctures, [co-founder] John [Sperling] chose growth over academic integrity, which ultimately diminished a powerful educational model&quot;. At its peak, UoPX operated more than 500 campuses and learning sites. The university began to focus on opening new resource centers for online students to provide spaces for alumni to network and current students to seek assistance from professors and peers.

In August 2011, Apollo Group announced it would buy 100% of Carnegie Learning to accelerate its efforts to incorporate adaptive learning into its academic platform. Controversies concerned its marketing and recruitment practices, instructional hours, its status as one of the top recipients of student aid, and a student body carrying the most student debt of any college.

In 2013, the Department of Defense ended its contract with University of Phoenix for military bases in Europe. U.S. military commanders at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, allowed UoPX representatives to advertise and place promotional materials in high-traffic areas. Access was provided in exchange for the university funding events on army bases, including Easter egg hunts and welcome briefings for newly assigned soldiers.

Murphy wrote in &quot;Mission Forsaken&quot; (2013) about the school&#x27;s degeneration from a provider of working adult continuing education programs to a money making machine whose sole criterion for admission was eligibility for federally funded student loans.

In 2014 the Department of Education&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General demanded records from the school and Apollo Group going back to 2007 &quot;related to marketing, recruitment, enrollment, financial aid, fraud prevention, [and] student retention&quot;. In the same year, Arthur Green, a former UoPX enrollment advisor, sued the school and claimed that it had violated the US False Claims Act. According to Green, he was fired for uncovering billions of dollars in fraud. Five years later, the case was dismissed in 2019 after the US Department of Justice under William Barr decided not to take the case and the records were sealed.

In 2014, UoPX partnered with 47 historically black colleges and universities to offer UoPX classes that transfer to these institutions. 142,500 students enrolled on August 31, 2016, and 119,938 during the 2016–17 school year. During this time, the university continued to spend tens of millions of dollars on marketing and advertising, including $27 million on internet paid search advertising. The Brookings Institution reported that UoPX spent $76 million on advertising in 2017.

From 2009 to 2015, University of Phoenix received an estimated $1.2 billion of federal money issued through the G.I. Bill. The university enrolled almost 50,000 such students in 2014, twice as many as any other institution.

In October 2015, the Department of Defense suspended the school&#x27;s ability to recruit on U.S. military bases and receive federal funding for educating members of the U.S. military. After protest from senators John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Lamar Alexander, the suspension was lifted in January 2016.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began investigating the university in 2015 in regard to an advertising campaign it ran from 2012 to 2014. On December 10, 2019, UoPX agreed to pay a settlement of $191 million related to charges that it recruited students using misleading advertisements. NPR reported the amount included $50 million in cash (which was later distributed as checks to more than 100,000 former students), as well as a $141 million cancellation in student debt, though the cancellations &quot;won&#x27;t affect student borrowers&#x27; obligations for federal or private loans&quot;. The institution admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which was at the time the largest FTC settlement against a for-profit school.

In 2015, MarketWatch reported that UoPX students owed more than $35 billion in student loan debt, the most of any US college at the time.

Between 2010 and 2016, enrollment declined by more than 70 percent amid multiple investigations, lawsuits, and controversies.

In 2016, Apollo Education Group shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit against the corporation, arguing that it withheld information leading to large losses in stock prices. Several of the allegations related to UoPX&#x27;s recruiting of military personnel and veterans.

=== Ownership by Apollo Global Management (2016–present)===

In February 2016, Apollo Group announced its sale to a private investment group comprising Apollo Global Management, the Vistria Group, and the Najafi Companies, for $1 billion. Former U.S. Department of Education deputy secretary Anthony W. Miller, partner and chief operating officer of Vistria, became chairman. The sale was approved by both the Department of Education and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). In December 2016, the U.S. Department of Education approved of the sale of Apollo Education Group to Apollo Global Management. The company provided a letter of credit for up to $385 million. In February 2017, after the takeover by Apollo Global Management, UoPX laid off 170 full-time faculty members. According to the 2019 academic report, degreed enrollment was 87,400.

In March 2020, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that they had suspended certification for G.I. Bill funds for new students at UoPX, citing a history of deceptive recruiting practices. The VA withdrew its threat of sanctions in July 2020. The same year, UoPX received $6.5 million in CARES Act funding and $7.4 million in the second round of COVID-19 relief funds. In 2020, UoPX began experimenting with micro-campuses, giving the centers a &quot;WeWork vibe&quot;.

In 2021, Bloomberg reported that Apollo&#x27;s higher education investment had gained about 50 percent in value: from its $634 million initial investment to $956 million. UoPX also received $3.4 million in aid through the American Rescue Plan.

In 2021, UoPX continued to close campuses, including Atlanta and Salt Lake City. The Phoenix, Arizona campus was the only location accepting new in-person students. UoPX would later announce that only one campus would remain open in 2025.

The University of Phoenix was one of 153 institutions included in student loan cancellation due to alleged fraud. The class action was brought by a group of more than 200,000 student borrowers in 2019, assisted by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, part of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. A settlement was approved in August 2022, stating that the schools on the list were included &quot;substantial misconduct by the listed schools, whether credibly alleged or in some instances proven.&quot; In April 2023, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the settlement and allowed to proceed the debt cancellation due to alleged fraud.

On September 20, 2023, the Biden administration canceled nearly $37 million of federal student loan debt for more than 1,200 borrowers who were enrolled at the University of Phoenix between September 21, 2012, and December 31, 2014.

In April 2024, the University of Phoenix and California Attorney General Rob Bonta resolved an investigation into UoPX&#x27;s use of military student recruitment tactics from 2012 through 2015 via settlement, where the university agreed to pay out $4.5 million in penalties and other fees.

====Multiple acquisition proposals====

Apollo Global Management has been attempting to sell the University of Phoenix since 2021. A number of schools and systems were approached, including Tuskegee University, UMass Global, the University of Arkansas System, and the University of Idaho (U of I).

In April 2023, the University of Arkansas System Board voted against the proposed sale.

In May 2023, the University of Idaho announced a deal to acquire the University of Phoenix. The total cost would be $685 million raised through bonds. A new entity was created for the purchase by U of I ultimately named Four Three Education. The Higher Learning Commission approved a &quot;continuation of accreditation&quot; for the school under Four Three Education. The Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (U of I&#x27;s accreditors) completed a review of the potential acquisition and continued accreditation, determining that the deal “does not constitute a substantive change” for the University of Idaho.

Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador sued the Idaho State Board of Education, alleging that the acquisition was being pursued in violation of Idaho&#x27;s Open Meetings Law. The case was brought to trial and dismissed in January 2024. Labrador appealed the decision, taking the case to the Idaho Supreme Court. In December 2024, the Idaho Supreme Court ruled in favor of Labrador, overturning the Ada County District Court&#x27;s initial decision. While the Supreme Court did not determine that the Idaho State Board of Education violated the Open Meetings Law, it did determine &quot;that the district court applied the wrong legal standard on summary judgement due to a misinterpretation of the relevant statute.&quot; The case is scheduled to return to the lower court.

In March 2024, the Idaho legislature passed a resolution urging the Idaho State Board of Education to overturn its May 2023 vote endorsing the acquisition. Later in the month, Idaho&#x27;s Senate State Affairs Committee brought SB 1450 to the floor, which intended to restructure Four Three Education into an independent body corporate politic rather than a not-for-profit, but the Idaho Senate narrowly voted the bill down, with 14 yes votes to 19 no votes. After passing the May 31st deadline of the original purchase agreement, both sides agreed to an extension, creating a new end date of June 10, 2025. In the agreement, Phoenix will reimburse the U of I $5 million, covering some of the legal fees related to due diligence of the purchase agreement. A non-exclusivity structure was also agreed upon, where Phoenix would be allowed to either seek a new buyer or undergo an initial public offering during negotiations. If Phoenix does not come to an agreement with U of I by the deadline, the university owes the U of I another $5 million. If Phoenix is bought by another school or seeks an IPO, it agreed to pay the U of I $15 million as a &quot;break-up fee&quot;.

==Academics==
UoPX has an open admissions policy by which most of its undergraduate programs are accessible to anyone with a high school diploma, GED, or their equivalent. Prior to 2010, the university recruited students using high-pressure sales tactics, including assertions that classes were filling fast, by admissions counselors who are paid, in part, based on their success in recruiting students. The university recruits students and obtains financial aid on their behalf, such as the Academic Competitiveness Grant, Federal Pell Grant, National Science &amp; Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (National SMART Grant), Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, Federal Perkins Loan, and the Wounded Warrior Project. In the 2017–18 award year, 51,990 UoPX received the Federal Pell Grant.

Besides postsecondary degree-level programs, the school offers continuing education courses for teachers and practitioners, professional development courses for companies, and specialized courses of study for military personnel. Students spend 20 to 24 hours with an instructor during each course, and are required to collaborate on learning team projects.

Students have access to class-specific online resources, which include an electronic library of textbooks and other course materials. Some academics and former students argue the abbreviated courses and the use of learning teams result in an inferior education. UoPX has been criticized for lack of academic rigor; Henry M. Levin, a professor of higher education at Teachers College at Columbia University, called its business degree an &quot;MBA Lite&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve looked at [its] course materials. It&#x27;s a very low level of instruction.&quot; The university&#x27;s &quot;corporate articulation agreements&quot; provide an alternative assessment program for people working at other companies to earn college credit for training they have completed at their jobs. To qualify for college credit, students either write an &quot;experiential essay&quot; or create a professional training portfolio, the latter of which is a collection of documents such as transcripts from other schools, certificates, licenses, workshops or seminars.

UoPX has been regionally accredited since 1978 by the HLC. In May 2013, the university&#x27;s accreditation status was placed on &quot;notice&quot; for a period of two years (with allowed retention of their regional accreditation) by the HLC, due to &quot;insufficient autonomy relative to its parent corporation&quot;. The HLC Institutional Actions Council First Committee (IACFC) concerns centered on the university&#x27;s governance, student assessment, and faculty scholarship in relation to Ph.D. programs. In June 2015, the HLC determined that the University of Phoenix had resolved those concerns.

University of Phoenix has 18 programs with business, healthcare, nursing, counseling and education having programmatic or specialized accreditation. Some individual colleges within University of Phoenix hold specialty accreditation or are pre-accredited by accrediting agencies that are recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.
* School of Business accreditation through the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) including an Associate of Arts with a concentration in accounting or business fundamentals, a Bachelor of Science in business, a Master of Business Administration and a Doctor of Management. Because UoPX&#x27;s business programs are not accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), some companies will not provide tuition reimbursement for employees attending the university.
* College of Education Master of Arts in Education for Elementary, Secondary and Special Education as well as a Master of Arts in Administration and Supervision is accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.
* College of Nursing B.S. and M.S. degree programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.

* College of Social SciencesThe Master of Science in Counseling program in Community Counseling (Phoenix and Tucson campuses only), the Master of Science in Counseling program in Mental Health Counseling (Utah campuses only), and the Master of Science in Counseling program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling (Phoenix and Tucson campuses only) are accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs.

===Student demographics===

The 2020 Academic Annual Report for UoPX indicated women make up two-thirds of the student body, the average student age is 37, and more than 83 percent of its students are employed while in school. The 2020 report also noted that 21% of the student body were affiliated with the military, of which 41% are women. 26% of 2020 graduates were military-affiliated graduates.

In 2020–21, 1,316 students used Department of Defense Tuition Assistance and 7,380 students used G.I. Bill funds. University of Phoenix has been a partner of U.S. Army University and has had a presence at a few military bases.

===Student outcomes===
In 2016, a Brookings Institution study estimated University of Phoenix&#x27;s five-year student loan default rate at 47 percent. The College Navigator lists University of Phoenix&#x27;s overall graduation rate at 15 percent. According to the College Scorecard, of student debtors two years into repayment, 32 percent were in forbearance, 28 percent were not making progress, 13 percent were in deferment, 11 percent defaulted, 7 percent were making progress, 5 percent were delinquent, 2 percent were paid in full, and 1 percent were discharged.

===Rankings===
UoPX was ranked 386th out of 391 schools in the 2021 &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; list of national universities. The university is ranked #331-440 in the 2022 edition of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; National Universities.

==Ownership and leadership==
UoPX is a subsidiary of Apollo Global Management and Vistria Group. The president is Chris Lynne and the chief academic officer is John Woods. Lynne previously worked at Arthur Andersen, Education Management Corporation, Northcentral University, and HotChalk. Woods has a PhD in higher education administration from Bowling Green State University.

===Faculty===
The institution depends almost entirely on contingent faculty: about 97 percent of Phoenix instructors teach part-time, compared to 47 percent nationwide. This reliance on part-time faculty has been criticized by regulators and academic critics. Most of the classes are centrally crafted and standardized to ensure consistency and to maximize profits. No faculty members get tenure. Adjuncts earn approximately $1000–$2000 per course. Approximately 21 cents of every tuition dollar is spent on instruction.

According to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the student to faculty ratio is 110 to 1 in the Arizona segment. The university reported 76 full-time and 3,143 part-time faculty in its Arizona segment; full-time faculty make up 2 percent of the total faculty.

==Alumni and affiliations==
Phoenix alumni in the government sector include Howard Schmidt, Mary Peters (1994), and Brad Dee (1991). In the private sector, alumni include former MBA Chair at the Forbes School of Business &amp; Technology and radio host Diane Hamilton. In military and law enforcement, alumni include Lisa Franchetti, Kirkland H. Donald and Harold Hurtt (1991). Former MSNBC anchor and a host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Early Today&quot; Christina Brown is also an alumna of the university.

Athletes who have earned degrees from the university include Shaquille O&#x27;Neal (2005), Lisa Leslie, Michael Russell (2012), and Larry Fitzgerald (2016). Fitzgerald graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree shortly before his 33rd birthday (he began college in 2002 at the University of Pittsburgh) and was a spokesman for UoPX.

Several American policymakers have been affiliated with University of Phoenix and Apollo Education. Former secretary of the Department of Education, Margaret Spellings, is a member of the Apollo Group Board of Directors. Jane Oates, a former staffer for Senator Ted Kennedy and the Department of Labor, became the Apollo Group&#x27;s vice president for external relations in 2013. Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s close friendship with Sperling has been documented by Suzanne Mettler in &quot;Degrees of Inequality.&quot; University of Phoenix has community partnerships with Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the American Red Cross, and the Junior League. In 2016, University of Phoenix partnered with the ASIS Foundation to provide scholarships for students studying for security-related degrees. In March 2016, the first ten scholarship recipients were announced. In 2017, the Vistria Group was part of the deal with Apollo Global Management to take over the schools. Vistria included two friends of Barack Obama: Miller and Martin Nesbitt. In 2019, the Apollo Education Group was the third largest higher education lobby, and has 18 lobbyists at the federal level. In 2021, UoPX demanded that the Republican Attorneys General Association refund a donation of more than $50,000 after the organization was allegedly involved in instigating the 2021 United States Capitol attack.
