<text>Andy Hollis is an American video game designer, programmer and producer, mainly known for his flight simulators. He was one of the founding members of MicroProse.

==Video game development==
He began his career at MicroProse Software, where he was responsible for games such as &quot;Kennedy Approach&quot;, &quot;Gunship&quot;, &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle II&quot;, &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; and &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle III&quot;, as well as science fiction titles &quot;Lightspeed&quot; and &quot;Hyperspeed&quot;.

In 1993, Hollis joined Origin Systems, where he was responsible for creating games for Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;Jane&#x27;s Combat Simulations&quot; brand. Among the simulations created at Origin are &quot;AH-64D Longbow&quot;, &quot;Longbow 2&quot; and &quot;Jane&#x27;s F-15&quot;. In 1996, GameSpot named him as the number five in their listing of the Most Influential People in Computer Gaming, &quot;honored for helping to bring back serious flight simulations that don&#x27;t alienate beginners.&quot;
When Origin changed its focus to online games, he moved around within Electronic Arts and was working on NASCAR games and a Harry Potter online game.

He returned to Origin in 2003 after two years of retirement, where he oversaw the development of &quot;Ultima X&quot;, which was cancelled before release in 2004. Later, he served as president of Fastlane Games, Inc., working on the development of a massively multiplayer online game for NCsoft before retiring again in 2006.

<text>William Edmund Newton Sinclair (June 28, 1873 – November 26, 1947), known as W. E. N. Sinclair, was a Canadian barrister, solicitor and interim leader of the Ontario Liberal Party.

==Background==
Sinclair was born in Whitby Township, Ontario, the son of John Sinclair, and was educated at Toronto University, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law. In 1907, he married Ella Minerva Montgomery; he married Edna Worden in 1918 after his first wife&#x27;s death.

==Politics==
Sinclair was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1911 provincial election but was defeated in 1914.

He returned to politics in the 1917 federal election on conscription (see Conscription Crisis of 1917), Sinclair ran on as part of the anti-conscription &quot;Laurier Liberals&quot; but was again defeated.

He returned to provincial politics and was elected again to the Ontario legislature in the 1919 provincial election as the MLA for the riding of Ontario South.

Sinclair ran for the leadership of the party in the 1922 leadership convention, but lost to Wellington Hay. Hay resigned following a disastrous election result, and Sinclair served as interim leader of the Ontario Liberal Party from 1923 to 1930 and also as Leader of the Opposition in the provincial legislature. He was interim leader for that length of time (and through the elections of 1926 and 1929) because of the party&#x27;s state of disorganization and inability to hold a proper leadership convention.

The Liberals remained at the 14 seats they had in 1926, and dropped to 13 seats in the 1929 election. Sinclair initially decided to run for the permanent leadership in 1930, but because of the party&#x27;s failure to make gains during his tenure, he attracted little support, and withdrew before balloting began. He remained Leader of the Opposition until the 1934 election because the newly elected leader, Mitchell Hepburn, did not have a seat in the provincial legislature. Sinclair was re-elected in the 1934 election that brought the Liberals to power but Hepburn, the new Premier of Ontario, did not appoint him to Cabinet. Sinclair sat as a government backbencher for three years and then retired from the legislature at the 1937 provincial election.

In the 1945 federal election, Sinclair was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the Liberal Party of Canada. He died in office in 1947.

Sinclair also served as mayor of Oshawa from 1910 to 1911, in 1915 and from 1932 to 1934.

<text>Điện Biên () is a province in the Northwest region of Vietnam. It is bordered by Lai Châu to the northeast, Sơn La to the southeast, Pu&#x27;er City, Yunnan, China, to the northwest, and Phongsaly province in Laos to the west. The province covers an area of about and as of 2022 it had a population of 635,920 people.

==History==
The name &quot;Điện Biên&quot; means &quot;stable frontier&quot; (referring to Điện Biên&#x27;s location on the border between Lan Xang and Vietnam). Điện Biên has various ancient monuments including the caves Thẩm Khương, as well as Thẩn Búa in Tuần Giáo. The original settlers were the Ai Lao or Tai people who are a direct ancestor of Lao people in Laos today. The names of some villages and towns still use words of Tai origin, such as Mường (city) and Tham (cave).

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Lự in Mường Thanh were the most developed in the area and controlled Sìn Hồ, Mường Lay, and Tuần Giáo.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, Tai people (not to be confused with the Thai people of Thailand) from Mường Ôm and Mường Ai occupied Mường Lò in Nghĩa Lộ and Mường Thanh in Điện Biên. They eventually gained control of the whole area between Mường Lò and Mường Thanh (Điện Biên).

== Places ==
Chua ta cave: Located at an altitude of nearly 1,000m above sea level, in a limestone mountain range with a geological tectonic process of millions of years, Tham Khen cave in Muong Dun commune, Tua Chua district has also been recognized by the Ministry of Culture. Sports and Tourism ranked national relics and scenic spots according to decision No. 3086/QD-BVHTTDL dated October 27, 2020. In addition to being unique like other caves, Chua Ta cave also has two typical types of ecosystems: Limestone mountain ecosystem and cave ecosystem. This place converges the diverse properties of nature.

==Climate==
Điện Biên province has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;).


==Administrative divisions==
Điện Biên is subdivided into 10 district-level sub-divisions:

They are further subdivided into five commune-level towns (or townlets), 116 rural communes, and nine wards.

<text>&#x27; (Old Norse and , plural &#x27;) is the name the Norse Greenlanders used for the peoples they encountered in North America (Canada and Greenland). In surviving sources, it is first applied to the Thule people, the proto-Inuit group with whom the Norse coexisted in Greenland after about the 13th century. In the sagas, it is also used for the peoples of the region known as Vinland whom the Norse encountered and fought during their expeditions there in the early 11th century.

==Etymology==
The word may be related to the Old Norse word , meaning &quot;dried skin&quot;, in reference to the animal pelts worn by the Inuit. William Thalbitzer (1932: 14) speculated that might have been derived from the Old Norse verb , meaning &quot;bawl, shout, or yell&quot;. In modern Icelandic, means &quot;barbarian&quot;, whereas the Danish descendant, , means &quot;weakling&quot;.

The term is thought to have first been used by in his work , also called &quot;The Book of the Icelanders&quot;, written well after the period in which Norse explorers made their first contacts with indigenous Americans. By the time these sources were recorded, was the common term Norse Greenlanders used for the Thule people, the ancestors to the modern Inuit. The Thule first arrived in Greenland from the North American mainland in the 13th century and were thereafter in contact with the Greenlanders. The &quot;Greenlanders&#x27; Saga&quot; and the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, which were written in the 13th century, use this same term for the people of the area known as Vinland whom the Norse met in the early 11th century. The word subsequently became well known, and has been used in the English language since the 18th century.

&quot;Kalaallit&quot;, the name of the largest ethnic group of Greenlandic Inuit, is probably derived from &quot;skræling&quot;. In 1750, Paul Egede mentions that the Inuit used &quot;Inuit&quot; among themselves, but used Kalaallit when speaking to non-Inuit, stating that this was the term used by Norse settlers.

==Norse exploration of the New World==

Norse exploration of the New World began with the initial sighting of North America by an Icelander named Bjarni Herjólfsson, who spotted land after drifting off course on a journey to Greenland in 985 or 986. 
His voyage piqued the interest of later explorers including Leif Eriksson, who would explore and name the areas of Helluland, Markland and Vinland.

== First contact ==

Leif laid the groundwork for later colonizing efforts by establishing a foothold on Vinland, where he constructed some &quot;large houses&quot;. Upon his return to Greenland,

Thorvald had the first contact with the native population which would come to be known as the &quot;skrælings&quot;. After attacking and killing eight of the natives, they were attacked beside their beached ships, which they defended:

== Thorfinn Karlsefni ==

Thorfinn Karlsefni was the first Norse explorer to attempt to truly colonize the newly discovered Vinland, on the same site as his predecessors Thorvald and Leif Eriksson. According to the Saga of Erik the Red, he set sail with three ships and 140 men.

Upon reaching Vinland, their intended destination, they found the now famous grapes and self-sown wheat for which the land was named. They spent a very hard winter at this site, barely surviving by fishing, hunting game inland, and gathering eggs on the island. The following summer they sailed to the island of Hóp where they had the first peaceful interactions with the native people, with whom they traded. Thorfinn forbade his men to trade their swords and spears, so they mainly exchanged red cloth for pelts. They described the aboriginal inhabitants:

Shortly thereafter, the Norsemen were attacked by natives frightened by a bull that broke loose from the Norse encampment. They were forced to retreat to a more defensible location before engaging their attackers; at the end of the battle two of his men had been slain, while &quot;many of the natives&quot; were killed. As with any inhabited foreign land, Thorfinn and his men realized that

After this adventure, they returned to Greenland. Their three-year excursion would be the longest lasting known European colony in the New World, until Columbus&#x27;s voyages nearly 500 years later initiated full-scale European conquest of the Americas.

==Inuit folktales of the Norse==
There are also accounts from the Inuit:

Kavdlunait (plural) was the Inuit word for foreigner or European. Compare modern Greenlandic &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dane&quot;), formerly spelled &quot;ĸavdlunâĸ&quot;.

<text>The Lusatian culture existed in the later Bronze Age and early Iron Age (1300–500 ) in most of what is now Poland and parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, eastern Germany and western Ukraine. It covers the Periods Montelius III (early Lusatian culture) to V of the Northern European chronological scheme. It has been associated or closely linked with the Nordic Bronze Age. Hallstatt influences can also be seen particularly in ornaments (fibulae, pins) and weapons.

==Origins==
The Lusatian culture developed as the preceding Trzciniec culture experienced influences from the Tumulus culture of the Middle Bronze Age, essentially incorporating the local communities into the socio-political network of Iron Age Europe. It formed part of the Urnfield systems, origin of the Celts and Romans, found from eastern France, southern Germany and Austria to Hungary and the Nordic Bronze Age in northwestern Germany and Scandinavia. It was followed by the Billendorf culture of the Early Iron Age in the West. In Poland, the Lusatian culture is taken have spanned part of the Iron Age as well (there is only a terminological difference) and was succeeded in Montelius VIIbc in the northern ranges around the mouth of Vistula by the Pomeranian culture spreading south.

&#x27;Lusatian-type&#x27; burials were first described by the German pathologist and archaeologist Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902). The name refers to the Lusatia area in eastern Germany (Brandenburg and Saxony) and western Poland. Virchow identified the pottery artifacts as &#x27;pre-Germanic&#x27; but refused to speculate on the ethnic identity of their makers. The Polish archeologist Józef Kostrzewski, who started in 1934 to conduct extensive excavations of a Lusatian settlement of Biskupin, hypothesised that the Lusatian culture was a predecessor of later cultures that belonged to the early Slavs. Modern archeologists, such as both K. Godłowski and P. Kaczanowski, hold the view that the ethnic geography of Bronze Age Central Europe then included peoples whose languages and ethnic identity are simply unknown.

==Culture==
Burial was by cremation; inhumations are rare. The urn is usually accompanied by numerous (up to 40) secondary vessels. Metal grave gifts are sparse, but there are numerous hoards (such as Kopaniewo, Pomerania) that contain rich metalwork, both bronze and gold (hoard of Eberswalde, Brandenburg). Graves containing moulds (like at Bataune, in Saxony) and tuyeres attest to the production of bronze tools and weapons at the village level. The &#x27;royal&#x27; tomb of Seddin, Brandenburg, Germany, covered by a large earthen barrow, contained Mediterranean imports like bronze vessels and glass beads. Cemeteries can be quite large and contain thousands of graves.

Well-known settlements include Biskupin, in Poland, and Buch, near Berlin. There are both open villages and fortified settlements (&quot;burgwall&quot; or &quot;gord&quot;) on hilltops or in swampy areas. The ramparts were constructed of wooden boxes filled with soil or stones.

Its economy was mainly based on arable agriculture, as is attested by numerous storage pits. Wheat (emmer) and six-row barley formed the basic crops, together with millet, rye and oats, peas, broad beans, lentils, and gold of pleasure (Camelina sativa). Flax was grown, and remains of domesticated apples, pears, and plums have been found. Cattle and pigs were the most important domestic animals, followed by sheep, goats, horses, and dogs. Pictures on Iron Age urns from Silesia attest horse riding, but horses were used to draw chariots as well. Hunting was practiced, as bones of red and roe deer, boar, bison, elk, hare, fox, and wolf attest, but it did not provide much of the meat consumed. The numerous frog bones found at Biskupin may indicate that frogs&#x27; legs were eaten as well.

<doc id="488331" wikidata="Q7177331" url="?curid=488331" title="Peter Tinniswood">
<text>Peter Tinniswood (21 December 1936 – 9 January 2003) was an English radio and TV comedy scriptwriter, and author of a series of popular novels. He was born in Liverpool, but grew up above a dry cleaner&#x27;s on Eastway in Sale, Cheshire.

==Early career==
Tinniswood attended Sale Boys&#x27; Grammar School. His career began in journalism. He spent four years in Sheffield from 1958, first working for &quot;The Star&quot;, and then for the &quot;Sheffield Telegraph&quot;, where he was a leader writer and specialised in feature writing. He won widespread admiration for a week-long series &quot;Travels with a Donkey&quot;, an account of a tramp round the Peak District with a reluctant donkey.

==Television and radio==

In 1964, Tinniswood collaborated with his long-term writing partner David Nobbs on the BBC sketch show &quot;The Frost Report&quot; and the comedy &quot;Lance At Large&quot;, a sitcom starring Lance Percival in which Percival&#x27;s character, Alan Day, was involved in different scenarios and meeting different people in each episode. The short-lived ITV series &quot;Never Say Die&quot; (1970) drew on Tinniswood&#x27;s days as a hospital porter. Set in Victoria Memorial Hospital, the show derived much of its comedy from the interactions between patients and staff. It starred Reginald Marsh and Patrick Newell. 
Tinniswood based the BBC comedy &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know You Cared&quot; (1975–1979) on his novels. Featuring the Brandons, a dour northern family, the programme ran until 1979, and featured Liz Smith, Robin Bailey, John Comer and Stephen Rea. In 1980, the BBC produced a series based on other Tinniswood books, featuring the character the Brigadier, an erstwhile cricketer and latterly raconteur, played by Robin Bailey. Some of the stories were adapted for BBC Radio 4. The series was remade in 1985 for Channel 4.

For ITV in 1983, Tinniswood wrote &quot;The Home Front&quot;, again set in the north of England. It starred Brenda Bruce as Mrs Place, a nosey, arrogant mother who lorded it over her three children. Two years later ITV produced &quot;Mog&quot;, based on Tinniswood&#x27;s 1970 novel and starring Enn Reitel as the title character. The episodes were written by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, but it was not a success. Also in 1985, was &quot;South Of The Border&quot; starring Brian Glover as Edgar Rowley, a Yorkshireman forced to migrate to the south of England.

In later years, Tinniswood&#x27;s output was mostly for Radio 4 and included the continuing adventures of Uncle Mort and Carter Brandon in &quot;Uncle Mort&#x27;s North Country&quot;, &quot;Uncle Mort&#x27;s South Country&quot; and &quot;Uncle Mort&#x27;s Celtic Fringe&quot; and a series about poacher Winston Hayballs, his &quot;bit of fluff&quot; Nancy and her family adapted from his novel &quot;Winston&quot;. Liz Goulding, his second wife, played Rosie.

A lifelong pipe smoker, Peter Tinniswood died of throat cancer at the age of 66. Since his death, the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain and the Society of Authors have jointly administered in his memory the annual Tinniswood Award, to honour the best original radio drama script broadcast in the UK during the previous year, with a prize of £3,000 for the winner.

<text>Kyzyl ( ) is the capital city of the Republic of Tuva within the Russian Federation. Kyzyl&#x27;s population is approximately 

==History==

The city was founded in 1914 as Belotsarsk. It was renamed Hem-Beldir from 1918 to 1926. When the city was the capital of Tannu Tuva, it was named Kyzyl Hoto. In September 2014, Kyzyl celebrated its 100th anniversary as a city.

The city was founded in 1914 by Russian settlers immediately after the creation of the Uryankhay Krai (a protectorate of the Russian Empire), and called Belotsarsk.

In 1918, in connection with the communist revolution and the anti-tsarist movement, it was renamed to Hem-Beldir (Tuv.: &quot;confluence of rivers&quot;), and in 1926, to Kyzyl (Tuv.: &quot;red&quot;).

Between 1921 and 1944, the city was the capital of Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic. From 1944 to 1961, it was the capital of the RSFSR&#x27;s Tuvan Autonomous Oblast. From 1961 to 1991, it was the capital of the Tuvan ASSR, and since 1991, the capital of the Republic of Tyva.

Settlers began to lay a new city in the village of Vilany. Technological engineer K.V. Goguntsov and topographer M. Ya. Kryuchkov arrived in February 1914. Kryuchkov drew a general plan of the city of Belotsarsk (fund 123, inventory 2, file 21), which can still be seen in the layout of central Kyzyl today. The city plan enumerated the land plots and named their owners. In May 1914, the head of the Russian population in Uryankhai approved the draft rules on the allotment of land plots and the organization of a committee for the improvement of the future city. The very first plots were allocated for houses of officials, administration, homes of honorary Uryankhs, a treasury, post and telegraph offices, and the state fire shed.

The city was built by recruited workers from Krasnoyarsk, Minusinsk, Tomsk, and other cities of Siberia; Tuvan farm laborers; and Russian workers who fled from gold mines because of difficult working and living conditions.

On 4 July 1915, the Commissioner for the Uryankhay Krai, V. Yu. Grigoriev, wrote a letter to the Head of the Russian population in the Uryankhay Krai, requesting that a museum be constructed in the city of Belotsarsk (fund 123, inventory 2, file 53, sheets 25–26).

At the IV Uryankhay Regional Congress on March 11, 1918, a decree was issued to rename Belotsarsk to Uryankhaysk. However, this name did not stick, as many still called the city Belotsarsk.

The Revolution of 1917 did not leave the city unscathed. During a major battle between the detachment of P.E. Schetinkin and A.D. Kravchenko (communist forces) and the Kolchak men (tsarist forces) under the command of the captain G.K. Bologov at the end of August 1919, the city was almost completely burned down. The 10th Congress of Representatives of the Russian Population of Tuva (16–20 September 1920) gathered in the village of Turan, in the Uryankhai region. At this Congress, participants decided to restore the city and rename it as Kyzyl.

On 13 August 1921, in the town of Sug-Bazhy (the village of Kochetovo), the Vsetuvinsky Constituent Khural of Representatives of all Khoshuns (khoshun was an administrative-territorial unit at that time) of Tuva gathered. This gathering proclaimed the creation of an independent state – the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic. In March 1922, the Tuvan government, the Central Committee of the Tuvan People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (Central Committee of the TPRP), and the executive committee of the Russian Self-Governing Labor Colony (RSTK) were transferred to the restored Kyzyl. In the spring of 1922, the city of Kyzyl became the capital of the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic (TPR).

In 1924, the Tuvan Central Cooperative (Tuvintsenkoop, TCC) was formed, which played a significant role in the development of industrial production and domestic and foreign trade. In 1925, the Tuvan National Bank (Tuvinbank) was founded. In Kyzyl, enterprises for the processing of agricultural raw materials were organized, and in 1928, a shoemaker&#x27;s workshop opened. In 1929, the Kyzyl printing house was opened, and the transport organization &quot;Soyuztrans&quot; was created. Two years later, the Soyuztrans truck fleet consisted of 31 vehicles. In 1931, a telephone exchange for 30 subscribers was opened in the city of Kyzyl. Between 1930 and 1931 a sausage workshop, a pimokatny (a felt workshop), and tailoring workshop were built. In the early 1940s, a mill, a sawmill, a power station and a brick factory operated in Kyzyl, and sheepskin and fur production began.

==Geography==

Kyzyl claims to be located exactly in the geographical center of Asia. This claim is disputed. Nevertheless, locals constructed a monument labelled &quot;Center of Asia&quot; in Tuvan, Russian, and English. Tos-Bulak is an area of open fields and mineral springs which lies immediately south of Kyzyl.

Kyzyl stands at the point where the Great Yenisey (Bii-Xem) meets the Little Yenisey (Kaa-Xem) river to form the Yenisey proper (Ulug-Xem). Most development takes place south of the Yenisey and Little Yenisey and follows the curve of the river, with the highest development centered just below the confluence of the Great Yenisey with the Little Yenisey. A monument was built in 1964 on the riverbank to mark this point.

===Climate===

The climate of Kyzyl has a cold semi-arid variety (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha climate classification &quot;BSbd&quot;), bordering on humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcbd&quot;), with average highs around in the summer and in the winter and only of precipitation annually. Located far from any moderating bodies of water and at a relatively high latitude, temperatures can be extreme, though less so than in the Sakha Republic. Nevertheless, the temperature has never risen above freezing between 22 November and 19 February. On the 20th of February, 2021, the temperature rose to above freezing for the first time in recorded history. Temperature swings can be rapid. The transitional seasons of spring and autumn are short. Only April and October average close to the annual mean of .

Kyzyl&#x27;s climate is dry and sharply continental. Kyzyl&#x27;s low altitude contributes to its extreme cold. In winter, the air in the basin stagnates and cools under the influence of the Siberian anticyclone, forming a powerful temperature inversion. Winter (November to March) is exceptionally harsh for the city&#x27;s latitude (Kyzyl is located at the same latitude as London, Kursk and Orenburg), snow-free (), and windless. The average temperature in January is (absolute minimum at ). The city is among the 10 coldest cities in Russia and the world. Spring is short. The daytime thaws that begin in March lead to a rapid decline of snow cover by the end of the month. However, even in April, the temperature can drop at night to due to sudden arctic winds.

In May, hot weather quickly sets in, with occasional prolonged droughts. Summer in Kyzyl begins in mid-May and ends in mid-September. In summer, the city is characterized by high daytime temperature. The maximum temperature is one of the highest in the Russian Federation, and is among the ten hottest cities, at . Precipitation is more common in the summer. Dust storms are possible in May and July. In August, heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms are not uncommon. In late September, the first frosts are observed, although the weather is still quite hot during the day. Trees lose their leaves in the beginning of October, and a rapid decrease in average temperatures begins. At the end of October, before the snow cover is established, the average daily temperature drops below , which makes it impossible to grow winter crops, and many fruits and berries. Snow cover is usually established in mid-November, followed by a sharp drop in temperatures to and below.

Since the center of the Asian maximum atmospheric pressure (Siberian anticyclone) is located above Tuva in the cold season, and Kyzyl is located at the bottom of a deep basin (compared to the mountains surrounding it) with a dense atmosphere, up to the level of planetary winds to heights of , in winter a powerful inversion is observed over the city. The temperature at an altitude of above the city can be degrees higher than at the surface of the earth. Almost from the end of October to the beginning of March, there is windless, often clear weather, leading to strong smog gathering over the city and the basin. On some days, visibility can drop to due to the smog. Severe air pollution in winter is a substantial environmental concern. The government of the region is currently seeking to build gasification infrastructure to combat this.

The record high of was recorded on 15 July 2004. The record low of was recorded on 4 February 1945.

==Tourism==
===Sights===
====Center of Asia – Sculpture Complex====
The obelisk, symbolizing the center of Asia, is located on the bank of the Yenisei River. Three versions have been built — in 1964, 1984 and 2014. 

The new obelisk was designed by the Buryat artist Dashi Namdakov. It is represented by an ensemble of three lions holding a globe topped with a spire. Externally, the monument is very similar to the previous obelisks. It depicts grandiose figures of eastern dragons and a high stele, surrounded by symbolic animals intertwined in a rush of ascent to the sky. The animal figures also represent the twelve creatures of the Buddhist horoscope.

====Ethnic and cultural complex of Aldyn-Bulak====

The complex occupies the coastal zone of the Yenisei, 45 km from Kyzyl. The installation was built as a model of the universe, where the roles of stars and planets are assigned to yurts of different sizes and purposes. Although the yurts are decorated as authentic as possible to the Uralic way of life, Aldyn-Bulak has all the amenities, including places for tourists to stay, a restaurant, a sauna, a parking lot.

====Tsechenling Temple====

One of the most important Buddhist attractions of Kyzyl. Built in 1998, it consists of two floors: the first – as a residence, the second – for prayer. The corners of the building appear worn, due to the tradition of walking around the temple in a circle and touching the corners. Classes on spiritual practices and languages are held inside. Admission is free.

====Buddhist Prayer Wheel====
The wheel was officially opened in 2006. It is considered the largest prayer wheel in Russia. It came from an Indian monastery, where the monks worked on the wheel for several years. Millions of scrolls with mantras are stacked inside.

====Kadarchy Monument====

It was installed in 1997 in front of the Kyzyl Airport. The monument is a shepherd with a staff in traditional Tuvan clothing. After the sculpture took its place on the hill, the locals considered that the hero did not have enough liverstock, so &quot;sheep&quot; were placed nearby in the form of boulders painted white.

====Mineral spring - &quot;Bobry&quot;====
The spring is located from Kyzyl. The name is translated to English as &quot;beavers&quot;. According to legend, people learned about the spring from the beavers who went there to drink. There are more than 20 streams and springs, and the water is collected in small natural and handmade bowls or spreads. It is also said that, since each of the streams treats different diseases, tourists should try the water from all of them.

====National Museum of the Republic of Tuva====
This museum was founded in 1929 in Kyzyl. Unique collections presented in the museum include: Archaeological collections of the Scythian mounds &quot;Arzhaan&quot; and &quot;Arzhaan-2&quot;; Tuvan ethnographic collections; Tuvan women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s silver jewelry; and cult collections of Shamanism, Buddhism and Orthodoxy.

====Dus-khol Lake====
A salty spring in the Republic of Tuva. In the Tuvan dialect, the name of the reservoir means &quot;salt lake&quot;. Dus-Khol is a natural monument and is under state protection. The water in this spring is said to possess healing properties. Throughout the summer, tourists and locals visit the reservoir.

===Events===
====International Festival of Live Music and Faith - &quot;Ustuu-Khuree&quot;====
The festival, which is a showcase of indigenous cultures, has been held in the Republic of Tuva since 1999. The festival arose in line with the idea of restoring a ruined Buddhist temple in Chadan. The central tenets of the festival are live music and following the universal spiritual postulates of living faith (kindness, tolerance, unpretentiousness to the benefits of life). Participants stay in a tent city constructed near the temple, and are able to listen to numerous performers from various diverse traditions. Traditionally, the Ustuu-Khuree festival takes place in July.

====International festival Khoomei in the &quot;Center of Asia&quot;====
The festival program traditionally includes competitions among throat singing performers and the consecration ceremony &quot;Ovaa khoomei&quot;. It is held every two years. During the festival, the number of participants reached more than 600 people, including 31 foreign citizens from different countries including the United States, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Mongolia, Sweden, Germany, Japan, and Brazil.

====National holiday – &quot;Naadym&quot;====
Naadym is a Tuvan national holiday of shepherds, held annually in mid-August. It necessarily includes the traditional wrestling &quot;khuresh&quot;, horse racing, archery, competitions for the best traditional yurt, the best traditional costume, and the best equipment of a horse.

<text>Homo () is a genus of great ape (family Hominidae) that emerged from the genus &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and encompasses only a single extant species, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (modern humans), along with a number of extinct species (collectively called archaic humans) classified as either ancestral or closely related to modern humans; these include &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;. The oldest member of the genus is &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, with records of just over 2 million years ago. &quot;Homo&quot;, together with the genus &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, is probably most closely related to the species &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; within &quot;Australopithecus&quot;.&quot;&quot; The closest living relatives of &quot;Homo&quot; are of the genus &quot;Pan&quot; (chimpanzees and bonobos), with the ancestors of &quot;Pan&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; estimated to have diverged around 5.7–11 million years ago during the Late Miocene.

&quot;H. erectus&quot; appeared about 2 million years ago and spread throughout Africa (debatably as another species called &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;) and Eurasia in several migrations. The species was adaptive and successful, and persisted for more than a million years before gradually diverging into new species around 500,000 years ago.

Anatomically modern humans (&quot;H. sapiens&quot;) emerged close to 300,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa, and &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; emerged around the same time in Europe and Western Asia. &quot;H. sapiens&quot; dispersed from Africa in several waves, from possibly as early as 250,000 years ago, and certainly by 130,000 years ago, with the so-called Southern Dispersal, beginning about 70–50,000 years ago, leading to the lasting colonisation of Eurasia and Oceania by 50,000 years ago. &quot;H. sapiens&quot; met and interbred with archaic humans in Africa and in Eurasia. Separate archaic (non-&quot;sapiens&quot;) human species including Neanderthals are thought to have survived until around 40,000 years ago.

== Names and taxonomy ==


The Latin noun &quot;homō&quot; (genitive &quot;hominis&quot;) means &quot;human being&quot; or &quot;man&quot; in the generic sense of &quot;human being, mankind&quot;. The binomial name &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; was coined by Carl Linnaeus (1758). Names for other species of the genus were introduced from the second half of the 19th century (&quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; 1864, &quot;H. erectus&quot; 1892).

The genus &quot;Homo&quot; has not been strictly defined, even today. Since the early human fossil record began to slowly emerge from the earth, the boundaries and definitions of the genus have been poorly defined and constantly in flux. Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define &quot;Homo&quot; when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthal brought the first addition.

The genus &quot;Homo&quot; was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human. And, over the decades of the 20th century, fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times produced a rich mix for debating classifications. There is continuing debate on delineating &quot;Homo&quot; from &quot;Australopithecus&quot;—or, indeed, delineating &quot;Homo&quot; from &quot;Pan&quot;. Even so, classifying the fossils of &quot;Homo&quot; coincides with evidence of: (1) competent human bipedalism in &quot;Homo habilis&quot; inherited from the earlier &quot;Australopithecus&quot; of more than four million years ago, as demonstrated by the Laetoli footprints; and (2) human tool culture having begun by 2.5 million years ago to 3 million years ago.

From the late-19th to mid-20th centuries, a number of new taxonomic names, including new generic names, were proposed for early human fossils; most have since been merged with &quot;Homo&quot; in recognition that &quot;Homo erectus&quot; was a single species with a large geographic spread of early migrations. Many such names are now regarded as &quot;synonyms&quot; with &quot;Homo&quot;, including &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot;, &quot;Protanthropus&quot;, &quot;Sinanthropus&quot;, &quot;Cyphanthropus&quot;, &quot;Africanthropus&quot;, &quot;Telanthropus&quot;, &quot;Atlanthropus&quot;, and &quot;Tchadanthropus&quot;.

Classifying the genus &quot;Homo&quot; into species and subspecies is subject to incomplete information and remains poorly done. This has led to using common names (&quot;Neanderthal&quot; and &quot;Denisovan&quot;), even in scientific papers, to avoid trinomial names or the ambiguity of classifying groups as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; (uncertain placement)—for example, &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; vs. &quot;H. sapiens neanderthalensis&quot;, or &quot;H. georgicus&quot; vs. &quot;H. erectus georgicus&quot;. Some recently extinct species in the genus have been discovered only lately and do not as yet have consensus binomial names (see Denisova hominin). Since the beginning of the Holocene, it is likely that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (anatomically modern humans) has been the only extant species of &quot;Homo&quot;.

John Edward Gray (1825) was an early advocate of classifying taxa by designating tribes and families. Wood and Richmond (2000) proposed that Hominini (&quot;hominins&quot;) be designated as a tribe that comprised all species of early humans and pre-humans ancestral to humans back to &quot;after&quot; the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor, and that Hominina be designated a subtribe of Hominini to include &quot;only&quot; the genus &quot;Homo&quot; — that is, &quot;not&quot; including the earlier upright walking hominins of the Pliocene such as &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, &quot;Orrorin tugenensis&quot;, &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;, or &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot;. Designations alternative to Hominina existed, or were offered: &quot;Australopithecinae&quot; (Gregory &amp; Hellman 1939) and &quot;Preanthropinae&quot; (Cela-Conde &amp; Altaba 2002); and later, Cela-Conde and Ayala (2003) proposed that the four genera &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;, &quot;Praeanthropus&quot;, and &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; be grouped with &quot;Homo&quot; within Hominini (sans &quot;Pan&quot;).

==Evolution==

===&quot;Australopithecus&quot; and the appearance of &quot;Homo&quot;===

Several species, including &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot;, &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;, &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, and &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, have been proposed as the ancestor or sister of the &quot;Homo&quot; lineage. These species have morphological features that align them with &quot;Homo&quot;, but there is no consensus as to which gave rise to &quot;Homo&quot;.

Especially since the 2010s, the delineation of &quot;Homo&quot; in &quot;Australopithecus&quot; has become more contentious. Traditionally, the advent of &quot;Homo&quot; has been taken to coincide with the first use of stone tools (the Oldowan industry), and thus by definition with the beginning of the Lower Palaeolithic. But in 2010, evidence was presented that seems to attribute the use of stone tools to &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; around 3.3 million years ago, close to a million years before the first appearance of &quot;Homo&quot;. LD 350-1, a fossil mandible fragment dated to 2.8 Mya, discovered in 2013 in Afar, Ethiopia, was described as combining &quot;primitive traits seen in early &quot;Australopithecus&quot; with derived morphology observed in later &quot;Homo&quot;. Some authors would push the development of &quot;Homo&quot; close to or even past 3 Mya. This finds support in a recent phylogenetic study in hominins that by using morphological, molecular and radiometric information, dates the emergence of &quot;Homo&quot; at 3.3 Ma (4.30 – 2.56 Ma). Others have voiced doubt as to whether &quot;Homo habilis&quot; should be included in &quot;Homo&quot;, proposing an origin of &quot;Homo&quot; with &quot;Homo erectus&quot; at roughly 1.9 Mya instead.

The most salient physiological development between the earlier australopithecine species and &quot;Homo&quot; is the increase in endocranial volume (ECV), from about in &quot;A. garhi&quot; to in &quot;H. habilis&quot; and further to in &quot;H. erectus&quot;, in &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; and up to in &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot;. However, a steady rise in cranial capacity is observed already in &quot;Autralopithecina&quot; and does not terminate after the emergence of &quot;Homo&quot;, so that it does not serve as an objective criterion to define the emergence of the genus.

=== &quot;Homo habilis&quot; ===
&quot;Homo habilis&quot; emerged about 2.1 Mya. Already before 2010, there were suggestions that &quot;H. habilis&quot; should not be placed in the genus &quot;Homo&quot; but rather in &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. The main reason to include &quot;H. habilis&quot; in &quot;Homo&quot;, its undisputed tool use, has become obsolete with the discovery of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; tool use at least a million years before &quot;H. habilis&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;H. habilis&quot; was long thought to be the ancestor of the more gracile &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; (&quot;Homo erectus&quot;). In 2007, it was discovered that &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot; coexisted for a considerable time, suggesting that &quot;H. erectus&quot; is not immediately derived from &quot;H. habilis&quot; but instead from a common ancestor. With the publication of Dmanisi skull 5 in 2013, it has become less certain that Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; is a descendant of African &quot;H. ergaster&quot; which was in turn derived from &quot;H. habilis&quot;. Instead, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot; appear to be variants of the same species, which may have originated in either Africa or Asia and widely dispersed throughout Eurasia (including Europe, Indonesia, China) by 0.5 Mya.

=== &quot;Homo erectus&quot; ===

&quot;Homo erectus&quot; has often been assumed to have developed anagenetically from &quot;H. habilis&quot; from about 2 million years ago. This scenario was strengthened with the discovery of &quot;Homo erectus georgicus&quot;, early specimens of &quot;H. erectus&quot; found in the Caucasus, which seemed to exhibit with &quot;H. habilis&quot;. As the earliest evidence for &quot;H. erectus&quot; was found outside of Africa, it was considered plausible that &quot;H. erectus&quot; developed in Eurasia and then migrated back to Africa. Based on fossils from the Koobi Fora Formation, east of Lake Turkana in Kenya, Spoor et al. (2007) argued that &quot;H. habilis&quot; may have survived beyond the emergence of &quot;H. erectus&quot;, so that the evolution of &quot;H. erectus&quot; would not have been anagenetically, and &quot;H. erectus&quot; would have existed alongside &quot;H. habilis&quot; for about half a million years (), during the early Calabrian. On 31 August 2023, researchers reported, based on genetic studies, that a human ancestor population bottleneck (from a possible 100,000 to 1000 individuals) occurred &quot;around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago ... lasted for about 117,000 years and brought human ancestors close to extinction.&quot;

Weiss (1984) estimated that there have been about 44 billion (short scale) members of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; from its origins to the evolution of &quot;H. erectus&quot;, about 56 billion individuals from &quot;H. erectus&quot; to the Neolithic, and another 51 billion individuals since the Neolithic. This provides the opportunity for an immense amount of new mutational variation to have arisen during human evolution.

A separate South African species &quot;Homo gautengensis&quot; has been postulated as contemporary with &quot;H. erectus&quot; in 2010.

== Phylogeny ==

A taxonomy of &quot;Homo&quot; within the great apes is assessed as follows, with &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; emerging within &quot;Australopithecus&quot; (shown here cladistically granting &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot;, and &quot;Homo&quot;). The exact phylogeny within &quot;Australopithecus&quot; is still highly controversial. Approximate radiation dates of daughter clades are shown in millions of years ago (Mya). &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; and &quot;Orrorin&quot;, possibly sisters to &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, are not shown here. The naming of groupings is sometimes muddled as often certain groupings are presumed before any cladistic analysis is performed.

Cladogram based on Dembo et al. (2016):

Cladogram based on Feng et al. (2024): 
Several of the &quot;Homo&quot; lineages appear to have surviving progeny through introgression into other lines. Genetic evidence indicates an archaic lineage separating from the other human lineages 1.5 million years ago, perhaps &quot;H. erectus&quot;, may have interbred into the Denisovans about 55,000 years ago. Fossil evidence shows &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.s. survived at least until 117,000 yrs ago, and the even more basal &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; survived until 50,000 years ago. A 1.5-million-year &quot;H. erectus&quot;-like lineage appears to have made its way into modern humans through the Denisovans and specifically into the Papuans and aboriginal Australians. The genomes of non-sub-Saharan African humans show what appear to be numerous independent introgression events involving Neanderthal and in some cases also Denisovans around 45,000 years ago. The genetic structure of some sub-Saharan African groups seems to be indicative of introgression from a west Eurasian population some 3,000 years ago.

Some evidence suggests that &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot; could be moved to the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, or placed in its own genus, due to its position with respect to e.g. &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;.

By about 1.8 million years ago, &quot;H. erectus&quot; is present in both East Africa (&quot;H. ergaster&quot;) and in Western Asia (&quot;H. georgicus&quot;). The ancestors of Indonesian &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; may have left Africa even earlier.

&quot;Homo erectus&quot; and related or derived archaic human species over the next 1.5 million years spread throughout Africa and Eurasia (see: Recent African origin of modern humans). Europe is reached by about 0.5 Mya by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;.

&quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;H. sapiens&quot; develop after about 300 kya. &quot;Homo naledi&quot; is present in Southern Africa by 300 kya.

&quot;H. sapiens&quot; soon after its first emergence spread throughout Africa, and to Western Asia in several waves, possibly as early as 250 kya, and certainly by 130 kya. In July 2019, anthropologists reported the discovery of 210,000 year old remains of a &quot;H. sapiens&quot; and 170,000 year old remains of a &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; in Apidima Cave, Peloponnese, Greece, more than 150,000 years older than previous &quot;H. sapiens&quot; finds in Europe.

Most notable is the Southern Dispersal of &quot;H. sapiens&quot; around 60 kya, which led to the lasting peopling of Oceania and Eurasia by anatomically modern humans. &quot;H. sapiens&quot; interbred with archaic humans both in Africa and in Eurasia, in Eurasia notably with Neanderthals and Denisovans.

Among extant populations of &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, the deepest temporal division is found in the San people of Southern Africa, estimated at close to 130,000 years, or possibly more than 300,000 years ago. Temporal division among non-Africans is of the order of 60,000 years in the case of Australo-Melanesians. Division of Europeans and East Asians is of the order of 50,000 years, with repeated and significant admixture events throughout Eurasia during the Holocene.

Archaic human species may have survived until the beginning of the Holocene, although they were mostly extinct or absorbed by the expanding &quot;H. sapiens&quot; populations by 40 kya (Neanderthal extinction).

== List of lineages ==

The species status of &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, &quot;H. georgicus&quot;, &quot;H. antecessor&quot;, &quot;H. cepranensis&quot;, &quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot;, &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot;, Denisova hominin, and &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; remain under debate. &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; and &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; are closely related to each other and have been considered to be subspecies of &quot;H. sapiens&quot;.

There has historically been a trend to postulate new human species based on as little as an individual fossil. A &quot;minimalist&quot; approach to human taxonomy recognizes at most three species, &quot;H. habilis&quot; (2.1–1.5 Mya, membership in &quot;Homo&quot; questionable), &quot;H. erectus&quot; (1.8–0.1 Mya, including the majority of the age of the genus, and the majority of archaic varieties as subspecies, including &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; as a late or transitional variety) and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (300 kya to present, including &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; and other varieties as subspecies). Consistent definitions and methodology of species delineation are not generally agreed upon in anthropology or paleontology. Indeed, speciating populations of mammals can typically interbreed for several million years after they begin to genetically diverge, so all contemporary &quot;species&quot; in the genus &quot;Homo&quot; would potentially have been able to interbreed at the time, and introgression from beyond the genus &quot;Homo&quot; can not &quot;a priori&quot; be ruled out. It has been suggested that &quot;H. naledi&quot; may have been a hybrid with a late surviving &quot;Australipith&quot; (taken to mean beyond &quot;Homo&quot;, ed.), despite the fact that these lineages generally are regarded as long extinct. As discussed above, many introgressions have occurred between lineages, with evidence of introgression after separation of 1.5 million years.

<doc id="488346" wikidata="Q34119" url="?curid=488346" title="Tuvan language">
<text>Tuvan, sometimes spelt Tyvan, is a Turkic language spoken in the Republic of Tuva in South Central Siberia, Russia. There are small groups of Tuvans that speak distinct dialects of Tuvan in China and Mongolia.

== History ==
The earliest record of Tuvan is from the early 19th century by &quot;Wūlǐyǎsūtái zhìlüè&quot; (), Julius Klaproth 1823, Matthias Castrén 1857, Nikolay Katanov, Vasily Radlov, etc.

The name Tuva goes back as early as the publication of &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;. The Tuva (as they refer to themselves) have historically been referred to as Soyons, Soyots or Uriankhais.

== Classification ==
Tuvan (also spelled Tyvan) is linguistically classified as a Sayan Turkic language. Its closest relative is the moribund Tofa.

Tuvan, as spoken in Tuva, is principally divided into four dialect groups; Western, Central, Northeastern, Southeastern.
* Central: forms the basis of the literary language and includes Ovyur and Bii-Khem subdialects. The geographical centrality of this dialect meant it was similar to the language spoken by most Tuvans, whether or not exactly the same.
* Western: can be found spoken near the upper course of the Khemchik. It is influenced by the Altai language.
* Northeastern, also known as the Todzhi dialect, is spoken near the upper course of the Great Yenisey. The speakers of this dialect utilize nasalization. It contains a large vocabulary related to hunting and reindeer breeding not found in the other dialects.
* Southeastern: shows the most influence from the Mongolic languages.

Other dialects include those spoken by the Dzungar, the Tsengel and the Dukha Tuvans, but currently these uncommon dialects are not comprehensively documented. Different dialects of the language exist across the geographic region in which Tuvan is spoken. K. David Harrison, who completed his dissertation on the Tuvan language in 2001, argues that the divergence of these dialects relates to the nomadic nature of the Tuvan nation.

One subset is the Jungar Tuvan language, originating in the Altai Mountains in the western region of Mongolia. There is no accurate number of Jungar-Tuvan speakers because most currently reside in China, and the Chinese include Tuvan speakers as Mongolians in their census.
== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
Tuvan has 19 native consonant phonemes:


=== Vowels ===
Vowels in Tuvan exist in three varieties: long, short, and short with low pitch. Tuvan long vowels have a duration that is at least (and often more than) twice as long as that of short vowels. Contrastive low pitch may occur on short vowels, and when it does, it causes them to increase in duration by at least a half. When using low pitch, Tuvan speakers employ a pitch that is at the very low end of their modal voice pitch. For some speakers, it is even lower and using what is phonetically known as creaky voice. When a vowel in a monosyllabic word has low pitch, speakers apply low pitch only to the first half of that vowel (e.g. &#x27;horse&#x27;). That is followed by a noticeable pitch rise, as the speaker returns to modal pitch in the second half of the vowel.

The acoustic impression is similar to that of a rising tone like the rising pitch contour of the Mandarin second tone, but the Tuvan pitch begins much lower. However, Tuvan is considered a pitch accent language with contrastive low pitch instead of a tonal language. When the low pitch vowel occurs in a multisyllabic word, there is no rising pitch contour or lengthening effect: &#x27;his/her/its horse&#x27;. Such low pitch vowels were previously referred to in the literature as either kargyraa or pharyngealized vowels. Phonetic studies have demonstrated that the defining characteristic of such vowels is low pitch. See Harrison 2001 for a phonetic and acoustic study of Tuvan low pitch vowels.

In her PhD thesis, &quot;Long Vowels in Mongolic Loanwords in Tuvan&quot;, Baiarma Khabtagaeva states that the history of long vowels is ambiguous. While the long vowels may originate from Mongolic languages, they could also be of Tuvan origin. In most Mongolic languages, the quality of the long vowel changes depending on the quality of the second vowel in the conjunction. The only exception to this rule is if the conjunction is labial. The ancient Tuvan languages, in contrast, depended upon the first vowel rather than the second to determine the long vowels.

Khabtagaeva divided the transformation of these loanwords into two periods: the early layer and the late layer. The words in the early layer are words in which the Mongolic preserved the conjunction, the VCV conjunction was preserved but the long vowel still developed when it entered the Tuvan language, or the stress is on the last syllable and a long vowel in the loanword replaced a short vowel in the original word. The late layer includes loanwords in which the long vowel does not change when the word entered Tuvan.
Vowels may also be nasalized in the environment of nasal consonants, but nasalization is non-contrastive. Most Tuvan vowels in word-initial syllables have a low pitch and do not contrast significantly with short and long vowels.

==== Vowel harmony ====

Tuvan has two systems of vowel harmony that strictly govern the distribution of vowels within words and suffixes. Backness harmony, or what is sometimes called &#x27;palatal&#x27; harmony, requires all vowels within a word to be either back or front. Rounding harmony, or what is sometimes called &#x27;labial&#x27; harmony, requires a vowel to be rounded if it is a high vowel and appears in a syllable immediately following a rounded vowel. Low rounded vowels are restricted to the first syllable of a word, and a vowel in a non-initial syllable may be rounded only if it meets the conditions of rounding harmony (it must both be a high vowel and be preceded by a rounded vowel). See Harrison (2001) for a detailed description of Tuvan vowel harmony systems.

== Grammar ==
Tuvan builds morphologically complex words by adding suffixes. For example, &quot;teve&quot; is &#x27;camel&#x27;, &quot;teveler&quot; is &#x27;camels&#x27;, &quot;tevelerim&quot; is &#x27;my camels&#x27;, &quot;tevelerimden&quot; is &#x27;from my camels&#x27;.

=== Nouns ===
Tuvan marks nouns with six cases: genitive, accusative, dative, ablative, locative, and allative. The suffixes below are in front vowels, however, except &quot;-Je&quot; the suffixes follow vowel harmony rules. Each case suffix has a rich variety of uses and meanings, of which only the most basic ones are shown here.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Tuvan take a number of endings to mark tense, mood, and aspect. Auxiliary verbs are also used to modify the verb. For a detailed scholarly study of auxiliary verbs in Tuvan and related languages, see Anderson 2004.

=== Syntax ===
Tuvan employs SOV word order. For example, (camel hay eat-PAST) &quot;The camel ate the hay.&quot;

== Vocabulary ==

Tuvan vocabulary is mostly Turkic in origin but marked by a large number of Mongolian loanwords. The language has also borrowed several Mongolian suffixes. In addition, there exist Ketic and Samoyedic substrata. A Tuvan talking dictionary is produced by the Living Tongues Institute.

In contrast with most Turkic languages, which have many Arabic and Persian loanwords that even cover some basic concepts, these loanwords are very few, if any, in Tuvan, as Tuvans never adopted Islam like most Turkic peoples.

== Writing system ==
=== Cyrillic script ===
The current Tuvan alphabet is a modified version of the Russian alphabet, with three additional letters: Ңң (Latin &quot;ng&quot; or International Phonetic Alphabet ), Өө (Latin &quot;ö&quot;, ), Үү (Latin &quot;ü&quot;, IPA ). The sequence of the alphabet follows Russian, but with Ң located after Russian Н, Ө after О, and Ү after У.

The letters Е and Э are used in a special way. Э is used for the short sound at the beginning of words while Е is used for the same sound in the middle and at the end of words. Е is used at the beginning of words, mostly of Russian origin, to reflect the standard Russian pronunciation of that letter, . Additionally, ЭЭ is used in the middle and at the end of words for the long sound.

The letter ъ is used to indicate pitch accent, as in эът &quot;èt&quot; &#x27;meat&#x27;.

=== Historic scripts ===

==== Traditional Mongolian script ====
From approximately the 17th and 18th centuries until the 1930s, Tuvans used the traditional Mongolian script for their written language. By the late 1920s less than 1.5% of the total Tuvan population was literate in the traditional Mongolian script. Mongolian literacy was mainly possessed by the feudal nobility and officials. The absolute majority of Tuvans (with the exception of residents of some areas of the south-eastern part of Tuva, where Tuvan-Mongolian bilingualism has been preserved to this day) did not know the Mongolian language, and had long spoken only their native language.

==== Draft scripts ====

In 1926, the government of the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic asked Soviet scientists to develop a native Tuvan script. The first draft of a Tuvan alphabet based on Cyrillic was compiled by Roman Buzykaev (1875-1939) and B. Bryukhanov (Sotpa) in 1927. This alphabet contained the letters Аа, Бб, Вв, Гг, Дд, Ёё, Жж, Ӝӝ, Зз, Ии, Йй, Кк, Лл, Мм, Нн, Ҥҥ, Оо, Ӧӧ, Пп, Рр, Сс, Тт, Уу, Ӱӱ, Хх, Чч, Шш, Ыы. The first Tuvan primer was published using this alphabet, but this project was not developed further.

==== Tuvan Latin ====

The Latin-based alphabet for Tuvan was devised in 1930 by a Tuvan Buddhist monk, Mongush Lopsang-Chinmit (a.k.a. Lubsan Zhigmed). This project was proposed based on the German alphabet, albeit with a modified letter order. In this proposed system, all vowels were placed first (10 letters), followed by consonants (18 letters). This order is characteristic of the classical Mongolian script. Moreover, the pronunciation of several letters underwent significant alteration.

A few books and newspapers, including primers intended to teach adults to read, were printed using this writing system. Lopsang-Chinmit was later executed in Stalinist purges on 31 December 1941.

In the USSR, Aleksandr Palmbach, Yevgeny Polivanov, and Nicholas Poppe were engaged in the development of the Tuvan Latinized alphabet. These researchers utilized the so-called New Turkic Alphabet as a foundation for their work. New Turkic Alphabet was designed with the intention of facilitating unification of writing systems among all Turkic peoples. In early 1930, the Tuvan alphabet was finalized and officially introduced on June 28, 1930, by a decree of the TPR government. The approved Tuvan alphabet was as follows: 
The letter Ɉ ɉ was excluded from the alphabet in 1931.

===Examples===
By September 1943, this Latin-based alphabet was replaced by a Cyrillic-based one, which is still in use to the present day. In the post-Soviet era, Tuvan and other scholars have taken a renewed interest in the history of Tuvan letters.
=== Transliteration ===
For bibliographic purposes, transliteration of Tuvan generally follows the guidelines described in the ALA-LC Romanization tables for non-Slavic languages in Cyrillic script. Linguistic descriptions often employ the IPA or Turcological standards for transliteration.

== Status ==
Tuvans in China, who live mostly in Xinjiang Autonomous Region, are included under the Mongol nationality. Some Tuvans reportedly live at Kanas Lake in the northwestern part of Xinjiang, where they are not officially recognized, and are counted as a part of the local Oirat Mongol community that is counted under the general PRC official ethnic label of &quot;Mongol&quot;. Oirat and Tuvan children attend schools in which they use Chakhar Mongolian and Mandarin Standard Chinese, native languages of neither group.

<text>The 1872 Canadian federal election was held from July 20 to October 12, 1872, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 2nd Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Conservative Party remained in power, defeating the Liberals. However, the Liberals increased their parliamentary representation considerably, while the Conservative seat count remained static, giving them only six more seats than the Liberals. The election produced the country&#x27;s first minority government. The support of two independent Conservative MPs functionally gave Macdonald an extremely slim majority that allowed it to survive for two years, until it fell due to scandal.

Edward Blake, who had a seat in both the House of Commons of Canada and the Ontario legislature, resigned as Premier of Ontario in order to run in the 1872 federal election as dual mandates had been abolished. Had the Liberals won the election, he likely would have been offered the position of Prime Minister of Canada. The party had no formal leader as such until 1873 when Alexander Mackenzie was given the title after Blake declined due to ill health. Blake was ill during much of the 1872 campaign, and it was Mackenzie who essentially led the Liberal campaign in Ontario, though not outside the province.

The 1872 general election was the first to include the new provinces of Manitoba and British Columbia, which had both joined Canada after the Confederation of 1867. By-elections had been held in both provinces to elect Members of Parliament in the newly created ridings, with Manitoba receiving four seats and British Columbia six. (In 1870 Canada had also expanded to include the current provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Territories, but no MPs were elected there until 1887.) In 1873, PEI joined Confederation and six more seats were added to the House of Commons, all filled by acclamations in by-elections.

==Electoral system==
Most of the ridings in this election elected just one member through First past the post, except for the ridings of: Ottawa, Victoria, the City and County of St. John, Cape Breton, Pictou, Hamilton, and Halifax; which elected two members, with each voter casting up to two votes (Plurality block voting).

==Results==
===National===


Note:
1 Though identifying themselves as Liberal-Conservatives, these MPs and those identifying as Conservatives were both led by Sir John A. Macdonald (himself a Liberal-Conservative) and sat together in the House of Commons.

Acclamations

The following MPs were acclaimed:
* British Columbia: 3 Liberal-Conservatives
* Manitoba: 1 Liberal-Conservative
* Ontario: 3 Conservatives, 3 Liberal-Conservatives, 10 Liberals
* Quebec: 9 Conservatives, 5 Liberal-Conservatives, 5 Liberals
* New Brunswick: 6 Liberals, 1 Independent
* Nova Scotia: 1 Conservative, 4 Liberal-Conservatives, 2 Liberals

<text>Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia ( or ), published at the turn of the 20th century, is the largest encyclopedia written in Czech. For its scope and the quality of the writing, it is comparable to the greatest world encyclopedias of its time, such as &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

==The first edition==
At the beginning of the 1880s, Jan Otto, a Czech book-seller and publisher, began planning a new general Czech encyclopedia. He was inspired by the first Czech encyclopedia by F. L. Rieger, a fourteen-volume work published between 1860 and 1874, but wanted to go further. For a long time Otto could not find an eligible editor-in-chief until he began to cooperate with Jan Malý, a former co-editor of the Reiger&#x27;s encyclopedia, who laid down a concept of the new work with a proposed name - &quot;Czech national encyclopedia&quot; (&quot;Národní encyklopedie česká&quot;) in 1884. After Malý&#x27;s death the following year, Otto found a new editor-in-chief, Tomáš Masaryk later the president of Czechoslovakia, and in 1886 the actual work began (Masaryk himself leading subjects of psychology, sociology, philosophy and logic disciplines, but didn&#x27;t contribute any text to published encyclopedias). Work on encyclopedia then was slower than Masaryk promised. The next year, Masaryk got involved in a tempestuous dispute over the authenticity of the allegedly historical &quot;Zelenohorský and Královedvorský manuscripts&quot; and resigned from the editorship. Otto managed to establish a new editorial group from prominent technicians, theologians and representatives of Czech universities including figures such as Karel Boromejský Mádl. Their intensive work and the work of their collaborators lead to the publication of the first volume of the encyclopedia, under the name &quot;Ottův slovník naučný&quot; (&quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;), in January 1888. From that point onwards, the work progressed without major problems and volumes were published regularly until the last (28th) one appeared in 1908.

&quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; consists of 28 (27 regular plus one supplementary) volumes. It contains approximately 150,000 entries printed on 28,912 pages, using an estimated 130 million letters. There are nearly 5,000 images and illustrations and 479 pages of attachments in the encyclopedia. Around 55 main editors and 1,100 external collaborators participated in its creation. 

==&quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia of the New Era&quot;==

Immediately after finishing his encyclopedia, Otto began to plan a second, sixteen-volume revised edition and started to prepare its realization. The preparation was continued by others even after he died (1916) and during the World War I but it was never completed due to quickly rising expenses.

But the story does not end yet. Since the &quot;Jan Otto Ltd.&quot; publishing company, which was led by Otto&#x27;s son-in-law K. B. Mádl, began issuing supplements to the original encyclopedia - the so-called Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia of the New Era (&quot;Ottův slovník naučný nové doby&quot;) - in 1930. These supplements, of very broad conception, were supposed to reflect new pieces of knowledge arising since the first edition was published, new historical events and the new political reality of the freshly born Czechoslovakia. Most of the entries were completely new, only a minor part of them were revised entries from the first encyclopedia. The Jan Otto company continued to release the supplements until 1934, when it got into financial problems and the work was given over to the &quot;Novina&quot; publishing company. Although the supplements were laid out as a set of 16 volumes, the last two of them, although being ready for printing, never came out, as the whole project was stopped in 1943 by the Nazis. In 1945, an order &quot;not&quot; to publish the rest of the encyclopedia came, substantiated by a statement that volumes released during World War II were severely affected by the Nazi censorship. (This statement has been disputed since. Jan Havránek, a contemporary Czech historian, states that such censorship interference indeed took place, its range was much more limited than was thought at that time.) Thus, the last released entry of the &quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia of the New Era&quot; was &quot;Užok&quot; (Uzsok - a village in Hungary). The text of the two last volumes disappeared and the letters V to Z are missing from the encyclopedia.

&quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia of the New Era&quot; is about one third of the size of the original edition. It contains nearly 60,000 entries in 12 volumes printed on 8,585 pages.

The whole project has been re-released between 1996 and 2003. It has also been digitized and appeared in a CD-ROM version. Both, the paper and digital editions are &#x27;reprints&#x27; of the original work, thus preserving the exact look and feel of &quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;.

&quot;Otto&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; demonstrated the progress of Czech society and greatly supported its rising national identity. Even today, it is a good source of information, mainly on historical subjects. Derek Sayer in his book says that &quot;But it is Ottův slovník naučný that remains the greatest of Czech works of reference, unsurpassed by anything published since. In its time it was one of the largest encyclopedias in the world, second in the number of its entries and illustrations perhaps only to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.&quot;

<text>Mining in the engineering discipline is the extraction of minerals from the ground. Mining engineering is associated with many other disciplines, such as mineral processing, exploration, excavation, geology, metallurgy, geotechnical engineering and surveying. A mining engineer may manage any phase of mining operations, from exploration and discovery of the mineral resources, through feasibility study, mine design, development of plans, production and operations to mine closure.

==History of mining engineering==
From prehistoric times to the present, mining has played a significant role in the existence of the human race. Since the beginning of civilization, people have used stone and ceramics and, later, metals found on or close to the Earth&#x27;s surface. These were used to manufacture early tools and weapons. For example, high-quality flint found in northern France and southern England were used to set fire and break rock. Flint mines have been found in chalk areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The oldest known mine on the archaeological record is the &quot;Lion Cave&quot; in Eswatini. At this site, which radiocarbon dating indicates to be about 43,000 years old, paleolithic humans mined mineral hematite, which contained iron and was ground to produce the red pigment ochre.

The ancient Romans were innovators of mining engineering. They developed large-scale mining methods, such as the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by aqueducts for hydraulic mining. The exposed rock was then attacked by fire-setting, where fires were used to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The thermal shock cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed. In some mines, the Romans utilized water-powered machinery such as reverse overshot water-wheels. These were used extensively in the copper mines at Rio Tinto in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, lifting water about .

Black powder was first used in mining in Banská Štiavnica, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia) in 1627. This allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins, which was much faster than fire-setting. The Industrial Revolution saw further advances in mining technologies, including improved explosives and steam-powered pumps, lifts, and drills.

==Education==

Becoming an accredited mining engineer requires a university or college degree. Training includes a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng. or B.E.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) or Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) in mining engineering. Depending on the country and jurisdiction, to be licensed as a mining engineer may require a Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), Master of Science (M.Sc or M.S.) or Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) degree.

Some mining engineers who have come from other disciplines, primarily from engineering fields (e.g.: mechanical, civil, electrical, geomatics or environmental engineering) or from science fields (e.g.: geology, geophysics, physics, geomatics, earth science, or mathematics), typically completing a graduate degree such as M.Eng, M.S., M.Sc. or M.A.Sc. in mining engineering after graduating from a different quantitative undergraduate program.

The fundamental subjects of mining engineering study usually include:
*mathematics; calculus, algebra, numerical analysis, statistics
*geoscience; geochemistry, geophysics, mineralogy, geomatics
*mechanics; rock mechanics, soil Mechanics, geomechanics
*thermodynamics; heat transfer, mass transfer
*hydrogeology
*fluid mechanics; fluid statics, fluid dynamics
*Geostatistics; spatial analysis
*control engineering; control theory, instrumentation
*surface mining; open-pit mining
*underground mining (soft rock)
*underground mining (hard rock)
*computing; DATAMINE, MATLAB, Maptek (Vulcan), Golden Software (Surfer), MicroStation, Carlson 
*drilling and blasting
*solid mechanics; fracture mechanics

In the United States, about 14 universities offer a B.S. degree in mining and mineral engineering. The top rated universities include West Virginia University, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Virginia Tech, the University of Kentucky, the University of Arizona, Montana Tech, and Colorado School of Mines. Most of these universities offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.

In Canada, there are 19 undergraduate degree programs in mining engineering or equivalent. McGill University Faculty of Engineering offers both undergraduate (B.Sc., B.Eng.) and graduate (M.Sc., Ph.D.) degrees in Mining Engineering. and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver offers a Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) in Mining Engineering and also graduate degrees (M.A.Sc. or M.Eng and Ph.D.) in Mining Engineering.

In Europe, most programs are integrated (B.S. plus M.S. into one) after the Bologna Process and take five years to complete. In Portugal, the University of Porto offers an M.Eng. in Mining and Geo-Environmental Engineering and in Spain the Technical University of Madrid offers degrees in Mining Engineering with tracks in Mining Technology, Mining Operations, Fuels and Explosives, Metallurgy. In the United Kingdom, The Camborne School of Mines offers a wide choice of BEng and MEng degrees in Mining engineering and other Mining related disciplines. This is done through the University of Exeter. In Romania, the University of Petroșani (formerly known as the &quot;Petroşani Institute of Mines&quot;, or rarely as the &quot;Petroşani Institute of Coal&quot;) is the only university that offers a degree in Mining Engineering, Mining Surveying or Underground Mining Constructions, albeit, after the closure of Jiu Valley coal mines, those degrees had fallen out of interest for most high-school graduates.

In South Africa, leading institutions include the University of Pretoria, offering a 4-year Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng in Mining Engineering) as well as post-graduate studies in various specialty fields such as rock engineering and numerical modelling, explosives engineering, ventilation engineering, underground mining methods and mine design; and the University of the Witwatersrand offering a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.Sc.(Eng.)) in Mining Engineering as well as graduate programs (M.Sc.(Eng.) and Ph.D.) in Mining Engineering.

Some mining engineers go on to pursue Doctorate degree programs such as Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D., DPhil), Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng., Eng.D.). These programs involve a significant original research component and are usually seen as entry points into academia.

In the Russian Federation, 85 universities across all federal districts are training specialists for the mineral resource sector. 36 universities are training specialists for extracting and processing solid minerals (mining). 49 are training specialists for extracting, primary processing, and transporting liquid and gaseous minerals (oil and gas). 37 are training specialists for geological exploration (applied geology, geological exploration). Among the universities that train specialists for the mineral resource sector, 7 are federal universities, and 13 are national research universities of Russia. Personnel training for the mineral resource sector in Russian universities is currently carried out in the following main specializations of training (specialist&#x27;s degree): &quot;Applied Geology&quot; with the qualification of mining engineer (5 years of training); &quot;Geological Exploration&quot; with the qualification of mining engineer (5 years of training); &quot;Mining&quot; with the qualification of mining engineer (5.5 years of training); &quot;Physical Processes in Mining or Oil and Gas Production&quot; with the qualification of mining engineer (5.5 years of training); &quot;Oil and Gas Engineering and Technologies&quot; with the qualification of mining engineer (5.5 years of training). Universities develop and implement the main professional educational programs of higher education in the directions and specializations of training by forming their profile (name of the program). For example, within the framework of the specialization &quot;Mining&quot;, universities often adhere to the classical names of the programs &quot;Open-pit mining&quot;, &quot;Underground mining of mineral deposits&quot;, &quot;Surveying&quot;, &quot;Mineral enrichment&quot;, &quot;Mining machines&quot;, &quot;Technological safety and mine rescue&quot;, &quot;Mine and underground construction&quot;, &quot;Blasting work&quot;, &quot;Electrification of the mining industry&quot;, etc. In the last ten years, under the influence of various factors, new names of programs have begun to appear, such as: &quot;Mining and geological information systems&quot;, &quot;Mining ecology&quot;, etc. Thus, universities, using their freedom to form new training programs for specialists, can look to the future and try to foresee new professions of mining engineers. After the specialist&#x27;s degree, you can immediately enrol in postgraduate school (analogue of Doctorate degree programs, four years of training).

==Salary and statistics==
Mining salaries are usually determined by the level of skill required, where the position is, and what kind of organization the engineer works for.

Mining engineers in India earn relatively high salaries in comparison to many other professions, with an average salary of $15,250 . However, in comparison to mining engineer salaries in other regions, such as Canada, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, Indian salaries are low. In the United States, there are an estimated 6,150 employed mining engineers, with a mean yearly wage of US$103,710.

==Pre-mining==

As there is considerable capital expenditure required for mining operations, an array of pre-mining activities are normally carried out to assess whether a mining operation would be worthwhile.

Mineral exploration is the process of locating minerals and assessing their concentrations (grade) and quantities (tonnage), to determine if they are commercially viable ores for mining. Mineral exploration is much more intensive, organized, involved, and professional than mineral prospecting – though it frequently utilizes services exploration, enlisting geologists and surveyors in the necessary pre-feasibility study of the possible mining operation. Mineral exploration and estimation of the reserve can determine the profitability conditions and advocate the form and type of mining required.

===Mineral discovery===
Mineral discovery can be made from research of mineral maps, academic geological reports, or government geological reports. Other sources of information include property assays and local word of mouth. Mineral research usually includes sampling and analysing sediments, soil, and drill cores. Soil sampling and analysis is one of the most popular mineral exploration tools. Other common tools include satellite and aerial surveys or airborne geophysics, including magneto-metric and gamma-spectrometric maps. Unless the mineral exploration is done on public property, the owners of the property may play a significant role in the exploration process and might be the original discoverers of the mineral deposit.

===Mineral determination===
After a prospective mineral is located, the mining geologist and engineer determine the ore properties. This may involve chemical analysis of the ore to determine the sample&#x27;s composition. Once the mineral properties are identified, the next step is determining the quantity of the ore. This involves determining the extent of the deposit and the purity of the ore. The geologist drills additional core samples to find the limits of the deposit or seam and estimates the quantity of valuable material present.

===Feasibility study===

Once the mineral identification and reserve amount are reasonably determined, the next step is to determine the feasibility of recovering the mineral deposit. A preliminary survey shortly after the discovery of the deposit examines the market conditions, such as the supply and demand of the mineral, the amount of ore needed to be moved to recover a certain quantity of that mineral, and analysis of the cost associated with the operation. This pre-feasibility study determines whether the mining project is likely to be profitable; if so, a more in-depth analysis of the deposit is undertaken. After the full extent of the ore body is known and has been examined by engineers, the feasibility study examines the cost of initial capital investment, methods of extraction, the cost of operation, an estimated length of time to pay back the investment, the gross revenue and net profit margin, any possible resale price of the land, the total life of the reserve, the full value of the account, investment in future projects, and the property owner or owners&#x27; contract. In addition, environmental impact, reclamation, possible legal ramifications, and all government permitting are considered. These steps of analysis determine whether the mining company and its investors should proceed with the extraction of the minerals or whether the project should be abandoned. The mining company may decide to sell the rights to the reserve to a third party rather than develop it themselves. Alternatively, the decision to proceed with extraction may be postponed indefinitely until market conditions become favourable.

==Mining operation==
Mining engineers working in an established mine may work as an engineer for operations improvement, further mineral exploration, and operation capitalization by determining where in the mine to add equipment and personnel. The engineer may also work in supervision and management or as an equipment and mineral salesperson. In addition to engineering and operations, the mining engineer may work as an environmental, health, and safety manager or design engineer.

The act of mining requires different methods of extraction depending on the mineralogy, geology, and location of the resources. Characteristics such as mineral hardness, the mineral stratification, and access to that mineral will determine the method of extraction.

Generally, mining is either done from the surface or underground. Mining can also occur with surface and covert operations on the same reserve. Mining activity varies as to what method is employed to remove the mineral.

===Surface mining===
Surface mining comprises 90% of the world&#x27;s mineral tonnage output. Also called open pit mining, surface mining removes minerals in formations near the surface. Ore retrieval is done by material removal from the land in its natural state. Surface mining often alters the land&#x27;s characteristics, shape, topography, and geological makeup.

Surface mining involves quarrying and excavating minerals through cutting, cleaving, and breaking machinery. Explosives are usually used to facilitate breakage. Hard rocks such as limestone, sand, gravel, and slate are generally quarried into benches.

Using mechanical shovels, track dozers, and front-end loaders, strip mining is done on softer minerals such as clays and phosphate removed. Smoother coal seams can also be extracted this way.

With placer mining, dredge mining can also remove minerals from the bottoms of lakes, rivers, streams, and even the ocean. In addition, in-situ mining can be done from the surface using dissolving agents on the ore body and retrieving the ore via pumping. The pumped material is then set to leach for further processing. Hydraulic mining is utilized as water jets to wash away either overburden or the ore itself.

===Mining process===
; Blasting
: Explosives are used to break up a rock formation and aid in the collection of ore in a process called blasting. Blasting generally the heat and immense pressure of the detonated explosives to shatter and fracture a rock mass. The type of explosives used in mining is high explosives, which vary in composition and performance properties. The mining engineer is responsible for selecting and properly placing these explosives to maximize efficiency and safety. Blasting occurs in many phases of the mining process, such as the development of infrastructure and the production of the ore. An alternative to high explosives are Cardox blasting cartridges, invented in 1931, and extensively used from 1932 in coal mines. The cartridge contains an &#x27;energizer&#x27; which heats liquid carbon dioxide until it ruptures a bursting disk; then, a physical explosion of the supercritical fluid.
; Leaching
: Leaching is the loss or extraction of certain materials from a carrier into a liquid (usually, but not always, a solvent). Mostly used in rare-earth metal extraction.
; Flotation
: Flotation (also spelled floatation) involves phenomena related to the relative buoyancy of minerals. It is the most widely used metal separating method.
; Electrostatic separation
: Separating minerals by electro-characteristic differences.
; Gravity separation
: Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension or dry granular mixture, where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical.
; Magnetic separation
: Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.
; Hydraulic separation
: Hydraulic separation is a process that uses the density difference to separate minerals. Before hydraulic separation, minerals were crushed into uniform sizes; minerals with uniform sizes and densities will have different settling velocities in water, which can be used to separate target minerals.

==Mining health and safety==

Legal attention to health and safety in mining began in the late 19th century. In the 20th century, it progressed to a comprehensive and stringent codification of enforcement and mandatory health and safety regulation. In whatever role, a mining engineer must follow all mine safety laws.

===United States===
The United States Congress, through the passage of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, known as the Miner&#x27;s Act, created the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the US Department of Labour. The act provides miners with rights against retaliation for reporting violations, consolidated regulation of coal mines with metallic and non-metallic mines, and created the independent Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission to review violations reported to MSHA.

The act codified in Code of Federal Regulations § 30 (CFR § 30) covers all miners at an active mine. When a mining engineer works at an active mine, they are subject to the same rights, violations, mandatory health and safety regulations, and compulsory training as any other worker at the mine. The mining engineer can be legally identified as a &quot;miner&quot;.

The act establishes the rights of miners. The miner may report at any time a hazardous condition and request an inspection. The miners may elect a miners&#x27; representative to participate during an inspection, pre-inspection meeting, and post-inspection conference. The miners and miners&#x27; representatives shall be paid for their time during all inspections and investigations.

==Environmental concerns==

Waste and uneconomic material generated from the mineral extraction process are the primary source of pollution in the vicinity of mines. Mining activities, by their nature, cause a disturbance of the natural environment in and around which the minerals are located. Mining engineers should therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral commodities but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area.

<text>Bulería (; interchangeable with the plural, bulerías) is a fast flamenco rhythm made up of a 12 beat cycle with emphasis in two general forms as follows:
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
This may be thought of as a measure of followed by a measure of (known as hemiola).

For dancers, it is commonly viewed with a compas or bar of 6 counts as opposed to 12. 

Flamenco Bulerías with emphasis as [[Bulerías|[12]]] 1 2 [[Bulerías|[3]]] 4 5 [[Bulerías|[6]]] 7 [[Bulerías|[8]]] 9 [[Bulerías|[10]]] 11

An interesting counting method has been used by Pepe Romero, in his book &quot;Classical Guitar Style and Technique&quot;, which is 2 measures of time followed by 3 measures of time. This puts the emphasis on the last beat of each measure:&lt;br&gt;
When performed, the &quot;bulería&quot; always starts on beat twelve of the &quot;compas&quot;, so the accented beat is heard first.
It is normally played at 195-240 beats per minute, most commonly in an A-phrygian mode (por medio) with a sharpened third to make A major the root chord. A typical &quot;rasgueado&quot; pattern involves only the A and B chords, were golpes are used to accent the chords as follows:

[A] — — B] — — [B] —[B] —[A]— 
Although professional players often intersperse other chords, in more traditional playing variations of chords from the Andalusian cadence are utilised and modern players, influenced by jazz may use a greater variety of chord patterns and variations. 

&lt;br&gt;
It originated among the Calé Romani people of Jerez during the 19th century, originally as a fast, upbeat ending to &quot;soleares&quot; or &quot;alegrias&quot;. It is among the most popular and dramatic of the flamenco forms and often ends any flamenco gathering. The name bulerías comes from the Spanish word burlar, meaning &quot;to mock&quot; or bullería, &quot;racket, shouting, din&quot;. It is the style which permits the greatest freedom for improvisation, the metre playing a crucial role in this. Speed and agility are required and total control of rhythm as well as strength in the feet which are used in intricate tapping with toe, heel and the ball of the foot. &lt;br&gt;(See also tap dance.)

== &quot;Cante&quot; (singing) ==

When sung, the &quot;bulería&quot; has three or four octosyllabic lines. It is sometimes subdivided into &quot;bulerías al golpe&quot; and &quot;bulerías ligadas&quot;. The former is slower while the latter is frantic.

There are many styles of Buleria depending on the region of Spain from which it originated. For example: Buleria de Lebrija, Buleria de Jerez (possibly the most commonly used style), Buleria de Cadiz, Buleria de Utrera etc.

<text>Alegrías () is a flamenco palo or musical form, which has a rhythm consisting of 12 beats. It is similar to Soleares. Its beat emphasis is as follows: 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11 [12]. Alegrías originated in Cádiz. Alegrías belongs to the group of &quot;palos&quot; called Cantiñas and it is usually played in a lively rhythm (120-170 beats per minute). The livelier speeds are chosen for dancing, while quieter rhythms are preferred for the song alone.

One of the structurally strictest forms of flamenco, a traditional dance in alegrías must contain each of the following sections: a salida (entrance), paseo (walkaround), silencio (similar to an adagio in ballet), castellana (upbeat section) zapateado (literally &quot;a tap of the foot&quot;) and bulerías. This structure though, is not followed when alegrías are sung as a standalone song (with no dancing). In that case, the stanzas are combined freely, sometimes together with other types of cantiñas.

Recommended listenings for this &quot;palo&quot; include most singers from Cádiz, like Chano Lobato, La Perla de Cádiz, Aurelio Sellés, but also general singers like Manolo Caracol or La Niña de los Peines.

Also, you can listen &quot;Mar Amargo&quot; from Camarón and &quot;La Tarde es Caramelo&quot; from Vicente Amigo.

It is one of the cante chico forms of flamenco. The word Alegrías literally means &quot;joys.&quot;

<text>José Mercé (born José Soto Soto in 1955 in Jerez de la Frontera) is a Spanish flamenco singer. As a 12-year-old he performed at flamenco festivals. Later he moved to Madrid where he recorded his first album in 1968.
== Family ==

He is the great-grandson of nineteenth-century seguiriya maestro Francisco Valencia, whose nickname was Paco la Luz.

He is also the nephew of Manuel Soto Sordera, the patriarch of Jerez flamenco. Mercé&#x27;s nickname comes from his participation in the choir of the Basilica de la Merced when he was a boy.

== Production ==

The youthful Mercé became one of the most sought-after singers for accompanying dance, and he has worked with the Trío Madrid, formed by Mario Maya, El Güito and Carmen Mora. From 1973 to 1983 he joined the company of Antonio Gades, with which he travelled half-way around half the world and took part in the film &quot;Bodas de Sangre&quot;, by Carlos Saura.

He has also worked with guitarists Enrique De Melchor, Tomatito, Vicente Amigo and Moraito.

<text>José Fernández Torres (born Fondón, 1958), known professionally as Tomatito, is a Spanish roma flamenco guitarist and composer. Having started his career accompanying famed flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla (with Paco de Lucía), he has made a number of collaborative albums and six solo albums, two of which have won Latin Grammy Awards.

==Biography==

===Beginnings, Camarón de la Isla===
Jose Fernandez Torres grew up in a musical family, which included two guitar playing uncles: Niño Miguel, a flamenco guitarist, and Antonio, a professional guitarist.

Tomatito, who had been playing clubs in Andalucía, became a flamenco sensation when he was discovered by guitarist Paco de Lucía. He accompanied legendary flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla for two decades. With Paco and Camarón he recorded four albums, and had a 1979 hit called &quot;La Leyenda del Tiempo&quot;. Their album &quot;Paris 87&quot; won a Latin Grammy for best flamenco album in 2000. Their partnership continued until Camarón&#x27;s death in 1992.

===Later career===
Tomatito&#x27;s music blends traditional flamenco and jazz. On some albums, such as &quot;Barrio Negro,&quot; he experimented with Afro-Cuban and Brazilian Music. He has also worked with flamenco singers Duquende and Potito and pianist Chano Domínguez, among others. A collaboration with pianist Michel Camilo produced the albums &quot;Spain&quot; (2000), which won a Latin Grammy, and &quot;Spain Again&quot; (2006).

Tomatito has produced six solo albums. His 2005 album &quot;Aguadulce&quot; won a Latin Grammy for best flamenco album, and in 2010 he won his second solo Latin Grammy for &quot;Sonanta Suite&quot;.

His music for the film &quot;Vengo&quot;, directed by Tony Gatlif, won the César Award for Best Music Written for a Film in 2001.

On March 11, 2019, he was awarded by the Premio Flamenco Radio of Canal Sur.

==Style and instruments==
Tomatito incorporates elements of jazz in his style of flamenco; both, he says, &quot;emerged as a response to discrimination, a cry of suffering, or the joy of liberation&quot;. Half of what he plays is improvised, he said. He frequently employs the Phrygian mode, and his favorite tuning is D, A, D, G, B♭, D.

He plays guitars made by Manuel Reyes, and uses (and endorses) strings by Savarez.

<text>José Monje Cruz (5 December 1950 – 2 July 1992), better known by his stage name Camarón de la Isla, was a Spanish Romani flamenco singer. Considered one of the all-time greatest flamenco singers, he was noted for his collaborations with Paco de Lucía and Tomatito, and the three of them were of major importance to the revival of flamenco in the second half of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
He was born in San Fernando, Cádiz, Spain, into a Spanish Romani family, the seventh of eight children. His mother was Juana Cruz Castro, a &quot;Canastera&quot;, literally a basket weaver, and meaning from a wandering Roma family, and whose gift of singing was a strong early influence.

His father, Juan Luis Monje, was also a singer as well as a blacksmith, and had a forge where Camarón worked as a boy. His uncle José nicknamed him &quot;Camarón&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Shrimp&quot;) because he was blonde and fair skinned.

When his father died of asthma, while still very young, the family went through financial hardship. At the age of eight he began to sing at inns and bus stops with Rancapino to earn money. At sixteen, he won first prize at the Festival del Cante Jondo in Mairena del Alcor. Camarón then went to Madrid with Miguel de los Reyes and in 1968 became a resident artist at the Tablao Torres Bermejas, where he remained for twelve years.

== Musical career ==

During his time at Tablao Torres Bermejas, he met Paco de Lucía, with whom he recorded nine albums between 1969 and 1977. The two toured extensively together during this period. As Paco de Lucía became more occupied with solo concert commitments, &quot;Camarón&quot; worked with the flamenco guitarist Tomatito.

In 1976, at the age of 25, Camarón married Dolores Montoya, a Romani girl from La Línea de la Concepción whom he nicknamed &quot;La Chispa&quot; (The Spark). At the time La Chispa was 16. The couple had four children.

Many consider Camarón to be the single most popular and influential flamenco &quot;cantaor&quot; (singer) of the modern period. In his recordings and collaborations, he sought to incorporate contemporary elements and expand the appeal of flamenco, for example by recording with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, whilst staying true to the genre&#x27;s roots. Although his work was criticized by some traditionalists, he was one of the first to feature an electric bass in his songs. This was a turning point in the history of Flamenco music that helped distinguish Nuevo Flamenco.

When Camarón was already a recognised artist, internationally acclaimed for his authenticity and depth, he received an offer from the Rolling Stones. Mick Jagger personally wanted them to play together. According to his biographer Alfonso Rodríguez, Camarón said: &quot;If they don&#x27;t know anything about flamenco, what am I going to sing for them?&quot; Mick Jagger called him several times and offered him a lot of money, but Camaron preferred to stay in Andalusia and not complicate his life.

He also turned down an offer from the Gipsy Kings to be part of their tour of Latin America. According to his wife, Dolores Montoya, La Chispa, they offered him &quot;a Mercedes convertible, 50 million pesetas and insurance for what could happen&quot; and he turned it down. For him, his family was the main priority.

== Health issues and death ==
In later years, his health deteriorated due to heavy smoking and some level of drug abuse.

In 1992, Camarón de la Isla died of lung cancer in Badalona, Spain. He was buried in a Catholic ceremony at the cemetery of San Fernando as he wanted. It was estimated that 100,000 people attended his funeral.

== Posthumous awards and recognitions ==
On 5 December 2000 the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía posthumously awarded to Camaron the &#x27;Llave de Oro del Cante&#x27;, the Golden Key of Flamenco. This was only the fourth key awarded since 1862.

In 2005, film director Jaime Chávarri released the biopic &quot;Camarón&quot; in Spain starring Óscar Jaenada as Camarón and Verónica Sánchez as La Chispa. The film, produced in consultation with Camarón&#x27;s widow, was subsequently nominated for several Goya Awards.

In 2006, Isaki Lacuesta directed &quot;La Leyenda del Tiempo&quot; (The Legend of Time), in which a Japanese woman visits Camarón&#x27;s birthplace to learn to sing exactly like him.

In 2018, the documentary film &quot;Camarón: Flamenco y Revolución&quot; (Camarón: The Film), from the Spanish director Alexis Morante, was released through Netflix. In an interview, the director would say that one of his goals with the film was &quot;to explain how the myth was built&quot;.

In 2021 a museum devoted to the singer was opened in San Fernando.

<text>A trilemma is a difficult choice from three options, each of which is (or appears) unacceptable or unfavourable. There are two logically equivalent ways in which to express a trilemma: it can be expressed as a choice among three unfavourable options, one of which must be chosen, or as a choice among three favourable options, only two of which are possible at the same time.

The term derives from the much older term &quot;dilemma&quot;, a choice between two or more difficult or unfavourable alternatives. The earliest recorded use of the term was by the British preacher Philip Henry in 1672, and later, apparently independently, by the preacher Isaac Watts in 1725.

== In religion ==
=== Epicurus&#x27; trilemma ===

One of the earliest uses of the trilemma formulation is that of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, rejecting the idea of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God (as summarised by David Hume):

# If God is unable to prevent evil, then he is not all-powerful.
# If God is not willing to prevent evil, then he is not all-good.
# If God is both willing and able to prevent evil, then why does evil exist?

Although traditionally ascribed to Epicurus and called Epicurus&#x27; trilemma, it has been suggested that it may actually be the work of an early skeptic writer, possibly Carneades.

In studies of philosophy, discussions, and debates related to this trilemma are often referred to as being about the &quot;problem of evil&quot;.

===Apologetic trilemma===

One well-known trilemma is sometimes used by Christian apologists considered a proof of the divinity of Jesus, and is most commonly known in the version by C. S. Lewis. It proceeds from the premise that Jesus claimed to be God, and that therefore one of the following must be true:

# &quot;Lunatic&quot;: Jesus was not God, but he mistakenly believed that he was.
# &quot;Liar&quot;: Jesus was not God, and he knew it, but he said so anyway.
# &quot;Lord&quot;: Jesus is God.

The trilemma, usually in Lewis&#x27; formulation, is often used in works of popular apologetics, although it is almost completely absent from discussions about the status of Jesus by professional theologians and biblical scholars.

== In law ==

=== The &quot;cruel trilemma&quot; ===

The &quot;cruel trilemma&quot; was an English ecclesiastical and judicial weapon developed in the first half of the 17th century, and used as a form of coercion and persecution. The format was a religious oath to tell the truth, imposed upon the accused prior to questioning. The accused, if guilty, would find themselves trapped between:
# A breach of religious oath if they lied (taken extremely seriously in that era, a mortal sin), as well as perjury;
# Self-incrimination if they told the truth; or
# Contempt of court if they said nothing and were silent.

Outcry over this process led to the foundation of the right to not incriminate oneself being established in common law and was the direct precursor of the right to silence and non-self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

== In philosophy ==

=== The Münchhausen trilemma ===

In the theory of knowledge the Münchhausen trilemma is an argument against the possibility of proving any &quot;certain&quot; truth even in the fields of logic and mathematics. Its name is going back to a logical proof of the German philosopher Hans Albert.
This proof runs as follows: All of the only three possible attempts to get a certain justification must fail:
# All justifications in pursuit of &quot;certain&quot; knowledge have also to justify the means of their justification and doing so they have to justify anew the means of their justification. Therefore, there can be no end. We are faced with the hopeless situation of an infinite regression.
# One can stop at self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or speaking &quot;ex cathedra&quot; or at any other evidence, but in doing so the intention to install &quot;certain&quot; justification is abandoned.
# The third horn of the trilemma is the application of a circular argument.

=== The trilemma of censorship ===
In John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;On Liberty&quot;, as a part of his argument against the suppression of free speech, he describes the trilemma facing those attempting to justify such suppression (although he does not refer to it as a trilemma, Leo Parker-Rees (2009) identified it as such).
If free speech is suppressed, the opinion suppressed is either:
# True – in which case society is robbed of the chance to exchange error for truth;
# False – in which case the opinion would create a &#x27;livelier impression&#x27; of the truth, allowing people to justify the correct view;
#Half-true – in which case it would contain a forgotten element of the truth, that is important to rediscover, with the eventual aim of a synthesis of the conflicting opinions that is the whole truth.

===Buddhist Trilemma===
The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna uses the trilemma in his &quot;Verses on the Middle Way&quot;, giving the example that:

* a cause cannot follow its effect
* a cause cannot be coincident with its effect
* a cause cannot precede its effect

== In economics ==

=== &quot;The Uneasy Triangle&quot; ===
In 1952, the British magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; published a series of articles on an &quot;Uneasy Triangle&quot;, which described &quot;the three-cornered incompatibility between a stable price level, full employment, and ... free collective bargaining&quot;. The context was the difficulty maintaining external balance without sacrificing two sacrosanct political values: jobs for all and unrestricted labor rights. Inflation resulting from labor militancy in the context of full employment had put powerful downward pressure on the pound sterling. Runs on the pound then triggered a long series of economically and politically disruptive &quot;stop-go&quot; policies (deflation followed by reflation). John Maynard Keynes had anticipated the severe problem associated with reconciling full employment with stable prices without sacrificing democracy and the associational rights of labor. The same incompatibilities were also elaborated upon in Charles E. Lindblom&#x27;s 1949 book, &quot;Unions and Capitalism&quot;.

=== The &quot;impossible trinity&quot; ===

In 1962 and 1963, a trilemma (or &quot;impossible trinity&quot;) was introduced by the economists Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming in articles discussing the problems with creating a stable international financial system. It refers to the trade-offs among the following three goals: a fixed exchange rate, national independence in monetary policy, and capital mobility. According to the Mundell–Fleming model of 1962 and 1963, a small, open economy cannot achieve all three of these policy goals at the same time: in pursuing any two of these goals, a nation must forgo the third.

=== Wage policy trilemmas ===
In 1989 Peter Swenson posited the existence of &quot;wage policy trilemmas&quot; encountered by trade unions trying to achieve three egalitarian goals simultaneously. One involved attempts to compress wages within a bargaining sector while compressing wages between sectors and maximizing access to employment in the sector. A variant of this &quot;horizontal&quot; trilemma was the &quot;vertical&quot; wage policy trilemma associated with trying simultaneously to compress wages, increase the wage share of value added at the expense of profits, and maximize employment. These trilemmas helped explain instability in unions&#x27; wage policies and their political strategies seemingly designed to resolve the incompatibilities.

=== The Pinker social trilemma ===
Steven Pinker proposed another social trilemma in his books &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; and &quot;The Blank Slate:&quot; that a society cannot be simultaneously &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;free&quot;, and &quot;equal&quot;. If it is &quot;fair&quot;, individuals who work harder will accumulate more wealth; if it is &quot;free&quot;, parents will leave the bulk of their inheritance to their children; but then it will not be &quot;equal&quot;, as people will begin life with different fortunes.

=== The political trilemma of the world economy ===
Economist Dani Rodrik argues in his book, &quot;The Globalization Paradox&quot;, that democracy, national sovereignty, and global economic integration are mutually incompatible. Democratic states pose obstacles to global integration (e. g. regulatory laws, taxes and tariffs) to protect their own economies. Therefore, if we need to achieve complete economic integration, it is necessary to also remove democratic nations states. A government of some nation state could possibly pursue the goal of global integration on the expense of its own population, but that would require an authoritarian regime. Otherwise, the government would be likely replaced in the next elections.

=== Holmström&#x27;s theorem ===

In &quot;Moral Hazard in Teams&quot;, economist Bengt Holmström demonstrated a trilemma that arises from incentive systems. For any team of risk-neutral agents, no incentive system of revenue distribution can satisfy all three of the following conditions: Pareto efficiency, balanced budget, and Nash stability. This entails three optimized outcomes:
# Martyrdom: the incentive system distributes all revenue, and no agent can improve their take by changing their strategy, but at least one agent is not receiving reward in proportion to their effort.
# Instability: the incentive system distributes all revenue, and all agents are rewarded in proportion to their effort, but at least one agent could increase their take by changing strategies.
# Insolvency: all agents are rewarded in proportion to their effort, and no shift in strategy would improve any agent&#x27;s take, but not all revenue is distributed.

=== Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem ===

In social choice theory, economist Kenneth Arrow proved that it is impossible to create a social welfare function that simultaneously satisfies three key criteria: Pareto efficiency, non-dictatorship and independence of irrelevant alternatives.

== In politics ==
===The Brexit trilemma===

Following the Brexit referendum, the first May government decided that not only should the United Kingdom leave the European Union but also that it should leave the European Union Customs Union and the European Single Market. This meant that a customs and regulatory border would arise between the UK and the EU. Whilst the sea border between Great Britain and continental Europe was expected to present manageable challenges, the UK/EU border in Ireland was recognised as having rather more intractable issues. These were summarised in what became known as the &quot;Brexit trilemma&quot;, because of three competing objectives: no hard border on the island; no customs border in the Irish Sea; and no British participation in the European Single Market and the European Union Customs Union. It is not possible to have all three.

=== The Zionist trilemma ===

Zionists have often desired that Israel be democratic, have a Jewish identity, and encompass (at least) the land of Mandatory Palestine. However, these desires (or &quot;&quot;) seemingly form an inconsistent triad, and thus a trilemma. Palestine has an Arab majority, so any democratic state encompassing all of Palestine would likely have a binational or Arab identity.

However, Israel could be:

* Democratic and Jewish, but not in all of Palestine. 
* Democratic and in all of Palestine, but not Jewish.
* Jewish and in all of Palestine, but not democratic.

This observation appears in &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem&quot; (1989), by Thomas Friedman, who attributes it to the political scientist (historically, the &#x27;trilema&#x27; is inexact since early Zionist activists often (a) believed that Jews would migrate to Palestine in sufficiently large numbers; (b) proposed forms of bi-national governance; (c) preferred forms of communism over democracy).

=== The Žižek trilemma ===

The &quot;Žižek trilemma&quot; is a humorous formulation on the incompatibility of certain personal virtues under a constraining ideological framework. Often attributed to the philosopher Slavoj Žižek, it is actually quoted by him as the product of an anonymous source:

One cannot but recall here a witty formula of life under a hard Communist regime: Of the three features—personal honesty, sincere support of the regime and intelligence—it was possible to combine only two, never all three. If one were honest and supportive, one was not very bright; if one were bright and supportive, one was not honest; if one were honest and bright, one was not supportive.
== In business ==

=== The project-management trilemma ===

Arthur C. Clarke cited a management trilemma encountered when trying to achieve production quickly and cheaply while maintaining high quality. In the software industry, this means that one can pick any two of: fastest time to market, highest software quality (fewest defects), and lowest cost (headcount). This is the basis of the popular project management aphorism &quot;Quick, Cheap, Good: Pick two,&quot; conceptualized as the project management triangle or &quot;quality, cost, delivery&quot;.

=== The trilemma of an encyclopedia ===
The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; is said to have overcome the trilemma that an encyclopedia cannot be authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date all at the same time for any significant duration.

== In computing and technology ==

===In data storage===
The RAID technology may offer two of three desirable values: (relative) inexpensiveness, speed or reliability (RAID 0 is fast and cheap, but unreliable; RAID 6 is extremely expensive and reliable, with correct performance and so on). A common phrase in data storage, which is the same in project management, is &quot;fast, cheap, good: choose two&quot;.

The same saying has been pastiched in silent computing as &quot;fast, cheap, quiet: choose two&quot;.

In researching magnetic recording, used in hard drive storage, a trilemma arises due to the competing requirements of readability, writeability and stability (known as the Magnetic Recording Trilemma). Reliable data storage means that for very small bit sizes the magnetic medium must be made of a material with a very high coercivity (ability to maintain its magnetic domains and withstand any undesired external magnetic influences). But this coercivity must be overridden by the drive head when data is written, which means an extremely strong magnetic field in a very tiny space, but the size occupied by one bit of data eventually becomes so small that the strongest magnetic field able to be created in the space available, is not strong enough to allow data writing. In effect, a point exists at which it becomes impractical or impossible to make a working disk drive because magnetic writing activity is no longer possible on such a small scale. Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR) are technologies that aim to modify coercivity during writing only, to work around the trilemma..

=== In anonymous communication protocols ===
Anonymous communication protocols can offer two of the three desirable properties: strong anonymity, low bandwidth overhead, low latency overhead.

Some anonymous communication protocols offer anonymity at the cost of high bandwidth overhead, that means the number of messages exchanged between the protocol parties is very high. Some offer anonymity with the expense of latency overhead (there is a high delay between when the message is sent by the sender and when it is received by the receiver). There are protocols which aims to keep the bandwidth overhead and latency overhead low, but they can only provide a weak form of anonymity.

=== In clustering algorithms ===
Kleinberg demonstrated through an axiomatic approach to clustering that no clustering method can satisfy all three of the following fundamental properties at the same time:

# Scale Invariance: The clustering results remain the same when distances between data points are proportionally scaled.
# Richness: The method can produce any possible partition of the data.
# Consistency: Changes in distances that align with the clustering structure (e.g., making closer points even closer) do not alter the results.

===Other (technology)===
The CAP theorem, covering guarantees provided by distributed systems, and Zooko&#x27;s triangle concerning naming of participants in network protocols, are both examples of other trilemmas in technology.

<text>Moraíto Chico (born Manuel Moreno Junquera; 13 September 1956 – 10 August 2011) was a Flamenco guitarist.

He was known as one of the best and most in-demand accompanying guitarists of his generation, and regularly accompanied José Mercé, Diego Carrasco and other popular flamenco singers. He also performed often with such stars as La Paquera de Jerez, Camarón de la Isla and Manuel Agujetas. Moraito was particularly renowned for his powerful, full, and round sound, his driving rhythmic style and impressive &quot;rasgueos&quot;. He was one of the finest exponents of the &quot;buleria&quot; form and can be seen and heard playing in this style on Carlos Saura&#x27;s influential &#x27;Flamenco&#x27; and &quot;Flamenco, Flamenco&#x27; films.

Moraito was the nephew of the original Moraíto (Manuel Moreno a.k.a. Manuel Morao), and son of the original Moraíto Chico (Juan Moreno). His son, Diego Del Morao, is one of the best known of the current generation of Flamenco guitarists.

He died on 10 August 2011, after a long struggle with cancer.

== Works ==

He has recorded two solo albums:

* &quot;Morao, Morao&quot;
* &quot;Morao y Oro&quot;

Moraito also participated in an instructional video and scores booklet (now published as a DVD) with Encuentro Publications which included in the first part of the video / DVD five selected pieces from his repertoire: two Bulerías, Sevillanas, Tangos and Vals-Bulerías. The second part was devoted to Moraíto&#x27;s speciality: together with singer Fernando Terremoto (also deceased), Moraíto focused on basic principles and difficulties of the accompaniment of cante using Malagueñas, Seguiriyas and Tientos/Tangos.

<text>The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) was an historic railway which operated in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Originally the parent company for, and later a division of, BC Electric Company (now BC Hydro), the BCER assumed control of existing streetcar and interurban lines in southwestern British Columbia in 1897, and operated the electric railway systems in the region until the last interurban service was discontinued in 1958. During and after the streetcar era, BC Electric also ran bus and trolleybus systems in Greater Vancouver and bus service in Greater Victoria; these systems subsequently became part of BC Transit, and the routes in Greater Vancouver eventually came under the control of TransLink. Trolley buses still run in the City of Vancouver with one line extending into Burnaby.

==History==

Streetcar and interurban services were inaugurated in southwestern British Columbia between 1890 and 1891, operated by the following companies:
* National Electric Tramway and Lighting Company Limited, which launched the streetcar service in Victoria on February 22, 1890;
* Vancouver Electric Railway and Light Company Limited, which launched Vancouver&#x27;s streetcar system on June 27, 1890 ; and
* Vancouver &amp; Westminster Tramway Company, which launched New Westminster&#x27;s streetcar system on October 8, 1891, as well as the Vancouver–New Westminster interurban line (via Central Park in Burnaby) in the same year.

With the global depression in the 1890s, all three companies went into receivership, and were amalgamated in 1895 into the Consolidated Railway and Light Company. The newly founded company was forced into receivership again after a streetcar accident in Victoria (the Point Ellice Bridge Disaster) resulted in 55 deaths, and was reorganized as the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited in April 1897.

==Power supply==
Power was supplied by then-innovative diversion projects at Buntzen Lake and on the Stave River system farther east, all of which were built primarily to supply power for the interurbans and street railway.

==Interurban rail lines==

Vancouver–Marpole

BCER began the Vancouver-Steveston interurban and freight service in 1905 after leasing the line from Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and electrifying it. The Vancouver-Marpole line&#x27;s right-of-way (whose northern section runs beside Arbutus Street) remained under the ownership of the CPR, which continued running freight trains on the corridor until June 2001. With the end of freight operations on the line in sight, Vancouver City Council adopted the &quot;Arbutus Corridor Official Development Plan&quot; in 2000, designating the corridor as a transportation/greenway public thoroughfare to prevent other types of development from taking place along the right-of-way.

Marpole–Steveston (Lulu Island Branch)

The Steveston line&#x27;s alignment on Lulu Island can be traced by Railway Avenue, Granville Avenue, Garden City Road, and Great Canadian Way. After the end of passenger service in 1958 the Granville and Garden City section of the line was relocated largely parallel to River Road north of Westminster Highway.

Marpole–New Westminster

Interurban service between Marpole and New Westminster along the North Arm of the Fraser River was started in 1909. Still in operation today, as part of the Southern Railway of British Columbia.

New Westminster–Chilliwack (Fraser Valley Branch)

Opened October 4, 1910 (also used by freight) and still in operation today, as part of the Southern Railway of British Columbia. This line made use of the New Westminster Bridge, opened in 1904.

 Burnaby Lake Line

The Burnaby Lake line&#x27;s right-of-way is largely taken up by the Trans-Canada Highway, but sections of it survive as walking and biking trails.

Central Park Line

Following the cessation of interurban services on the Central Park Line, the right-of-way remained under the control of BC Hydro. By 1975, the Greater Vancouver Regional District proposed incorporating the right-of-way into a light rail line linking Vancouver and New Westminster, thereby reinstating passenger rail service on the corridor. The provincial government eventually took over the project, which evolved into the Vancouver SkyTrain&#x27;s Expo Line.

New Westminster–Queensborough

The tracks from New Westminster to Queensborough and the &#x27;Railway Bridge&#x27; across the north arm of the Fraser River are still in operation today, as part of the Southern Railway of British Columbia.

New Westminster – Fraser Mills

Opened in 1912, construction of ramps leading to and from the new Pattullo Bridge resulted in the closure of the Queensborough and Fraser Mills lines in 1937, as well as the truncation of the Burnaby Lake line to Sapperton.

Victoria – Deep Bay

Now called Deep Cove, the Victoria to Deep Cove line (1913), was one of three passenger railways to serve the Saanich Peninsula, and was closed on November 1, 1924, due to low ridership. The Victoria-Deep Cove interurban&#x27;s alignment can be traced by Burnside Road, Interurban Road and the Interurban Rail Trail, West Saanich Road, Wallace Drive, Aldous Terrace, Mainwaring Road, one of Victoria International Airport&#x27;s runways, and Tatlow Road to Deep Cove. Besides the stretch through the airport, the stretch at the Experimental Farm (now called the Sidney/Centre for Plant Health) has also been blocked.

Stave Lake

A steam train branch line, the Stave Falls Branch, (constructed during the building of the original Stave Falls hydroelectric plant) was isolated from the main interurban network, and linked the power plant and community at Stave Falls to the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Ruskin. The route of the Stave Falls Branch along Hayward Lake is also now a walking trail managed by BC Hydro and the District of Mission, with sections of it south of Ruskin Dam used as local powerline and neighbourhood walking trails.

Port Moody–Coquitlam

The Port Moody-Coquitlam Railway connected the Port Moody – Ioco spur of the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Coquitlam Dam in order to haul supplies and materials to the dam.

Alouette Lake

Similar to the Stave Lake and Port Moody-Coquitlam lines, the Alouette Lake dam tracks connected power facilities to the CPR that ran on the north side of the Fraser River at Kanaka Creek in Haney.

Jordan River

This 5.3-mile railway connected the powerhouse and harbour at the mouth of the Jordan River to the Jordan River Dam.

==&quot;Rails-to-Rubber&quot; transition==

BCER ended streetcar service in New Westminster on December 5, 1938. The company then announced its &quot;Rails-to-Rubber&quot; conversion programme on September 30, 1944, with North Vancouver&#x27;s last streetcar service and two of Vancouver&#x27;s streetcar lines ending in April 1947, and Victoria&#x27;s streetcar service ending on July 4, 1948. In Vancouver, many streetcar lines were converted to trolley buses, with the first route of BCER&#x27;s Vancouver trolley bus system opening on 16 August 1948. 
The Chilliwack line ceased service in 1950, followed by the Vancouver-Marpole line in 1952 and the Burnaby Lake line in 1953. The stretch of the Central Park line in Burnaby and New Westminster was closed on October 23, 1953, followed by the rest of the line through Vancouver on July 16, 1954. The last streetcar line in Vancouver, the 14 Hastings East, ran on April 22, 1955. The Marpole-New Westminster interurban line was closed in 1956, followed by the Marpole-Steveston line on February 28, 1958, marking the complete closure of the interurban system.

In 1961, the provincial government took over BC Electric, with the railway becoming a division of Crown corporation BC Hydro. In August 1988, BC Hydro sold their freight division which included rolling stock and rails and the rights to run freight trains through Fraser Valley Subdivision, not the corridor, to a company known as Itel of Chicago who resold it to a new shortline operator and the railway is now known as the Southern Railway of British Columbia and is exclusively a freight railway.

At the time, BC Hydro did not specifically reserve rights to operate passenger rail service using Southern Railway of British Columbia&#x27;s facilities, but did retain the ability to grant operating rights to others, including to providers of passenger rail service, that do not materially interfere with Southern Railway of British Columbia&#x27;s operations.

In addition, BC Hydro in 1988 also sold the track assets of a section between Cloverdale from Pratt Junction through Langley City and beyond to CP Rail, but retained ownership of the right-of-way. At the time, BC Hydro also granted CPR a statutory right-of-way to use this section of the corridor in perpetuity, but put agreements in place to retain partial running rights for passenger service, which were renewed in 2009.

While there has been a number proposals regarding the restart of a commuter passenger rail service along the line, a review was conducted by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in 2010. The review noted issues around high cost per ride and low projected ridership relative to bus alternatives.

Subsequently, TransLink conducted a study as part of the 2010–2012 Surrey Rapid Transit Study to explore merits of utilizing the Interurban corridor for fast, frequent, and reliable rapid transit service. The interurban corridor was not selected, nor recommended for further consideration because the corridor does not directly connect relevant regional destinations of Surrey Central and Langley City, resulted in less attractive travel times between key destinations, and would require significant capital investments to meet safety requirements and reliability objectives compared to alternatives.

In particular, TransLink noted that the routing of the interurban line does not directly connect to the largest regional centre in the South of Fraser – Surrey Metro Centre – which is expected to be the focus of future population and employment growth, and the current alignment is indirect and through lower density and diverse areas, with a low ridership catchment near potential stations. Also, TransLink estimated that the interurban estimated travel times are not competitive with rapid transit along Fraser Highway or King George Boulevard, with transit times estimated to be around 63 minutes to travel between Langley and Surrey Central, which is double that of a possible bus rapid transit line or a Skytrain route along the Fraser Highway. Finally, TransLink has indicated that freight traffic along the line is expected to increase along the corridor, due to increased traffic at the Port of Metro Vancouver, in particular the Roberts Bank Superport.

==Remaining BCER cars==
After the decommission of the BCER streetcar and interurban system, most of the cars were either scrapped or burned underneath the Burrard Bridge, but some cars were sold for various other uses such as becoming bunkhouses, storage sheds and in some cases decor. A handful of cars were also donated to various museums mostly in the U.S. Since then however, many preservation societies have bought back the cars and begun restoring them. The following is a list of the known BCER cars in existence and their current locations (as of January 2016).

<text>Vicente Amigo Girol (born 25 March 1967) is a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist, born in Guadalcanal near Seville. He has played as an accompanying guitarist on recordings by flamenco singers Camarón de la Isla, and Luis de Córdoba, and he has acted as a producer for Remedios Amaya and José Mercé. His album &quot;Ciudad de las Ideas&quot; won the 2001 Latin Grammy for the Best Flamenco Album and the 2002 Ondas award for the best Flamenco work.

== Biography ==
Amigo was raised in Córdoba, where he took guitar lessons and later improved his playing with Manolo Sanlúcar, with whom he worked for ten years. After a period of accompaniment which began with El Pele, he devoted himself almost exclusively to playing concerts in 1988. &quot;De Mi Corazón al Aire&quot; (&quot;From Out of My Heart&quot;, 1991) was his first solo record. An admirer of Paco de Lucía since childhood, Amigo took part with him in the show Leyendas de la guitarra (Legends of the Guitar) in Seville.

Amigo has worked with Amaia Montero, Khaled, Miguel Bosé, Carmen Linares, Manolo Sanlúcar, Wagner Tiso, Rosario, Nacho Cano, Alejandro Sanz, Sting, Paco de Lucía, Stanley Jordan, John McLaughlin, Al Di Meola, and Milton Nascimento.

<doc id="488391" wikidata="Q17098298" url="?curid=488391" title="Jacobson density theorem">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically non-commutative ring theory, modern algebra, and module theory, the Jacobson density theorem is a theorem concerning simple modules over a ring .

The theorem can be applied to show that any primitive ring can be viewed as a &quot;dense&quot; subring of the ring of linear transformations of a vector space. This theorem first appeared in the literature in 1945, in the famous paper &quot;Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions&quot; by Nathan Jacobson. This can be viewed as a kind of generalization of the Artin-Wedderburn theorem&#x27;s conclusion about the structure of simple Artinian rings.

==Motivation and formal statement==
Let be a ring and let be a simple right -module. If is a non-zero element of , (where is the cyclic submodule of generated by ). Therefore, if are non-zero elements of , there is an element of that induces an endomorphism of transforming to . The natural question now is whether this can be generalized to arbitrary (finite) tuples of elements. More precisely, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the tuple and separately, so that there is an element of with the property that for all . If is the set of all -module endomorphisms of , then Schur&#x27;s lemma asserts that is a division ring, and the Jacobson density theorem answers the question on tuples in the affirmative, provided that the are linearly independent over .

With the above in mind, the theorem may be stated this way:

:The Jacobson density theorem. Let be a simple right -module, , and a finite and -linearly independent set. If is a -linear transformation on then there exists such that for all in .

==Proof==
In the Jacobson density theorem, the right -module is simultaneously viewed as a left -module where , in the natural way: . It can be verified that this is indeed a left module structure on . As noted before, Schur&#x27;s lemma proves is a division ring if is simple, and so is a vector space over .

The proof also relies on the following theorem proven in p. 185:

:Theorem. Let be a simple right -module, , and a finite set. Write for the annihilator of in . Let be in with . Then is in ; the -span of .

===Proof of the Jacobson density theorem=== 
We use induction on . If is empty, then the theorem is vacuously true and the base case for induction is verified.

Assume is non-empty, let be an element of and write If is any -linear transformation on , by the induction hypothesis there exists such that for all in . Write . It is easily seen that is a submodule of . If , then the previous theorem implies that would be in the -span of , contradicting the -linear independence of , therefore . Since is simple, we have: . Since , there exists in such that .

Define and observe that for all in we have:

:formula_1

Now we do the same calculation for :

:formula_2

Therefore, for all in , as desired. This completes the inductive step of the proof. It follows now from mathematical induction that the theorem is true for finite sets of any size.

==Topological characterization==
A ring is said to act densely on a simple right -module if it satisfies the conclusion of the Jacobson density theorem. There is a topological reason for describing as &quot;dense&quot;. Firstly, can be identified with a subring of by identifying each element of with the linear transformation it induces by right multiplication. If is given the discrete topology, and if is given the product topology, and is viewed as a subspace of and is given the subspace topology, then acts densely on if and only if is dense set in with this topology.

==Consequences==
The Jacobson density theorem has various important consequences in the structure theory of rings. Notably, the Artin–Wedderburn theorem&#x27;s conclusion about the structure of simple right Artinian rings is recovered. The Jacobson density theorem also characterizes right or left primitive rings as dense subrings of the ring of -linear transformations on some -vector space , where is a division ring.

==Relations to other results==
This result is related to the Von Neumann bicommutant theorem, which states that, for a *-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space , the double commutant can be approximated by on any given finite set of vectors. In other words, the double commutant is the closure of in the weak operator topology. See also the Kaplansky density theorem in the von Neumann algebra setting.

<doc id="488393" wikidata="Q185580" url="?curid=488393" title="FA Vase">
<text>The Football Association Challenge Vase, also known as the [[Isuzu]] FA Vase for sponsorship reasons, is an annual football competition run by and named after The Football Association (The FA), for teams playing in Steps 5 and 6 of the English National League System. Nearly 600 teams participate in this knockout competition with semi-finals played over two legs. The final is played at Wembley Stadium.

The 2024 winners were Romford, who beat Great Wakering Rovers 3–0 at Wembley Stadium.

== History ==
Until 1974, football players were categorised as either professionals or amateurs. Amateurs were not paid (at least not officially) by their clubs; amateur clubs had their own national cup competition, the FA Amateur Cup. Professionals were paid to play by their clubs; until the creation of the FA Trophy in 1969 there was no national knock-out competition specifically for professional clubs outside the Football League. 

In 1974, with many of the top amateur players receiving payment for playing, the Football Association abolished the distinction, scrapped the Amateur Cup and introduced the FA Vase for the majority of clubs who had previously played in the competition. Well over 200 clubs entered in the first season, 1974–75, when Hoddesdon Town of the Spartan League beat Epsom &amp; Ewell of the Surrey Senior League 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium before a crowd of 9,000.

In September 2021 Hinckley AFC set a new record score in the competition, beating St Martins 18–0.

== Eligibility ==

In recent years, entry to the FA Vase has been restricted to clubs in the ninth and lower tiers of the English football league system (those in the four levels above the ninth qualified for the FA Trophy). Reorganisation of the National League System for 2004 onwards moved the dividing line down to the new &quot;Step 5&quot; (ninth tier overall). Clubs from the Channel Islands (First Tower United, St. Martins and Vale Recreation) and the Isle of Man (Douglas HSOB) also entered the Vase in the past. Guernsey F.C., who were formed in 2011 and played in the &quot;Step 5&quot; Combined Counties League, gained entry for the 2012–13 season and reached the semi-finals.

===Exemptions===
*Eligible teams who played in the FA Vase the previous season and participated in the fourth round proper are exempt from qualifying, and start play in the second round proper of the Vase, unless they were promoted to a Step 4 league. (If they were promoted, they would play for the FA Trophy instead.)
*Those teams that lost in the third round proper the previous season are, unless promoted to the Trophy, exempt until the first round proper.

== Finals==
Only five teams have won the FA Vase more than once. Whitley Bay are the only team to win the FA Vase three times in successive seasons, while Billericay Town, Tiverton Town and Halesowen Town have won back-to-back titles. As of 2017–18, at least one Northern League team has reached the final for 10 consecutive seasons, with teams from the league winning the title in all but two of those years. In 2017 Forest Green Rovers became the first FA Vase winners to go on to play in the English Football League, while one former Football League team (Glossop North End) have been beaten finalists.

==Media coverage==
BT Sport showed the 2016 FA Vase Final between Hereford and Morpeth Town live on 22 May as part of a double-header along with the 2016 FA Trophy Final. This has continued in more recent years.

<text>The Konkan is a stretch of land by the western coast of India, bound by the river Daman Ganga at Damaon in the north, to Anjediva Island next to Karwar town in the south; with the Arabian Sea to the west and the Deccan plateau to the east. The hinterland east of the coast has numerous river valleys, riverine islands and the hilly slopes known as the Western Ghats; that lead up into the tablelands of the Deccan. The region has been recognised by name, since at least the time of Strabo in the third century CE. It had a thriving mercantile port with Arab tradesmen from the 10th century. The best-known islands of Konkan are Ilhas de Goa, the site of the Goa state&#x27;s capital at Panjim; also, the Seven Islands of Bombay, on which lies Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra and the headquarters of Konkan Division.

== Definition ==
Historically, the limits of Konkan have been flexible, and it has been known by additional names like &quot;Aparanta&quot; and &quot;Gomanchal&quot;, the latter being defined as the coastal area between the Daman Ganga River in the north and the Gangavalli River in the south.

The ancient &quot;Sapta Konkan&quot; was a larger geographical area that extended from Gujarat to Kerala and included the whole region of coastal Maharashtra and coastal Karnataka Tulunad. However, this segment overlaps the Konkan, Tulunad coast and Malabar coast continuum; and usually corresponds to the southernmost and northernmost stretches of these locales respectively.

== Etymology ==
According to the &quot;Sahyadrikhanda&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, Parashurama threw his axe into the sea and commanded the Sea God to recede up to the point where his axe landed. The new piece of land thus recovered came to be known as &quot;Saptah-Konkana&quot;, meaning &quot;piece of earth&quot;, &quot;corner of the earth&quot;, or &quot;piece of the corner&quot;, derived from Sanskrit words: &quot;koṇa&quot; (कोण, corner) + &quot;kaṇa&quot; (कण, piece). Xuanzang, the noted Chinese Buddhist monk, mentioned this region in his book as &quot;Konkana Desha&quot;; Varahamihira&#x27;s Brihat-Samhita described Konkan as a region of India; and 15th-century author Ratnakosh mentioned the word Konkandesha.

== Geography ==

The Konkan extends throughout the western coasts of Maharashtra, and Goa. It is bounded by the Western Ghats mountain range (also known as Sahyadri) in the east, the Arabian Sea in the west, the Daman Ganga River in the north, and the River Aghanashini in the south. The Gangavalli flows in the district of Uttara Kannada in present-day Karnataka. Its northern bank constitutes the southernmost portion of Konkan. The towns of Karwar, Ankola, Kumta, Honavar, and Bhatkal fall within the Konkan coast. The largest city on the Konkan coast is Mumbai, the state capital of Maharashtra. Districts on the Konkan coast are, from north to south:
*Damaon district
* Palghar district
* Thane district
* Mumbai Suburban district
* Mumbai City district
* Raigad district
* Ratnagiri district
* Sindhudurg district
* North Kanara(Karwar to Bhatkal)

== Ethnology ==
The main ethnolinguistic group of the Konkan region is the Konkani people. Specific caste and communities found in the region are the Aagri, Koli, Bhandari, Kunbi, Maratha, Gabit, Mangela, Karadi, Phudagi, Vaiti, Kharvi, Teli, Kumbhar, Nhavi, Dhobi, Kasar, Sutar, Lohar, Chambhar, Mahar, Dhangar, Gaud Saraswat Brahmin (also includes Rajapur Saraswats and Chitrapur Saraswats), Kudaldeshkar, Pathare Prabhu, Gomantak Maratha, Chitpavan Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivadnya, Kayastha Prabhu, Panchkalshi, Vani, Komarpant, Vadval Gavli, Ghorpi, Nath Jogi, Gurav, Pagi, Kalan, Ghadi, Padti, Vanjari, Namdev Shimpi and others. Billava, Bunt, Nadavara, Mogaveera and Linghayat communities found in the parts of Karnataka which are near to Konkan.

Tribal communities include the Katkari, Thakar, Konkana, Warli and Mahadev Koli, mainly found in the northern and central parts of Konkan. The Dubla and Dhodia tribes live in southern Gujarat, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Palghar district of Maharashtra. Palghar district has the largest percentage of tribal population in Konkan. A small nomadic tribe called the Vanarmare is found in southern parts of Konkan, which was originally associated with the hunting of monkeys. The Gauda and Velip tribes are found in Goa.

The Jewish community called Bene Israel is mainly found in Raigad district. The Christians included Bombay East Indians in North Konkan and Mumbai, Goan Catholics in Goa, Karwari Catholics in Uttara Kannada as well as Mangalorean Catholics in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada.

Major Muslim communities like Konkani Muslims and Nawayaths are scattered throughout the whole region. They are reportedly descendants of people who came from Hadhramaut (in Yemen or South Arabia), and other parts of Arabia and the Middle East. The Siddis have their roots in Africa.

<text>The Tank, Infantry, Mk IV (A22) Churchill was a British infantry tank used in the Second World War, best known for its heavy armour, large longitudinal chassis with all-around tracks with multiple bogies, its ability to climb steep slopes, and its use as the basis of many specialist vehicles. It was one of the heaviest Allied tanks of the war.

The origins of the Churchill&#x27;s design lay in the expectation that war in Europe might be fought in conditions similar to those of the First World War, and thus emphasised the ability to cross difficult ground. The Churchill was hurried into production in order to build up British defences against a possible German invasion. The first vehicles had flaws that had to be overcome before the Churchill was accepted for wide use. After several marks (versions) had been built, a better-armoured specification, the Mark VII, entered service with the British Army. The improved versions performed well in the later stages of the war.

The Churchill was used by British and other Commonwealth forces during the North African, Italian and North-West Europe campaigns. In addition, 344 Churchills were sent as military aid to the Soviet Union during the Second World War and more than 250 saw active service on the Eastern Front.

==Name==
The Churchill tank was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Winston Churchill told Field Marshal Jan Smuts &quot;That is the tank they named after me when they found out it was no damn good!&quot;

The name only incidentally matched what became the British Army practice of giving service names beginning with C to tanks. Cruiser tanks were given names, such as the contemporary Covenanter, Crusader, Cromwell, Cavalier and Comet but infantry tank naming had no particular pattern. However, this fact was not largely known by the public, which called the tanks &quot;Churchill&#x27;s children&quot;

==History==
===A20===

Initially specified just before the outbreak of the Second World War, the A20 (its General Staff specification) was to supplement the Matilda II and Valentine infantry tanks. In accordance with British infantry tank doctrine and based on the expected needs of attacking a fixed defensive line, crossing wide trenches, possibly shell-cratered ground similar to First World War trench warfare it was to be immune to the current German 3.7 cm Pak 36 anti-tank guns and carry an unditching beam.

A general outline produced by Woolwich Arsenal was expanded by Belfast shipbuilders Harland &amp; Wolff with advice from the Department of Tank Design. The General Staff had proposed that it was armed with two QF 2 pounder guns, each located in a side sponson with a coaxial Besa machine gun. A third Besa and a smoke projector would be fitted in the front hull. To reduce weight the specification was revised to prefer a maximum armour to the front of 60 mm – sufficient to protect against ordinary shells from the German 37 mm gun. Outline drawings were produced by Woolwich Arsenal based on the A12 Matilda turret – the Director of Mechanisation opposed a turretless design – and the engine and Wilson epicyclic transmission being developed for the A13 Mark III Covenanter tank. Detail design and construction of the A20 was left to Harland &amp; Wolff, who completed four prototypes by June 1940. During the construction period, the armament was reconsidered, including fitting either a 6-pounder gun or the French short 75 mm gun (as used on Char B1) in the forward hull – the former was considered too long and the latter would require redesigning the front of the hull. In the end, a 3-inch howitzer was chosen. The A20 designs were short-lived, however, as at roughly the same time the defeated British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk. While intended for &quot;positional warfare&quot; and direct assaults against fortifications (it was referred to as &quot;Shelled Area Tank&quot;, or by the French phrase &quot;Char de Fortresse&quot;) which had been rendered pointless by the fast pace of German armoured warfare, a heavy tank that could defend the infantry from other tanks was still desired.

At an initial 32 tons, with a 300 hp flat-12 Meadows DAV engine, the A20 had limited power compared to the 16-ton Covenanter. This was a less serious limitation than it might appear, owing to the British distinction between the high-speed cruiser tanks and the slow-speed infantry tanks. Vauxhall, who were already involved as consultants on the suspension, were approached to see if they could build the A20 and one example was sent to Vauxhall at Luton to see if they could provide an alternative engine developing 350 bhp. To this end, they developed a flat-12 petrol engine. For speed of production, this engine was based on a Bedford Vehicles (Vauxhall&#x27;s commercial vehicle operations) six-cylinder lorry engine, giving rise to its name of &quot;Twin-Six&quot;. Although using sidevalves to fit within the space, the engine was developed with high squish pistons, dual ignition and sodium-cooled exhaust valves in Stellite seats to give 350 bhp.

===A22===
With France lost, the scenario of trench warfare in Northern Europe was no longer applicable and the design was revised by Dr H. E. Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, based on the combat witnessed in Poland and France. These new specifications, for the A22 or Infantry Tank Mark IV, were given to Vauxhall in June 1940.

With a German invasion of Britain looking imminent, and the loss of a substantial amount of military vehicles in the evacuation from France, the War Office specified that the A22 had to enter production within a year. By July 1940, the design was completed and by December of that year the first prototypes were completed; in June 1941, almost exactly a year as specified, the first Churchill tanks began rolling off the production line.

A leaflet from the manufacturer was added to the User Handbook, which also described known faults, with work-arounds and what was being done to correct the problem. It said:

Harold Drew of Vauxhall achieved miracles with the Churchill and its Merrit-Brown Tank Gearbox produced by David Brown Limited; &quot;a brilliant design that went into production off the drawing board without adequate prototype testing and had the most disastrous teething troubles&quot; according to Robotham, but British tanks were under-powered, under-gunned and unreliable. At the Tank Board level the Director of Artillery was still extolling the merits of the 2-pounder, and this gun was still fitted to every British tank until March 1942. In a 1942 exercise, one tank had to have its gearbox changed five times.

Because of its hasty development, there had been little testing and the Churchill was plagued with mechanical faults. Most apparent was that the Churchill&#x27;s engine was underpowered, unreliable, and difficult to access for servicing. Another serious shortcoming was the tank&#x27;s inadequate armament, the 2 pounder (40 mm) gun, which was improved by the addition of a 3-inch howitzer in the hull to deliver a HE shell, albeit not on a howitzer&#x27;s usual high trajectory.

Production of a turret to carry the QF 6 pounder gun began in 1941, but lack of supplies of the plate used in an all-welded design led to an alternative cast turret also being produced. These formed the distinction between Mark III and Mark IV.

In August 1942, the Churchill was used offensively for the first time in the Dieppe Raid.

The poor speed of the Churchill nearly caused production to be ceased in favour of the forthcoming Cromwell tank; it was saved by the successful use of the Mk III at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942.

The second major improved Churchill, the Mk VII, was first used in the Battle of Normandy in 1944. The Mk VII improved on the already heavy armour of the Churchill with a wider chassis and the British 75 mm gun, which had been introduced on the Mk VI. It was primarily this variant, the A22F, which served through the remainder of the war. It was re-designated A42 in 1945.

The Churchill was a versatile project and was used in numerous specialist roles.

==Design==

The hull was made up of simple flat plates, which were bolted together in earlier models and were welded in later models. The hull was split into four compartments: the driver&#x27;s position at the front, then the fighting compartment including the turret, the engine compartment, and the gearbox compartment. The suspension was fitted under the two large &quot;panniers&quot; on either side of the hull, the track running over the top. There were eleven bogies either side, each carrying two 10-inch wheels. Only nine of the bogies normally took the vehicle weight, the front coming into play when the vehicle nosed into the ground or against an obstacle, the rear acting in part as a track tensioner. Due to the number of wheels, the tank could survive losing several without much in the way of adverse effects as well as traversing steeper terrain obstacles. As the tracks ran around the panniers, escape hatches in the side could be incorporated into the design. These were retained throughout the revisions of the Churchill and were of particular use when the Churchill was adopted as the AVRE.

The Bedford Vehicles engine was effectively two engines in horizontally opposed configuration (&quot;flat twelve&quot;) on a common crankshaft. There were four Solex carburettors each on a separate manifold that fed three cylinders formed as a single cylinder head. The elements of the engine and ancillary components were laid out so they could be reached for maintenance through the engine deck covers. Air for the engine was drawn from the fighting compartment through air cleaners. Cooling air was drawn into the engine compartment through louvres on the sides, across the radiators and through the engine compartment by a fan driven by the clutch. This fan blew the air over the gearbox and out the rear of the hull. By opening a flap between the fighting compartment and the engine compartment, this airflow could be used to remove fumes produced by firing the armament. The capacity engine was rated at at 2,200 rpm, delivering torque over an engine speed range from 800 to 1,600 rpm. With the introduction of the Churchill Mk vii and viii, the engine was uprated to at 2,200 rpm, presumably to counteract the increased weight.

The gearbox featured a regenerative steering system that was controlled by a tiller bar instead of the more commonplace brake levers or, as with the German Tiger I heavy tank, a steering wheel. The tiller was connected, with servo assistance, hydraulically to the steering brakes. The Churchill was also the first tank to utilise the Merritt-Brown triple differential gearbox, which allowed the tank to be steered by changing the relative speeds of the two tracks; this effect became more pronounced with each lower gear, ultimately allowing the tank to perform a &quot;neutral turn&quot; when no gear was engaged, where it could fully pivot within its own length and thus rotate in place. There were final reduction gears, of the planetary type, in the driving wheels. Although capable of the noise at that speed was so great that the Churchill was limited to by not using the highest gear.

The first turrets were of cast construction and were rounded in shape, providing sufficient space to accommodate the relatively small 2 pounder gun. To fulfil its role as an infantry support vehicle, the first models were equipped with a 3-inch howitzer in the hull in a layout very similar to the French Char B1. This enabled the tank to deliver a useful high-explosive capability while retaining the anti-tank capabilities of the 2 pounder. However, like other multi-gun tanks, it was limited by a poor fire arc – the track horns limiting traverse – and elevation of only 9°. Despite the length of the gun the muzzle velocity was only . The Mark IVA (retrospectively the Churchill Mk II) dispensed with the howitzer (there had been only enough guns to equip 300 tanks) and replaced it with a bow machine gun and on the Mk III, the 2 pounder was replaced with the 6 pounder, significantly increasing the tank&#x27;s anti-tank capabilities. The tank underwent field modification in North Africa with several Churchills being fitted with the 75 mm gun of destroyed M4 Shermans. These &quot;NA75&quot; variants were used in Italy. The use of the 75mm increased despite its worse anti-tank performance when compared to the 6pdr due to the HE rounds used by the 75mm being considerably more effective when used in infantry support roles.

Churchills made use of the Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV. In the Mark VII, the driver had two periscopes as well as a vision port in the hull front that could be opened. The hull gunner had a single periscope as well as the sighting telescope on the BESA machine gun mounting. In the turret, the gunner and loader each had single periscope and the commander had two fitted in his hatch cupola.

The armour on the Churchill, often considered its most important feature, was originally specified to a minimum of and a maximum of ; this was increased with the Mk VII to a range from to . Though this armour was considerably thicker than its rivals (including the German Tiger I tank, but not the Tiger II) it was not sloped, reducing its effectiveness. Earlier models were given extra armour by the expedient of welding on extra plates.
On the Mark VII, the hull front armour was made up of a lower angled piece of , a nearly horizontal plate and a vertical 6 inch plate. The hull sides, were, for the most part, . The rear was and the hull top . The turret of the Mark VII was to the front and for the other sides. The turret roof was 0.79 (20 mm) thick. Plate was specified as IT 80, the cast sections as IT 90.

The A22F, also known as &quot;Heavy Churchill&quot;, was a major revision of the design. The most significant part was the use of welding instead of riveted construction. Welding had been considered earlier for the Churchill but, until its future was assured, this was no more than testing techniques and hulls at the firing ranges. What welding reduced in the overall weight (estimates were around 4%), the thicker armour of the A22F made up for. Welding also required fewer man-hours in construction. The hull doors changed from square to round which reduced stresses. A new turret went with the new hull. The sides, which included a flared base to protect the turret ring, were a single casting while the roof, which did not need to be so thick, was a plate fitted to the top.

Since the engines on the Churchill were never upgraded, the tank became increasingly slow as additional armour and armament was equipped and weight increased; while the Mk I weighed and the Mk III weighed , the Mk VII weighed . This caused a reduction in the tanks&#x27; maximum speed from its original down to .

Another problem was the tank&#x27;s relatively small turret that prevented the use of powerful weapons; definitive versions of the tank were armed with either the QF 6-pounder or the derivative QF 75 mm gun. The 6-pounder was effective against armoured vehicles, but less so against other targets; the 75 mm was a better all-round weapon, but lacked in effectiveness against armour. Although the Churchills with their 6-pounders could outgun many contemporary German medium tanks (like the Panzer IV with the short-barrel 75 mm gun, and the Panzer III armed with the 50 mm gun) and the thick armour of all Churchill models could usually withstand several hits from any German anti-tank gun, in the later years of the war the German Panther tank had a 75 mm high-velocity cannon as its main armament along with increased protection, against which the Churchills&#x27; own guns often lacked sufficient armour penetration to fight back effectively.

The Churchill had many variations, including many specialised modifications. The most significant change to the Churchill was that it was up-gunned from 2-pounder to 6-pounder and then 75 mm guns over the course of the war. By the war&#x27;s end, the late model Churchill Mk VII had exceptional amounts of armour – considerably more than the German Tiger tank. However, the firepower weakness was never fully addressed. The Mark VII turret that was designed for the 75 mm gun was of composite construction – cast with top and bottom plates welded into position.

While it had weaknesses, the Churchill could cross terrain obstacles that most other tanks of its era could not. This capacity frequently proved useful, especially during the fighting in Normandy. One action in Normandy where the tank&#x27;s ability to surmount obstacles was found to be of value was the capture of Hill 309 on 30/31 July 1944 (Operation Bluecoat) conducted by VIII Corps.

==Production==

The Churchill tank was produced with Vauxhall as the design parent. Subcontracted work on some tanks was provided by Whessoe Foundry &amp; Engineering, Metropolitan‑Cammell Carriage &amp; Wagon, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Newton, Chambers &amp; Company and the Gloucester Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company; the latter two produced some complete vehicles. Other contractors produced hulls and turrets which went to Vauxhall, Charles Roberts &amp; Co, and Dennis Brothers for final assembly.

In March and April 1942, Vauxhall stopped producing new tanks. Together with Broom &amp; Wade (at High Wycombe) they started rebuilding earlier tanks; about 700 of the first 1,000 built were included in this scheme. The reworked tanks got an &quot;R&quot; as a suffix to their WD number. Changes to the hull air intakes and the full length mudguards were the most obvious changes.

Turrets for the earliest Marks were single piece castings. One thousand were supplied from the United States: 600 complete from General Steel and 400 from American Steel Foundries that were finished by other companies before shipping to UK.

==Service history==
===Dieppe Raid===
The Churchill first saw combat on 19 August 1942, in the Dieppe Raid in France. The Dieppe raid was planned to temporarily take control of the French port of Dieppe using a strong force of about 6,000 troops – mostly drawn from inexperienced Canadian units. The operation, codenamed Jubilee, would test the feasibility of opposed landings. Nearly 60 Churchill tanks from the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)) were allocated to support the infantry and commandos; they would be put ashore by Landing Craft Tank vessels, along with the supporting engineers. Some problems were anticipated and allowed for: waterproofing of the hulls, canvas carpets (&quot;Bobbin&quot;) to aid the tanks crossing the short stretch of shingle beach, engineer teams to demolish road blocks and a few of the tanks were fitted with flame-throwers. The tanks, a mix of Mark I with hull howitzers, Mark II (three with flamethrowers) and Mark III (some with Bobbin), were expected to enter the town and reach a nearby airfield before retiring back to the beach to be taken off by the LCTs. Half of the tank force would be held in reserve offshore.

In the event, the German defences were stronger than expected. The beach was chert which included larger stones than the anticipated shingle: according to history professor Hugh Henry, the German defenders had previously considered it impassable to tanks. Only the 30 Churchills in the first two waves of 10 LCTs were landed on the beach under heavy fire: the latter two waves were turned away. One Churchill was trapped in its LCT by shellfire. Of the 29 remaining (eight Mark I/IIs, three Oke flamethrower tanks, and 18 Mark IIIs), two sank en route to shore, and 11 were immobilized on the beach due to a combination of the chert shingle and indirect fire. Only 15 would get off the beach and over the sea wall onto the Dieppe promenade. Although these tanks were effective in engaging the defenders in the town&#x27;s buildings, their further progress was blocked by concrete defences; the engineer demolition teams – killed or pinned on the beach – had not been able to accompany the tanks. Ten of these Churchills were able to return to the beach once the withdrawal had been signalled but they could not be evacuated. According to Henry, no Churchills were penetrated by German anti-tank fire while still manned. These surviving tank crews fought to cover the withdrawal of the infantry from the beach, and almost all were captured with their vehicles, having exhausted their main gun ammunition. The tank regiment&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Johnny Andrews, was among those killed in action. Nearly 70% of the Canadians were killed, injured or captured and none of the raid&#x27;s objectives were met other than the secret raid on the radar station on a headland.

===North Africa===

Two Mark II had been sent to North Africa for trials and they were joined by six Mk III Churchills (with the 6 pounder) to form the Special Tank Squadron commanded by Major Norris King. They saw action in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. This detachment, called &quot;Kingforce&quot;, supported the attack of 7th Motor Brigade first with three tanks at Kidney Ridge (where one was hit &quot;repeatedly&quot; by anti-tank gun fire (including &quot;friendly fire&quot; from a British gun) and another took &quot;a lot of punishment&quot;), then the remaining five at Tell-el-Aqqaqir. The Churchills were fired on many times by Italian and German anti-tank guns, but only one was knocked out and partially caught fire. One tank was said to have been hit up to 80 times.

Kingforce, formed to test whether the Churchills could operate in Africa, was considered too slow to participate in the chase after the retreating Axis, sent back to Alexandria and disbanded after El Alamein. This seems unlikely, as firstly the Churchill has the same top speed as the Valentine tanks that the 8th Army did use on this advance and secondly; the tanks would have been loaded onto tank transporters such as the Scammell Pioneer to transport them any strategic distance in a reasonable time, without the fuel consumption and wear and tear of driving tanks hundreds of kilometres. It is more likely that Kingforce was disbanded as the trial was limited only to the battle of El Alemain and when that ended, the six tanks of Kingforce were earmarked to go to a Brigade that was operating Churchill tanks, of which the 8th Army had no such brigades. The 25th Army Tank Brigade of three regiments was sent to Africa, and went into action in February 1943 during the Tunisian campaign. It was followed by 21st Army Tank Brigade.

Churchill tanks took part in containing the German offensive of Operation Ochsenkopf in February – March 1943. At the battle of Steamroller Farm, two Churchill Mk III tanks of 51 RTR got ahead of their squadron. They came across an entire German transport column, which they ambushed and completely shot up before they rejoined. The result was the destruction of two 88 mm, two 75 mm and two 50 mm, four lesser anti-tank guns, 25 wheeled vehicles, two 3-inch mortars, two Panzer III tanks and infliction of nearly 200 casualties.

A Churchill tank in a hull down defensive position made a particular contribution to Allied success. In one encounter, on 21 April 1943, during the start of the Battle of Longstop Hill, a Churchill tank of the 48th Royal Tank Regiment got the better of a German Tiger I heavy tank. A 6 pounder shot from the Churchill lodged between the Tiger&#x27;s turret and turret ring, jamming the turret and injuring the German crew. They abandoned the Tiger, which was subsequently captured by the British. Known as Tiger 131, this was the first Tiger captured by the Western Allies and was particularly useful for intelligence. Tiger 131 has since been restored to full working condition and is now on display at The Tank Museum in Dorset, UK. As of early 2021, it is the only working Tiger tank in the world.

===Italy===
Churchill tanks were not initially used in the Italian mainland in 1943. There were six regiments with Churchills in Tunisia, these may have been kept out because Montgomery preferred the Sherman or because their 6-pdr guns were not considered suitable for the fighting in Italy. Churchills did land in Italy in April/May 1944 with 75mm gun armed Churchills arriving later.
As the mainstay of the Tank Brigades, which operated in support of the infantry, Churchill units were in operation more often than other tank units.

The Churchill NA75s, Churchill Mark IVs converted to carry the US 75 mm gun, were used in Italy. As the Churchill proved to be a better gun platform than the Sherman, the effective range of the 75 mm was increased.

===North-West Europe===
Churchills saw widespread action in Normandy during the Battle of Hill 112 and Operation Bluecoat, as well as subsequent operations in the Low Countries and into Germany, such as the fighting in the Reichswald during Operation Veritable.

The Churchill was able to cross the muddy ground and force through the forests of the Reichswald; a contemporary report expressed the belief that no other tank could have managed the same conditions.

===Burma and India===
A single Churchill, possibly a Mk V, was trialled in Burma in 1945. It was operated by the 3rd Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers) from the end of April 1945 for about a month. Although it proved impossible to bring the Churchill into action, on approach marches the tank proved at least the equal to the M3 Lee then in service.

The 254th Indian Tank Brigade returned to India from Burma, arriving at Ahmednagar during July 1945. The brigade immediately began conversion from the Lee to the Churchill, the intention being for the newly equipped brigade to return to operations in October 1945. At the time, it was assumed that the war against Japan would continue and that the new battleground would be Malaya. Although a small number of tanks were delivered, and some training undertaken, the end of the war against Japan meant that the conversion was not completed. At the end of September, the 254th Indian Tank Brigade was reassigned and posted away from Ahmednagar. All the Churchills delivered up to that point were returned to the Ordnance Depot at Kirkee (Khadki) by the end of November–early December 1945. Of the three regiments (battalions) involved, the 3rd Dragoon Guards accompanied the 254th Brigade when posted away while the 149th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps and the 150th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps were eventually disbanded at Ahmednagar on 28 February 1946, the majority of personnel already having been repatriated to the United Kingdom or posted to other units.

===Other theatres===
In mid-1944, at the request of Britain&#x27;s War Office, the Churchill was tested by the Australian Army, along with the M4 Sherman. The results were to be used to determine any modifications required for use in the tropics; Matildas were used as a reference point in the tests at Madang, New Guinea. The Churchill was found to be, overall, superior to the other tanks for jungle warfare.

It was not used in the Pacific War; only 46 of the 510 Churchills ordered by Australia were delivered by the end of the war, and the remainder of the order was cancelled.

===Korean War and after===
During the Korean War, the United Kingdom deployed 20 Churchill tanks from C Company, 7th Royal Tank Regiment, and arrived on the Korean Peninsula along with its first-sent troops in November 1950. Most of these tanks were Mk. VII (A42) &#x27;Crocodile&#x27; flame-throwing tanks; despite being a flame-thrower, they were used like a regular tank. In addition, the Assault Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE), Armoured Recovery Vehicle (ARV), and Bridgelayers variants were brought together.

In action against the Chinese, they mostly fought as gun tanks, for example in the Third Battle of Seoul. To restore the 1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers&#x27; position during the defence of Seoul, Brigadier Thomas Brodie of the 29th Infantry Brigade sent four Churchill tanks as reinforcement; their contributions to the battle were widely praised by British and American historians.

The Churchill tank was briefly operated from 1950 to 1951, and withdrew in October 1951 from Korea. All Churchills were retired from the British Army in 1952.

===USSR===


The Soviet Union was sent 301 Churchill tanks (45 Mk II, 151 Mk III and 105 Mk IV) as part of the Lend-Lease programme. 43 of them (19 Mk II and 24 Mk III) were lost &quot;en route&quot; on the Arctic Convoys. Delivery of the first 25 units took place in May 1942, but adoption by the Red Army was delayed because of the 30 that were sent by June 1942, 20 had been lost in shipping.

The Churchill was not very popular in Soviet service. Soviet operators disliked the 2 pdr gun of the Mk II version (also used by Matildas and Valentines shipped to the USSR), and the tank was considered &quot;sufficient&quot; by inspectors, who warned that it was &quot;unrefined&quot; in terms of both design and production and would require constant maintenance in the field. Like Soviet heavy tanks, they were assigned to separate breakthrough tank regiments tasked with infantry support.

In 1942–1943, Churchills were used in the Battle of Stalingrad (47th and 48th regiments of heavy tanks – 42 Churchills). In 1943, the Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army used Churchills in the Battle of Prokhorovka (15th and 36th regiments of heavy tanks – 42 Churchills) during the Battle of Kursk, and in the Fourth Battle of Kharkov. It was also used in other battles until 1944 (82nd regiment of heavy tanks).

The Churchills were also employed at the Finnish front, and they took part on the capture of Viipuri 1944. The Finnish forces reported to have destroyed &quot;three heavy tanks of previously unknown type&quot;, which after the war were recognized as Churchill III tanks.

===Ireland===
The Irish Army took delivery of three Churchill Mk VI tanks in 1948 and a fourth in 1949. These were rented from the British War Office as trials vehicles until 1954, when they were purchased outright. This purchase was despite the fact that the supply and transport corps workshops, which maintained them, had reported that spares had all but run out. Experiments were carried out involving replacing the existing Bedford engine with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine salvaged from an Irish Air Corps Supermarine Seafire aircraft on one tank. The experiment was a success, but not followed up on the other tanks although the reasons are not recorded. By 1967, only one Churchill remained serviceable, and by 1969 all were retired. One remains preserved in the Curragh Camp.

== Variants ==



During the course of the war, as well as new production, older vehicles were reworked to bring them up to later standard. For example, 2-pdr turrets were replaced with the 6-pdr turret, and the improved commander&#x27;s cupola (with eight periscopes) introduced after the first Mark VII was applied to some earlier marks as well. Nearly 3,100 Churchills of all marks were rebuilt. Early tanks were produced before the Churchill name was attached and were retroactively known as Churchill Mark I etc.







The following Churchill variants saw primary use as battle tanks:

; Churchill I: 303 produced. Equipped with a 40 mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder gun in the turret with 150 rounds and a coaxial Besa machine gun. It was equipped with an Ordnance QF 3 inch howitzer in the hull, with 58 rounds, for use against infantry. It was a tank that was noted for poor mechanical reliability. This variant was used alongside Mark IIs and IIIs with Canadian forces on the Dieppe Raid and in Tunisia; some were still in use late in the war in Italy on the Gothic Line.

; Churchill Mk II: 1,127 produced. Replaced the hull howitzer with another machine gun to reduce cost and complexity. Sometimes referred to as &quot;Churchill Ia&quot;.
; Churchill Mk IICS: Close support. Placed the 2-pounder gun in the hull and the howitzer in the turret, available in very limited numbers. Sometimes called the &quot;Churchill II&quot;. Not used in combat.
; Churchill Mk III: 675 produced. The III was the first major armament overhaul of the series, eliminating the hull howitzer and equipping the tank with a more powerful Ordnance QF 6-pounder gun with 84 rounds. It had a new welded, &quot;cleaner&quot;, squarish turret (from Babcock &amp; Wilcox Ltd) unlike earlier versions. The availability of rolled armour plate limited the number that could be built – leading to the Mark IV. The first Mark to have &quot;catwalks&quot; over the upper track runs to protect the tracks; examples later upgunned with the QF 75 mm gun are known as the Churchill III*.
; Churchill Mk IV: 1,622 produced. The IV, the most numerous Churchill produced, was virtually identical to the III, the largest change being a return to the cheaper cast turret, keeping the welded turret&#x27;s &quot;clean&quot; squarish shape. A tank telephone was fitted to the rear of the tank for communication with infantry. In earlier models, turrets using the 6-pounder Mark V were fitted with a counterweight. Two hundred and ten were refitted in North Africa with US 75 mm guns taken from battle-damaged M4 Sherman tanks (the Churchill NA75&#x27;s), while others were up-gunned with British Ordnance QF 75 mm guns, creating the Mark IV (75). The QF 75 mm had a muzzle brake unlike the 6-pounder.
; Churchill Mk V: 241 produced. A Churchill equipped with a close support Ordnance QF 95 mm howitzer with 47 rounds in place of the main gun in a cast turret. The gun could fire smoke, HE, or HEAT round with a maximum range of . Produced from the Mark IV production run at about 1 in 10. The turret was similar to the Marks IV/VI turrets, with a slightly different opening for the gun in the turret front face.
; Churchill Mk VI: 200 produced. Along with several minor improvements, such as an additional collar at the turret base protecting the turret ring, it was produced as standard with the 75 mm Mark V gun. Few were built due to the impending release of the VII and concurrent up-gunning of the Marks III/IV.
; Churchill Mk VII (A22F): 1,600 produced, together with Mark VIII. The second big redesign, the VII used the 75mm gun, was wider and carried much more armour, 50 per cent thicker at the front than a Tiger I, giving it the ability to withstand massive amounts of punishment. It is sometimes called the &quot;Heavy Churchill&quot; and was given the specification number &quot;A42&quot; in 1945. This version of the Churchill first saw service in the Battle of Normandy and equipped three Royal Armoured Corps regiments in western Europe, one in Italy and with 7th Royal Tank Regiment in Korea. The Mark VII was designed to be able to be converted into the &quot;Crocodile&quot; flame-throwing variant without major modification.
; Churchill Mk VIII: 1,600 produced, together with Mark VII. A Churchill VII with a 95 mm howitzer and 47 rounds in a slightly different turret.
; Churchill Mk IX: Churchill III/IV upgraded with extra armour added to hull and turret, along with gearbox and suspension modifications. If the original turret was retained without added armour it was called LT (&quot;Light Turret&quot;).
; Churchill Mk X: The same improvements as for the IX applied to a Mk VI.
; Churchill Mk XI: The same improvements as for the IX applied to a MkV CS. Does not appear to have been built.
; Churchill NA75: 210 produced. Churchill IVs with 6-pounder guns replaced (under Operation Whitehot) by US 75 mm guns and mantlets from destroyed or scrapped Sherman tanks, fitted to Churchill IV cast turrets. Their performance was virtually identical to the VI. They were known as NA75 (North Africa 75) where the first conversions took place, after 48 Shermans with new guns had been disabled by mines. Some Mark IIIs were also modified, using Mark IV turrets. To fit the Sherman mantlet required cutting away the front of the Churchill turret before it was welded in place, then the mantlet slot had to be cut away to give sufficient elevation. The Sherman 75 mm gun was designed for a left hand loader and the Churchill, in common with British practice, had a right hand loader. The gun was turned upside down and the firing controls adapted. The conversion of about 200 tanks was carried out between March and June 1944 and the conversion project earned the officer in charge, Capt. Percy Morrell, an MBE and a promotion.

===Specialist vehicles===

In addition to the tanks, several specialist Churchill variants were developed, chiefly for combat engineering roles. The Churchill Assault Vehicle Royal Engineers was a Churchill III or IV armed with a spigot mortar demolition weapon which replaced the 6 pounder gun. The effective range of the 230mm high-explosive &quot;flying dustbin&quot; round was only around 80 yards of 230 yard maximum range. Crew was increased to six to accommodate a demolition NCO in addition to driver, commander, gunner, wireless operator, and co-driver/machine gunner. As well as the mortar ammunition it carried &quot;General Wade&quot; 26 lb explosive charge, and &quot;Beehive&quot; charges of up to 75 lbs of explosive. Both types of charge had to be set manually, but could be detonated from the relative safety of the AVRE interior. The AVRE could be fitted to carry different combat engineering equipment.

The Churchill Crocodile was a flamethrower tank which replaced the hull machine gun with a flamethrower and towed an armoured fuel trailer.

Churchills were converted to &quot;Kangaroo&quot; armoured personnel carriers by removing the turret from Churchills.

===Further development===

The Black Prince (General Staff specification A43) was a development of the Churchill design. In 1943, an attempt was made to produce a Churchill with the same 17 pounder anti-tank gun which was installed on the Sherman Firefly, the gun, a British modification of the American M4 Sherman, on a Churchill chassis and turret. It was known that insufficient numbers of the 17 pounder armed Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger were going to be produced in time for the invasion of Europe, and work was only starting on the Centurion cruiser design. Due to the wider turret ring required, Vauxhall had to redesign the hull though it used as much of the Churchill Mark VII as possible including retaining the Bedford Flat-12 engine which led to the heavier Black Prince being consequently much slower, going from 15 MPH (24 km/h) to 10.5 MPH onroad, and 7.5 mph offroad. This resulted in the &quot;Tank, Infantry, Black Prince (A43)&quot;. Six prototypes were built and delivered in May 1945 just as the war in Europe was ending. The test programme was completed but the project was cancelled due to the success of the new and less complicated Centurion Mark I, which offered the same armament and frontal armour, was faster and more manoeuvrable, and had just entered production. Two Black Princes currently survive. The one that is fully intact is No. 4 of the prototypes, and is displayed at The Tank Museum in Bovington. The second surviving Black Prince is only a hull, recovered from Salisbury plain in the 80s as part of the Tony Budge collection. It is now held as of today by the Rex and Rod Cadman collection. After the Black Prince, no more Churchills were developed, as the army had shifted in favour of the above-mentioned Centurion, which was mainly claimed as the first Main battle tank, and also, the British army was going through a change of doctrine, meaning large infantry tanks to support men were no longer needed on the front.

==Operators==
* Australia – retired, replaced with the Centurion main battle tank
* Canada – retired, replaced with the Centurion
* Czechoslovakia - 1st Czechoslovak armoured Independent Brigade
* India – retired
* Ireland – retired in 1969, replaced with the Comet cruiser tank
* Poland (Polish Armed Forces in the West) – retired in 1947 without replacement
* United Kingdom – retired from British Army service in 1952, replaced by the Centurion
* Soviet Union (Lend-Lease) – retired, replaced with IS-3 and T-10 heavy tanks
* Kingdom of Iraq – retired, replaced with the Centurion

==Surviving vehicles==

A number of Churchills still exist as gate guardians or war memorials, while many examples reside in museums. Jacques Littlefield&#x27;s Military Vehicle Technology Foundation in California, United States, acquired a Flail FV3902 &quot;Toad&quot; in its collection in 2008 after it was restored to full working order by RR Services in Kent, England; it was subsequently sold at auction and acquired by the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum. There are two Churchill Mark IVs at Normandy in France; one is residing at Lion-sur-Mer, while the other is located at Graye-sur-Mer.

The Churchill Trust is a project that aims to restore existing Churchills to their original condition and working order. So far, a Mark III AVRE with appliqué armour, salvaged from a firing range, and a post-war Mark IV Twin-ARK have been restored to running condition. The specialist equipment was removed and turrets were added, converting both tanks into their original variants. the project was in the process of restoring a Mark VII AVRE recovered from a range in northern England.

The Tank Museum in Bovington Camp, Dorset, England, currently has four Churchills in its collection: a Mark VII in The Tank Story Hall as a static exhibit, a working Mark III AVRE as a static display (currently located in the museum&#x27;s Conservation Hall), a Mark VI returned to the museum after the closure of the Isle of Wight Military History Museum (also currently located in the museum&#x27;s Conservation Hall) and a Mark II (with cosmetic alterations to make it appear as a Mark I) as an outdoor static display. The museum&#x27;s Mark VII was the last Mark VII produced; it went directly to the museum from the factory, and in terms of mileage, is virtually brand new. The Mark III AVRE was salvaged from a firing range marker as a complete wreck. It was restored to running order by Bob Grundy of Wigan and his Tracked Armour Group in August 1988. The museum also has the only surviving Black Prince prototype.

The Churchill Trust and the Tank Museum are not affiliated or associated with one another in any way; their tanks are different and owned separately, and the only common ground between both parties is that the Churchill Trust sometimes sends its tanks to participate in the Tank Museum&#x27;s annual Tankfest event. Additionally, the Churchill Trust&#x27;s tanks were all specialist vehicles, but were converted back into the standard turreted heavy tank variants during restoration. In 2018 the two parties concluded a long-term agreement that saw the Churchill Trust loan all three of its Churchills to the Tank Museum, with the III* becoming a permanent part of the museum&#x27;s fleet of running vehicles and the IV and VII being included in the museum&#x27;s Second World War exhibitions. The Churchill III* was restored in time for Tankfest 2019, and ran at the event.

The Cavalry Tank Museum, Ahmednagar. Maharashtra, India has one Churchill Mark VII, a Mark X (uparmoured Mk VI chassis; Mk VII turret; 75mm gun; Mk VII driver&#x27;s visor and MG mount), a Churchill bridgelayer and a Churchill ARV.

A Mk. VII Churchill Tank stands at the side of the Marine Highway, Carrickfergus, Co. Antrim. The restored vehicle was a gift to the Borough from the Trustees of the North Irish Horse Regimental Association.

A Churchill AVRE is also at the South African Armour Museum, situated at the Tempe Military Base, Bloemfontein, South Africa. The museum is hoping to restore it to running condition.

<doc id="488401" wikidata="Q1937950" url="?curid=488401" title="Sound design">
<text>Sound design is the art and practice of creating soundtracks for a variety of needs. It involves specifying, acquiring or creating auditory elements using audio production techniques and tools. It is employed in a variety of disciplines including filmmaking, television production, video game development, theatre, sound recording and reproduction, live performance, sound art, post-production, radio, new media and musical instrument development. Sound design commonly involves performing (see e.g. Foley) and editing of previously composed or recorded audio, such as sound effects and dialogue for the purposes of the medium, but it can also involve creating sounds from scratch through synthesizers. A sound designer is one who practices sound design.

==History==

The use of sound to evoke emotion, reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in prehistoric times when it was used in religious practices for healing or recreation. In ancient Japan, theatrical events called &quot;kagura&quot; were performed in Shinto shrines with music and dance.
Plays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, which used music and sound effects to enhance performances. The use of music and sound in the Elizabethan Theatre followed, in which music and sound effects were produced off-stage using devices such as bells, whistles, and horns. Cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time.

Italian composer Luigi Russolo built mechanical sound-making devices, called &quot;intonarumori,&quot; for futurist theatrical and music performances starting around 1913. These devices were meant to simulate natural and man-made sounds, such as trains or bombs. Russolo&#x27;s treatise, &quot;The Art of Noises&quot;, is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre. After his death, his intonarumori&#x27; were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects.

===Recorded sound===
Possibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a baby&#x27;s cry in a London theatre in 1890. Sixteen years later, Herbert Beerbohm Tree used recordings in his London production of Stephen Phillips’ tragedy NERO. The event is marked in the Theatre Magazine (1906) with two photographs; one showing a musician blowing a bugle into a large horn attached to a disc recorder, the other with an actor recording the agonizing shrieks and groans of the tortured martyrs. The article states: “these sounds are all realistically reproduced by the gramophone”. As cited by Bertolt Brecht, there was a play about Rasputin written in (1927) by Alexej Tolstoi and directed by Erwin Piscator that included a recording of Lenin&#x27;s voice. Whilst the term &quot;sound designer&quot; was not yet in use, some stage managers specialised as &quot;effects men&quot;, creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry, mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records. A great deal of care and attention was paid to the construction and performance of these effects, both naturalistic and abstract. Over the twentieth century recorded sound effects began to replace live sound effects, though often it was the stage manager&#x27;s duty to find the sound effects, and an electrician played the recordings during performances.

Between 1980 and 1988, Charlie Richmond, USITT&#x27;s first Sound Design Commissioner, oversaw efforts of their Sound Design Commission to define the duties, responsibilities, standards and procedures expected of a theatre sound designer in North America. He summarized his conclusions in a document which, although somewhat dated, provides a succinct record of what was then expected. It was subsequently provided to the ADC and David Goodman at the Florida USA local when they both planned to represent sound designers in the 1990s.

===Digital technology===

MIDI and digital audio technology have contributed to the evolution of sound production techniques in the 1980s and 1990s. Digital audio workstations (DAW) and a variety of digital signal processing algorithms applied in them allow more complicated soundtracks with more tracks and auditory effects to be realized. Features such as unlimited undo and sample-level editing allows fine control over the soundtracks.

In theatre sound, features of computerized theatre sound design systems have also been recognized as being essential for live show control systems at Walt Disney World and, as a result, Disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their &quot;Disney-MGM Studios&quot; theme park, which opened in 1989. These features were incorporated into the MIDI Show Control (MSC) specification, an open communications protocol for interacting with diverse devices. The first show to fully utilize the MSC specification was the Magic Kingdom Parade at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom in September 1991.

The rise of interest in game audio has also brought more advanced interactive audio tools that are also accessible without a background in computer programming. Some of such software tools (termed &quot;implementation tools&quot; or &quot;audio engines&quot;) feature a workflow that&#x27;s similar to that in more conventional DAW programs and can also allow the sound production personnel to undertake some of the more creative interactive sound tasks (that are considered to be part of sound design for computer applications) that previously would have required a computer programmer. Interactive applications have also given rise to many techniques in &quot;dynamic audio&quot; which loosely means sound that&#x27;s &quot;parametrically&quot; adjusted during the program&#x27;s run-time. This allows for a broader expression in sounds, more similar to that in films, because this way the sound designer can e.g. create footstep sounds that vary in a believable and non-repeating way and that also corresponds to what&#x27;s seen in the picture. The digital audio workstation cannot directly &quot;communicate&quot; with game engines, because the game&#x27;s events often occur in an unpredictable order, whereas traditional digital audio workstations as well as so called linear media (TV, film etc.) have everything occur in the same order every time the production is run. Especially, games have also brought in dynamic or adaptive mixing.

The World Wide Web has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly, easily and cheaply. Nowadays, a designer can preview and download crisper, more &quot;believable&quot; sounds as opposed to toiling through time- and budget-draining &quot;shot-in-the-dark&quot; searches through record stores, libraries and &quot;the grapevine&quot; for (often) inferior recordings. In addition, software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a DIY (or &quot;do-it-yourself&quot;) approach. From the comfort of their home and at any hour, they can simply use a computer, speakers and headphones rather than renting (or buying) costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing. This provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director.

==Applications==

===Film===

In motion picture production, a &quot;Sound Editor/Designer&quot; is a member of a film crew responsible for the entirety or some specific parts of a film&#x27;s soundtrack. In the American film industry, the title &quot;Sound Designer&quot; is not controlled by any professional organization, unlike titles such as Director or Screenwriter.

The terms &quot;sound design&quot; and &quot;sound designer&quot; began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969. At that time, The title of &quot;Sound Designer&quot; was first granted to Walter Murch by Francis Ford Coppola in recognition for Murch&#x27;s contributions to the film &quot;The Rain People&quot;. The original meaning of the title &quot;Sound Designer&quot;, as established by Coppola and Murch, was &quot;an individual ultimately responsible for all aspects of a film&#x27;s audio track, from the dialogue and sound effects recording to the re-recording (mix) of the final track&quot;. The term &quot;sound designer&quot; has replaced monikers like &quot;supervising sound editor&quot; or &quot;re-recording mixer&quot; for the same position: the head designer of the final sound track. Editors and mixers like Murray Spivack (&quot;King Kong&quot;), George Groves (&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;), James G. Stewart (&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), and Carl Faulkner (&quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;) served in this capacity during Hollywood&#x27;s studio era, and are generally considered to be sound designers by a different name.

The advantage of calling oneself a sound designer beginning in later decades was two-fold. It strategically allowed for a single person to work as both an editor and mixer on a film without running into issues pertaining to the jurisdictions of editors and mixers, as outlined by their respective unions. Additionally, it was a rhetorical move that legitimised the field of post-production sound at a time when studios were downsizing their sound departments, and when producers were routinely skimping on budgets and salaries for sound editors and mixers. In so doing, it allowed those who called themselves sound designers to compete for contract work and to negotiate higher salaries. The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of Production Designer, which was created in the 1930s when William Cameron Menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

The audio production team is a principal member of the production staff, with creative output comparable to that of the film editor and director of photography. Several factors have led to the promotion of audio production to this level, when previously it was considered subordinate to other parts of film:

* Cinema sound systems became capable of high-fidelity reproduction, particularly after the adoption of Dolby Stereo. Before stereo soundtracks, film sound was of such low fidelity that only the dialogue and occasional sound effects were practical. These sound systems were originally devised as gimmicks to increase theater attendance, but their widespread implementation created a content vacuum that had to be filled by competent professionals. Dolby&#x27;s immersive Dolby Atmos format, introduced in 2012, provides the sound team with 128 tracks of audio that can be assigned to a 7.1.2 bed that utilizes two overhead channels, leaving 118 tracks for audio objects that can be positioned around the theater independent of the sound bed. Object positions are informed by metadata that places them based on &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot; coordinates and the number of speakers available in the room. This immersive sound format expands creative opportunities for the use of sound beyond what was achievable with older 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound systems. The greater dynamic range of the new systems, coupled with the ability to produce sounds at the sides, behind, or above the audience, provided the audio post-production team new opportunities for creative expression in film sound. 

* Some directors were interested in realizing the new potential of the medium. A new generation of filmmakers, the so-called &quot;Easy Riders and Raging Bulls&quot;—Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and others—were aware of the creative potential of sound and wanted to use it.
* Filmmakers were inspired by the popular music of the era. Concept albums of groups such as Pink Floyd and The Beatles suggested new modes of storytelling and creative techniques that could be adapted to motion pictures.
* New filmmakers made their early films outside the Hollywood establishment, away from the influence of film labor unions and the then rapidly dissipating studio system.

The contemporary title of &quot;sound designer&quot; can be compared with the more traditional title of &quot;supervising sound editor&quot;; many sound designers use both titles interchangeably. The role of &quot;supervising sound editor&quot;, or &quot;sound supervisor&quot;, developed in parallel with the role of sound designer. The demand for more sophisticated soundtracks was felt both inside and outside Hollywood, and the supervising sound editor became the head of the large sound department, with a staff of dozens of sound editors, that was required to realize a complete sound job with a fast turnaround.

===Theatre===

Sound design, as a distinct discipline, is one of the youngest fields in stagecraft, second only to the use of projection and other multimedia displays, although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started. Dan Dugan, working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones during the 1968–69 season of American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco, was the first person in the USA to be called a sound designer.

A theatre sound designer is responsible for everything the audience hears in the performance space, including music, sound effects, sonic textures, and soundscapes. These elements are created by the sound designer, or sourced from other sound professionals, such as a composer in the case of music. Pre-recorded music must be licensed from a legal entity that represents the artist&#x27;s work. This can be the artist themselves, a publisher, record label, performing rights organization or music licensing company. The theatre sound designer is also in charge of choosing and installing the sound system —speakers, sound desks, interfaces and convertors, playout/cueing software, microphones, radio mics, foldback, cables, computers, and outboard equipment like FX units and dynamics processors.

Modern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible, complex, and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance. The influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes, which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound. The development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design. Consequently, theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long-term collaborations with directors.

====Musicals====
Sound design for musicals often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production. If a sound system is already installed in the performance venue, it is the sound designer&#x27;s job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production. Sound system tuning employs various methods including equalization, delay, volume, speaker and microphone placement, and in some cases, the addition of new equipment. In conjunction with the director and musical director, if any, the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians. The sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience, regardless of the shape, size or acoustics of the venue, and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs. While sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement, many musicals, such as &quot;Into the Woods&quot; also require significant sound scores (see Sound Design for Plays). Sound Reinforcement Design was recognized by the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Musical until the 2014–15 season, later reinstating in the 2017–18 season.

====Plays====
Sound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds (sound score) for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play, and the design, installation, calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score. The sound designer for a play and the production&#x27;s director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored. Based on this, the sound designer for plays, in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer, decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods. In some productions, the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play. The sound designer and the director usually work together to &quot;spot&quot; the cues in the play (i.e., decide when and where sound will be used in the play). Some productions might use music only during scene changes, whilst others might use sound effects. Likewise, a scene might be underscored with music, sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two. Some sound designers are accomplished composers, writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound. Many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement (see Sound Design for Musicals). Sound Design for plays was recognized by the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Play until the 2014–15 season, later reinstating the award in the 2017–18 season.

====Professional organizations====
* Theatrical Sound Designers and Composers Association (TSDCA)
* The Association for Sound Design and Production is a charity representing theatre sound designers and engineers in the UK.
* United Scenic Artists (USA) Local USA829, which is integrated within IATSE, represents theatrical sound designers in the United States.
* Theatrical Sound Designers in English Canada are represented by the Associated Designers of Canada (ADC), and in Québec by l&#x27;Association des professionnels des arts du Québec (APASQ).

===Music===
In the contemporary music business, especially in the production of rock music, ambient music, progressive rock, and similar genres, the record producer and recording engineer play important roles in the creation of the overall sound (or soundscape) of a recording, and less often, of a live performance. A record producer is responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres, arrangements, etc. On some, particularly more electronic music projects, artists and producers in more conventional genres have sometimes sourced additional help from artists often credited as &quot;sound designers&quot;, to contribute specific auditory effects, ambiences etc. to the production. These people are usually more versed in e.g. electronic music composition and synthesizers than the other musicians on board.

In the application of electroacoustic techniques (e.g. binaural sound) and sound synthesis for contemporary music or film music, a sound designer (often also an electronic musician) sometimes refers to an artist who works alongside a composer to realize the more electronic aspects of a musical production. This is because sometimes there exists a difference in interests between composers and electronic musicians or sound designers. The latter specialises in electronic music techniques, such as sequencing and synthesizers, but the former is more experienced in writing music in a variety of genres. Since electronic music itself is quite broad in techniques and often separate from techniques applied in other genres, this kind of collaboration can be seen as natural and beneficial.

Notable examples of (recognized) sound design in music are the contributions of Michael Brook to the U2 album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, George Massenburg to the Jennifer Warnes album &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot;, Chris Thomas to the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, and Brian Eno to the Paul Simon album &quot;Surprise&quot;.

In 1974, Suzanne Ciani started her own production company, Ciani/Musica. Inc., which became the #1 sound design music house in New York.

===Fashion===
In fashion shows, the sound designer often works with the artistic director to create an atmosphere fitting the theme of a collection, commercial campaign or event.

===Computer applications and other applications===
Sound is widely used in a variety of human–computer interfaces, in computer games and video games. There are a few extra requirements for sound production for computer applications, including re-usability, interactivity and low memory and CPU usage. For example, most computational resources are usually devoted to graphics. Audio production should account for computational limits for sound playback with audio compression or voice allocating systems.

Sound design for video games requires proficient knowledge of audio recording and editing using a digital audio workstation, and an understanding of game audio integration using audio engine software, audio authoring tools, or middleware to integrate audio into the game engine. Audio middleware is a third-party toolset that sits between the game engine and the audio hardware. 

Interactivity with computer sound can involve using a variety of playback systems or logic, using tools that allow the production of interactive sound (e.g. Max/MSP, Wwise). Implementation might require software or electrical engineering of the systems that modify sound or process user input. In interactive applications, a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer (e.g. a sound programmer) who&#x27;s concerned with designing the playback systems and their efficiency.

==Awards==
Sound designers have been recognized by awards organizations for some time, and new awards have emerged more recently in response to advances in sound design technology and quality. The Motion Picture Sound Editors and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the finest or most aesthetic sound design for a film with the Golden Reel Awards for Sound Editing in the film, broadcast, and game industries, and the Academy Award for Best Sound respectively. In 2021, the 93rd Academy Awards merged Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing into one general Best Sound category. In 2007, the Tony Award for Best Sound Design was created to honor the best sound design in American theatre on Broadway.

North American theatrical award organizations that recognize sound designers include these:
* Dora Mavor Moore Awards
* Drama Desk Awards
* Helen Hayes Awards
* Obie Awards
* Joseph Jefferson Awards

Major British award organizations include the Olivier Awards. The Tony Awards retired the awards for Sound Design as of the 2014–2015 season, then reinstated the categories in the 2017–18 season.

<text>Table setting (laying a table) or place setting refers to the way to set a table with tableware—such as eating utensils and for serving and eating. The arrangement for a single diner is called a place setting. It is also the layout in which the utensils and ornaments are positioned. The practice of dictating the precise arrangement of tableware has varied across cultures and historical periods.

==Place setting==
Informal settings generally have fewer utensils and dishes but use a layout based on more formal settings. Utensils are arranged in the order and according to the manner in which the diner will use them. In the West, forks, plate, butter knife, and napkin generally are placed to the left of the dinner plate, and knives, spoons, stemware and tumblers, cups, and saucers to the right. (By contrast, formal settings in Armenia place the fork to the right of the dinner plate and informal settings in Turkey place the fork to the right of the dinner plate if not accompanied by a knife) Sauceboats and serving dishes, when used, either are placed on the table or, more formally, may be kept on a side table.

===Informal===

At an informal setting, fewer utensils are used and serving dishes are placed on the table. Sometimes the cup and saucer are placed on the right side of the spoon, about 30 cm or 12 inches from the edge of the table. Often, in less formal settings, the napkin should be in the wine glass. However, such objects as napkin rings are very rare in the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, or Italy.

===Formal===

Utensils are placed inward about 20 cm or 8 inches from the edge of the table, with all placed either upon the same invisible baseline or upon the same invisible median line. Utensils in the outermost position are to be used first (for example, a soup spoon or a salad fork, later the dinner fork and the dinner knife). The blades of the knives are turned toward the plate. Glasses are placed an inch (2.5 cm) or so above the knives, also in the order of use: white wine, red wine, dessert wine, and water tumbler.

====Formal dinner====

The most formal dinner is served from the kitchen. When the meal is served, in addition to the central plate (a service plate or dinner plate at supper; at luncheon, a service plate or luncheon plate) at each place there is a bread roll (generally on a bread plate, sometimes in the napkin), napkin, and flatware (knives and spoons to the right of the central plate, and forks to the left). Coffee is served in Butler Service style in demitasses, and a spoon is placed on the saucer to the right of each handle. Serving dishes and utensils are not placed on the table for a formal dinner. The only exception in the West to these general rules is the protocol followed at the Spanish royal court, which was also adopted by the Austrian court, in which all cutlery was placed to the right of the central plate for each diner. 

At a less formal dinner, not served from the kitchen, the dessert fork and spoon can be set above the plate, fork pointing right, spoon pointing left.

<text>The Temple of Athena Nike (Greek: Ναός Αθηνάς Νίκης, &quot;Naós Athinás Níkis&quot;) is a temple on the Acropolis of Athens, dedicated to the goddesses Athena and Nike. Built around 420 BC, the temple is the earliest fully Ionic temple on the Acropolis. It has a prominent position on a steep bastion at the south west corner of the Acropolis to the right of the entrance, the Propylaea. In contrast to the Acropolis proper, a walled sanctuary entered through the Propylaea, the Victory Sanctuary was open, entered from the Propylaea&#x27;s southwest wing and from a narrow stair on the north. The sheer walls of its bastion were protected on the north, west, and south by the &quot;Nike Parapet&quot;, named for its frieze of Nikai celebrating victory and sacrificing to their patroness, Athena and Nike.

Nike was the goddess of victory in Greek mythology, and Athena was worshipped in this form, representative of being victorious in war. The citizens worshipped the goddesses in hopes of a successful outcome in the long Peloponnesian War fought against the Spartans and allies.

== History ==

The cult of Athena Nike was operable in the early sixth century BC. On the remains of a Mycenaean bastion, a cult image of Athena seated holding a pomegranate in her right hand and holding a helmet in her left was placed on top of a square limestone base. The Sanctuary of Athena Nike was demolished by the Persians in 480-479 BC and a temple was built over the remains. The new temple construction was underway in 449 BC and was finished around 420 BC. The cult was supervised by the Priestess of Athena Nike, who was appointed through democratic allotment. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

Athens fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1456. The temple sat untouched until it was demolished in 1686 by the Ottomans who used the stones to build defenses. In 1834 the temple was reconstructed after the independence of Greece. In 1998 the temple was dismantled so that the crumbling concrete floor could be replaced and its frieze was removed and placed in the new Acropolis Museum that opened in 2009. The Temple of Athena Nike is often closed to visitors as work continues. The new museum exhibit consists of fragments of the site before the Persians were thought to have destroyed it in 480 BC. Sculptures from the friezes have been salvaged such as: deeds of Hercules, statue of Moscophoros, a damaged sculpture of a goddess credited to Praxiteles and the Rampin horseman, as well as epigraphic dedications, decrees, and stelae.

== Architecture ==
The Temple of Athena Nike was finished around 420 BC, during the Peace of Nicias. It is a &quot;tetrastyle&quot; (four column) Ionic structure with a colonnaded portico at both front and rear facades (&quot;amphiprostyle&quot;), designed by the architect Kallikrates. The columns along the east and west fronts were monolithic columns. The temple ran long by wide and tall. The total height from the stylobate to the acme of the pediment while the temple remained intact was a modest . The ratio of height to diameter of the columns is 7:1, rather than the more standard 9:1 or 10:1 ratio in Ionic buildings. Constructed from white Pentelic marble, it was built in stages as war-starved funding allowed.
== Friezes and parapets ==
=== Friezes ===
The friezes of the building&#x27;s entablature were decorated on all sides with relief sculpture in the idealized classical style of the 5th century BC. The orientation of the temple is set up so that the East Frieze sits above the entrance of the temple on the porch side. The north frieze depicted a battle between Greeks entailing cavalry. The south frieze showed the decisive victory over the Persians at the battle of Plataea. The east frieze showed an assembly of the gods Athena, Zeus and Poseidon, rendering Athenian religious beliefs and reverence for the gods bound up in the social and political climate of 5th century Athens. The west frieze has a good amount of the original sculpting preserved. Similar to the east frieze it is most likely telling the story of a battle, or more specifically a victory. There are multiple corpses depicted (more than any of the other three friezes) and imagery of one about to be killed with some figures wearing helmets. This battle between armies most likely is depicting the massacre of the Corinthians by the Athenians.

Some time after the temple was completed, around 410 BC a parapet was added around it to prevent people from falling from the steep bastion. The outside of the parapet was adorned by carved relief sculptures showing Nike in a variety of activities, including two Nikai setting up a trophy, and all in procession.

Architects Christian Hansen and Eduard Schaubert excavated the temple in the 1830s. The building had been totally dismantled in the 17th century and the stone built into the Turkish wall that surrounded the hill. A primitive anastylosis was carried out in 1836 when the temple was re-erected from remaining parts. A third restoration was completed in Summer 2010. The main structure, stylobate and columns are largely intact, minus the roof and most of the tympanae. Fragments of the sculpted frieze are exhibited in the Acropolis Museum and the British Museum; copies of these are fixed in their place on the temple.

=== Parapet of Nike ===
On the parapet, there would have stood a famous marble statue of a wingless Nike. The positioning of this statue has Nike leaning towards her right foot with her right arm stretching towards her sandal and her clothes slipping off her shoulder. For a while, there has been much debate over what the imagery of this statue is supposed to represent. There are many other uses of Greek sandal-related art found on cups, vases, and even on the friezes of the Parthenon. However, these versions all depict the subjects bending down with both arms stretched out to adjust or tie their sandals. The difference in imagery between one hand and two is what has caused discrepancy behind the meaning of the statue of a wingless Nike. It is most likely that Nike is instead removing or loosening her sandal as opposed to adjusting or putting it on. This use of imagery is thought to be used to demonstrate the action of removing footwear to those entering the temple to pay tribute to Athena, as this was a traditional action of worshiping in this space. The statue was discovered in 1835 near the temple. It is thought to have stood on the south side of the temple. It is currently held by the Acropolis Museum (inventory number Ακρ. 973).

The famous parapet of Nike removing her sandal is an example of wet drapery. Wet drapery involves showing the form of the body but also concealing the body with the drapery of the clothing. Some friezes are from the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. The friezes contained a cavalry scene from the battle of Marathon and a Greek victory over the Persians at the battle of Plataea. The battles represent Greek and Athenian dominance through military power and historical events.
A statue of Nike stood in the &quot;cella&quot;, or otherwise referred to as a &quot;naos&quot;. Nike was originally the &quot;winged victory&quot; goddess (&quot;see&quot; the winged Nike of Samothrace). The Athena Nike statue&#x27;s absence of wings led Athenians in later centuries to call it &quot;Apteros Nike&quot; or wingless victory, and the story arose that the statue was deprived of wings so that it could never leave the city.

== Cornice and cyma ==

=== Cornice ===
The cornice follows standard architectural design and sits immediately above the frieze and wraps around the entire structure. Many sections of the cornice that have been discovered are believed to be part of the Temple of Athena Nike, however, some archaeologists think that some of the pieces found near the temple might not be part it. These pieces of the cornice are lined on the inside with an array of holes, supporting the idea that the cornice was held in place by dowels, which connected it to the frieze. Many of these cornice pieces are so weathered and worn that the dowel holes are no longer visible.

The cornice stretches flat and with no moldings that would create a design. If there had been a design, it would not be sculptural. There is evidence that would suggest that the cornice would have at one point been painted. However, because the architecture has been worn for such a long time, any knowledge of what the design could have been is long lost.

=== Cyma ===
Just above the cornice, on the north and south sides of the temple, rests the cyma. They sit at an angle on both sides, creating the slope that makes up the roofing and the pediment. Stretching along the cyma is an order of lion heads that extend outward. At each end of the cyma, where the corners would turn into the east and west faces of the temple, there are cuttings just above the cyma where an akroteria would have been placed.

== Akroteria ==
The main body of the central statue that made up the akroteria was composed of bronze, not marble. There is evidence of gold foiling and gold wiring through the main bronze core. Researchers have hypothesized on the form of the statue, but there is no trace of the original sculpture to indicate what the central akroteria really looked like. The same can be said for the statues that would make up the east and west akroteria. Both were made of bronze and it is impossible to know what the figures could have been. Theories around the figure of the central statue include the winged horse Pegasus or the monster Chimera. However, these theories may be unlikely as the proportions of these animals’ bodies would not match where their feet would be placed in the akroteria&#x27;s base block.

=== Statue theories ===
A possible theory for the central akroteria would be a bronze tripod, similar to the ones that would have been on the Temple of Zeus in Olympia. This hypothesis has not been discredited for a few reasons: 1) It would be a realistic answer for the shape of the statue since the tripods dimensions would fit in the cuttings of the supporting block (unlike the animal theories). 2) A tripod would have been a likely statue to have a bronze core when serving as an acroteria. 3) The Tripod is commonly used as a symbol of victory.

A commemorative trophy is another theory for the central akroteria that has yet to be disproven for many of the same reasons as the tripod. There are also some sculptures on the surrounding parapets that depict Nike setting up a trophy.

The last theory that has yet to be discredited is a central akroteria of a flying Nike. The idea is that a statue of a winged Nike would have been set just above a shield and on either side of her would have stood a Nikai holding weapons dedicated to the goddess. The akroteria at the temple of Zeus in Olympia would be a good statue for comparison with the exception of the two Nikai. This shape for the central akroteria would explain the cuttings in the supporting block that would not have matched with some of the other forms.

<text>Frederick Herman Tuttle (July 18, 1919 – October 4, 2003) was an American dairy farmer, actor, United States Army veteran of World War II, and Republican candidate for the United States Senate from Vermont in 1998. He lived in Tunbridge all his life, and attended South Royalton High School before dropping out after the tenth grade to begin a career as a dairy farmer. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and participated in military actions in the European Theater.

Tuttle retired from farming in 1984, and continued to reside in Tunbridge, where he engaged in gardening and other hobbies. Tuttle was a neighbor of filmmaker John O&#x27;Brien, who recognized that Tuttle&#x27;s charisma and unique personality might come across well on film. As a result, he cast Tuttle in movie roles including parts in &quot;Nosey Parker&quot; and &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;. In 1998, Tuttle and O&#x27;Brien decided that a Tuttle candidacy for public office might help publicize &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;, a mock documentary which centers on the idea of a retired farmer (Tuttle) running for the United States House of Representatives because it is easier and pays better than farming. He decided to run for the Republican nomination to oppose Senator Patrick Leahy, in part to promote the film, and in part to poke fun at Jack McMullen, a recent arrival to Vermont, who was accused of moving to the state because it would be easier to campaign for a United States Senate seat there than in his home state of Massachusetts.

Tuttle defeated McMullen by 5,034 votes out of 52,813 cast in the Republican primary after a campaign of humorous and memorable incidents. Vermont had recently adopted an open primary system and many Democrats voted in the Republican primary to help Tuttle win. He then announced that he had no intention of leaving Tunbridge or serving in the Senate, and endorsed Leahy for reelection. They made several joint appearances, and Leahy easily won reelection in November. The campaign added to Tuttle&#x27;s growing status as a folk figure and cult hero, and a steady stream of public appearances followed. However, many Republicans in Vermont resented his false candidacy which they felt denied them the right to a legitimate candidate in the Senate race since McMullen was seen as their best chance to unseat Leahy in years. He died in 2003, and was buried in Tunbridge.

==Early life==
Tuttle was born in Tunbridge, Vermont, the son of Bessie Laura (Hoyt) and Joseph Charles Tuttle. He lived in Tunbridge all his life, except for his military service. He attended the schools of Tunbridge, and completed tenth grade at South Royalton High School before going to work on his family&#x27;s dairy farm.

==Military service==
Tuttle served in the United States Army during World War II. He participated in military actions in Europe, first with the Military Police, and then Army Corps of Engineers.

==Post-World War II==
In 1947, Tuttle married Ida May Foote (1916–2000) in Canterbury, New Hampshire. They divorced and in 1953, Tuttle married Charlotte Lorraine Perry (1929–1999) in White River Junction, Vermont. He married Dorothy L. (Hilts) (1929–2011) in Maine in 1961.

==Later career==
Tuttle retired from farming in 1984 and engaged in gardening and other hobbies. After his retirement, he appeared in several movies directed by Vermont filmmaker John O&#x27;Brien, including &quot;Nosey Parker&quot; and &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;. He starred in the latter, playing a retired farmer who decides to run for U.S. Representative from Vermont.

In 1998, Tuttle was persuaded to run in the Republican U.S. Senate primary as a way to publicize &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;. His opponent was Jack McMullen, a multi-millionaire who had lived in Massachusetts for most of his adult life. O&#x27;Brien and Tuttle targeted McMullen as a carpetbagger who apparently moved to Vermont for the sole purpose of establishing residency for a Senate run. The Vermont primary structure allows Democrats and Independents to vote in the Republican primary, and many political observers foresaw the possibility that Tuttle could draw votes across party lines. 

Tuttle campaigned on a platform that seemed absurdist by the standards of contemporary politics. McMullen and the state Republican Party challenged Tuttle&#x27;s nominating petitions and got 95 signatures invalidated. Tuttle needed to obtain 23 more to stay on the ballot, and proceeded to obtain 2,309. McMullen sent flowers to while Tuttle was hospitalized for knee surgery.

During their debate on Vermont Public Radio, Tuttle asked a series of humorous local knowledge questions. McMullen was unable to correctly pronounce the names of several Vermont towns, or correctly answer Tuttle&#x27;s dairy farming-related questions, such as &quot;How many teats a Holstein got?&quot; answering &quot;Six&quot;, instead of the correct four. In the primary, Tuttle defeated McMullen by ten percentage points and promptly endorsed the incumbent Democrat, Patrick Leahy.

Tuttle&#x27;s subsequent general election campaign continued to generate publicity. He made several joint appearances with Leahy and continued to endorse him, saying &quot;He knows how many tits on a cow.&quot; Tuttle commented that he did not really want to win because he would have to move to Washington, D.C. Despite endorsing his opponent, Tuttle garnered 48,051 votes (22 percent of the vote) in the actual election.

Tuttle was described by Senator Leahy as &quot;the distilled essence of Vermonthood&quot;. He was considered by many to be an example of both the &quot;everyman&quot; and of the unique individualist.

==Death and burial==
Tuttle died in Burlington, Vermont, after being hospitalized with a heart attack following a day spent digging potatoes at his home in Tunbridge. He was buried at Tunbridge&#x27;s Spring Road Cemetery wearing his overalls, with a pen in his pocket for autograph signing and a can of Moxie by his side.

<doc id="488416" wikidata="Q6832454" url="?curid=488416" title="Michael Majerus">
<text>Michael Eugene Nicolas Majerus (13 February 1954 – 27 January 2009) was a British geneticist and professor of evolution at the University of Cambridge. He was also a teaching fellow at Clare College, Cambridge. He was an enthusiast in Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection and became a world authority in his field of insect evolutionary biology. He was widely noted for his work on moths and ladybirds and as an advocate of the science of evolution. He was also an enthusiastic educator and the author of several books on insects, evolution and sexual reproduction. He is best remembered as an ardent supporter and champion of experiments on peppered moth evolution.

== Biography ==

The son of Fernand and Muriel Majerus, Michael Majerus took an early interest in insects. He got his first butterfly net at the age of four. His father, a Luxembourg national by origin, encouraged him by taking him for field trips on weekends and bringing him home specimens from his travels. He was particularly interested in lepidopterans and ecological genetics following the work of E.B. Ford, whose book &quot;Moths&quot; (in the &quot;New Naturalist&quot; series) he bought at the age of ten. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood, and graduated in botany and zoology from Royal Holloway College, London. He earned his PhD from Royal Holloway College on the study of the genetic control of larval colour in the angle shades moth. He worked for two years at Keele University as a research demonstrator. In 1980 he joined the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge as a research associate. After promotion as lecturer in 1987 and reader in 2001, he was appointed professor of evolution in 2006. In 1990 he was elected fellow of Clare College, and from the next year, in 1991, he became a teaching fellow of the college, the post he held until his death.

He died 27 January 2009 after an unexpected and brief struggle with aggressive mesothelioma.

=== Personal life ===

Majerus was a passionate anti-creationist. He used much of his scientific works to argue against creationism.

He married Vicki Maclean in 1979, but their marriage was dissolved. He remarried Tamsin Harris in 1988 with whom he had two sons, and one daughter. They later divorced, and Majerus married, for the third time, Christina Poole in 2005.

== Achievements ==

After his doctoral work on moths, Majerus moved into studying ladybirds, an area which brought him widespread publicity as an expert in 2004 when the harlequin ladybird came to Britain, causing a disaster for native species. This publicity led to the involvement of members of the public in the effective monitoring of the spread of the harlequin. His work on the peppered moth provided new support for the understanding of peppered moth evolution.

His research work was largely focussed around insect species, particularly the peppered moth and ladybirds, but explored these from many different perspectives including melanism, male killers, sexual selection, sexually transmitted diseases, animal colouration, invasive species, and biological pest control.

=== Peppered moth evolution ===

The legacy of Majerus was largely built on his fervent defence and experimental works on the peppered moth evolution. The concept of industrial melanism in &quot;Biston betularia&quot; had been a primary example of Darwinian natural selection in action. With the experimental evidence of Bernard Kettlewell in the early 1950s, the story became a classic in evolutionary biology. However, the rise of creationism towards the end of 20th century brought forth serious attack. To increase the controversy, biologists also began to argue the validity of Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments. The publication of &quot;&quot; in 1998 in which Majerus analysed and defended Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments provoked severe criticism. Kettlewell&#x27;s works were seen as lacking proper experimental procedure, with some even accusing it variously as a fake, fraudulent, hoax and wrong. The accusations were most influentially popularised by Judith Hooper in her 2002 book &quot;Of Moths and Men&quot; (which in turn received severe criticisms). One of the critics, Jerry Coyne, himself a professor of evolution at the University of Chicago, commented that: &quot;[M]ost of the work described is inconclusive... for the time being we must discard &quot;Biston&quot; as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution.&quot; Majerus then designed an elaborate experiment to resolve the issues. Starting from 2001 he conducted experiments for seven years, and terminated by his own death. He had experimented with 4,864 moths in Cambridgeshire, becoming the largest experiment in such manner. After his death his experimental results were analysed by a collaboration of American and British geneticists, and was published in 2012. Majerus&#x27;s works clearly vindicated the experiments on peppered moth evolution, and the paper concluded that:
== Honours and recognitions ==

Majerus was the president of the Amateur Entomologists&#x27; Society, a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society, and a Life Fellow of the British Naturalists&#x27; Association. He received a number of awards, including the Peter Scott Memorial Award in 2006, for his contributions to British Natural History. In 2004 he was conferred the title &quot;Distinguished Supporter&quot; of the British Humanist Association. In 2010 the 
Amateur Entomologists&#x27; Society launched &quot;The Mike Majerus Grant&quot; with the aim of encouraging a new generation of entomologists by supporting and funding projects based in the British Isles which further the cause of entomological study, research or education by amateurs, especially the young.

<text>In physics, the Newtonian limit is a mathematical approximation applicable to physical systems exhibiting (1) weak gravitation, (2) objects moving slowly compared to the speed of light, and (3) slowly changing (or completely static) gravitational fields. Under these conditions, Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation may be used to obtain values that are accurate. In general, and in the presence of significant gravitation, the general theory of relativity must be used.

In the Newtonian limit, spacetime is approximately flat and the Minkowski metric may be used over finite distances. In this case &#x27;approximately flat&#x27; is defined as space in which gravitational effect approaches 0, mathematically actual spacetime and Minkowski space are not identical, Minkowski space is an idealized model.
==Special relativity==
In special relativity, Newtonian behaviour can in most cases be obtained by performing the limit formula_1. In this limit, the often appearing gamma factor becomes 1
formula_2
and the Lorentz transformations between reference frames turn into Galileo transformations
formula_3

==General relativity==
The geodesic equation for a free particle on curved spacetime with metric formula_4 can be derived from the action
formula_5
If the spacetime-metric is
formula_6
then, ignoring all contributions of order formula_7 the action becomes 
formula_8
which is the action that reproduces the Newtonian equations of motion of a particle in a gravitational potential formula_9

<doc id="488425" wikidata="Q1992659" url="?curid=488425" title="Gupta script">
<text>The Gupta script (sometimes referred to as Gupta Brahmi script or Late Brahmi script) was used for writing Sanskrit and is associated with the Gupta Empire of the Indian subcontinent, which was a period of material prosperity and great religious and scientific developments. The Gupta script was descended from Brāhmī and gave rise to the Śāradā and Siddhaṃ scripts. These scripts in turn gave rise to many of the most important Indic scripts, including Devanāgarī (the most common script used for writing Sanskrit since the 19th century), the Gurmukhī script for Punjabi, the Odia script, the Bengali-Assamese script and the Tibetan script.

==Origins and classification==
The Gupta script was descended from the Ashokan Brāhmī script, and is a crucial link between Brahmi and most other Brahmic scripts, a family of alphasyllabaries or abugidas. This means that while only consonantal phonemes have distinct symbols, vowels are marked by diacritics, with being the implied pronunciation when the diacritic is not present. In fact, the Gupta script works in exactly the same manner as its predecessor and successors, and only the shapes and forms of the graphemes and diacritics are different.

Through the 4th century, letters began to take more cursive and symmetric forms, as a result of the desire to write more quickly and aesthetically. This also meant that the script became more differentiated throughout the Empire, with regional variations which have been broadly classified into three, four or five categories; however, a definitive classification is lacking, because even in a single inscription, there may be variation in how a particular symbol is written. In this sense, the term Gupta script should be taken to mean any form of writing derived from the Gupta period, even though there may be a lack of uniformity in the scripts.

==Inscriptions==
The surviving inscriptions of the Gupta script are mostly found on iron or stone pillars, and on gold coins from the Gupta Dynasty. One of the most important was the &quot;Prayagraj (Allahabad) Prasasti&quot;. Composed by Harisena, the court poet and minister of Samudragupta, it describes Samudragupta&#x27;s reign, beginning from his accession to the throne as the second king of the Gupta Dynasty and including his conquest of other kings. It is inscribed on the Allahabad pillar of Ashoka.

==Alphabet==
The Gupta alphabet is composed of 37 letters: 32 consonants with the inherent ending &quot;a&quot; and 5 independent vowels. In addition diacritics are attached to the consonants in order to change the sound of the final vowel (from the inherent &quot;a&quot; to other sounds such as i, u, e, o, au ...). Consonants can also be combined into compounds, also called conjunct consonants (for example sa+ya are combined vertically to give &quot;sya&quot;).

=== In Unicode ===

The Unicode Standard does not explicitly state that the Gupta script is considered a stylistic variation of Brahmi, though use of the Brahmi encoding is one approach. 

==Gupta numismatics==

The study of Gupta coins began with the discovery of a hoard of gold coins in 1783. Many other such hoards have since been discovered, the most important being the Bayana (situated in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan) hoard, discovered in 1946, which contained more than 2000 gold coins issued by the Gupta Kings. Many of the Gupta Empire&#x27;s coins bear inscriptions of legends or mark historic events. In fact, it was one of the first Indian Empires to do so, probably as a result of its unprecedented prosperity. Almost every Gupta king issued coins, beginning with its first king, Chandragupta I.

The scripts on the coin are also of a different nature compared to scripts on pillars, due to conservatism regarding the coins that were to be accepted as currency, which would have prevented regional variations in the script from manifesting on the coinage. Moreover, space was more limited especially on their silver coins, and thus many of the symbols are truncated or stunted. An example is the symbol for /ta/ and /na/, which were often simplified to vertical strokes.

<text>() are a type of Japanese playing cards. They are typically smaller than Western playing cards, only , but thicker and stiffer. On the face of each card is a depiction of plants, , animals, birds, or man-made objects. One single card depicts a human. The back side is usually plain, without a pattern or design of any kind, and traditionally colored either red or black. are used to play a variety of games including and .

== Outside Japan ==
In Korea, are known as (, ) and made of plastic with a textured back side. The most popular game is &quot;Go-stop&quot; (), commonly played during special holidays such as Lunar New Year and ().

In Hawaii, is used to play Sakura. is also played in Micronesia, where it is known as and is used to play a four-person game, which is often played in partnerships.

==History==
Playing cards were introduced to Japan by the Portuguese in the mid-16th century. The Portuguese deck consisted of 48 cards, with four suits divided into 12 ranks. The first Japanese-made decks made during the Tenshō period (1573–1592) mimicked Portuguese decks and are referred to as &quot;Tenshō Karuta&quot;. The main game was a trick-taking game intermediate in evolution between Triunfo and Ombre. After Japan closed off all contact with the Western world in 1633, foreign playing cards were banned.

In 1648, were banned by the Tokugawa shogunate. During prohibition, gambling with cards remained highly popular which led to disguised card designs. Each time gambling with a card deck of a particular design became too popular, the government banned it, which then prompted the creation of a new design. This cat-and-mouse game between the government and rebellious gamblers resulted in the creation of increasingly abstract and minimalist regional patterns (地方札). These designs were initially called &quot;Yomi Karuta&quot; after the popular Poch-like game of &quot;Yomi&quot; which was known by the 1680s.

Through the Meiwa, An&#x27;ei, and Tenmei eras (roughly 1764–1789), a game called &quot;Mekuri&quot; took the place of &quot;Yomi&quot;. It became so popular that &quot;Yomi Karuta&quot; was renamed &quot;Mekuri Karuta&quot;. Mechanically, &quot;Mekuri&quot; is similar to Chinese fishing games. Cards became so commonly used for gambling that they were banned in 1791, during the Kansei era. On the other hand, Uta-garuta such as Hyakunin Isshu were officially permitted as being educationally beneficial. So as a loophole to the ban, early hanafuda were made to have old poems on some of the cards, disguising them as Uta-garuta. Remnants of this can be seen via the tanzaku-ranked cards.

The earliest known reference to (a previous version of ) is from 1816 when it was recorded as a banned gambling tool. The earliest decks contained between 12, 20, and even 32 suits, each with one high value card, one tanzaku card, and two low-value cards.

As modernized into , it standardized at 12 months (suits) with four rank-like categories. The majority of games are descended from &quot;Mekuri&quot; although &quot;Yomi&quot; adaptations for the flower cards survived until the 20th century. Though they can still be used for gambling, its structure and design is less convenient than other decks such as Kabufuda. In the Meiji period, playing cards became tolerated by the authorities.

In 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo for the purposes of producing and selling hand-crafted . Nintendo has focused on video games since the 1970s but continues to produce cards in Japan, including themed sets based on Mario, Pokémon, and Kirby. The &quot;Koi-Koi&quot; game played with is included in Nintendo&#x27;s own &quot;Clubhouse Games&quot; (2006) for the Nintendo DS, and &quot;Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics&quot; (2020) for the Nintendo Switch.

Though modern Japanese hanafuda is primarily made today by either of the long-standing Oishi Tengudo (1800) or Nintendo (1889), dozens of others have manufactured hanafuda, such as Angel, Tamura Shogundo, Matsui Tengudo, Ace, Maruē, and many more.

Hanafuda were likely introduced to Korea during the late 1890s and to Hawaii in the early 1900s. Since then, companies and individuals in Korea and Hawaii have produced their own hanafuda, sometimes adapting the original Japanese imagery to fit either culture. Also made for western audiences are decks which fuse hanafuda with Toranpu (トランプ, &quot;Trumps&quot; a.k.a. the standard 52-card deck). These decks have indices on all their cards, and introduce a 13th suit which varies considerably by manufacturer (jokers, flowers, objects from japanese imagery, left blank or used as a &quot;snow&quot; suit, left as western Kings, etc.).

==Cards==
There are 48 cards total, divided into twelve suits, representing months of the year. Each suit is designated by a flower and has four cards. An extra blank card may be included to serve as a replacement. In Korean &quot;hwatu&quot; decks, several joker cards (조커패) award various bonuses.

The standard categorizations and point values for each card are as follows. Note that some games change the point values or categorizations of the cards. For example, in the game Hachi-Hachi, all of the November cards count as &quot;kasu&quot;, and in the game Sakura, the values of the cards are different.


* In the Korean version, the November and December suits are swapped.

=== Text significance ===
A few cards in hanafuda contain Japanese text. Early hanafuda had poems in order to disguise themselves as Uta-garuta, but the text had since been simplified in modern times. In addition to the examples below, the December cards typically display the manufacturer&#x27;s name and marks, similar to the Ace of spades in western playing cards.

<doc id="488430" wikidata="Q161083" url="?curid=488430" title="Lonicera japonica">
<text>Lonicera japonica, known as Japanese honeysuckle and golden-and-silver honeysuckle, is a species of honeysuckle native to East Asia, including many parts of China. It is often grown as an ornamental plant, but has become an invasive species in a number of countries. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine.

==Description==
&quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; is a twining vine able to climb up to high or more in trees, with opposite, simple oval leaves long and broad. When its stems are young, they are slightly red in color and may be fuzzy. Older stems are brown with peeling bark, and are often hollow on the inside. 

The flowers are double-tongued, opening white and fading to yellow, and sweetly vanilla scented. The fruit, which is produced in fall, is a black spherical berry diameter containing a few seeds.

=== Chemistry ===
&quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; contains methyl caffeate, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, methyl 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinate, protocatechuic acid, methyl chlorogenic acid, and luteolin. The two biflavonoids, 3′-O-methyl loniflavone and loniflavone, along with luteolin and chrysin, can be isolated from the leaves. Other phenolic compounds present in the plant are hyperoside, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid. The two secoiridoid glycosides, loniceracetalides A and B, can be isolated, together with 10 known iridoid glycosides, from the flower buds. The plant also contains the saponins loniceroside A and B and the anti-inflammatory loniceroside C.

==Subspecies==
There are three subspecies of &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot;:
== Ecology ==
The flowers can also be a significant source of food for deer, rabbits, hummingbirds, and other wildlife.

=== As an invasive species ===
Japanese honeysuckle has become naturalized in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, and much of the United States, including Hawaii, as well as a number of Pacific and Caribbean islands. It is classified as a noxious weed in 46 states, Prohibited to be bought and sold in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Vermont, and banned in Indiana and New Hampshire. It is listed on the New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord as an unwanted organism.

&quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; was initially brought to the U.S. from Japan in the early 1800s as an ornamental plant. It is still deliberately planted in the U.S. for reasons such as erosion control or forage for deer, but has become invasive in many areas. It prefers to invade areas that have been disturbed, such as roadsides or floodplains. It will generally only invade forests when the canopy has been opened by logging or fallen trees, as it grows less vigorously in the shade. Once it has invaded an area, &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; grows rapidly and outcompetes native plants for sunlight and nutrients. It proliferates using both sexual and vegetative reproduction, producing seeds that are spread by animals and expanding locally via rhizomes. Eventually, it will form a dense thicket which prevents other plant species from germinating in that area. Due to its suppression of germination in the understory, &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; also prevents the regeneration of trees.

Management of invasive &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; has been achieved through a variety of means. Small patches can be removed by hand, or using simple digging tools, but all plant parts including roots and rhizomes must be removed to prevent resprouting. Larger patches can be removed through repeated mowing, but application of herbicide is also recommended to prevent regrowth. There has been some study of using controlled burns to remove &quot;L. japonica&quot;, but the underground portion of the plant is usually able to survive and resprout, limiting the effectiveness of this method. Browsing by herbivores may limit its growth, but is unlikely to fully eliminate it.

==== Biological control ====
The EPA of New Zealand approved the release of &quot;Limenitis glorifica&quot; butterflies in 2013 as a biological control for &quot;Lonicera japonica.&quot; This butterfly is host specific for Japanese honeysuckle, but it may incidentally feed on other closely related plants, including Himalayan honeysuckle &quot;Leycesteria formosa&quot;. &quot;Oberea shirahatai&quot; is a Japanese honeysuckle host-specific beetle that feeds on the stems and leaves of Japanese honeysuckle. It was released in New Zealand in 2018 as another &quot;L. japonica&quot;-specialist biological control.

==Cultivation==
Even though it is a highly invasive and destructive plant, this species is often sold by American nurseries as the cultivar &#x27;Hall&#x27;s Prolific&#x27; (&quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; var. &quot;halliana&quot;), and in the UK as the cultivar &#x27;Halliana&#x27;. The cultivar is also known as Hall&#x27;s Japanese honeysuckle. It is an effective groundcover and has strong-smelling flowers. It can be cultivated by seed, cuttings, or layering. In addition, it will spread itself via shoots if given enough space to grow. The variety &quot;L. japonica&quot; var. &quot;repens&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Toxicity ==
All parts of the plant other than the flower nectar have the potential to be toxic.

==Uses==
Japanese honeysuckle flowers are edible to humans and appreciated for their sweet-tasting nectar.

===Herbal medicine===
In traditional Chinese medicine, &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; is called &quot;rěn dōng téng&quot; (); literally &quot;winter enduring vine&quot;) or &quot;jīn yín huā&quot; (; literally &quot;gold-silver flower&quot;, in reference to the presence of flowers of different age on the same plant as each flower change from white (silver) to yellow (gold)). Alternative Chinese names include &quot;er hua&quot; (二花) and &quot;shuang hua&quot; (雙花), meaning &quot;double-[color] flowers&quot;.

<doc id="488434" wikidata="Q1020217" url="?curid=488434" title="Minehead">
<text>Minehead is a coastal town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It lies on the south bank of the Bristol Channel, north-west of the county town of Taunton, from the boundary with the county of Devon and close to the Exmoor National Park. The parish includes Alcombe and Woodcombe, suburban villages which have been subsumed into Minehead, and had a population of 11,757 at the 2021 census.

There was a small port at Minehead by 1380, which grew into a major trading centre during the medieval period. Most trade transferred to larger ports during the 20th century, but pleasure steamers continued to call at the port. Major rebuilding took place in the Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791. The fortunes of the town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 was becoming a retirement centre. There was a marked increase in building during the early years of the 20th century, which resulted in the wide main shopping avenue and adjacent roads with Edwardian-style architecture. The town is the home of a Butlins Holiday Park which increases the seasonal tourist population by several thousand.

There is a variety of schools and religious, cultural and sporting facilities including sailing, windsurfing and golf. An ancient local tradition involves the Hobby Horse which takes to the streets for four days on the eve of the first of May each year, with accompanying musicians and rival horses. The town is the starting point of the South West Coast Path National Trail, the nation&#x27;s longest long-distance countryside walking trail. The Minehead Railway was opened in 1874 and closed in 1971 but has since been reopened as the West Somerset Railway.

==Toponym==
The town sits at the foot of a steeply rising outcrop of Exmoor known as North Hill, and the original name of the town was &quot;mynydd&quot;, which means mountain in Welsh. It has also been written as Mynheafdon (1046), Maneheve (1086), Menehewed (1225) and Menedun (also 1225), which contain elements of Welsh and Old English words for hill.

==History==
The earliest known fossilised forest was discovered in the Hangman Sandstone Formation near to the Butlins Holiday Park. The trees, identified as a species resembling modern palm trees, known as calamophyton, date back to the Devonian period, between 419 and 358 million years ago.

Evidence of prehistoric occupation of the area are Bronze Age barrows at Selworthy Beacon and an Iron Age enclosure at Furzebury Brake west of the town, although there is also possible evidence in the intertidal area, where the remains of a submerged forest still exist.

Minehead was part of the hundred of Carhampton. It is mentioned as a manor belonging to William de Moyon in the Domesday Book in 1086, although it had previously been held by Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia. William de Moyon and his descendants administered the area from Dunster Castle, which was later sold to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell.



There was a small port at Minehead by 1380, but it was not until 1420 that money given by Lady Margaret Luttrell enabled improvements to be made and a jetty built. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the town had its own Port Officer similar to the position at Bristol. Vessels in the 15th century included the &quot;Trinite&quot; which traded between Ireland and Bristol, and others carrying salt and other cargo from La Rochelle in France. Other products included local wool and cloth which were traded for coal from South Wales. In 1559 a charter of incorporation, established a free borough and parliamentary representation, but was made conditional on improvements being made to the port. The harbour silted up and fell into disrepair so that in 1604 James I withdrew the town&#x27;s charter. Control reverted to the Luttrells and a new harbour was built, at a cost of £5,000, further out to sea than the original, which had been at the mouth of the Bratton Stream. It incorporated a pier, dating from 1616, and was built to replace that at Dunster which was silting up. Trade was primarily with Wales for cattle, sheep, wool, butter, fish and coal. These are commemorated in the town arms which include a woolpack and sailing ship. Privateers based at Minehead were involved in the war with Spain and France during 1625–1630 and again during the War of the Spanish Succession from 1702 to 1713. The first cranes were installed after further improvements to the port in 1714.

By the beginning of the 18th century, trade between Minehead and Ireland, South Wales, Bristol and Bridgwater grew, with forty vessels based in the harbour for trade and herring fishing. It was also a departure point for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela. Until the 19th century, trade continued with Ireland but Minehead vessels started to travel further afield to Virginia and the West Indies. In 1808 a ship, believed to be the which had been built in 1801, was wrecked on Madbrain Sands. Further problems with the port continued and led to a decline in trade and the fisheries in the late 18th century and in 1834 the port lost its jurisdiction to Bridgwater. In the 20th century most trade transferred to larger ports, but pleasure steamers did call at the port. Minehead Lifeboat Station was established in 1901 near the harbour. The pier was demolished during the Second World War as it obstructed the view from the gun battery set up on the quay head, as part of the coastal defence preparations, which stopped steamers calling at the harbour until it was cleared in 1951.
Major rebuilding took place in the Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791. In that year a Carrara marble statue of Queen Anne, sculpted by Francis Bird was presented to the town by Sir Jacob Bancks, who served as the local Member of Parliament from 1698 to 1715. It originally stood in the parish church but was moved to Wellington Square in 1893, when the marble pedestal and canopy by H. Dare Bryan were added. Lower town and the quay area were rebuilt and the fortunes of the town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 was becoming a retirement centre.
Early areas of development of the town include Higher Town with its cottages, many of which are &quot;listed&quot; buildings of historic interest, some of which are still thatched, and the Quay area. In Victorian times wealthy industrialists built large houses on North Hill and hotels were developed so that tourism became an important industry. It was in the Victorian and Edwardian era that tourism in the town increased. There was a marked increase in building in the early years of the 20th century when the landowners, the Luttrells of Dunster Castle, released extensive building land. Probably the most prolific Edwardian architect was W.J.Tamlyn from North Devon who settled in the town and was responsible for designing several hundred domestic properties as well as Minehead Town Hall and the Queen&#x27;s Hall.

The steamship SS &quot;Pelican&quot; grounded in Minehead Bay on 22 June 1928, on an unmarked reef known as the Gables that circles Minehead Bay, from land. The &quot;Pelican&quot; was sailing from Port Talbot to Highbridge. The crew of five were rescued by the Minehead Lifeboat. Evacuees were billeted in Minehead during the Second World War. During the war, the town was bombed by KG 54, a Luftwaffe bomber wing on the night of the 7/8 April 1941. Butlins opened in 1962, and has brought thousands of visitors to the town.

==Governance==
The civil parish of Minehead is governed by a town council, which was created in 1983. Since April 2023, Minehead has been part of the unitary authority area administered by Somerset Council. Most of the parish forms the Minehead electoral division which elects two members of Somerset Council. The exception is an area in the south-east, including Alcombe and Ellicombe, which is within the largely rural Dunster division that also elects two members.

Minehead was previously in the district of Somerset West and Taunton, and before that West Somerset. Until 1974 it was part of Minehead Urban District.
The town falls within the Tiverton and Minehead parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==
Minehead is on the Bristol Channel coast of South West England, and thus experiences one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. The tidal rise and fall in the Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.

The town is overlooked by North Hill, which rises steeply from the harbour shoreline. The town lies just outside the boundaries of Exmoor National Park. The cliff exposures around the shoreline are dramatic and fossils are exposed. Areas of the town include Higher Town, Quay Town and Lower or Middle Town, although they are no longer separate.

In 1990, much of Minehead&#x27;s beach was washed away in a severe storm which also caused serious flooding in the town. A £12.6 million sea defence scheme by the Environment Agency was designed to reduce the risk of this erosion and flooding happening in the future. The agency built of new sea wall and rock or concrete stepped revetments between 1997 and 1998, and imported 320,000 tons of sand in 1999 to build a new beach. This beach sits between four rock groynes and has been built at a much higher level than the previous beach so that the waves are broken before they reach the new sea wall. Any waves that do reach the new wall are turned back by its curved shape. The town&#x27;s new sea defences were officially opened in 2001.

Blenheim Gardens, which is Minehead&#x27;s largest park, was opened in 1925. The bandstand within the park is used to host musical events.

Along with the rest of South West England, Minehead has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between and . July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around . In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Landmarks==

The town&#x27;s major tourist attraction is Butlins holiday camp. Others include: the terminus of the West Somerset Railway; the town&#x27;s main ornamental park, Blenheim Gardens, off Blenheim Road; and the Minehead &amp; West Somerset Golf Club, Somerset&#x27;s oldest golf club, established in 1882, which has an 18-hole links course. A variety of sailing and wind surfing options are on offer, as well as the usual beach activities. There are many other attractions and amusement arcades, for example &quot;Merlins&quot; and a variety of well-known high street stores such as WHSmith and Boots, together with independent local shops. The town has both a Tesco and a Morrisons supermarket on its outskirts as well as a new Lidl.

The South West Coast Path National Trail starts at a marker, erected in Minehead in 2001, partly paid for by the South West Coast Path Association. The UK&#x27;s longest long-distance countryside walking trail, it runs along the South West Coast to Poole in Dorset.

==Transport==
The town&#x27;s location—sea to the north and Exmoor to the south—means that transport links are limited. Minehead is located on the A39 road, and is north-west of the M5 motorway at junction 24.

Local bus services are operated by First West of England and Quantock Motor Services.

Minehead railway station is close to the beach. The Minehead Railway was opened on 16 July 1874, linking the town to and beyond. It was operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1876. The Minehead Railway was itself absorbed into the GWR in 1897, which in turn was nationalised into British Railways in 1948. It was closed on 4 January 1971 but has since been reopened as the West Somerset Railway, which is notable for being the longest standard-gauge heritage railway in Britain.

==Media==
Minehead&#x27;s local radio station is the community-based West Somerset Radio. The local newspapers are &quot;West Somerset Free Press&quot; and &quot;Somerset County Gazette&quot;.

==Education==
In Minehead, there are two first schools, one middle school (Minehead Middle School) and an upper school, West Somerset College, which provides education for 1,298 students between the ages of 13 and 18. In 2006 there was debate about changing West Somerset&#x27;s 3-tier school system to a 2-tier system to match the rest of Somerset and the majority of education authorities in the UK.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican parish church of St Michael dates from the 15th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building; its tower used to display a beacon light for ships approaching the harbour. After being caught in a violent storm at sea, Robert Quirke dedicated a ship and its cargo to God&#x27;s service, as well as donating a cellar near the quay for prayers to be offered for those at sea. Dating from 1628 and known as the Gibraltar Celler , it is now the Chapel of St Peter. Quirke also donated money from the sale of the ship and its cargo to build almshouses.

St Michael&#x27;s parish church contains a number of historical highlights, including an impressive late medieval rood screen and rood stair, and an attractive stained glass window designed by Sir Henry Holiday. There are views from the churchyard of the surrounding hills and coastline.

The Church of St Michael the Archangel in Alcombe was built in 1903 as a chapel of ease for the Dunster parish, but in 1953 it became the Parish Church of Alcombe in its own right. St Andrew&#x27;s Church, on Wellington Square in the town, was built of red sandstone in 1877–1880, by George Edmund Street.

Butlins Minehead is the only Butlins resort still to have a small on-site chapel, and over the Easter period the resort hosts an annual Spring Harvest, the largest Christian festival in the UK. The Catholic parish of Minehead covers an area of and is served by the Sacred Heart Parish Church, built in 1896, as well as a mass centre in the nearby village of Watchet. There are also religious sites serving the needs of the Baptist, Evangelical, Methodist and United Reformed communities and the Plymouth Brethren. Alcombe is also home to the Spiritualist Church in Grove Place.

==Local economy==
Minehead has one of the UK&#x27;s three remaining Butlins holiday camps, and tourism has been a part of Minehead&#x27;s economy since Victorian times. At the height of the season in late July and early August, the town&#x27;s population is significantly increased by tourists.

There is a Farmers&#x27; Market in the Parade every Friday from 8:30 am to 2 pm, selling local produce.

==Culture==
The town hosts the annual Minehead and Exmoor Festival, a week-long classical music festival that has been running since 1963. Richard Dickins has held the post of artistic director for the festival since 1982.

The wooded bluffs above Minehead feature as the Hermit&#x27;s abode &quot;in that wood which slopes down to the sea&quot;, in &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; by Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The poet lived nearby, at Nether Stowey (between Bridgwater and Minehead). His statue can be seen at the nearby harbour at Watchet. He and Wordsworth (who lived nearby at Alfoxton House) would often roam the hills and coast on long night walks; leading to local gossip that they were &#x27;spies&#x27; for the French. The Government sent an agent to investigate, but found they were, indeed, &quot;mere poets&quot;. Cecil Frances Alexander wrote the popular Anglican hymn All Things Bright And Beautiful in Minehead and in nearby Dunster the verse:

&quot;The purple headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;−&quot; Refers to Grabbist Hill and the River Avill that runs near it through the popular tourist location Snowdrop Valley on Exmoor

Minehead was the setting of Monty Python&#x27;s 1969 sketch &quot;The North Minehead By-Election&quot; (aka &quot;Mr. Hilter&quot;) in which Adolf Hitler (posing as a &quot;Mr. Hilter&quot;), Joachim von Ribbentrop (&quot;Ron Vibbentrop&quot;) and Heinrich Himmler (&quot;Heimlich Bimmler&quot;) conspire at a local rooming house to win the local by-election as the &quot;National Bocialist&quot; candidate and unite Minehead with neighbouring Taunton (in the style of the Anschluss in 1938).

===May Day Hobby Horse===

One popular ancient local tradition involves the Hobby Horse, or Obby Oss, which takes to the streets on the eve of the first of May each year, with accompanying musicians and rival horses, for four days. In fact there are three rival hobby horses, the Original Sailor&#x27;s Horse, the Traditional Sailor&#x27;s Horse and the Town Horse. They appear on May Eve (called &quot;Show Night&quot;), on May Day morning (when they salute the sunrise at a crossroads on the outskirts of town), 2 and 3 May (when a ceremony called &quot;The Bootie&quot; takes place in the evening called &quot;Bootie Night&quot; at part of town called Cher). Each horse is made of a boat-shaped wooden frame, pointed and built up at each end, which is carried on the dancer&#x27;s shoulders.

As at Padstow, his face is hidden by a mask attached to a tall, pointed hat. The top surface of the horse is covered with ribbons and strips of fabric. A long fabric skirt, painted with rows of multicoloured roundels, hangs down to the ground all round. A long tail is attached to the back of the frame. Each horse is accompanied by a small group of musicians and attendants. The Town Horse is accompanied by &quot;Gullivers&quot;, dressed similarly to the horse but without the large frame; as at Padstow, smaller, children&#x27;s horses have sometimes been constructed. The horses&#x27; visits are (or were) believed to bring good luck. In the past there was also a similar hobby horse based at the nearby village of Dunster, which would sometimes visit Minehead. The first of May has been a festival day in Minehead since 1465.
==Sport and recreation==
Minehead Barbarians, the town&#x27;s rugby club, have been playing together since the 1930s, but the main local football club, Minehead A.F.C., is even older, founded in 1889. In September 2007, the TWIF European Outdoor tug of war championships was held at the football club&#x27;s stadium. Minehead Cricket Club, based at the West Somerset College in Alcombe, field four men&#x27;s teams and one women&#x27;s team while Minehead Hockey Club plays close by at the West Somerset Sports &amp; Leisure Centre. There is a bowls club on Irnham Road.

There have been proposals for a public swimming pool since at least 2009, and plans are being pursued by Minehead Swimming and Leisure Ltd, a community benefit society.

Minehead has on several occasions been the location of the Britain&#x27;s Strongest Man contest, most recently in 2004, and since 2006 the Butlin&#x27;s Resort has been one of the venues for the World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s UK winter tour. In 2010, stage four of the Tour of Britain road cycling race started in Minehead.

The 2011 European Outdoor tug of war championships was held within the grounds of Butlin&#x27;s Minehead from 22 to 25 September.

Since December 2012, Minehead has hosted the PDC Players Championship Finals.

<text>A browser game is a video game that is played via the internet using a web browser. They are mostly free-to-play and can be single-player or multiplayer. Alternative names for the browser game genre reference their software platform used, with common examples being [[Adobe Flash|Flash games]] and [[HTML5]] games.

Some browser games are also available as mobile apps or PC games, or on consoles. For users, the advantage of the browser version is not having to install the game; the browser automatically downloads the necessary content from the game&#x27;s website. However, the browser version may have fewer features or inferior graphics compared to the others, which are usually native apps. Browser games also had a huge influence on independent video games.

The front end of a browser game is what runs in the user&#x27;s browser. It is implemented with the standard web technologies of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. In addition, WebGL and WebGPU enable more sophisticated graphics. On the back end, numerous server technologies can be used.

Most browser games were originally created with Adobe Flash, but as Adobe Flash was shut down on December 31, 2020, special browser plug-ins are now required. Thousands of these games have been preserved by the Flashpoint project. The emulation plug-in Ruffle aims to continue browser accessibility of Flash games.

== Early browser games ==
When the Internet first became widely available and initial web browsers with basic HTML support were released, the earliest browser games were similar to text-based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs), minimizing interactions to what implemented through simple browser controls but supporting online interactions with other players through a basic client–server model. One of the first known examples of a browser game was &quot;Earth 2025&quot;, first released in 1995. It featured only text but allowed players to interact and form alliances with other players of the game.

== The Flash era ==
Browser technology quickly began to mature in the mid-1990s with support for browser plug-ins and the introduction of JavaScript. More advanced browser interactions, unbounded by the restrictions of HTML and that used client-side processing were possible. Among other browser extensions, these new plug-ins allowed users to run applets made in the Java language and interactive animations created in Macromedia Flash. These technologies were initially intended to provide web page developers tools to create fully immersive, interactive websites, though this use fell out of favor as it was considered elitism and broke expected browsing behavior. Instead, these technologies found use by programmers to create small browser games among other unexpected uses such as general animation tools.

Sites began to emerge in the late 1990s to collect these browser games and other works, such as Sun Microsystems&#x27; HotJava. These sites started to become a popular commodity as they drew web visitors. Microsoft acquired one such site, The Village, in 1996, and rebranded it as the Internet Gaming Zone, offering various card and board browser games. ClassicGames.com was created in 1997 to host a selection of classic, Java-based online multiplayer games such as chess and checkers; its popularity led Yahoo! to purchase the site in 1998 and rebranding it as Yahoo! Games.

In 1999, Tom Fulp kickstarted the Flash games scene with the release of the game &quot;Pico&#x27;s School&quot; on his site Newgrounds that featured a &quot;complexity of design and polish in presentation that was virtually unseen in amateur Flash game development&quot; of the time.

Many Flash games in the late 1990s and early 2000s received attention through the use of shock comedy or real-world events, like &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Videogame&quot;, a satire of McDonald&#x27;s business practices, or &quot;Darfur is Dying&quot;, about the War in Darfur, Sudan. In 2017, Julie Muncy writing for &quot;Wired&quot; said, &quot;Flash games lent themselves to the exaggerated and cartoonish, a style that eventually evolved into an affection-at least amongst its best creators-for beautiful grotesquerie. Like much of the younger gaming internet, Flash games defined boundaries simply to cross them; the best titles straddled a weird line between innocence and cruelty, full of gorgeous gore and enthralling body horror&quot;. In &quot;Pico&#x27;s School&quot;, based on the Columbine shootings, the player must take down a goth school shooter. There are a few other controversies involving browser games and real-world events, such as the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting reenactment &quot;V-Tech Rampage&quot;, and NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre targeting the game &quot;Kindergarten Killers&quot; after the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings.

Expansion of broadband connectivity in the early 2000s drew more people to play browser games through these sites, as well as added attention as viral phenomenon. New sites like Kongregate and Armor Games arose for hosting Flash-based games while also offering their own titles, while companies like PopCap Games and King launched their own portals featuring titles they had developed. Social media sites also drove more players to browser games. Facebook, after launching in 2004, added support for browser game functionality that integrated with its social network features, creating social network games, notably with Zynga&#x27;s &quot;Farmville&quot;. The success of browser games did hurt some developers. Humongous Entertainment reported that they lost players to Flash games in the early 2000s.

Flash games were considered to have hit their peak in the mid-2000s but waned by the early 2010s. Their popularity had fallen due to two primary causes. First was the introduction of mobile gaming, primarily with Apple&#x27;s iPhone release in 2007 and the availability of the App Store. Through the App Store, anyone could release apps for the iPhone, and with the addition of in-app purchases, new revenue models such as free-to-play quickly emerged for mobile games, well surpassing the current ad-driven revenue model of browser games. Google used the same concepts for developing the Android storefront Play Store. Developers either augmented browser games or shifted to the mobile platform to take advantage of the new revenue opportunities; notably, King transitioned one of its browser games into one of the most successful mobile games, &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot;. The second factor came from the claimed &quot;death knell&quot; for Adobe Flash by way of Steve Jobs&#x27; open letter to Adobe in 2010, stating that Apple would not support Flash on the iPhone platform due to security concerns and other factors. About a year after Jobs&#x27; letter, Adobe announced it would start deprecating Flash and transition users to HTML5 and other open standards in its other products. Adobe completely shut down Flash by January 12, 2021 after giving web developers a few years to prepare for this event. With little future in Flash, developers moved away from the browser platform in the mid-2010s.

As for Adobe Flash games, various collections of such games can be found. Even though Adobe Flash is &quot;broken&quot; and hard to launch after 2021, one can use alternatives, such as the Flashpoint Archive.

=== Indie games ===
Browser games were an important platform for the emergence of indie games. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the video game industry had started to coalesce around triple-A development, games made by large studios with multi-million dollar budgets. Because of the money involved, the industry took few risks in these major titles, and experimental games were generally overlooked. Browser games gave a venue for such titles during the early 2000s, and the broader interest in-browser games by the mid-2000s highlighted several of these titles. Subsequently, a number of early indie games are those based on browser games, such as The Behemoth&#x27;s &quot;Castle Crashers&quot;, inspired by Newgrounds&#x27; &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; and Edmund McMillen&#x27;s &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot; based on his &quot;Meat Boy&quot; browser game. Other indie developers got their start in browser and Flash games, including Vlambeer, Bennett Foddy, and Maddy Thorson.

== Post-Flash browser games ==
Post-2010, browser games written in other formats besides Flash remain popular, such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly. The .io domain, which was first used in 2015 by &quot;Agar.io&quot;, has become a popular domain attached to browser games, because of its short length, the ease of acquiring the domain, and the association with programming because &quot;io&quot; can also stand for input/output. Subsequently, these game developers have found ways to monetize their work by creating versions for mobile devices or other platforms which they can sell.

=== .io games ===

.io games or IO games are a genre of free, online multiplayer that gained popularity with the success of &quot;Agar.io&quot; in 2015. The games are usually characterized by simple graphics and gameplay in a free for all multiplayer arena. The term &quot;.io&quot; comes from the .io domain, which was originally assigned to the British Indian Ocean Territory but became popular for game developers due to its short and memorable nature.

Thousands of .io games exist, and many of them have been subject to controversy for both political use and lack of moderation.

==== &quot;Agar.io&quot; ====
&quot;Agar.io&quot; is considered the first ever .io game. The game was announced on 4chan on 27 April, 2015 by Matheus Valadares, a then 19-year-old Brazilian developer. In the game, players control one or more circular cells in a map representing a Petri dish. The goal is to gain as much mass as possible by eating cells and player cells smaller than the player&#x27;s cell while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player&#x27;s cells. 

&quot;Agar.io&quot; went viral, and was featured on the free online games site Miniclip. The mobile version of &quot;Agar.io&quot; for iOS was released on 8 July 2015 and Android on 7 July 2015 by Miniclip. The browser version was released in June 2015 by CrazyGames. The YouTuber PewDiePie created a video titled &quot;REDDIT WANTS TO EAT ME! (Agario Part 1) | PewDiePie,&quot; which has over 8.5 million views as of July 2024. The creation and quickly-growing popularity of &quot;Agar.io&quot; led to the creation of similar games using the .io domain, and eventually the .io game genre. 

==== &quot;Slither.io&quot; ====
&quot;Slither.io&quot; was the second .io game to be released, which is a free for all multiplayer game that is in the Snake genre. The basic premise of the game has 50 players compete to eat colored orbs and grow as large as possible, while destroying other player&#x27;s snakes. The game was created in 2016 by Steven Howse, a self-taught independent developer who was inspired to make it after playing &quot;Agar.io.&quot; The game quickly rose to be the top game on many platforms. 

==== .io games as a genre ====
Starting in around 2016, soon after the popularity spikes of &quot;Agar.io&quot; and &quot;Slither.io&quot;, more games in the .io games genre began to be released. Many of these games were simple clones of popular games, usually released in a top down-format. Some notable games released in this period include &quot;Diep.io&quot; (another game by Matheus Valadares), &quot;ZombsRoyale.io, Krunker.io, Wings.io, Surviv.io,&quot; &quot;Hole.io, and Snake.io&quot;. These games all remain popular and are some of the most played games in the .io games genre.

==== COVID-19 ====
During COVID-19, .io games became very popular because of their accessibility on the web. Most games, not just .io games, however, also experienced growth during this time.

<doc id="488443" wikidata="Q1202394" url="?curid=488443" title="Iron Duke-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Iron Duke&quot; class was a group of four dreadnought battleships built for the British Royal Navy before the First World War. The class comprised four ships: , , , and . Launched from October 1912 to November 1913, this was the third class of Royal Navy super-dreadnoughts.
The ships were essentially repeats of the battleships; they retained the same ten 13.5 inch (34.3 cm) guns in five twin gun turrets on the centreline. However, the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;s had improved armour and a more powerful secondary armament of 6-inch weapons instead of the 4-inch mounted on the earlier ships.

The four ships were the most advanced battleships in the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the First World War, though they were soon surpassed by the five ships of the . They all saw extensive service during the war with the Grand Fleet, where &quot;Iron Duke&quot; acted as the flagship for the fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe. Three of the ships, &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, &quot;Benbow&quot;, and &quot;Marlborough&quot;, were present at the Battle of Jutland; &quot;Emperor of India&quot; missed the battle by being in dock for periodic refit. The four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships saw limited active duty following the end of the war; they were all demilitarised under the terms of the London Naval Treaty signed in 1930. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was reduced to a training and depot ship and lasted in that role until 1946 when she was scrapped. &quot;Benbow&quot; was scrapped in 1931 and &quot;Marlborough&quot; followed in 1932. &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was sunk as a gunnery target in 1931 though was later re-floated to be scrapped in 1932.

==Design==
===General characteristics===
The &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships were 622 feet 9 inches (189.8 metres) long overall, and had a beam of 90 ft (27.4 m) and a draught of 29 ft (8.8 m). This was an increase of 25 ft (7.7 m) in length and 1 ft (.3 m) in width over the preceding &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships. The &quot;Iron Duke&quot;s displaced 25,000 long tons (25,400 tonnes). This was some 2,000 tons (2,032 tonnes) heavier than the preceding &quot;King George V&quot;s, and was primarily due to the increase in calibre of the secondary battery.

The ships were powered by four-shaft Parsons turbines. Steam was provided to the turbines by 18 Babcock &amp; Wilcox or Yarrow boilers. The engines were rated at 29,000 shaft horsepower and delivered a top speed of . &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and her sisters had a fuel storage capacity of of coal and of oil. This enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament===
====Primary battery====

The &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships mounted a main battery of ten 13.5 inch (34.3 cm) Mk V(H) guns in five twin gun turrets, all mounted on the centreline. Two turrets were placed in a superfiring pair forward (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; turrets), one turret amidships—the &quot;Q&quot; turret—directly after the two funnels, and two in a superfiring pair aft of the rear superstructure (&quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; turrets). The gun houses used were Mk II turrets that weighed 600 tons (610 tonnes) and allowed for depression to −5° and elevation to 20°. Despite this, the range dials on the gunsights at the time of construction were graduated to 15 degrees; super-elevating cams and prisms to allow the full elevation of the guns to be used were issued some time after the Battle of Jutland. The forward and aft gun turrets could train 150° in either direction from the centreline, while the &quot;Q&quot; had a much more limited range. It could engage targets on an arc from between 30° to 150° from the centerline on either beam of the ship.

The guns fired at a rate of 1.5–2 rounds per minute. The Mk V &quot;Heavy&quot; gun fired a variety of shells, including high explosive and armour-piercing rounds; they all weighed 1,400 lb (635 kg). The guns were loaded with MD45 propellant charges that weighed 297 lb (135 kg); these were stored in silk bags. This provided a muzzle velocity of 2,491 ft/s (759 meters per second). At maximum elevation of 20°, the guns had a range of 23,740 yards (21,710 m), though at the maximum effective elevation of 15°, the range was somewhat shorter, at approximately 20,000 yd (18,290 m). At a range of 10,000 yd (9,144 m), the gun could penetrate up to 12.5 in (318 mm) of Krupp cemented steel armour, the type used on contemporary German dreadnoughts.

====Secondary battery====

The secondary battery consisted of twelve 6-inch (15.2 cm) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure. These guns were chosen because the 4-inch (10.2 cm) guns on earlier battleships were deemed to be too weak and have too short a range to effectively combat torpedo boats with newer, more powerful torpedoes. Admiral Jackie Fisher had opposed the idea of increasing the secondary battery, though he retired from the post of First Sea Lord in 1910. As a result, the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;s, which were designed in 1911, received the larger 6 inch gun.

These guns fired 100 lb (45.4 kg) shells at a rate of between 5 and 7 per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle velocity of 2,775 ft/s (846 m/s), though the guns were capable of higher velocities. It was reduced in order to standardize the performance of all the 6 inch guns in Royal Navy service, which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre. The guns could elevate to 20°, which enabled a maximum range of 15,800 yd (14,450 m).

There were some significant problems with the casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was compounded by the fact that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.

====Other armament====
&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was the first British battleship to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3 in (7.62 cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 12 and 14 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5 lb (5.67 kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500 ft (7,160 m).

As was customary for capital ships of the period, the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships were equipped with submerged torpedo tubes. The ships carried four 21 in (53.3 cm) tubes, two on each beam. These launched Mk II torpedoes that carried a 515 lb (234 kg) TNT warhead. They had two speed settings; and . At 31 knots, the range was 10,750 yd (9,830 m), though at 45 kn the range was considerably reduced, to 4,500 yd (4,110 m).

===Armour===
The &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships had an armour belt that was thick in the central area of the ship, where the ammunition magazines, machinery spaces, and other vital parts of the ship were located. The belt tapered down to towards the bow and stern. The barbettes that contained the main gun turrets were on the sides and on the rear, where shells were less likely to hit. The turrets themselves were thick on the sides. The ships&#x27; armoured deck was between 25 and 65 mm (1–2.5 in) thick. After the battle of Jutland in May 1916, some 820 tonnes of armour was added to the ships, primarily to thicken the deck around the main battery turrets, as well as to increase the bulkheads in the ammunition magazines.

==Ships==
===&quot;Iron Duke&quot;===

Upon commissioning, was assigned to the Home Fleet as the flagship of Admiral George Callaghan. After the outbreak of the First World War, the Royal Navy was reorganized; the Home Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet were combined to form the Grand Fleet; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; retained her position as fleet flagship, under John Jellicoe. The ship took part in all of the major fleet actions, though only one of them ended in combat—the sortie on 31 May 1916 that resulted in the Battle of Jutland. At Jutland, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Division of the 4th Battle Squadron, and was stationed in the centre of the British line.

Following the end of the war, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. During 1919–20, the ship operated in the Black Sea in support of the White Russians during the Russian Civil War. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 mandated that &quot;Iron Duke&quot; be removed from the active roster. However, she remained with the fleet for a short time, having been transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in 1926. This duty assignment lasted 3 years, after which she was removed from active service. She was demilitarised, to be used as a training ship. Two of her gun turrets and a good deal of her armour were removed, and her speed was reduced to through the removal of some of her boilers. She was later used as a depot ship in Scapa Flow, starting in 1939. After the outbreak of the Second World War that year, her remaining guns were removed to be used in shore defences. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers attacked her on 17 October 1939; while they scored no direct hits, several near misses caused significant damage. After repairs were effected, the ship resumed her duties as a depot vessel until the end of the war. She was finally sold for scrapping in 1946.

===&quot;Marlborough&quot;===
 was the most heavily engaged ship of the class during the battle of Jutland; she fired a total of 162 heavy-calibre shells, out of a total of 292 for the entire class. She was assigned to the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, towards the rear of the British line. She served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Cecil Burney. During the battle, she was hit by a torpedo amidships; the torpedo tore a hole that was 21 m by 6 m (70 ft by 20 ft). Despite the damage, she was able to keep her position in the line, though her speed was reduced to . &quot;Marlborough&quot; continued to fire her main guns until the list increased to the point that prevented her guns from being effectively employed. The ship eventually withdrew to the Humber, where she undertook 3 months of repairs.

Post-war, &quot;Marlborough&quot; joined &quot;Iron Duke&quot; in the Mediterranean, where she remained until 1926. She was then transferred to the Atlantic Fleet; her tour of duty there lasted until 1929, at which point she was withdrawn from active duty. The ship was sold for scrapping in 1932.

===&quot;Benbow&quot;===
Like her sisters, was assigned to the Grand Fleet for the duration of the First World War. She was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron on 10 December 1914. &quot;Benbow&quot; was the flagship of Admiral Doveton Sturdee, the commander of the 4th Division of the 4th Battle Squadron, during the battle of Jutland. The 4th Division was directly ahead of the 3rd Division, where Admiral Jellicoe commanded the fleet from &quot;Benbow&quot;″s sister &quot;Iron Duke&quot;. Throughout the battle the ship remained undamaged. Like &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and &quot;Marlborough&quot;, &quot;Benbow&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1919, and she provided artillery support to White Russian forces in the Black Sea. She followed &quot;Marlborough&quot; to the Atlantic Fleet in 1926; she too was stricken in 1929 and sold for scrap.

===&quot;Emperor of India&quot;===
 was also assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron, in December 1914. She missed Jutland because she was in dock for a periodic refit. After the end of the war, she was transferred to the Mediterranean along with the other three ships of the class. &quot;Emperor of India&quot; returned to England in 1922 for a refit, after which she resumed her duties in the Mediterranean. She likewise joined the Atlantic Fleet in 1926, alongside her sisters, and stricken in 1929. Instead of being scrapped, however, she was used as a gunnery target, and sunk in 1931. She was raised shortly thereafter and sold to ship breakers on 6 February 1932.

<doc id="488444" wikidata="Q1201408" url="?curid=488444" title="HMS Iron Duke (1912)">
<text>HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was a dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy, the lead ship of her class, named in honour of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. She was built by Portsmouth Dockyard, and her keel laid in January 1912. Launched ten months later, she was commissioned into the Home Fleet in March 1914 as the fleet flagship. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and was capable of a top speed of .

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet during the First World War, including at the Battle of Jutland. There, she inflicted significant damage on the German battleship early in the main fleet action. In January 1917, she was relieved as fleet flagship. After the war, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; operated in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. She participated in both the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea and the Greco-Turkish War. She also assisted in the evacuation of refugees from Smyrna. In 1926, she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as a training ship.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; remained on active duty for only a few more years; in 1930, the London Naval Treaty specified that the four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships be scrapped or otherwise demilitarised. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was therefore converted into a gunnery training ship; her armour and much of her armament was removed to render her unfit for combat. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when she was moored in Scapa Flow as a harbour defence ship. In October, she was badly damaged by German bombers and was run aground to avoid sinking. She continued to serve as an anti-aircraft platform for the duration of the war, and was eventually refloated and broken up for scrap in the late 1940s.

==Design==

The four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships were ordered in the 1911 building programme, and were an incremental improvement over the preceding . The primary change between the two designs was the substitution of a heavier secondary battery in the newer vessels. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and an average draught of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Her cruising radius was at a more economical . &quot;Iron Duke&quot; had a crew of 995 officers and ratings, though during wartime this grew to up to 1,022.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was armed with a main battery of ten BL Mk V naval guns mounted in five twin gun turrets. They were arranged in two superfiring pairs, one forward and one aft; the fifth turret was located amidships, between the funnels and the rear superstructure. Close-range defence against torpedo boats was provided by a secondary battery of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns. The ship was also fitted with a pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns and four 3-pounder guns. As was typical for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged on the broadside.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was protected by a main armoured belt that was thick over the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and engine and boiler rooms, and reduced to toward the bow and stern. Her deck was thick in the central portion of the ship, and reduced to elsewhere. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

==Service history==
&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 12 January 1912 and launched on 12 October of that year. After completing fitting-out work, she began sea trials on 25 November 1913. The ship was completed in March 1914, and she joined the Home Fleet after completing her trials. In the Home Fleet, she served as the flagship of Admiral Sir George Callaghan. On 29 July 1914, as war loomed on the Continent, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the rest of the Home Fleet was ordered to proceed to Scapa Flow from Portland to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack.

===World War I===
In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; remained the flagship of the fleet, now under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and most of the fleet initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914, though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area. After receiving further information about the possibility of the rest of the German fleet being at sea, Jellicoe gave the order for the fleet to sortie to try to intercept the Germans, though by that time they had already retreated. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; went to sea with the 2nd and 4th Battle Squadrons for gunnery practice north of the Hebrides on 23 and 24 December. The following day, the rest of the fleet joined &quot;Iron Duke&quot; for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the rest of the fleet conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet, but &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not become engaged in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. Upon returning from the operation, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; went to Invergordon for refit; while she was away, acted as the temporary fleet flagship. The work was completed by 23 February, after which she returned to Scapa Flow. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 17–19 May without encountering any German vessels. On 25 May, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; carried Jellicoe to Rosyth to meet with Admiral Henry Jackson, the new First Sea Lord. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned to Scapa Flow on 28 May, in time to participate in another sweep into the North Sea on 29–31 May. After returning to Scapa Flow, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; immediately departed for Cromarty. The fleet conducted gunnery training in mid-June. &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, the 2nd Battle Squadron, and the 1st Cruiser Squadron conducted gunnery training at Cromarty on 2 August; after completing the drills, the ships returned to Scapa Flow. On 7 August, the ship again took Jellicoe to Cromarty for another meeting, this time with the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was back in Scapa Flow by 16 August.
On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; went to Invergordon on 1 October for another period of refitting—the work lasted until 11 October. Two days later, the majority of the fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on 15 October. On 2–5 November, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney. Another such cruise took place on 1–4 December. Later in the month, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; took part in gunnery drills, and during them, conducted an experiment of sorts to determine the accuracy of the ship&#x27;s gunners. Jellicoe concluded that the &quot;result was very satisfactory.&quot;

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; collided with the tanker on 12 January 1916 while in Scapa Flow, and the latter sank. The tanker had come loose during a severe gale, which had winds of up to . &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was undamaged in the accident. The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a severe gale threatened the light craft. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; guided the destroyers back to Scapa while the rest of the fleet retired independently.

On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the Germans had withdrawn, however. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. On the day of the battle, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; steamed with the 4th Battle Squadron, and was the 9th ship in the British line.

The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. At around 18:14, two large-calibre shells fell near &quot;Iron Duke&quot; but caused no damage. Fifteen minutes later, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; had closed to effective gunnery range—some —of the German fleet, and took the dreadnought under fire. &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s first salvo fell short, but the next three were on target; the ship&#x27;s gunner claimed at least six hits on the German battleship. In fact, they had scored seven hits on &quot;König&quot; and inflicted significant damage.

Shortly after 19:00, fighting around the disabled German cruiser —which had been badly damaged earlier in the engagement—resumed. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; opened fire on the crippled cruiser and nearby destroyers with her secondary battery at 19:11 at a range of . &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s gunners claimed to have sunk one of the destroyers and hit a second, but they had in fact missed their targets entirely. Shortly thereafter, the German destroyers attempted to launch a torpedo attack on the British line; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; began firing at 19:24. The sinking of the destroyer is credited to a salvo from &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, but determining which ship fired which shells in the melee is difficult, according to naval historian John Campbell.

Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard &quot;Iron Duke&quot; over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned to Scapa Flow, arriving at 11:30. Over the course of the battle, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; had fired ninety rounds from her main battery, along with fifty rounds from her secondary guns.

====Subsequent actions in the North Sea====

On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, this time to bombard Sunderland; Scheer hoped to draw out Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew, however, after their opponents&#x27; submarines inflicted losses in the action of 19 August 1916: the British cruisers and were both torpedoed and sunk by German U-boats, and the German battleship was damaged by the British submarine . After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats unless the odds of defeating the High Seas Fleet in a decisive engagement were high.

In the aftermath of Jutland, the Royal Navy determined that horizontal protection, particularly over ammunition magazines, was insufficient. As a result, many ships in the Grand Fleet had additional armour installed; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; went into dock for this work in October. The work, which saw over of armour added to the ship, was completed by December. On 28 November 1916, while she was still in dry dock, Admiral Beatty replaced Jellicoe as the commander of the Grand Fleet; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; served as his flagship until January 1917, when he transferred to . In 1918, flying-off platforms for aircraft were installed on &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; turrets.

===Post-war career===
In March 1919, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she again served as flagship. The ship went into the Black Sea in April to participate in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. While en route, the ship stopped in Constantinople on 7 April. There, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was involved in the destruction of warships and other materiel that might be used by the Bolsheviks. On 12 May, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; travelled from Constantinople to Smyrna, where she provided a landing party to occupy some of the city&#x27;s outer forts. She returned to the Black Sea, where she remained until June, when she returned to the Mediterranean.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned to the Black Sea in late 1919. She arrived in Novorossiysk on 12 October, where she met the White Russian protected cruiser &quot;General Kornilov&quot;. On 14 October, the ship stopped in Sevastopol. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned to Novorossiysk on 19 January 1920. On 25 January, she stopped in the ports of Yalta and Sevastopol to inspect the situation of the White Russians there. On 17 June, shore parties from &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the destroyer destroyed Turkish guns in the forts protecting the Bosporus on the Black Sea.

On 2 September 1922, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was steaming to the Dalmatian coast for a training cruise, when she received news of the Greek defeat in Turkey. Admiral Osmond Brock, the Mediterranean Fleet commander, ordered &quot;Iron Duke&quot; to proceed to Smyrna, where he expected disturbances. There, she served as the flagship of the British naval forces participating in the evacuation of Greek refugees from the city. She was present during the Great Fire that devastated the city. During the chaos, a number of refugees managed to come alongside &quot;Iron Duke&quot; in small boats, and were brought aboard the battleship. The following month, the Allies held a conference aboard &quot;Iron Duke&quot; at Mudania to mediate the Greco-Turkish dispute. The ship thereafter proceeded to Constantinople.
In November 1924, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; relieved &quot;Iron Duke&quot; as the Mediterranean Fleet flagship; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was then transferred to the 3rd Battle Squadron, Mediterranean Fleet, where she became the squadron flagship. The 3rd Squadron was moved to the Atlantic Fleet in March 1926, where it was used as a training squadron. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; remained the squadron flagship during this period, until 30 May 1928, when she was relieved by her sister &quot;Benbow&quot;. In 1927, the Navy considered adding anti-torpedo bulges to &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and her sister ships, but the plan was discarded because the ships were due to be replaced in 1931–1932 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the plan was not economical. That year, the aircraft launching-platform mounted on &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s &quot;B&quot; turret was removed. The ship went into dry dock in May 1928 for a periodic refit; the work lasted until May 1929. Two anti-aircraft guns were installed on the forward superstructure. The aircraft platform on &quot;Q&quot; turret was also removed during this period.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned to service on 30 May 1929, when she was recommissioned as a gunnery training ship. She served in this capacity for only a year and a half, however. In November 1931, under the terms of the London Naval Treaty, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was disarmed and converted into a gunnery training vessel. The work lasted until 21 September 1932, when she was commissioned for new sea trials. The ship&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; turrets were also removed, and several small guns of various types were installed atop &quot;B&quot; barbette. Two anti-aircraft guns were installed as well, but these were later removed in 1935. A high-angle director for the anti-aircraft guns was also added in place of the aft rangefinder. Over of steel from her belt armour was removed during the demilitarisation; in all, of material was removed from the ship and added. The ship was recommissioned on 4 October 1932 at Devonport, again as a gunnery training ship. She was featured in the film &quot;Brown on Resolution&quot;, which was released in May 1935. On 16 July 1935, she was present at the Silver Jubilee fleet review at Spithead for King George V. She attended another Fleet Review, the coronation review for George VI, on 20 May 1937. In 1939, a twin QF 5.25-inch dual-purpose gun mount was installed aft of &quot;Y&quot; barbette.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, she was used as a base ship and a floating anti-aircraft platform at Scapa Flow. Her secondary guns were removed and used for coastal defence around the base. On 17 October 1939, four Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers attacked Scapa Flow, and damaged &quot;Iron Duke&quot; with several near misses. To prevent her from sinking, her crew had to run the ship aground. On 16 March 1940 the ship, which was still beached, was attacked again by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft. This time, eighteen Ju 88s attacked the harbour and surrounding installations. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was again badly damaged, as was the heavy cruiser .

The ship&#x27;s presence in Scapa Flow may have affected the Germans&#x27; plans during Operation Rheinübung, the Atlantic sortie of the battleship in May 1941. German aerial reconnaissance spotted &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and two decoy battleships, merchant ships that had been camouflaged with wood and canvas to look like Revenge-class battleships, in the harbour, and erroneously identified them as active units of the Home Fleet. Under the mistaken impression that the heavy units of the Home Fleet were still in port, the German fleet commander, Günther Lütjens, decided to break into the Atlantic via the Denmark Strait, which resulted in the Battle of the Denmark Strait.

The ship was later repaired and returned to service as a harbour ship for the duration of the war, though she remained beached. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; remained in the Royal Navy inventory until March 1946, when she was sold for scrapping to Metal Industries, still beached in Scapa Flow. The ship was refloated on 19 April 1946 and transferred to Faslane on 19 August. In September 1948, she was re-sold and moved to Glasgow, arriving on 30 November 1948, and subsequently broken up for scrap. &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s bell is on display at Winchester Cathedral. Some of the ship&#x27;s timbers were used to create commemorative souvenirs, often bearing a plaque describing their origin.

<text>HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot; was an of the Royal Navy, named in honour of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. She was built at Devonport Royal Dockyard between January 1912 and June 1914, entering service just before the outbreak of the First World War. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and was capable of a top speed of .

&quot;Marlborough&quot; served with the Grand Fleet for the duration of the war, primarily patrolling the northern end of the North Sea to enforce the blockade of Germany. She saw action at the Battle of Jutland (31 May – 1 June 1916), where she administered the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; to the badly damaged German cruiser . During the engagement, &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; hit &quot;Marlborough&quot; with a torpedo that eventually forced her to withdraw. The damage to &quot;Marlborough&quot; was repaired by early August, though the last two years of the war were uneventful, as the British and German fleets adopted more cautious strategies due to the threat of underwater weapons.

After the war, &quot;Marlborough&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1919–1920, and she rescued members of the Imperial Family from Yalta in 1919. She was also involved in the Greco-Turkish War. In 1930, the London Naval Treaty mandated that the four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships be discarded; &quot;Marlborough&quot; was used for a variety of weapons tests in 1931–1932, the results of which were incorporated into the reconstruction programme for the s.

==Design==

The four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships were ordered in the 1911 building programme, and were an incremental improvement over the preceding . The primary change between the two designs was the substitution of a heavier secondary battery in the newer vessels. &quot;Marlborough&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and an average draught of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . &quot;Marlborough&quot;″s cruising radius was at a more economical . She had a crew of 995 officers and ratings; during wartime this increased to up to 1,022.

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten BL Mk V naval guns mounted in five twin gun turrets. They were arranged in two superfiring pairs, one forward and one aft; the fifth turret was located amidships, between the funnels and the rear superstructure. Close-range defence against torpedo boats was provided by a secondary armament of twelve BL Mk VII guns. &quot;Marlborough&quot; was also fitted with a pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns and four 3-pounder guns. As was typical for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged on the broadside.

&quot;Marlborough&quot; was protected by a main armoured belt that was thick over the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and engine and boiler rooms, and reduced to toward the bow and stern. Her deck was thick in the central portion of the ship, and reduced to elsewhere. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

==Service history==
&quot;Marlborough&quot; was laid down at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 25 January 1912. She was launched nearly ten months later, on 24 October, and was commissioned on 2 June 1914. The ship was completed on 16 June 1914, a month before the First World War broke out on the Continent. &quot;Marlborough&quot; initially joined the Home Fleets, where she served as the flagship for Sir Lewis Bayly. Following the British entry into the war in August, the Home Fleets was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, commanded by Admiral John Jellicoe. &quot;Marlborough&quot; was assigned as the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, where she served for the duration of the conflict.

===First World War===
On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea to support Vice Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port at Scapa Flow by 27 November. &quot;Marlborough&quot; and most of the fleet initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914, though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area. After receiving further information about the possibility of the rest of the German fleet being at sea, Jellicoe gave the order for the fleet to sortie to try to intercept the Germans, though by that time they had already retreated. Vice Admiral Cecil Burney replaced Bayley aboard &quot;Marlborough&quot; in December; at that time, &quot;Marlborough&quot; became the second-in-command flagship for the Grand Fleet. On 25 December, the fleet sortied for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December without event. &quot;Marlborough&quot; and the rest of the fleet conducted gunnery drills during 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet but the rest of the fleet did not become engaged in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day.

On 7–10 March 1915, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it undertook training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place during 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place during 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April. The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea during 17–19 May without encountering German vessels. Another patrol followed during 29–31 May; it too was uneventful. The fleet conducted gunnery training in mid-June. During 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises.

On 13 October, the majority of the fleet conducted a sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on 15 October. During 2–5 November, &quot;Marlborough&quot; participated in a fleet training operation west of Orkney. Another such cruise took place during 1–4 December. The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January 1916. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow, to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern.

On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans, while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled, before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the Germans had withdrawn. During 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet with 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and 31 torpedo boats commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet of 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. On the day of the battle, &quot;Marlborough&quot; was stationed toward the rear of the British line in the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.

The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. The transition from their cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions, forcing &quot;Marlborough&quot; and many of the other ships to reduce speed to to avoid colliding with each other. The British ships initially had poor visibility and &quot;Marlborough&quot; could only faintly make out a group of German s at 18:17. In the span of four minutes, she fired seven salvos, first at and then at . &quot;Marlborough&quot;″s gunners claimed to have made hits with the fifth and seventh salvos, but these claims are unlikely. Her guns were then masked by a burning cruiser, probably the armoured cruiser .

&quot;Marlborough&quot; joined the group of battleships battering the German light cruiser at 18:25. She fired five salvos, before a premature detonation in the right barrel of &quot;A&quot; turret disabled the gun. She also engaged the ship with her secondary battery. At 18:39, &quot;Marlborough&quot; again engaged what appeared to be a &quot;Kaiser&quot;-class ship, firing a salvo before the German vessel disappeared into the haze. During the engagement with &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;, the German cruiser launched one or two torpedoes at around 18:45, one of which struck &quot;Marlborough&quot; around the starboard diesel generator room. The detonation tore a hole in the hull and causing significant flooding, that forced the forward boilers on that side of the ship to be extinguished and reduced the ship&#x27;s speed to . Burney initially reported to Jellicoe that his ship had struck a mine or had been hit by a torpedo at 18:57. Several more torpedoes, this time from the torpedo boat , forced &quot;Marlborough&quot; and the rest of the ships in her division to take evasive action.
At 19:03, &quot;Marlborough&quot; engaged &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; again, firing four salvos at ranges of . She hit the German cruiser with probably three shells from the last two salvos and these finally neutralised the ship, although it took several more hours before &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; sank. &quot;Marlborough&quot; then shifted fire to the s leading the German line at 19:12. She fired thirteen salvos in the span of six minutes at at ranges of , scoring three hits, though she incorrectly claimed a fourth hit. During this phase of the battle, &quot;Marlborough&quot; fired two torpedoes, both of which missed their targets: the first at &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; at 19:10 and the second at at 19:25.

By about 19:30, &quot;Marlborough&quot;″s pumps had contained the flooding in the boiler rooms but she took on a list of around 7–8 degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently shored up. Three more torpedoes approached &quot;Marlborough&quot; at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.

After the opposing fleets disengaged late in the day, the Grand Fleet steamed south in an attempt to cut off the retreating Germans and destroy them the following morning. The 6th Division was slowed down by &quot;Marlborough&quot;, which could make no more than by this point. By around 02:00 on 1 June, the 6th Division was about behind the rest of the fleet. At that time, the bulkheads in the starboard forward boiler room started to give way under the strain, forcing &quot;Marlborough&quot; to reduce speed to . The damage control teams believed that if the main battery were to fire, the shoring supporting the damaged bulkheads would give way, greatly increasing the risk to the ship. Jellicoe detached the ship to proceed independently to Rosyth or the Tyne; Burney had ordered the scout cruiser to come alongside to transfer him to the battleship . &quot;Marlborough&quot; thereafter proceeded northward at a speed of .

&quot;Fearless&quot; rejoined &quot;Marlborough&quot; around 04:00 and both ships briefly fired at the German zeppelin &quot;L11&quot;. Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt&#x27;s Harwich Force had been ordered to reinforce the Grand Fleet, particularly to relieve ships low on fuel; they departed at 03:50 but this was too late for them to reach the fleet by morning, so Jellicoe ordered Tyrwhitt to detach destroyers to escort &quot;Marlborough&quot; back to port. On the way, &quot;Marlborough&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot; encountered the British submarines and ; the two submarines prepared to attack the ships but fortunately recognised them before they launched torpedoes. By 15:00, eight destroyers from the Harwich Force had joined &quot;Marlborough&quot; and another pump had been lowered into the flooded boiler room. At around 23:30, the pump was being moved to clean it when the roll of the ship threw the pump into the damaged bulkhead, knocking the shores loose. Water flooded into the ship and &quot;Marlborough&quot;″s captain ordered &quot;Fearless&quot; and the destroyers to prepare to come alongside, to rescue the crew if the flooding worsened at 00:47 on 2 June. A diver was sent into the boiler room at that time, and he was able to keep the pump clean, which slowly reduced the water level in the ship.

Jellicoe ordered &quot;Marlborough&quot; to proceed to the Humber for temporary repairs. While there, her forward main battery and 6-inch magazines were emptied to lighten the ship, more pumps were brought aboard and the shoring supporting the damaged bulkhead was reinforced. On the morning of 6 June, the ship left the Humber for the Tyne, where she would receive permanent repairs, escorted by four destroyers from the Harwich Force. In the course of the battle, &quot;Marlborough&quot; had fired 162 shells from her main battery, 60 rounds from her secondary guns and five torpedoes. The torpedo hit had killed two men and wounded another two. She was repaired by the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard at Jarrow, with the work lasting until 2 August, after which she departed for Cromarty, arriving on 5 August. During the repair work, an extra of armour plating was added to the ship, primarily over the magazines. These alterations were the result of the British experience at Jutland, where three battlecruisers had been destroyed by magazine explosions.

====Later operations====
On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, this time to bombard Sunderland; Scheer hoped to draw out Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew the following day, after their opponents&#x27; submarines inflicted losses in the action of 19 August: the British cruisers and were both torpedoed and sunk by German U-boats and the German battleship was damaged by the British submarine . After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats.

In February 1917, &quot;Revenge&quot; replaced &quot;Marlborough&quot; as the 1st Battle Squadron flagship; she thereafter served as the second command flagship. She was briefly replaced in this role by in May and she temporarily became a private ship. Toward the end of the year, the Germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the British convoys to Norway; this forced the British to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys. On 23 April 1918, the German fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated British squadrons, though the convoy had already passed safely. The Grand Fleet sortied too late the following day to catch the retreating Germans, though the battlecruiser was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine . In 1918, &quot;Marlborough&quot; and her sisters received flying-off platforms on their &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; turrets to handle reconnaissance aircraft.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. That morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training manoeuvres and while they were away Reuter issued the order to scuttle the High Seas Fleet.

===Postwar career===

On 12 March 1919, &quot;Marlborough&quot; was recommissioned at Devonport and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, as part of the 4th Battle Squadron, along with her three sisters and two s, &quot;Centurion&quot; and &quot;Ajax&quot;. During this period, she served in the Black Sea during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. On 5 April 1919, &quot;Marlborough&quot; arrived in Sevastopol before proceeding to Yalta the following day. The ship took Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna and other members of the deposed Russian Imperial Family including Grand Duchess Xenia, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, Prince Andrei Alexandrovich, Princess Andrei Romanovskya, Princess Irina Alexandrovna, Prince Felix Yusupov, and Princess Irina Yusupova aboard in Yalta on the evening of the 7th. The Empress refused to leave unless the British also evacuated wounded and sick soldiers, along with any civilians that also wanted to escape the advancing Bolsheviks. The Russian entourage aboard &quot;Marlborough&quot; numbered some 80 people, including 44 members of the Royal Family and nobility, with a number of governesses, nurses, maids and manservants, plus several hundred cases of luggage.
Officer&#x27;s cabins were vacated and more bunks installed in some. The Empress took over the Captain&#x27;s cabin. On the morning of 12 April the ship anchored off Halki Island, about from Constantinople, due to doubt over the family&#x27;s destination. On 16 April members of the family and their servants left the ship for HMS &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; destined for Genoa. They were replaced by other members of the nobility who were taken to Malta. The ship departed on 18 April, bound for Malta to deposit the Russians, before returning to Constantinople.

In May 1919, &quot;Marlborough&quot; conducted tests with new high-explosive 6-inch shells off the Kerch Peninsula, though these proved to be unreliable. During this period, she operated a kite balloon to aid in spotting the fall of shot. Later that month, a shell broke up in the left barrel of &quot;A&quot; turret and caused minor damage. While stationed off the Kerch Peninsula, the ship provided artillery support to White troops, including bombardments of Bolshevik positions in the villages of Koi-Asan and Dal Kamici. By 1920, British attention had turned to the Greco-Turkish War. On 20 June 1920, &quot;Marlborough&quot; arrived in Constantinople, where the Mediterranean Fleet was being concentrated to support the occupation of the city. On 6 July, British forces landed at Gemlik, while &quot;Marlborough&quot; provided artillery support.

In October 1920, the battleship arrived to replace &quot;Marlborough&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Marlborough&quot; then returned to Devonport, where she was paid off for a major refit that took place between February 1921 and January 1922. During the refit, range dials were installed, along with another range-finder on the rear superstructure. The aircraft platform was removed from &quot;B&quot; turret. Long-base range-finders were installed on &quot;X&quot; turret. After completing the refit in January 1922, &quot;Marlborough&quot; was recommissioned and assigned to the Mediterranean, where she replaced &quot;Emperor of India&quot;. She served as the second command flagship until October. Following the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, the Allied countries withdrew their occupation forces from Turkey; &quot;Marlborough&quot; was involved in escorting the troop convoys out of Constantinople.

&quot;Marlborough&quot; briefly served as the flagship for the deputy commander of the 4th Battle Squadron after &quot;King George V&quot; was damaged from striking a rock off Mytilene. In November 1924, the 4th Battle Squadron was renamed the 3rd Battle Squadron. In March 1926, the 3rd Battle Squadron, including &quot;Marlborough&quot;, was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. There, the battleships served as training ships. In 1929, the ship&#x27;s 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced with more powerful 4-inch guns. In January 1931, &quot;Marlborough&quot; served as the squadron flagship, relieving &quot;Emperor of India&quot;. She remained in the position for only five months, being decommissioned on 5 June. According to the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, the four ships of the &quot;Iron Duke&quot; class were to be scrapped or demilitarised; &quot;Marlborough&quot; was scheduled to be removed from service in 1931 and broken up for scrap.

The ship was used as a target to test the effect of various weapons on capital ships, along with &quot;Emperor of India&quot;. The tests included firing destroyer armament at the upper works at close range to test their effectiveness in a simulated night engagement, direct hits from 13.5-inch shells, bomb tests, and experiments with flash tightness in the magazines. The first two tests were conducted in July 1931, and were simulations of magazine explosions. The venting system worked as designed, and while the explosions caused serious internal damage, &quot;Marlborough&quot; was not destroyed, as the three battlecruisers had been at Jutland. In 1932, further tests were conducted with dummy and bombs to test deck strength; armour-piercing (AP) bombs and high explosive (HE) bombs were then detonated inside the ship to test their effectiveness. The Royal Navy determined that the HE bombs were useless, but that thick deck armour would be required to defeat AP bombs. This led to the decision to reinforce the deck armour of existing battleships throughout the 1930s.

&quot;Marlborough&quot; was placed on the disposal list in May 1932 and was quickly sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Co. On 25 June, she arrived in Rosyth, where she was broken up for scrap.

<text>HMS &quot;Benbow&quot; was the third of four s of the Royal Navy, the third ship to be named in honour of Admiral John Benbow. Ordered in the 1911 building programme, the ship was laid down at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard in May 1912, was launched in November 1913, and was completed in October 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. The four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;s were very similar to the preceding , with an improved secondary battery. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and twelve secondary guns. The ship was capable of a top speed of , and had a thick armoured belt.

&quot;Benbow&quot; served in the Grand Fleet as the flagship of the 4th Battle Squadron during the war. She was present during the largest naval action of the war, the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, though she was not heavily engaged. She sortied twice more, in August 1916 and April 1918 in attempts to catch the German High Seas Fleet in another major battle, but neither produced any significant action. After the end of the war in 1918, &quot;Benbow&quot; and the rest of the 4th Squadron were reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. There, she took part in operations in the Black Sea in support of White Russians in the Russian Civil War until mid-1920, when the Mediterranean Fleet began supporting Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War. In 1926, &quot;Benbow&quot; was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She was decommissioned in 1929, placed on the sale list in September 1930, and sold for scrap the following year.

==Design==

The four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships were ordered in the 1911 building programme, and were an incremental improvement over the preceding . The primary change between the two designs was the substitution of a heavier secondary battery in the newer vessels. &quot;Benbow&quot; was long overall, and she had a beam of and an average draught of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. &quot;Benbow&quot; had a fuel storage capacity of of coal and of oil. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Her cruising radius was at a more economical . &quot;Benbow&quot; had a crew of 995 officers and ratings, though during wartime this grew to up to 1,022.

&quot;Benbow&quot; was armed with a main battery of ten BL Mk V naval guns mounted in five twin gun turrets all on the centerline. They were arranged in two superfiring pairs, one forward with &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; turrets and one aft of the superstructure with &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; turrets; the fifth turret, &quot;P&quot;, was located amidships, between the funnels and the rear superstructure. Close-range defence against torpedo boats was provided by a secondary battery of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns, which were mounted in casemates in the hull clustered around the forward superstructure. The ship was also fitted with a pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns and four 3-pounder guns. As was typical for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged on the broadside.

&quot;Benbow&quot; was protected by a main armoured belt that was thick over the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and engine and boiler rooms, and reduced to toward the bow and stern. Her deck was thick in the central portion of the ship, and reduced to elsewhere. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

==Service history==
===First World War===

The keel for &quot;Benbow&quot; was laid down at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard on 30 May 1912. Her completed hull was launched on 12 November 1913, and fitting out work was completed by October 1914, just two months after the outbreak of the First World War. On 1 December, &quot;Benbow&quot; and her sister ship arrived at the 4th Battle Squadron to begin working up, before being pronounced fit for service with the fleet on 10 December. During this period, the rearmost 6-inch guns were removed from the four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships and their casemates were sealed off, as they were too low in the hull and permitted water to continually enter the ship. On the 10th, she replaced as the flagship of the 4th Squadron. On 23–24 December, the 4th and 2nd Squadrons conducted gunnery practice north of the Hebrides. The following day, the entire fleet sortied for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December; this was &quot;Benbow&quot;″s first fleet operation.

Another round of gunnery drills followed on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland, this time with the entire fleet. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet, but the main fleet did not become engaged in the Battle of Dogger Bank that took place the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place from 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place from 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April. The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea from 17–19 May without encountering any German vessels. In mid-June, the fleet conducted another round of gunnery training. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. On 13 October, the majority of the fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on the 15th. From 2–5 November, &quot;Benbow&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney. Another such cruise took place from 1–4 December.

&quot;Benbow&quot; was occupied with the typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises in January. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Admiral John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet, had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Benbow&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a severe gale threatened the light craft. &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, the fleet flagship, guided the destroyers back to Scapa while &quot;Benbow&quot; and the rest of the fleet retired independently. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the German High Seas Fleet had withdrawn, however. From 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet with sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, at that time consisting of twenty-eight dreadnoughts and nine battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. At the time of the battle, the ship&#x27;s commander was Captain Henry Wise Parker, and she was the flagship of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee. She was stationed toward the center of the British line. The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene.

At about 18:15, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. At 18:30, &quot;Benbow&quot; opened fire, but her gunners were frequently hampered by poor visibility; her two forward turrets fired only six two-gun salvos over the course of the next ten minutes without any success. Shortly thereafter, German torpedo boats attempted to rescue the crew from the light cruiser , which had been disabled between the opposing fleets, though they appeared to the British to be launching an attack against the Grand Fleet. &quot;Benbow&quot; and several other battleships opened fire with their secondary batteries, starting at 19:09. Despite the fusillade from eight battleships, none of the torpedo boats were hit, though they were forced to abandon &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;. The ship fired six salvos from her main battery between 19:17 and 19:25, the first from two of her forward guns to confirm the range, and then four 5-gun and one 4-gun salvo in rapid succession. The gunners incorrectly claimed to have hit the battlecruiser . At around that time, &quot;Benbow&quot; and three other battleships opened fire with their secondary guns on a group of torpedo boats that were launching an attack on the British line. The vessels made four hits, but in the confusion, credit for the hits could not be given.

Following the German torpedo boat attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and &quot;Benbow&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further significant action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. &quot;Benbow&quot; fired briefly at a group of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch shells and a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, &quot;Benbow&quot; had fired forty 13.5-inch armour-piercing, capped shells and sixty 6-inch rounds.

====Later operations====
Upon returning to port, &quot;Benbow&quot; was relieved as the squadron flagship, thereafter serving as a private ship. In July, the ship received additional deck armour, primarily over the ammunition magazines. The work was completed by August. On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, this time to bombard Sunderland; Scheer again hoped to draw out Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew, however, after their opponents&#x27; submarines inflicted losses in the action of 19 August 1916: the British cruisers and were both torpedoed and sunk by German U-boats, and the German battleship was damaged by the British submarine . After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats.

In late 1917, the Germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the British convoys to Norway; this forced the British to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys. In April 1918, the German fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated British squadrons, though the convoy had already passed safely. The Grand Fleet sortied too late to catch the retreating Germans, though the battlecruiser was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine . A series of minor modifications were made to &quot;Benbow&quot; throughout 1917 and 1918; these included the installation of larger and additional searchlights to improve night combat capabilities and rangefinder baffles that were intended to make it more difficult to estimate the range for enemy gunners. The baffles were later removed in 1918, and flying-off ramps were erected on &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; turrets.

===Postwar===
After the war, the Grand Fleet was dissolved, and &quot;Benbow&quot; was assigned to the 4th Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, where she served until March 1926. In 1919, Captain Charles Douglas Carpendale took command of the ship, a position he held until 1921. During this period, from April 1919 to June 1920, the ship took part in anti-communist operations in the Black Sea. &quot;Benbow&quot; and other elements of the Mediterranean Fleet supported the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. In late January 1920, &quot;Benbow&quot; was sent from Constantinople to Novorossiysk. There, the ship relieved &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, and shortly thereafter rescued a group of 150 Russian soldiers and their British adviser, who had been attacked by bandits. On 1 February, Rear Admiral Michael Culme-Seymour hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Benbow&quot;. Shortly thereafter, men from the ship were sent to inspect White positions in the Kerch Peninsula. &quot;Benbow&quot; was ordered to return to Constantinople in June, where the Mediterranean Fleet was concentrating to begin supporting Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War; she arrived there on 19 June. On 5 July, &quot;Benbow&quot; and several other vessels left Constantinople to land a force at Gemlik to secure the harbor in order to hand it over to Greek forces that would arrive later. &quot;Benbow&quot;″s men returned to the ship on 16 July after a Greek battalion reached the town.

In February 1921, &quot;Benbow&quot;, the battleship , and several destroyers conducted training exercises in the Sea of Marmara. In 1922, the ship underwent a refit at Malta. In September and October that year, she took part in further operations against Turkish forces. On 1 November 1924, the 4th Squadron was renumbered as the 3rd Squadron. The 3rd Squadron was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in March 1926 and remained there until September 1930. She became the squadron flagship on 12 May 1928, relieving &quot;Iron Duke&quot; for a major refit. &quot;Benbow&quot; took part in major fleet training exercises held in March 1929 in conjunction with the Mediterranean Fleet. Later that year, the ship was paid off. In September 1930, &quot;Benbow&quot; was placed on the sale list. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;Benbow&quot; and her sisters were slated to be replaced by new construction the following year. The ship was sold for scrap in January 1931 and broken up in March 1931 by Metal Industries, of Rosyth, arriving there on 5 April.

<doc id="488447" wikidata="Q2541382" url="?curid=488447" title="HMS Emperor of India">
<text>HMS &quot;Emperor of India was an of the British [[Royal Navy]]. She was originally to have been named Delhi&quot; but was renamed before she was completed, to honour King George V, who was also Emperor of India at the time. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1912 at the Vickers shipyard, and was launched on 27 November 1913. The finished ship was commissioned a year later in November 1914, shortly after the start of the First World War. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and was capable of a top speed of .

Upon commissioning, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; joined the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. She took part in numerous sorties into the northern North Sea to enforce the blockade of Germany, along with frequent training exercises and gunnery drills. &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was in dock for a refit in late May 1916, so she was unavailable for the Battle of Jutland. The increased danger from submarines led both the Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet to pursue more cautious strategies after Jutland, which led to a less eventful war.

After the war, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she became involved in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea from 1919–1921. She remained in the Mediterranean until 1926, when she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. The London Naval Treaty of 1930 mandated that &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and her three sister ships be dismantled. In 1931, she and underwent a series of weapons tests that proved to be highly beneficial for future British battleship designs. &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was ultimately sold for scrap in February 1932, and was broken up shortly thereafter.

==Design==

The four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class battleships were ordered in the 1911 building programme, and were an incremental improvement over the preceding . The primary change between the two designs was the substitution of a heavier secondary battery in the newer vessels. &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and an average draught of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Her cruising radius was at a more economical . &quot;Emperor of India&quot; had a crew of 995 officers and ratings, though during wartime this grew to up to 1,022.

&quot;Emperor of India&quot; was armed with a main battery of ten BL Mk V naval guns mounted in five twin gun turrets. They were arranged in two superfiring pairs, one forward and one aft; the fifth turret was located amidships, between the funnels and the rear superstructure. Close-range defence against torpedo boats was provided by a secondary battery of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns. The ship was also fitted with a pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns and four 3-pounder guns. As was typical for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged on the broadside.

&quot;Emperor of India&quot; was protected by a main armoured belt that was thick over the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and engine and boiler rooms, and reduced to toward the bow and stern. Her deck was thick in the central portion of the ship, and reduced to elsewhere. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by thick barbettes.

==Service history==

&quot;Emperor of India&quot; was laid down at the Vickers shipyard on 31 May 1912, originally to have been named &quot;Delhi&quot;. She was launched on 27 November 1913 and christened &quot;Emperor of India&quot;. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy&#x27;s Grand Fleet under Admiral John Jellicoe in November 1914 for sea trials, three months after the outbreak of the First World War. The following month she was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron as the second division flagship, where she served for the first two years of the war. On 1 December, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and her sister ship arrived at the 4th Squadron to begin working up, before being pronounced fit for service with the fleet on 10 December. During this period, the rearmost 6-inch guns were removed from the four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships and their casemates were sealed off, as they were too low in the hull and permitted water to continually enter the ship.

===First World War===
On 23–24 December, the 4th and 2nd Squadrons conducted gunnery practice north of the Hebrides. The following day, the entire fleet sortied for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December; this was &quot;Emperor of India&quot;″s first fleet operation. Another round of gunnery drills followed from 10–13 January 1915 west of the Orkney and Shetland Islands, this time with the entire fleet. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet, but the main fleet did not become engaged in the Battle of Dogger Bank that took place the following day. From 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place from 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place from 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 17–19 May without encountering any German vessels. In mid-June, the fleet conducted another round of gunnery training. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. On 13 October the majority of the fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on the 15th. From 2–5 November, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney Another such cruise took place from 1–4 December.

The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a severe gale threatened the light craft. &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, the fleet flagship, guided the destroyers back to Scapa while &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and the rest of the fleet retired independently.
On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the German High Seas Fleet had withdrawn, however. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea. &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was not available for the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June, as she was in dock for a refit. Following Jutland, she was transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron, where she again served as the second division flagship. She remained in the 1st Squadron for the rest of the war.

On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, this time to bombard Sunderland; Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the German fleet commander, hoped to draw out Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew, however, after their opponents&#x27; submarines inflicted losses in the action of 19 August 1916: the British cruisers and were both torpedoed and sunk by German U-boats, and the German battleship was damaged by the British submarine . After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats. Later that year, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was equipped with equipment to handle a kite balloon. Following the investigation into the Battle of Jutland, the Royal Navy determined that deck protection was insufficient in all of its capital ships; as a result, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; had an additional of armour over the magazines between October and December 1916.

A series of minor modifications followed throughout 1917 and 1918; these included the installation of larger and additional searchlights to improve night combat capabilities, funnel caps to reduce smoke interference with the spotting tops, and rangefinder baffles that were intended to make it more difficult to estimate the range for enemy gunners. The baffles were later removed in 1918. In late 1917, the Germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the British convoys to Norway; this forced the British to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys. In April 1918, the German fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated British squadrons, though the convoy had already passed safely. The Grand Fleet sortied too late to catch the retreating Germans, though the battlecruiser was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine .

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. That morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and while they were away Reuter issued the order to scuttle the High Seas Fleet.

===Post-war career===

In 1919, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, as part of the 4th Battle Squadron, along with her three sisters and two King George V class battleships. During this period, she served in the Black Sea during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. Admiral Edward Hobart Seymour, the commander of British forces in the Black Sea, hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 14 April. The ship bombarded Bolshevik troops on 5 May 1919 outside Theodosia, and later to disrupt the operations of a railway being used to supply the Bolshevik assault on the port. On 26 March 1920, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; provided gunfire support to the evacuating White Russian forces outside Novorossiysk, along with the French armoured cruiser . Shortly thereafter, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; came under fire from an armoured train, prompting the ship to leave the harbour, bound for Theodosia. The ship was also involved in observing the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22; this included stops in the ports of Mitylene and Smyrna.

She returned to Britain for a refit in 1922, during which new long-base rangefinders were installed on &quot;X&quot; turret. This was followed by another stint in the Mediterranean Fleet that lasted until 1926. During this period, she took part in a demonstration in Smyrna against Turkish demands that foreign warships leave the port. She was thereafter transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served until 1930. In May 1926, stability tests were conducted with the ship; these provided the basis for a 1927 proposal from the Director of Naval Construction to add anti-torpedo bulges to the four &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships. The proposal was sent to the Board for review, but concerns over the further value of the ships, which were due to be replaced in 1931–32 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, and the cost of the reconstruction led the Board to cancel it. From July–September 1927, she had a refit in Devonport. She served as the squadron flagship from June 1929–January 1931, when she was relieved by &quot;Marlborough&quot;.

According to the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, the four ships of the &quot;Iron Duke&quot; class were to be scrapped or demilitarised; &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was scheduled to be removed from service in 1931 and broken up for scrap. The ship provided one final service to the Navy by serving as a gunnery target, along with &quot;Marlborough&quot;. The tests included firing destroyer armament at the upper works at close range to test their effectiveness in a simulated night engagement, direct hits from 13.5-inch shells, aerial attacks, and experiments with flash tightness in the magazines. The main tests for &quot;Emperor of India&quot; took place in June off Bognor Regis. She departed Portsmouth on 6 June and ran aground on the Owers Bank. Salvage efforts proved fruitless, and so the Navy decided to conduct the gunnery tests there. The tests were conducted on 10–11 June, with her sister &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, which hit &quot;Emperor of India&quot; with twelve 13.5-inch shells over the two days. The first round of shells were fired from , while on the second day the range was increased to . She was refloated later and sold for scrap to the Alloa Shipbreaking Co. on 6 February 1932. She arrived in Rosyth for demolition on 16 February.

The tests provided invaluable experience that was incorporated into the and es and . Of particular importance was a shell that struck &quot;Emperor of India&quot; on the bottom edge of the main belt, which penetrated into one of the boiler rooms, where it caused tremendous damage. This showed that the depth of British belt armour was too shallow, which influenced the design of the &quot;King George V&quot; class. In addition, the tests with &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and &quot;Marlborough&quot; highlighted the weaknesses of the deck armour of British battleship designs, particularly over the ammunition magazines, and the other First World War-vintage battleships that continued in service had additional armour installed in subsequent modernisations in the 1930s.

<doc id="488450" wikidata="Q163496" url="?curid=488450" title="6th SS Mountain Division Nord">
<text>The 6th SS Mountain Division Nord () was a World War II mountain infantry division of the Waffen-SS, the military wing of the German Nazi Party, primarily consisting of ethnic Germans along with some Norwegian and Swiss volunteers. It was the only Waffen-SS division to operate in the Arctic Circle.

It was founded in early 1941 as the SS Battle Group Nord (German: &quot;SS-Kampfgruppe Nord&quot;) in southern Norway before being upgraded and renamed the SS Division Nord in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. Its original personnel came from Allgemeine-SS paramilitary units and had low combat effectiveness. In the second half of 1941 the division was effectively destroyed by the Red Army during Operation Arctic Fox, when it advanced into Soviet territory alongside the Finnish Army and the Wehrmacht. After taking massive losses in its first operation the Nord Division was entirely rebuilt starting from late 1941. 

The SS Division Nord remained in Finland and northern Russia, where most of its personnel were replaced over the course of 1942 and 1943. From that point they consisted of combat veterans and graduates of the Waffen-SS mountain warfare school. With the improvement in its combat capability, the division fought off multiple Soviet attacks. It was also renamed again as the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord. After Finland signed an armistice with the Soviet Union in 1944, the Nord Division broke through lines of Soviet and Finnish troops in a fighting retreat back to Norway. It was then redeployed to the Western Front against the Western Allied invasion of Germany.

Elements of the 6th SS Mountain Division took part in Operation Nordwind in January 1945 along the French–German border, where they took heavy losses in several failed attempts to break through the U.S. Seventh Army in the Vosges mountains to reach Alsace. Afterwards the division was reinforced by poorly trained conscripts and new recruits, though it remained one of the most capable German divisions remaining in Army Group G, defending the Rhineland. In March 1945 it fought near Trier and Koblenz before retreating west of the Rhine, and was encircled by the U.S. 5th and 71st Infantry Divisions near Büdingen. After several days of fighting the Nord Division effectively ceased to exist on 4 April 1945.

==Background and formation==
After Germany invaded Poland in 1939, the decision was made to expand the Waffen-SS, the front-line combat arm of the SS, which had to recruit from foreign countries because of limitations imposed in Germany by the Wehrmacht. Scandinavians were the first to be recruited into the SS as they were considered to be Aryan and Germanic. Shortly after the German invasion of Norway, Norwegian volunteers were used to form police and security units of the Allgemeine-SS, the general service branch of the Nazi Party militia, becoming known as the &quot;Norges-SS&quot;.

On 24 February 1941, two SS infantry regiments in German-occupied southern Norway, the 6th and 7th SS-Totenkopf-Standarten, were ordered to form a &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (battle group) ahead of the anticipated German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. These regiments consisted of ethnic Germans from annexed Czechoslovakia who had infantry training and were used in paramilitary functions by the Allgemeine-SS in Sudetenland. They included members of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (concentration camp guards). The two regiments were transferred from the Allgemeine-SS to the Waffen-SS to form the &quot;Kampfgruppe Nord&quot;. 

Under the command of &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Richard Herrmann, the Kampfgruppe received a full headquarters, including a cartographic section, two pioneer (combat engineer) companies, a reconnaissance battalion, and other support units in March 1941. In April and May, the &quot;Kampfgruppe Nord&quot; was moved into the Kirkenes region of northern Norway. There they were joined by the 9th SS Infantry Regiment. The unit still lacked training and could not effectively fight with combined arms. 

On 17 June 1941, Herrmann was replaced by &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Karl-Maria Demelhuber and &quot;Kampfgruppe Nord&quot; was renamed the SS Division Nord (German: &quot;SS-Division Nord&quot;), becoming a motorized division. The division insignia was the Hagal rune, part of the system of runes invented by Guido von List. After Finland entered into an agreement with Nazi Germany to participate in Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, the new SS division was moved into central Finland opposite of the Soviet-occupied Finnish region of Salla. The division was part of the XXXVI Army Corps. By 18 June they completed their deployment to the positions for the invasion near Salla. Demelhuber noted that the division was not combat ready, because most of the troops had no experience in combat and their vehicles had maintenance problems.

==Operation Barbarossa==

When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Finland initially chose not to attack the Soviet Union unless it was provoked, and so the German-Finnish invasion of Karelia and the Kola peninsula did not begin for another week. Soviet aircraft bombed the Finnish side of the border shortly after the start of Barbarossa, causing Finland to enter the war. The Eastern Front along the Soviet border with Finland and German-controlled Norway consisted of two halves, with the southern portion of the Finnish border being the responsibility of the Finnish Armed Forces, while the northern Finnish and the Norwegian portions were overseen by the German Army High Command Norway. In the north, the German and Finnish forces had the objective of capturing Murmansk and cutting off the Murmansk railway that connected the vital Arctic Sea port with central Russia.

The SS Division Nord attacked the Soviet border in central Finland (as part of Operation Arctic Fox) on 1 July 1941, alongside the rest of XXXVI Army Corps, which included the 169th Infantry Division. One of the Nord Division&#x27;s infantry regiments, the 9th, was sent to the most northern sector near the Arctic Sea coast, where it was part of Mountain Corps Norway. The bulk of the division that was in the central region passed through the dense forests and swamps of Salla to attack Soviet positions. In the first week of fighting, the two Nord Division regiments sustained massive losses. They launched three attacks to force the Red Army from its positions but all of them failed. The Soviets then launched an armored counterattack that pushed back the remaining SS troops, who abandoned their positions and fled in panic. This lasted until 8 July, when the 169th Infantry Division attacked from the north and the Finnish 6th Division from the south, threatening the Red Army with a double-envelopment. The successful Finnish and Wehrmacht advance forced the Soviets to withdraw from Salla, though they did not make it to their objective, the Murmansk railway. By the end of August 1941 the SS Division Nord had lost 1,085 dead.

The terrible performance damaged the Nord Division&#x27;s reputation among Wehrmacht and SS leaders, including &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler and the head of Army Command Norway, Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. After this, the Nord Division was temporarily divided between other units. The 6th SS Infantry Regiment and the Artillery Regiment were sent to the 169th Infantry Division, the 7th SS Infantry Regiment went to the Finnish III Corps, and the 9th Regiment was with Mountain Corps Norway patrolling near the Arctic Sea. Now subordinated to the III Corps, there was tension between the SS Division Nord staff and the Finns, with the former seeing the situation as a humiliation. Despite this, the Nord Division troops learned tactics from the Finns and the other units they were attached to in the continued fighting. In late August and early September, Army Command Norway sent all of the remaining SS troops to III Corps, recreating the division as a unified formation. The Nord Division was also reinforced with the arrival of 700 Waffen-SS troops, who were trained infantrymen, unlike the former paramilitary members of the Allgemeine-SS. In addition, it received three artillery battalions in September. From October to November, &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Franz Schreiber briefly took command in Demelhuber&#x27;s place.

The Nord Division had a role in the final offensive of Operation Arctic Fox, in the first two weeks of November 1941. The Finnish III Corps and the Nord Division advanced together in the Loukhsky District in a last attempt to sever the Murmansk railway. Although they made progress and inflicted losses on the Red Army, the SS and Finnish troops also sustained casualties from the strong Soviet resistance. The attack was called off by Finland on 17 November. The Nord Division conducted mopping-up operations and anti-partisan patrols in the forests of Karelia for the rest of November and December 1941. 

==Northern Russia and Finland==
===1942–1943===

The high casualties taken during Operation Barbarossa led to almost all of the Nord Division&#x27;s original members being replaced by new reinforcements by January 1942, including by &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; Germans from Hungary and Romania. On 20 April 1942, the division received a new commander, &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Matthias Kleinheisterkamp, after Franz Schreiber briefly assumed command in the interim from 1 April until his arrival. The division was used to guard nickel mines in Finland and later was planned to take part in another German offensive toward the railway. Before this could happen, on 24 April 1942 the Soviets launched an attack in the sector where SS Division Nord was. The 23rd Guards Rifle Division, the 8th Ski Brigade, and the 80th Independent Brigade made some initial advances before the SS troops counterattacked. The Soviet offensive was fought off and the front line remained static for the rest of 1942.

In the early summer of 1942, the SS Division Nord was renamed SS-Mountain Division Nord (&quot;SS-Gebirgs-Division Nord&quot;) to solve its supply problems. The infantry and artillery regiments were reformed. This included reducing the number of regiments from three to two, both of which became mountain regiments staffed by experienced personnel. The division also established a training camp for arctic and mountain warfare in Oulu, Finland. The division became part of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 20th Mountain Army, and more specifically the XVIII Mountain Corps, which it formed along with the 7th Mountain Division. Under the corps commander, General of Mountain Troops Franz Böhme, the Nord Division and other German units were to hold the sector from the Loukhsky District area to the Arctic Sea coast in the north. The division received more skis and other types of equipment for the Arctic environment over the course of 1942, and a divisional training battalion was established at Berchtesgaden in the German Alps to prepare recruits for fighting in mountain and Arctic environments. The Nord Division was involved in occasional skirmishes with Soviet troops along the front in which they were able to defend their positions, and German commanders began seeing the division as more combat capable. At the start of 1943 the SS-Mountain Division Nord had 560 officers and 20,176 NCOs and soldiers. 

In late 1943 Waffen-SS divisions were reorganized and given a number based on seniority, with the unit being renamed the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord. New recruits trained at the Waffen-SS mountain warfare school continued to be sent to the division in late 1943, and around that time they also received two Norwegian SS units, a police company and the volunteer ski company &quot;Norway&quot; (&quot;SS-Freiwilligen-Schikompanie-Norwegen&quot;). There were also some Swiss volunteers. The SS had plans to expand the 6th Mountain Division into a two-division corps, so it had about 22,000 troops, larger than a normal German mountain division, but this was never implemented because of events in 1944.

===1944===

On 15 January 1944, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Lothar Debes became the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord commander. He was in command when the Soviets began an attack on the division on 7 March 1944, part of the Red Army winter spring campaign of 1944. The main blow of the attack fell on the division&#x27;s SS Volunteer Ski Battalion &quot;Norway&quot; and the 6th SS Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion. The SS troops were pushed back, but launched a successful counterattack that drove the Soviets out of the area. Later, in May 1944, Debes was relieved of command by &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger. 

Much further to the south, on 10 June 1944 the Red Army launched an offensive to drive the Finnish Army out of the Karelian isthmus near Leningrad. The massive Soviet attack rapidly pushed back the Finns. The German XVIII Mountain Corps tried to assist them on the northern flank but was also attacked by the Soviets, with three divisions hitting the 6th SS Mountain Division. The Red Army troops broke through the left flank of the Nord Division, causing the corps commander to send his reserve, Ski Battalion 82, and Krüger to send the Nord Division&#x27;s 6th Rifle Battalion (reserve), led by Gottlieb Renz. Together they were able to push the Soviets out and prevent a possible Soviet encirclement of the division, for which Renz and the 82nd battalion commander were both awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. On 23 August 1944, Krüger was assigned to another unit and relinquished command to &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Gustav Lombard until 1 September, when his replacement arrived, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Karl-Heinrich Brenner. Later that month Finland signed the Moscow Armistice with the Soviet Union, following the successful Red Army offensive in the south, requiring Finland to cut its ties with Germany. The Nord Division staff then received word of the 20th Mountain Army&#x27;s plans for Operation Birke, the evacuation of all troops from Finland into Norway.

The Nord Division left its positions and passed through central Finland before taking a road along the Swedish border into Norway. As the SS troops withdrew from northern Russia they fought off units of the Soviet 26th Army. The 12th Regiment evacuated first while the 11th was left to cover the retreat of the rest of the division and the entire XVIII Mountain Corps. When the rear-guard battalion of the 11th Regiment was cut off by Soviet troops from the rest of the force, another battalion commander, Günther Degen, led an attack that broke through the Soviet lines and rescued the surrounded troops. He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross. The 11th Regiment reunited with the rest of the Nord Division, which began the march out of Finland towards Norway in late September 1944.

On 26 October, Finnish troops began attacking the 11th Regiment near Muonio while another Finnish unit blocked the road behind them. The Germans, led by Günther Degen, were able to break through the Finnish encirclement and reached Muonio, and continued the rest of the into Norway without any more disruptions. In the first week of November 1944 they crossed the Finnish–Norwegian border, and continued marching in subzero temperatures before reaching Gratangen. There they took a ferry to Fauske, from where they marched to the most northern point of the Norwegian railway system to take a train to the southern coast. On 19 December 1944, the Nord Division departed from Norway to Denmark by ship. Karl-Heinrich Brenner was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for commanding the division&#x27;s successful withdrawal from Finland. The Norwegian ski battalion did not join the rest of the division when it was sent back to Germany, and other units also got reassigned, bringing down its strength to about 15,000 from the previous 22,000.

==Western Front==
===Operation Nordwind===
After arriving in Denmark the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord was immediately sent to reinforce the Western Front, where a German operation known as the Ardennes offensive failed to break through American positions in France in late 1944. On 29 December 1944 the lead elements of the Nord Division arrived near the French–German border by train from Denmark, marching to the villages of Ludwigswinkel and Eppenbrunn. There the SS troops came into contact with stragglers from other German units that fought in the recent battles of the Western Front. The division was to take part in Operation Nordwind, an attack on the U.S. 7th Army of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch in southeastern France, which held a relatively weak position in the Allied line. On 1 January 1945 the offensive commenced, and the lead elements of the Nord Division, known as &quot;Kampfgruppe Schreiber&quot; after its commander, took part in the attack, subordinated to the 361st Volksgrenadier Division. The Nord Division troops were tasked with capturing the town of Wingen-sur-Moder.

The town was the headquarters of the 117th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron from the 14th Armored Division, and the area was reinforced by Task Force from the 70th Infantry Division (United States) Task Force Herren under the command of Brigadier General Thomas W. Herren Assistant Divisional Commander, and a regiment from the 45th Infantry Division. Troops from the 12th SS Mountain Infantry Regiment and the 361st Volksgrenadier Division were prepared to take Wingen-sur-Moder and other towns in the area, initially to break through a mountain pass and allow German forces to enter the Rhine Valley. On 3 January, the SS troops advanced toward the town on their own after the volksgrenadier units failed to capture their objective. The initial attack caught the American troops off guard, they were able to capture the town, taking 350 American prisoners at the 117th Cavalry headquarters. But by 6 January, the U.S. troops had captured positions behind them and cut off the Nord Division men still in Wingen-sur-Moder, who later received orders to abandon the town from the commander of the 361st Volksgrenadier Division. German attacks elsewhere also led to little progress, and offensive operations were temporarily called off. The 12th SS Mountain Infantry Regiment managed to break out of the American encirclement, facing troops from the U.S. 179th and 180th Infantry Regiments, but took heavy losses in the process.

Even after taking losses, the 6th SS Mountain Division was still in a better condition than the 361st Volksgrenadier Division. The remaining divisional units also arrived at the front and rejoined what was left of the 12th Regiment. Fighting continued between the Germans and the Americans in this sector after 11 January, with no German breakthrough initially, and around this time the division was reassigned to the XC Army Corps. But on 15 January the 11th SS Mountain Infantry Regiment counterattacked the advance forces of the 45th Infantry Division after they overran the 256th Volksgrenadier Division. The attack encircled and captured several companies from the U.S. 157th Infantry. After this success, Brenner was ordered to capture Zinswiller on 23 January. This was the last offensive action by the Nord Division before the end of Operation Nordwind, and it failed despite making initial advances. By the end of the operation, the infantry regiments had taken 50% losses, although the other divisional units were intact. The losses were replaced by poorly trained conscripts and volunteers in February 1945.

===Defense of Germany===
With the failure of the last German offensive in the West, the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord and the rest of Army Group G was tasked with holding the Rhineland in southwest Germany. At this point it was one of the most capable divisions remaining in Army Group G, though its losses in the offensive and the arrival of new replacements was changing the Nord Division from the experienced mountain infantry unit it had been in Finland. In early March 1945 the division was given new orders to retake the German city of Trier, becoming part of the LXXXII Army Corps. Brenner moved the division headquarters to Holzerath in Rhineland. On 7 March 1945 the Nord infantry crossed the Ruwer river and attacked positions held by the U.S. 94th Infantry Division. They cut off the highway south of Trier, the main American line of communication in the area. However, the Nord Division took significant losses and was ordered to withdraw. One infantry regiment, the 12th, stayed behind while the rest of the division made their way to the section of the Moselle river between Koblenz and Cochem, where it was nominally assigned to the LXXXIX Army Corps, which consisted of several infantry divisions. The U.S. XX Corps and XII Corps began attacking the positions held by the LXXXII and LXXXIX Army Corps, respectively, on 12 March.

The American troops encountered fierce resistance, including from the regiment of the Nord Division that stayed behind with the LXXXII Army Corps, which launched a counterattack that slowed down the 80th Infantry Division. Meanwhile, the Nord reconnaissance battalion reached the Moselle river ahead of the rest of the division, where it fought against American troops on 14 March. The rest of the SS division minus the regiment that stayed behind arrived by 15 March to the Moselle. They were immediately sent into battle against the U.S. 90th Infantry Division, to hold a route eastward to the Rhine for the rest of the corps. The SS troops held out and cut off an American infantry company when they attempted to force their way into the area the Nord Division troops were holding. When the rest of the 6th SS Mountain Division caught up with the recon battalion, they continued to hold out and created a route towards the Rhine from Waldesch as the Americans began taking the rest of the German positions in the Moselle area. On 16 March the LXXXIX Army Corps was ordered to withdraw, and they evacuated from the western side of the Rhine. Koblenz and Trier had both fallen by 17 March, creating a risk of collapse in the German defensive positions. The regiment that remained behind with the LXXXII Corps continued to fight separately from the rest of the Nord Division before dissolving in mid-April 1945.

The rest of the Nord Division, which remained the most intact unit in the LXXXIX Corps, remained in the Rhine valley until it was ordered by Field Marshal Albert Kesselring to move southeast to Wiesbaden shortly before 24 March, in preparation for a counterattack against General George Patton&#x27;s troops crossing the Rhine near the city. Kesselring then changed his order, sending the 6,000 survivors of the Nord Division eastward to Limburg an der Lahn to hold the river crossing there. The division reached the southern outskirts of Limburg on 26 March, having marched there after they ran out of fuel, but the U.S. 9th Armored Division was already there. On 27 March the American division broke through the line of defense that the Nord troops had established south of Limburg before advancing to the southeast. Having taken heavy losses from the American attack, the Nord Division was down to just 2,000 men, and remained west of Limburg before attempting to reach German lines further east as the Americans overran the surrounding area. By this point in late March 1945 American troops had broken through the German front along the Rhine, cutting off Army Group G in the south from Army Group B to the north, and advanced deeper into Germany. The remnants of some German units were left behind as the American main force advanced, including the Nord Division. 

On 30 March, Brenner led those who were left in an attempt to break out of the American encirclement as units of the 5th and 71st Infantry Divisions were tasked with finishing them off. In the early days of April 1945, the SS Mountain Division Nord was in an area near Büdingen, where there was fierce fighting against U.S. troops with the use of Sherman tanks and other captured American weapons. Organized resistance ceased with the surrender of the last divisional units on 3 April. The division was no longer an effective force by 4 April, and formally ceased to exist on 8 May 1945 with the dissolution of all German units. Some members of the division were able to escape eastward from Büdingen, including the commander, Karl-Heinrich Brenner. Later that month a significant number of the survivors were combined with SS officer cadets in Bavaria to form the 38th SS Grenadier Division Nibelungen, though this unit did not finish forming before the defeat of Germany in early May.

<doc id="488452" wikidata="Q3104294" url="?curid=488452" title="Gerrard Street (Toronto)">
<text>Gerrard Street is a street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It consists of two separate parts, historically referred to as Lower Gerrard and Upper Gerrard. The former stretches between University Avenue and Coxwell Avenue for 6 km, across Old Toronto. The latter portion starts 300 m north of Lower Gerrard&#x27;s eastern terminus and runs between Coxwell Avenue and Clonmore Drive, between Victoria Park Avenue and Warden Avenue, in Scarborough for another 4 km.

Gerrard Street travels through a few important districts and neighbourhoods of Toronto, most notably Discovery District, East Chinatown, and Gerrard India Bazaar, Toronto&#x27;s prime South Asian ethnic enclave.

==History==

Gerrard is named for Samuel Gerrard (1767-1857), an Anglo-Irish businessman in Lower Canada and a personal friend of the Honourable John McGill, member of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada.

Upper Gerrard was originally a separate street called &quot;Lake View Avenue&quot;, which was in the town of East Toronto. The name was changed after East Toronto was annexed by Toronto in 1908.

==Gerrard Village==

A short stretch of Gerrard Street West from Bay Street to LaPlante Avenue was referred to as Gerrard Village, a bohemian-Greenwich Village like area emerged in late 19th Century to 1920s and disappeared towards the end of the 1960s. A few buildings from the former neighbourhood still exists, but the residents and remaining business no longer hold ties to the past.

People who lived or are associated to it included famous writers, artists:

* Pierre Berton - Canadian historian and author
* Ernest Hemingway - American novelist and reporter lived here during his time in Toronto around 1919-1920
* Lawren Harris - Canadian painter and member of the Group of Seven
* Albert Franck - Dutch-born Canadian painter

==Route description==
As is typical in Toronto, the street is divided into East and West addresses at Yonge Street. Atypically, the West portion of the street is very short — only four blocks long. Its western terminus at University Avenue lies within the heart of Downtown Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Hospital Row&quot;, which consists of Toronto General Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehab, and The Hospital for Sick Children. The bulk of Gerrard Street is actually known as Gerrard Street East. Toronto Metropolitan University is located on Gerrard Street East just east of Yonge Street. Further to the east, at Parliament Street, Gerrard Street separates Cabbagetown from Regent Park.

After crossing over the Don River, Gerrard Street East passes through Toronto&#x27;s East Chinatown which is centred on Gerrard between Broadview Avenue and Carlaw Avenue. Continuing east, Gerrard Street East between Greenwood Avenue and Coxwell Avenue is home to one of the largest South Asian marketplaces in North America. At the intersection of Gerrard and Broadview Avenue are two bilingual street signs with the words &quot;Gerrard St E / 芝蘭東街&quot;.

Upper Gerrard is largely a mix of residential and small neighbourhood businesses. At Victoria Park Avenue, the name of the street reverts simply to &quot;Gerrard Street&quot;, rather than &quot;Gerrard Street East&quot;, for the last four blocks before it ends by merging into Clonmore Drive. This nomenclature oddity is due to the area east of Victoria Park formerly being in Scarborough, which did not label the streets entering from Toronto with an &quot;east&quot; designation, even after the creation of Metropolitan Toronto, which used unified cardinal directions for streets elsewhere, including farther north in Scarborough itself for streets continuing from East York and North York. (Gerrard and Queen were the only streets labelled with an &quot;east&quot; designation that entered directly into Scarborough from Toronto; both only continue for a few blocks into Scarborough before ending.)

==Transit==
The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) serves Lower Gerrard with the Toronto streetcar route 506 Carlton, between Parliament Street and Coxwell Avenue. The route then travels along Coxwell Avenue and continues along Upper Gerrard until Main Street, where it turns and terminates at Main Street station. The remainder of Gerrard Street, east of Main Street, is served by the TTC bus route 135 Gerrard, which travels between Main Street station and Warden station.

==Gerrard Street Bridge==

A three-hinged ribbed deck steel arch bridge spans the Don River and (formerly railway tracks and now) the Don Valley Parkway below and was completed in 1923.

This single span replaced the previous bridge which consisted of a Warren pony truss span in the middle connected by a shorter riveted Warren deck truss spans to the east and west sides. Decorative steel railing has been replaced with concrete parapet with simple metal railings in 1991.

<text>Rosa multiflora (syn. Rosa polyantha) is a species of rose known commonly as multiflora rose, baby rose, Japanese rose, many-flowered rose, seven-sisters rose, Eijitsu rose and rambler rose. It is native to eastern Asia, in China, Japan, and Korea. It should not be confused with &quot;Rosa rugosa&quot;, which is also known as &quot;Japanese rose&quot;, or with polyantha roses which are garden cultivars derived from hybrids of &quot;R. multiflora&quot;. It was introduced to North America, where it is regarded as an invasive species.

==Description==
It is a scrambling shrub climbing over other plants to a height of , with stout stems with recurved prickles (sometimes absent). The leaves are long, compound, with 5–9 leaflets and feathered stipules. The flowers are produced in large corymbs, each flower small, diameter, white or pink, borne in early summer. The hips are reddish to purple, diameter.

&quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; and &quot;Flora of China&quot; include the varieties:
# &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; var. &quot;adenochaeta&quot; (Koidz.) Ohwi
# &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; var. &quot;cathayensis&quot; Rehder &amp; E.H.Wilson. Flowers pink, to diameter.
# &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; var. &quot;multiflora&quot;. Flowers white, diameter.

==Cultivation and uses==
&quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; is grown as an ornamental plant and also used as a rootstock for grafted ornamental rose cultivars.

In eastern North America, &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; is considered an invasive species. It was originally introduced from Asia as a soil conservation measure, as a natural hedge to border grazing land, and to attract wildlife. It is readily distinguished from American native roses by its large inflorescences, which bear multiple flowers and hips, often more than a dozen, while the American species bear only one or a few on a branch.

In some regions the plant is classified as a noxious weed. In grazing areas, it is generally considered to be a serious pest, though it is considered excellent fodder for goats. 

In Japan, the achene fruits of &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; (referred to as &quot;Eijitsu&quot; or &quot;Rosae fructus&quot;) has been utilized all over the world in traditional medicine historically and clinical practices to treat constipation. The hips of the plant are edible and can be used to make tea or medicine.

==Management==
The targeted removal of multiflora rose often requires an aggressive technique, such as the full removal of the plant in addition to the root structure. Pruning and cutting back of the plant often leads to re-sprouting. Two natural biological controls include the rose rosette disease and the rose seed chalid (&quot;Megastigmus aculeastus&quot; var. &quot;nigroflavus&quot;). Patches of introduced multiflora rose in Pennsylvania are displaying symptoms of rose rosette disease, which can lead to decline and death.

<text>The &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships were a group of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy (RN) in the early 1910s that were sometimes termed super-dreadnoughts. The sister ships spent most of their careers assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home and Grand Fleets, sometimes serving as flagships. In October 1914, &quot;Audacious&quot; struck a mine and sank. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, the surviving ships&#x27; service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

The three surviving ships were briefly reduced to reserve in 1919 before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1920–1921 where they played minor roles in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and the Chanak Crisis of 1922. The first ship to return to Britain, , became a training ship in 1923 but the other two were placed into reserve again upon their return the following year. The imminent completion of the two s in 1927 forced the sale of &quot;King George V&quot; and for scrap at the end of 1926 while was converted into a target ship to comply with the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty.

During the Second World War, &quot;Centurion&quot; was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets. &quot;Centurion&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.

==Design and description==
Ordered as part of the 1910–1911 Naval Programme, the &quot;King George V&quot; class was an enlarged version of the preceding with additional armour, a revised layout of the secondary armament and improved fire-control arrangements. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered around 869 officers and ratings upon completion and 1,114 in 1916.
Sea trials with the battlecruiser showed that the placement of the fore funnel between the forward superstructure and the foremast meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the forward boilers were alight and that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind. The &quot;King George V&quot; class also used the same arrangement and they were altered while under construction to remedy the problem at a cost of approximately £20,000 per ship. The fore funnel was moved aft and a makeshift foremast was built from one of the struts of the original tripod mast. The spotting tower at the rear of the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, and the coincidence rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower.

The ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines in the outer engine rooms and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines in the centre engine room which drove the inner shafts. The turbines used steam provided by 18 water-tube boilers. They were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a maximum speed of . During their sea trials, the ships exceeded their designed speed and horsepower, reaching a maximum of . They carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament===

The &quot;King George V&quot; class was equipped with ten 45-calibre breech-loading (BL) 13.5-inch Mark V gun in five hydraulically powered, centreline, twin-gun turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of . Their gunsights, however, were limited to +15° until super-elevating prisms were installed by 1916 to allow full elevation. In contrast to the &quot;Orions&quot;, the loading machinery of these turrets was modified to accommodate longer and heavier projectiles, some more than those of the &quot;Orions&quot;, at a muzzle velocity of about at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ships carried 100 shells per gun.

Training exercises had shown that destroyer and torpedo boats attacked more frequently from the frontal arc, so the sixteen 50-calibre BL Mark VII guns of the secondary armament was re-arranged to improve fire distribution ahead. Eight of these were mounted in the forward superstructure, four in the aft superstructure, and four in casemates in the side of the hull abreast of the forward main gun turrets, all in single mounts. The guns in the hull casemates were frequently unusable in heavy seas and were later removed during the war. The Mark VII guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 14 torpedoes were provided.

===Fire-control===
The ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were some of the first battleships in the RN to receive the full suite of fire-control equipment used during the First World War. The control position for the main armament was located in the conning tower. Data from a coincidence rangefinder (an unstabilized Barr and Stroud instrument in and stabilized Argo units in the other ships) on the roof of the conning tower, together with the target&#x27;s speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to a Dreyer Fire-control Table (a Mark III system in &quot;King George V&quot; and Mark II Tables in the others with an Argo range clock replacing the Dreyer-Elphinstone model in the Mark III) located in the transmitting station located on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was called down to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered telephone. The fire-control table integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. As a backup, two turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.
Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I, and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. The weight of the director and the enlarged spotting top proved to be more than the unsupported foremast could bear, and it had to be reinforced when the directors were installed in 1913–1914 on the roof of the spotting top. The mast of &quot;King George V&quot; used flanges, but the other three ships received half-height tripod legs. The former ship&#x27;s mast was rebuilt into a full-height tripod in 1918. Available sources do not acknowledge that was fitted with a director before her loss, but photographic evidence clearly shows one visible as she was sinking.

===Armour===
The &quot;King George V&quot;s had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and rear barbettes. It reduced to outside the central armoured citadel, but did not reach the bow or stern. The belt covered the side of the hull from above the waterline to below it. Above this was a strake of armour. The fore and aft oblique bulkheads connected the waterline and upper armour belts to the &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes. The exposed faces of the barbettes were protected by armour 9 to 10 inches thick above the main deck that thinned to below it. The gun turrets had faces sides with 3- to 4-inch roofs. The guns in the forward superstructure were protected by armour thick.

The four armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the roof was 3 inches thick. The gunnery control tower behind and above the conning tower had 4-inch sides and the torpedo-control tower aft had 6-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. Unlike the &quot;Orion&quot;s, the anti-torpedo bulkheads were extended to cover the engine rooms, as well as the magazines with thicknesses ranging from . The boiler uptakes were protected by armour plates.

===Modifications===
By October 1914, a pair of QF anti-aircraft (AA) guns were installed aboard each ship. About of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and &quot;King George V&quot; was fitted to tow kite balloons around the same time. By April 1917, the ships had exchanged a 4-inch AA gun for one of the 3-inch guns and the four 4-inch guns in the hull casemates had been removed. The stern torpedo tube was removed during 1917–1918 and one or two flying-off platforms were fitted aboard each ship in 1918; these were mounted on turret roofs and extended onto the gun barrels. &quot;King George V&quot; had them on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets, &quot;Centurion&quot; on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets and &quot;Ajax&quot; had one on &#x27;B&#x27;.

==Ships==
==Careers==

While conducting her sea trials on the night of 9/10 December, &quot;Centurion&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the Italian steamer and she was under repair until March 1913. All four ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron upon commissioning, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender, and &quot;King George V&quot; was the squadron flagship by 18 February 1913. &quot;Centurion&quot; was present to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913. The sisters represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the re-opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Kiel, Germany, 23–30 June 1914, held in conjunction with Kiel Week.
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the &quot;King George V&quot;s took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans&#x27; reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. While the 2nd Battle Squadron was conducting gunnery training off the northern coast of Ireland on 27 October, &quot;Audacious&quot; struck a mine and sank; all of her crew was successfully rescued before she capsized. &quot;King George V&quot; developed problems with her condensers in November. This forced the ship to be intermittently withdrawn from operations over the next several months while the condensers had their tubes replaced.

=== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby ===

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight predreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron, including the three surviving &quot;King George V&quot;s, and the four battlecruisers of Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces.

===Battle of Jutland===
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers which were to act as bait. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, so the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

Once Jellicoe&#x27;s ships had rendezvoused with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, on the morning of 31 May, he organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd Battle Squadron were on his left (east), the 4th Battle Squadron was in the centre and the 1st Battle Squadron on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd Battle Squadron at the head of the line of battle. The sisters were able to fire a few volleys at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group without effect early in the battle, but the manoeuvers of their escorting light cruisers frequently blocked their views of the German ships. Coupled with the visibility problems from the smoke and mist, none of the &quot;King George Vs&quot; were able to fire more than 19 rounds from their main guns.

===Subsequent activity===

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August 1916 to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, they sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught, and no shots were fired. The sisters were present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered there on 21 November.

===Postwar activities===

The sisters remained with the 2nd Battle Squadron into early 1919, after which &quot;King George V&quot; became the flagship of the 3rd Battle Squadron until that unit was disbanded later that year. The ship then became flagship of the Reserve Fleet and served until late 1920. In the meantime, &quot;Ajax&quot; had been transferred to 4th Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet by mid-1919 and sometimes served as the Fleet&#x27;s flagship. &quot;Centurion&quot; followed in early 1920, although she spent a lot of time in reserve in Malta. The sisters played minor roles in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1919–1920. &quot;King George V&quot; joined them in the 4th Battle Squadron in early 1921. After striking a rock in early September 1922, she was in Smyrna, Turkey, receiving temporary repairs when the Great Fire of Smyrna occurred later that month and evacuated some refugees when she sailed for permanent repairs at Malta. Her sisters were in Turkish waters during the Chanak Crisis around the same time. &quot;King George V&quot; was the first of the trio to return home in early 1923 and she served a training ship until she was sold for scrap at the end of 1926. &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Centurion&quot; followed in April 1924, although they were placed in reserve, with the latter serving as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Like &quot;King George V&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot; was sold for scrap at the end of 1926.
The British tonnage allowance granted by the Washington Naval Treaty permitted them to keep the three sisters in service until the two s were completed in 1927. While &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Ajax&quot; were scrapped, &quot;Centurion&quot; was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to being used as a target for surface ships, &quot;Centurion&quot; was used to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. &quot;Centurion&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may have figured out the deception. The ship was scuttled off Omaha Beach in June 1944 to form a breakwater to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Nightmarchers (&quot;huakaʻi pō&quot;) or Spirit Ranks (&quot;ʻoiʻo&quot;) are the deadly ghosts of ancient tribal Hawaiian warriors. The nightmarchers are the vanguard for a sacred king, chief, or chiefess. 

On the nights honoring the Hawaiian gods Kāne, Kū, Lono, or on the nights of Kanaloa, they are said to come forth from their burial sites or to rise up from the ocean, and to march in a large group to ancient Hawaiian battle sites or other sacred places. The legend says the night marchers are normal-size warriors, dressed for battle, carrying spears, clubs, and some are beating war drums and blowing tones from conch shells, to announce the advancing of their march. According to the myth, they are suspended in air; their feet do not touch water or ground as they traverse through the night, and they leave no evidence of their visitations.

They march in darkness after sunset and march as a group continuously until just before sunrise. Anyone living along their path may hear chanting, sounds of blown conch shell tones, and marching noises in the night. The following signs are a foul and musky “death-like” odor, and torches getting brighter and brighter as the night marchers get closer. Nightmarchers might appear during the day if they are to escort a dying relative to the spirit world. 

Ancient Hawaiian beliefs state that any mortal looking upon or being seen in defiance toward the marchers will die violently. Barriers placed in the path of night marchers will not deter them. Some people maintain that if the mortal lies motionless, face down on the ground, they are showing proper respect, fear, and deference to the night marchers, and they will be spared. Additionally, mortals can avoid harm or death from night marchers by being fortunate to have an ancient ancestor marcher present to recognize them. As they encounter the mortal, they will call out &quot;Naʻu!&quot;, which means &quot;mine&quot; in Hawaiian. No one in the warrior procession will harm them. 

Legend says planting living ti (&quot;Cordyline&quot; sp.) shrubs around one&#x27;s home is said to keep away all evil spirits and will cause the huakaʻi pō to avoid the area. The Nightmarchers are said to walk through houses with doors and backdoors placed in a straight line.

The ceremony and conduct of the march are customized to the tastes of its honored warrior leader. A Hawaiian King or Chief is known to be fond of music would be honored with much drumming and chanting. If the King or Chief enjoyed peace and quiet, the march would be as silent as possible. Further, if the King or Chief did not like to walk around much, he would be carried in a sling by warriors. 

In ancient Hawaiian lore, the laws declared body parts of a King or Chief to be sacred, and not to be seen by a mortal. The punishment for looking at these parts is always instant death, usually by bolts of intense light and flaming heat originating from several of the warrior&#x27;s eyes aimed toward the mortal. The violating mortal is incinerated instantly and the bodily remains dissipate as vapors.

If a King’s or Chief’s face was not supposed to be observed, the King or Chief would lead the assembled night marchers from the front. If his back was not to be looked upon, he would be in the back of the assembled group. However, for some Chiefs, no part of them was forbidden to look at by mortals. These Chiefs would march among their warriors in the group.

Some marches are joined by the Hawaiian gods. The torches are said to burn brighter in these marches. The largest torches are carried with one at the front, one in the back, and three within the group. The number five is significant in Hawaiian mythology. In the night marchers with Hawaiian gods present, there are six gods, three male, three female. The Goddess named Hiʻiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, (commonly shortened to Hiʻiaka), is often within the night marchers. The composition of night marchers is extremely varied.

<text>HMS &quot;King George V&quot; was the lead ship of her class of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

After the war, &quot;King George V&quot; became flagship of the Home Fleet and then of the Reserve Fleet before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1920. The ship evacuated refugees during the Great fire of Smyrna in September 1922 before returning home at the beginning of 1923. &quot;King George V&quot; was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship until late 1926 and was sold for scrap later in the year in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design and description==
The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were designed as enlarged and improved versions of the preceding . &quot;King George V&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load; by 1918, the ship&#x27;s deep displacement had increased to . Her crew numbered 869 officers and ratings upon completion and 1,114 in 1916.

The ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by 18 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials on 4 November 1912, &quot;King George V&quot; reached a maximum speed of from . She carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
Like the &quot;Orion&quot; class, the &quot;King George V&quot;s were equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. Eight of these were mounted in the forward superstructure, four in the aft superstructure, and four in casemates in the side of the hull abreast of the forward main gun turrets, all in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 14 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===

A fire-control director was installed on the roof of the spotting top in 1914, before the start of the war in August; her original pole foremast was reinforced by flanged girders to stiffen it and allow it to bear the weight of the director. By October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been added. The torpedo nets were removed in 1915–1916. Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland and a medium-length rangefinder was added atop the conning tower. Around the same time, the ship was modified to use a kite balloon. By April 1917, the 4-inch guns had been removed from the hull casemates as they were frequently unusable in heavy seas. The casemates were plated over and some of the compartments were used for accommodations. That same year, the spotting top was enlarged and the foremast was fitted with full-sized tripod legs to handle the additional weight. Her stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and flying-off platforms were fitted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets during 1918.

==Construction and career==
&quot;King George V&quot;, named after the reigning King of Great Britain, George V, was the first ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was initially going to be named &quot;Royal George&quot;, but was renamed in 1910. She was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 16 January 1911 and launched on 9 October. She was completed just over a year later, in November 1912, at a cost of £1,961,096 and was commissioned on 16 November. &quot;King George V&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender, and was the squadron flagship by 18 February 1913. She was later joined by her three sister ships and they represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the re-opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Kiel, Germany, 23–30 June 1914, held in conjunction with Kiel Week. Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine and her sons visited &quot;King George V&quot; on 24 June, followed by Kaiser Wilhelm II the next day. An &quot;at home&quot; was held on board on the 26th to which all the notables of Kiel were invited, with Admiral Warrender&#x27;s wife, Maude, acting as hostess. On 29 June, Warrender hosted a lunch for many of the senior admirals of the Imperial German Navy, including &quot;Großadmiral&quot; (Grand Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, and Admirals Friedrich von Ingenohl and Carl von Coerper.

===First World War===

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;King George V&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and her sister struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German auxiliary minelayer . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. In late November 1914, &quot;King George V&quot; developed problems with her condensers, even though she had just returned from a refit. This forced the ship to be withdrawn from operations while her port condenser had its tubes replaced, which took until 12 December.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====
The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron, including &quot;King George V&quot; and her sisters and , and stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s four battlecruisers.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness of 16 December in heavy weather. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces.

====1915–1916====
Retubing of the ship&#x27;s starboard condenser took from late December to 4 January 1915. Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;King George V&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January west of Orkney and the Shetland Islands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but the fleet was too far away participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;King George V&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December. Warrender was relieved by Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram on 16 December.

The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;King George V&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;King George V&quot;, under the command of Captain Frederick Field, was the lead ship of the battle line after deployment. She fired two salvoes for a total of nine common pointed, capped shells at the battlecruiser about 19:17, but had to turn away at 19:22 to avoid an attack by destroyers and then had to turn to avoid the ships of the 1st Light Cruiser and 2nd Cruiser Squadrons. That was the only time that the ship fired her guns during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. Vice-Admiral Sir John de Robeck relieved Jerram on 3 December.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November and she remained part of the 2nd Battle Squadron through 1 March 1919.

===Postwar activities===

By 1 May, &quot;King George V&quot; had been assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron and was serving as the flagship for Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Oliver, commanding both the Home Fleet and the squadron; he had assumed command on 22 March. On 1 November, the 3rd Battle Squadron was disbanded and &quot;King George V&quot; was transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portsmouth. She was still Oliver&#x27;s flagship, although he was now commander of the Reserve Fleet. The ship was relieved as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet by on 14 September 1920 and began a refit in preparation for her assignment to the 4th Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.

&quot;King George V&quot; recommissioned on 31 October and sailed for the Mediterranean. In February 1921, together with the dreadnought and several destroyers, she conducted training exercises in the Sea of Marmara. While passing between Mytilene and the Turkish mainland during the night of 2/3 September 1922, the ship struck an uncharted rock that flooded one of her boiler rooms. The Rear-Admiral of the squadron was forced to transfer his flag to the dreadnought and &quot;King George V&quot; had to transfer some crewmen to bring the former ship up to strength at Smyrna, Turkey. She was present during the Great Fire of Smyrna in mid-September and evacuated 130 refugees to Malta on 16 September as she proceeded there for permanent repairs.

In January 1923, the ship returned home and became a gunnery training ship at Devonport. She was relieved of that duty in November and &quot;King George V&quot; was reduced to reserve. She was then assigned to the training establishment HMS &quot;Impregnable&quot;. On 28 September 1926, the ship was taken out of service and was listed for disposal on 1 December to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. Later that month, &quot;King George V&quot; was sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company and arrived at Rosyth on 27 January 1927 to be broken up.

<doc id="488481" wikidata="Q1564496" url="?curid=488481" title="HMS Centurion (1911)">
<text>HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; was the second of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, and the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, her service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

By the end of 1919, &quot;Centurion&quot; had been transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. Although she spent much of her time in reserve, she had a peripheral role in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 &quot;Centurion&quot; was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing in addition to her normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. &quot;Centurion&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly saw through the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.

==Design and description==
The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were designed as enlarged and improved versions of the preceding . They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. &quot;Centurion&quot;″s crew numbered 862 officers and ratings upon completion.

Ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by 18 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials on 19–20 February 1913, &quot;Centurion&quot; reached a maximum speed of from . She carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
Like the &quot;Orion&quot; class, the &quot;King George V&quot;s were equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. Eight of these were mounted in the forward superstructure, four in the aft superstructure, and four in casemates in the side of the hull abreast of the forward main gun turrets, all in single mounts. Four  saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 14 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===

A fire-control director was installed on the roof of the spotting top before August 1914; her original pole foremast was reinforced by short tripod legs to stiffen it and allow it to bear the weight of the director. By October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been added on the quarterdeck. Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland. By April 1917, the four-inch guns had been removed from the hull casemates as they were frequently unusable in heavy seas. The casemates were plated over and some of the compartments were used for accommodations. In addition, one of the three-inch AA guns was replaced by a four-inch AA gun. Her stern torpedo tube was removed in either 1917 or 1918 and flying-off platforms were fitted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets during 1918.

When &quot;Centurion&quot; was initially converted for use as a radio-controlled target ship for use by ships with guns up to in diameter in 1926, the conversion was initially fairly minimal. All of her small fittings were removed, her boilers were converted to use diesel fuel instead of coal and numerous radio antennas were added for use by her controlling ship, the destroyer . The ship could steam at speeds of for three hours. Her gun turrets were removed shortly afterwards and some of the former coal bunkers were filled with rocks to compensate for weight of the turrets. This increased her draught to which reduced the chances of steeply diving shells fired at maximum range penetrating beneath the armour belt. The ship was maintained by a crew of 242 who sailed her to the firing range and then disembarked. The spotting top was removed by 22 September 1930 and her forward superstructure was cut down and her funnels were shortened in 1933 in preparation for aircraft bombing trials.

&quot;Centurion&quot; was armed with a variety of weapons in June 1940 as the threat of German invasion increased and was then modified to serve as a repair ship for the local defence ships based in Devonport. In April–May 1941, she was converted into a blockship, with her magazines now serving as fuel tanks, but she was then modified with false gun turrets and masts to serve as a decoy for the battleship . Her armament now comprised two 2-pounder (40 mm) Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot;s and eight Oerlikon light AA guns, all on single mounts. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was augmented in June 1942 with two additional &quot;pom-pom&quot;s and nine more Oerlikons.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Centurion&quot;, named after the Roman Army rank of centurion, was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. She was laid down at HM Dockyard, Devonport on 16 January 1911 and launched on 18 November. While conducting her sea trials on the night of 9/10 December, &quot;Centurion&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the Italian steamer with the loss of all hands. The battleship&#x27;s bow was badly damaged and the ship was under repair until March 1913. She cost £1,950,671 at completion and was commissioned on 22 May, joining her sister ships in the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS). The ship was present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June. All four sisters represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the re-opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, held in conjunction with Kiel Week, in Kiel, Germany, in June 1914.

===First World War===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Centurion&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and her sister struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German auxiliary minelayer . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Centurion&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of the 2nd BS, including &quot;Centurion&quot; and her sisters and , and stood with the main body in support of Beatty&#x27;s four battlecruisers.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness of 16 December in heavy weather. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces.

====1915–1916====

Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Centurion&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and the Shetland Islands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Centurion&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. The ship was refitted at Cromarty, Scotland, from 25 January to 22 February. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Centurion&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December.

The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Centurion&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea. It is uncertain if &quot;Centurion&quot; participated in this as she received a brief refit at Invergordon, Scotland, during the month.

====Battle of Jutland====

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Centurion&quot;, under the command of Captain Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, was the third ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. The ship was only lightly engaged at Jutland, firing four salvos (totalling 19 armour-piercing shells) at the battlecruiser at 19:16 before blocked &quot;Centurion&quot;″s view, failing to hit her target.

====Subsequent activity====

&quot;Centurion&quot; was being refitted when the Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.
In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November.

===Between the wars===
By 18 December 1919, &quot;Centurion&quot; had been assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. In March 1920, the ship was temporarily placed in reserve, but was recommissioned on 8 August. During the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, &quot;Centurion&quot; participated in an exchange of prisoners of war with the victorious Bolsheviks in Georgia in October–November. After the destroyer struck a mine near Trebizond on 12 November, she was towed from Constantinople to Malta for permanent repairs by &quot;Centurion&quot;. In April 1921, the ship was again reduced to reserve, recommissioning on 1 August 1922 before the Chanak Crisis of September. Upon her return home in April 1924, she became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet at Portsmouth and participated in a fleet review in Torbay on 26 July. &quot;Centurion&quot; was transferred to Chatham Dockyard at the end of the year and remained there through 1925.
In April 1926, the ship was chosen to replace the elderly semi-dreadnought as the fleet&#x27;s radio-controlled target ship. The conversion, costing approximately £358,088, began on 14 April at Chatham Dockyard and lasted until July 1927 when she began sea trials. She was laid up in 1931 to cut costs and was decommissioned at Portsmouth on 30 January 1932. The ship was recommissioned in 1933 and was used by the Atlantic Fleet on 1 June. She was used in September for trials with dive bombers, which made 19 hits out of 48 bombs dropped; a much higher rate than level bombing from medium or high altitudes. &quot;Centurion&quot; was refitted between November 1934 – January 1935 to repair the damage inflicted by the fleet.

===World War II===

In 1939–1940, the ship continued in her prewar role, although she was briefly considered for rearming in May 1940 as an anti-aircraft cruiser in support of the Norway campaign. She then served as a repair ship at Devonport before being converted into a blockship in April 1941. On 14 April, Winston Churchill suggested that a heavy naval bombardment of the Libyan city of Tripoli should be made by the Mediterranean Fleet and followed up by blocking the port with a battleship and the Admiralty suggested and a cruiser, but Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, rejected the idea of using one of his active battleships and suggested &quot;Centurion&quot; instead. Upon further consideration, he assessed the chance of success as one in ten due to the difficulties of &quot;wedging herself in exactly the right position within point blank range of the enemy guns with enemy dive bombers overhead.&quot; The ship was then modified to resemble the battleship , then building at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth.
In 1942, &quot;Centurion&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet and was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet in May–June to escort Convoy M.W. 11 from Alexandria to Malta in June as part of Operation Vigorous. She was assigned in the hopes of deceiving the Axis about the presence of an operational battleship; the Italians seem to have seen through the deception by the time the convoy sailed on 13 June, although the Germans were deceived. Two days later, the ship was slightly damaged by near misses when attacked by nine dive bombers; her Oerlikon cannon shot one of them down. &quot;Centurion&quot; was scuttled as a breakwater during the Invasion of Normandy off Omaha Beach on 9 June 1944 to protect a Mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.

<text>HMS &quot;Audacious&quot; was the fourth and last dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. After completion in 1913, she spent her brief 2-year career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. The ship struck a German naval mine off the northern coast of County Donegal, Ireland, early during the First World War. &quot;Audacious&quot; slowly flooded, allowing all of her crew to be rescued, and finally sank after the British were unable to tow her to shore. However, a petty officer on a nearby cruiser was killed by shrapnel when &quot;Audacious&quot; subsequently exploded. Even though American tourists aboard one of the rescuing ships photographed and filmed the sinking battleship, the Admiralty embargoed news of her loss in Britain to prevent the Germans from taking advantage of the weakened Grand Fleet. She is the largest warship ever sunk by naval mines.

==Design and description==
The &quot;King George V&quot;–class ships were designed as enlarged and improved versions of the preceding s. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. &quot;Audacious&quot;″s crew numbered 860 officers and ratings in 1914.

Ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts using steam provided by 18 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . &quot;Audacious&quot; carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
Like the &quot;Orion&quot; class, the &quot;King George V&quot;s were equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets. There were a pair of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the superstructure and another amidships, all on the centreline. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. Eight of these were mounted in the forward superstructure, four in the aft superstructure, and four in casemates in the side of the hull abreast of the forward main-gun turrets, all in single mounts. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 14 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;King George V&quot;–class ships were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

====Modifications====
&quot;Audacious&quot; was fitted with a fire-control director on the roof of the spotting top before her loss.

== Construction and career ==

Ordered under the 1910–1911 Naval Estimates, &quot;Audacious&quot; was the third ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down by Cammell Laird at their shipyard in Birkenhead on 23 March 1911 and launched on 14 September 1912. She was completed in August 1913 at a cost of £1,918,813, but was not commissioned until 15 October, joining her sister ships in the 2nd Battle Squadron. All four sisters represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the re-opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Germany in June 1914.

===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July, &quot;Audacious&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving at the Isle of Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow off the coast of Scotland four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the start of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The following month, the ship was refitted at HM Dockyard, Devonport, and rejoined the Grand Fleet at the beginning of October.

==== Sinking ====
Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences were reinforced. On 16 October, the 2nd Battle Squadron was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off Tory Island, Ireland, on the morning of 27 October and &quot;Audacious&quot; struck a mine at 08:45, laid a few days earlier by the German auxiliary minelayer . Captain Cecil Dampier, thinking that his ship had been torpedoed, hoisted the submarine warning; in accordance with instructions the other dreadnoughts departed the area, leaving the smaller ships behind to render assistance.

The explosion occurred under the bottom of the ship, approximately forward of the transverse bulkhead at the rear of the port engine room. The engine room and the outer compartments adjacent to it flooded immediately, with water spreading more slowly to the central engine room and adjoining spaces. The ship rapidly took on a list to port of up to 15 degrees, which was reduced by counter-flooding compartments on the starboard side, so that by 09:45, the list ranged up to only nine degrees as she rolled in the heavy swell. The light cruiser stood by, while Jellicoe ordered every available destroyer and tug out to assist, but did not send out any battleships to tow &quot;Audacious&quot; because of the supposed submarine threat. Having intercepted the stricken dreadnought&#x27;s distress calls, the White Star ocean liner arrived on the scene.

The ship could make and Dampier believed that he had a chance of making the to land and beaching the ship, so he turned &quot;Audacious&quot; south and made for Lough Swilly. The ship had covered when the rising water forced the abandonment of the centre and starboard engine rooms and she drifted to a stop at 10:50. Dampier ordered all non-essential crew to be taken off, boats from &quot;Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Olympic&quot; assisting, and only 250 men were left aboard by 14:00. At 13:30, Captain Herbert Haddock, the captain of &quot;Olympic&quot;, suggested that his ship attempt to take &quot;Audacious&quot; in tow. Dampier agreed, and with the assistance of the destroyer , a tow line was passed 30 minutes later. The ships began moving, but the line snapped as &quot;Audacious&quot; repeatedly tried to turn into the wind. &quot;Liverpool&quot; and the newly arrived collier then attempted to take the battleship in tow, but the lines broke before any progress could be made.

Vice-Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, commander of the 1st Battle Squadron, arrived on the scene in the ocean boarding vessel &quot;Cambria&quot; and took over the rescue operation. Upon learning that two ships had been mined in the area the day before, and that there was no threat from submarines, Jellicoe ordered the pre-dreadnought battleship to sail at 17:00 for an attempt to tow &quot;Audacious&quot;. Dampier ordered all but 50 men to be removed at 17:00 and Bayly, Dampier and the remaining men on the ship were taken off at 18:15 with dark approaching.

Just as &quot;Exmouth&quot; was coming up on the group at 20:45, &quot;Audacious&quot; heeled sharply, paused, and then capsized. She floated upside down with the bow raised until 21:00, when an explosion occurred that threw wreckage into the air, followed by two more. The explosion appeared to come from the area of &#x27;B&#x27; magazine and was probably caused by one or more high-explosive shells falling from their racks and exploding, then igniting the cordite in the magazine. A piece of armour plate flew and killed a petty officer on &quot;Liverpool&quot;. This was the only casualty in connection with the sinking.

== Aftermath ==
Jellicoe immediately proposed that the sinking be kept a secret, to which the Board of Admiralty and the British Cabinet agreed, an act open to ridicule later on. For the rest of the war, &quot;Audacious&quot;″ name remained on all public lists of ship movements and activities. The many Americans on board &quot;Olympic&quot; were beyond British jurisdiction and discussed the sinking. Many photos, and even one moving picture, had been taken. By 19 November, the loss of the ship was accepted in Germany. Jellicoe&#x27;s opposite number in Germany, Reinhard Scheer, wrote after the war, &quot;In the case of the &quot;Audacious&quot; we approve of the English attitude of not revealing a weakness to the enemy, because accurate information about the other side&#x27;s strength has a decisive effect on the decisions taken.&quot;

On 14 November 1918, shortly after the war ended, a notice officially announcing the loss appeared in &quot;The Times&quot;:

A Royal Navy review board judged that a contributory factor in the loss was that &quot;Audacious&quot; was not at action stations, with water-tight doors locked and damage-control teams ready. Attempts were made to use the engine-circulating pumps as additional bilge pumps, but the rapid rise of water prevented this. Although hatches were open at the time of the explosion, it was claimed that all were closed before rising water reached them. Apart from the damage to the bottom of the ship, water was found to have spread through bulkheads because of faulty seals around pipes and valves, broken pipes and hatches which did not close properly.

Naval historian John Roberts stated that the incident revealed the design flaws in the Royal Navy&#x27;s damage-control plans for the &quot;King George V&quot;–class battleships and the other recent dreadnought classes. In the first several class of dreadnoughts, the engine-circulating pumps had connections to the bilges to allow them to pump water overboard in case of flooding, but these were eliminated as useless in the ships designed after 1907. Furthermore, the ship&#x27;s auxiliary machinery was almost entirely steam powered, which meant that the steering, hydraulics and primary electrical systems were all disabled as flooding progressed in &quot;Audacious&quot;.

Two months after the battleship&#x27;s loss, the Royal Navy ordered that additional bilge pumps and piping connecting the engine-circulating pumps to the bilges be added to all the dreadnoughts of the and classes and later. Additional pumps were ordered to be fitted to the submerged torpedo rooms as well as additional valves in the ventilation ducts to limit any flooding. It is uncertain how much of this was actually carried out in the older ships as space was limited as was their availability to get the work done.

The wreck of &quot;Audacious&quot; was filmed for the television show &quot;Deep Wreck Mysteries&quot; on the History Channel in 2008. The programme featured an investigation of the wreck and the circumstances of its loss by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney and naval historian Bill Jurens. The diveable wreck lies upside down at a depth of in clear water at , some north-east of Tory Island. &#x27;B&#x27; turret and part of its barbette were blown clear of the wreck by the explosion.

<doc id="488483" wikidata="Q1564260" url="?curid=488483" title="HMS Ajax (1912)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; was the third of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. After commissioning in 1913, she spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

After the war, &quot;Ajax&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1919–1920. The ship was deployed to Turkish waters during the Chanak Crisis of September–October 1922. &quot;Ajax&quot; was placed in reserve in 1924 before being sold for scrap two years later in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design and description==
The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were designed as enlarged and improved versions of the preceding . They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. &quot;Ajax&quot;″s crew numbered 869 officers and ratings upon completion.

Ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by 18 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials on 12–13 May 1913, &quot;Ajax&quot; reached a maximum speed of from . She carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

Like the &quot;Orion&quot; class, the &quot;King George V&quot;s were equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. Eight of these were mounted in the forward superstructure, four in the aft superstructure, and four in casemates in the side of the hull abreast of the forward main gun turrets, all in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 14 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===
A fire-control director was installed on the roof of the spotting top shortly after completion in 1913; her original pole foremast was reinforced by short tripod legs to stiffen it and allow it to bear the weight of the director. By October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been added. Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland. By April 1917, the 4-inch guns had been removed from the hull casemates as they were frequently unusable in heavy seas. The casemates were plated over and some of the compartments were used for accommodations. Her stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and a flying-off platform was fitted on the roof of &#x27;B&#x27; turret during 1918.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Ajax&quot;, named after the mythological hero, Ajax, was the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. Ordered under the 1910–1911 Naval Estimates, the ship was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering at their shipyard in Greenock on 27 February 1911 and launched on 21 March 1912. She was completed a year later at a cost of £1,889,387, but was not commissioned until 31 October 1913, joining her sister ships in the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS). All four sisters represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the re-opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, held in conjunction with Kiel Week, in Kiel, Germany, in June 1914.

===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Ajax&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. While conducting training exercises a few weeks later, the ship had problems with one of her turrets and had to return to Scapa for repairs. At the beginning of October, the ship began a brief refit at HM Dockyard, Devonport. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and the dreadnought struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German auxiliary minelayer . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts, including &quot;Ajax&quot;, were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Ajax&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November.

The interned German ocean liner SS &quot;Kronprinzessin Cecilie&quot;, HMS &quot;Princess&quot;, served as a dummy for &quot;Ajax&quot; from 1 November 1914 until 9 January 1916 when she began her conversion into an armed merchant cruiser. She was based in Loch Ewe, on the western coast of Scotland, and patrolled in the Atlantic.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender&#x27;s 2nd BS, including &quot;Ajax&quot; and her sisters and , and stood with the main body in support of Beatty&#x27;s four battlecruisers. As the 2nd BS was departing Scapa Flow in the darkness, &quot;Ajax&quot; collided with a trawler, but suffered no significant damage.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness of 16 December in heavy weather. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces.

====1915–1916====
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Ajax&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of the Orkneys and the Shetland Islands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Ajax&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Ajax&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December.

The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Ajax&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Ajax&quot;, under the command of Captain George Baird, was the second ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. She fired one salvo of six common pointed, capped shells at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group shortly after 19:00, but had to cease fire immediately afterwards when her view was obstructed by the ships of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. That was the only time that the ship fired her weapons during the battle.

====Subsequent activity====

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November.

By 18 July 1919, &quot;Ajax&quot; was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet and was refitting in Malta. In February 1920, she assisted in the Evacuation of Odessa, Russia, and returned to Constantinople, Turkey, on 12 February. Vice-Admiral Sir John de Robeck, Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, hoisted his flag in &quot;Ajax&quot; on 18 April and the ship sailed to the Caucasus to allow him to investigate the situation there as the Bolsheviks advanced. After his arrival two days later, the ship briefly bombarded Bolshevik positions near Sochi before arriving back at Constantinople on 25 April. At the beginning of June, &quot;Ajax&quot; was in Sevastopol, although she was in Batumi, Georgia, by 22 June, where she remained until 9 July to cover the evacuation of the city by White forces.

De Robeck hoisted his flag again in &quot;Ajax&quot; in February 1921 as he voyaged from Malta to Smyrna, Turkey, Constantinople, and Lemnos before the ship returned to Malta before the end of the month. During the Chanak Crisis, she was ordered to Smyrna in September 1922, together with much of the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet. After the Armistice of Mudanya ended the crisis, &quot;Ajax&quot; proceeded to Malta for a refit. When the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed VI, was deposed in 1922, he was conveyed to Mecca aboard &quot;Ajax&quot;. The ship returned to Devonport in April 1924 and was placed in reserve. She was paid off and placed on the disposal list in October 1926 to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. On 10 December, &quot;Ajax&quot; was sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company and arrived at Rosyth four days later to be broken up.

<text>Pitch Black (titled The Chronicles of Riddick: Pitch Black on later re-releases) is a 2000 American science fiction action horror film directed by David Twohy and co-written by Twohy and brothers Ken and Jim Wheat from a story conceived by the latter. The film stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Claudia Black and Keith David. Dangerous criminal Riddick (Diesel) is being transported to prison in a spacecraft, and escapes when the spaceship is damaged by comet debris and crash lands on an empty desert planet. When predatory creatures begin attacking the survivors, Riddick joins forces with them to escape the planet.

&quot;Pitch Black&quot; was the final film credit of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, which merged with Universal Pictures during production. It was shot on a modest budget of US$23 million. &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was released on February 18, 2000, by USA Films and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised some inventive elements, the film&#x27;s visual style, and Diesel&#x27;s performance, but criticized a failure to fully expand on the core premise and some cliched characterizations. It was a sleeper hit, grossing over $53 million worldwide, and started a franchise centered on the antihero Riddick. A sequel, &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;, was released in 2004 by Universal, with Diesel back as the title character and Twohy returning as writer and director. A third film, titled &quot;Riddick&quot;, was released in 2013, with Diesel and Twohy reuniting again.

==Plot==
In the distant future, the spaceship &quot;Hunter-Gratzner&quot; is transporting passengers in cryostasis. Among them is Abu &quot;Imam&quot; al-Walid, a Muslim preacher guiding three young pilgrims to New Mecca; a teenage boy named Jack; a pair of prospectors named Shazza and Zeke; a rich merchant named Paris; and a law enforcement officer, William J. Johns, who is escorting notorious criminal Richard B. Riddick. Riddick has surgically modified eyes that are highly sensitive to light. Micrometeoroids rupture the ship&#x27;s hull, killing the captain and sending the ship off course. The ship&#x27;s first officer, Owens, and the docking pilot, Carolyn Fry, attempt to land the ship on a nearby planet. As the ship falls apart, Fry decides to dump the passenger section to reduce weight and level the ship, but Owens stops her. The vessel crashes into the planet&#x27;s surface, most of the passengers are killed, and Owens is fatally wounded. Riddick escapes into the desert despite Johns&#x27;s attempts to keep him restrained.

The survivors explore their surroundings, noticing that the planet&#x27;s three suns keep it in perpetual daylight. They find an abandoned geological research settlement, with a water well and a dropship that lacks power to fly. Zeke goes missing, and Riddick is suspected; while searching for Zeke, Fry escapes from aggressive photosensitive creatures after finding Zeke&#x27;s remains in their underground cave. Johns recaptures Riddick and offers him a deal: if he helps the survivors escape the planet, Johns will allow him to go free. The group takes a power cell to the dropship. One of the young pilgrims is ambushed and eaten while exploring the settlement. An orrery shows that an eclipse is imminent and the creatures will be free to hunt above ground. They realize the geologists must have been all killed by the creatures during the last eclipse. Johns informs Fry that Riddick is a capable pilot and could abandon them, and later Riddick reveals to Fry that Johns is actually a bounty hunter and morphine addict who denied Owens the drug in his final moments.

The group returns to the crash site on a solar-powered sand truck to salvage more power cells for the dropship before the eclipse, but it begins as they get there. Before the power cells can be loaded onto the sand truck, creatures pour out of the ground and devour Shazza. The group hides inside the crash while thinking of another plan, but the creatures find a way inside, and another of Imam&#x27;s child pilgrims are killed. With not many other options, and knowing about Riddick&#x27;s enhanced sight, the group asks Riddick to lead them to the dropship on foot through the darkness, to which he agrees. They build a rig from the ship&#x27;s lighting rods to wrap around Riddick, in addition to using improvised torches and other sources of light as protection from the creatures as Riddick drags the cells behind him; Paris accidentally destroys the power source to the lighting rods due to being overcome with fear and is devoured after wandering from the group. Riddick reveals to the remaining group that Jack is actually a female pretending to be a boy, and the scent of her menstrual blood is drawing the attention of the creatures; Johns suggests to Riddick that they use her as bait. Instead, Riddick fights and wounds Johns, leaving him to die as a distraction. The rest of the group pushes on as Riddick continues to drag the power cells behind him.

After Imam&#x27;s last child pilgrim is killed and rainfall starts putting out their improvised torches, Riddick hides Fry, Imam, and Jack in a cave and goes to start the dropship himself. Inside the cave, the group discovers bioluminescent worms, which they stuff in bottles to use as light. Fry leaves the cave and finds Riddick powering the ship, ready to leave. She pleads with him to help her rescue the others, but instead he offers to take her with him. Riddick is soon persuaded to return after Fry answers his question that she would die for them, and they retrieve Imam and Jack, but Riddick is separated and wounded by the predators; Fry goes back for him but a creature stabs and carries her off. Riddick makes it to the ship and delays engaging the engines to incinerate as many creatures as possible. In space, Jack asks Riddick what they should tell the authorities about him; he tells her to say that Riddick died on the planet.

==Production==
According to Ken and Jim Wheat, the original concept of &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was suggested by David Madden during his tenure in Interscope Communications. His initial premise was: &quot;[t]ravelers visit a planet where multiple suns mean perpetual daylight, but when an eclipse brings darkness, ghosts emerge.&quot; These &quot;ghost&quot; antagonists survived the first draft, but were later replaced by physical predators. Interscope approached David Twohy with the concept, letting him direct if he could refine the screenplay. Twohy had worked on an early version of &quot;Alien 3&quot;, and was aware that &quot;Pitch Black&quot; concept had similarities to that franchise. He proposed changes to character arcs in the script. Said Twohy: 

Most of the filming, including all of the external locations, took place in and around Coober Pedy, South Australia. It was winter in the region, and rain before the shoot caused filming delays. Most interior sequences were shot at the Village Roadshow Studios, in Oxenford, Queensland. In Los Angeles, New Deal Studios were used for miniature photography and the interior sequence of the spaceship crash. To highlight the different suns for some of the daytime sequences, the filmmakers used a bleach bypass process during post-production.

==Reception==

&quot;Pitch Black&quot; opened in 1,832 theaters on 18 February 2000, grossing $11,577,688 over its opening weekend and ranking 4th at the box office. The film has a domestic gross of $39,240,659 and an international gross of $13,947,000, giving it a worldwide total of $53,187,659.

===Critical response===
At review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 59% approval rating based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Despite an interesting premise (and a starmaking turn from Vin Diesel), &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is too derivative and formulaic to fully recommend to sci-fi or action fans&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb.&quot; BBC.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated it as &quot;an entertainment and quite a good one too.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;Guardian&quot; gave the film a positive review and stated that the film &quot;undoubtedly has something interesting about it, and that something can be summarized in two words: Vin Diesel.&quot; Nathan Rabin of &quot;A.V. Club&quot; gave the film a positive review and stated that the film &quot;falters a bit in its last half-hour&quot; and &quot;reduces Diesel to delivering a pithy one-liner-but for the most part, it&#x27;s terrific.&quot;

&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film 0 out of 4 stars and called the film &quot;a tiresome experience.&quot; &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and called the film &quot;a very streamlined exercise in interplanetary mayhem and the logistics of the body count.&quot; Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, stating &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was inferior to Twohy&#x27;s &quot;The Arrival&quot; (1996) and adding: &quot;how sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions.&quot;

===Accolades===

==Expanded franchise==
=== Sequels ===
The movie&#x27;s sequel, &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; (2004), was also directed by David Twohy. To tie in with the sequel, the film was novelized under the name &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Pitch Black,&quot; which was written by Frank Lauria.

A short animated movie released the same year, &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury&quot; (2004), was directed by Peter Chung. &quot;Dark Fury&quot; bridges the gap between &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot;.

&quot;Riddick&quot;, a live-action sequel to &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;, opened on September 6, 2013, with both David Twohy and Vin Diesel attached. The sequel ties in more closely to the original &quot;Pitch Black&quot;.

&quot;Riddick: Furya&quot;, the fourth installment was announced in February 2023. Vin Diesel will again appear in the film and David Twohy has written the script and will direct the film. Filming began in August 2024.

=== Prequel ===
&quot;Into Pitch Black&quot; (2000) is a Sci-Fi Channel special that includes clips from &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and takes place before and after the events of the film. Inconsistencies with the storyline of later sequels have made it non-canonical.

=== Video games ===
&quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay&quot;, a game for the Xbox and the PC, was released in 2004 to critical acclaim. A remake of &quot;Butcher Bay&quot;, including a new campaign set after Butcher Bay, was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC on 7 April 2009, under the title &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena&quot;.

<doc id="488489" wikidata="Q1565152" url="?curid=488489" title="HMS Orion (1910)">
<text>HMS &quot;Orion&quot; was the lead ship of her class of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, generally serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

After the Grand Fleet was dissolved in early 1919, &quot;Orion&quot; was transferred to back to the Home Fleet for a few months before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. She served as a gunnery training ship from mid-1921 until she was listed for disposal the following year. The ship was sold for scrap in late 1922 and subsequently broken up.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Orion&quot;-class ships were designed in response to the beginnings of the Anglo-German naval arms race and were much larger than their predecessors of the to accommodate larger, more powerful guns and heavier armour. In recognition of these improvements, the class was sometimes called &quot;super-dreadnoughts&quot;. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load as built; by 1918 &quot;Orion&quot;″s deep displacement had increased to . Her crew numbered 754 officers and ratings as of 1914.

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by 18 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials in September 1911, &quot;Orion&quot; reached a maximum speed of from . The ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. These guns were split evenly between the forward and aft superstructure, all in single mounts. Four  saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 20 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;Orion&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===
In 1914 the shelter-deck guns were enclosed in casemates. By October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been added. A fire-control director was installed on a platform below the spotting top in April–May 1915. Additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, three 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure and the ship was modified to operate kite balloons. In mid-to-late 1917, &quot;Orion&quot; was the only battleship in the Royal Navy to receive a director for her secondary armament. Two flying-off platforms were fitted aboard the ship during 1917–1918; these were mounted on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turret roofs and extended onto the gun barrels. A high-angle rangefinder was fitted in the forward superstructure by 1921.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Orion&quot;, named after the mythological hunter, Orion, was the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy (RN). The ship was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 29 November 1909. She was launched on 20 August 1910, and was commissioned on 2 January 1912. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,855,917 or £1,918,773. &quot;Orion&quot; was assigned to the 2nd division of the Home Fleet as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Herbert King-Hall, the division&#x27;s second-in-command. The ship was slightly damaged on 7 January when the pre-dreadnought battleship broke loose from her and collided with &quot;Orion&quot;″s bow. The division was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May. The ship, together with her sister ships and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres. King-Hall was relieved by Rear-Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss on 29 October. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with &quot;Thunderer&quot; to evaluate the effectiveness of the latter&#x27;s gunnery director. &quot;Thunderer&quot; decisively outshot &quot;Orion&quot;, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from &quot;Orion&quot;″s guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and &quot;Orion&quot; performed much better, apparently beating &quot;Thunderer&quot;. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913 and then participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres in August. Wemyss was relieved in his turn by Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet on 28 October. Captain Frederic Dreyer assumed command of &quot;Orion&quot; that same day. On 4 November, &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Thunderer&quot;, the dreadnought and the predreadnought fired at and sank the target ship to give their crews experience in firing live ammunition against a real ship.

===World War I===

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Orion&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, &quot;Orion&quot; was towing a target for the dreadnought and &quot;Monarch&quot; when the latter reported that she had been unsuccessfully attacked by a torpedo and the gunnery exercise was terminated. Almost two weeks later, the ship began having serious problems with her condensers and Jellicoe ordered that they be retubed while she was detached to the coaling base at Loch Ewe, on the northwest coast of Scotland. &quot;Orion&quot; rejoined the Grand Fleet on 9 September. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and the dreadnought struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German armed merchant cruiser . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Orion&quot; had to be sent to Greenock for repairs to her turbine mounts.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight predreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender&#x27;s 2nd BS, including &quot;Orion&quot; and her sisters, &quot;Monarch&quot; and , and the four battlecruisers of Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces. One of these occurred when &quot;Orion&quot;″s lookouts spotted the light cruiser and failed to engage because Arbuthnot refused to allow the ship to open fire without a command from Warrender.

====1915–1916====

Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Orion&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and the Shetland Islands. Rear-Admiral Arthur Leveson relieved Arbuthnot on 15 January. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Orion&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April. &quot;Orion&quot; was given a brief refit in late April in Devonport.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Orion&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December.

The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Orion&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Orion&quot;, under the command of Captain Oliver Backhouse, was the lead ship of the 2nd Division of the 2nd BS and was the fifth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired four salvos of armour-piercing, capped (APC) shells from her main guns at the battleship at 18:32, scoring one hit that knocked out a gun and killed or disabled its crew. About 19:15, she engaged the battlecruiser at a range of with six salvos of APC shells and claimed to her with the last two salvos. These last salvos were actually fired at the destroyer which was screening the battlecruiser and laying a smoke screen. &quot;Lützow&quot; was also fired at by &quot;Monarch&quot; during this time and was hit five times between the sisters. They knocked out two of her main guns, temporarily knocked out the power to the sternmost turret as well as causing a fair amount of flooding. This was the last time that &quot;Orion&quot; fired her guns during the battle, having expended a total of fifty-one 13.5-inch APC shells.

====Subsequent activity====

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. Rear-Admiral William Goodenough assumed command of the division on 5 December and Captain Eric Fullerton relieved Backhouse on the 14th.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November and she remained part of the 2nd BS through 1 March 1919.
By 1 May, &quot;Orion&quot; had been assigned to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet and was serving as the flagship for Rear-Admiral Sir Douglas Nicholson, second-in-command of the squadron. On 1 November, the 3rd BS was disbanded and &quot;Orion&quot; was transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, together with her sisters. Nicholson still hoisted his flag aboard her, although he was now commander of the Reserve Fleet there. Nicholson hauled down his flag on 1 April 1920 and the ship was transferred back to Portsmouth by 14 September. &quot;Orion&quot; then became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet, which was commanded by Vice-Admiral Richard Phillimore. In June 1921 she became a gunnery training ship at Portland. On 12 April 1922, she was paid off and placed on the disposal list in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. On 19 December &quot;Orion&quot; was sold for scrap to Cox and Danks and she arrived at Upnor in February 1923 to begin demolition.

<text>HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; was the second of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

After the Grand Fleet was dissolved in early 1919, &quot;Monarch&quot; was transferred back to the Home Fleet for a few months before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The ship was listed for disposal in mid-1922, but was hulked for use as a stationary training ship. In late 1923 &quot;Monarch&quot; was converted into a target ship and sunk in early 1925.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Orion&quot;-class ships were designed in response to the beginning of the Anglo-German naval arms race and were much larger than their predecessors of the to accommodate larger, more powerful guns and heavier armour. In recognition of these improvements, the class was sometimes called &quot;super-dreadnoughts&quot;. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load as built; by 1918 &quot;Monarch&quot;″s deep displacement had increased to . Her crew numbered 738 officers and ratings upon completion and 750 as of 1914.

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by 18 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a speed of . During her sea trials on 9 December 1911, &quot;Monarch&quot; reached a maximum speed of from . The ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Orion&quot; class was equipped with 10 breech-loading (BL) Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, all on the centreline. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of 16 BL Mark VII guns. These guns were split evenly between the forward and aft superstructure, all in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 20 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;Orion&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between the end barbettes. Their decks ranged in thickness between and 4 inches with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes.

===Modifications===
In 1914 the shelter-deck guns were enclosed in casemates and a fire-control director was installed sometime in 1914, before August, on a platform below the spotting top. By October 1914, a pair of anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been installed. Additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, three 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure and the ship was modified to operate kite balloons. A flying-off platform was mounted on &#x27;B&#x27; turret&#x27;s roof and extended onto the gun barrels during 1917–1918. A high-angle rangefinder was fitted in the forward superstructure by 1921.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Monarch&quot;, named after a third-rate ship of the line, &quot;Monarque&quot;, that had been captured from the French in 1747, was the third ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at their shipyard in Elswick on 1 April 1910 and launched on 30 March 1911. She was completed on 31 March 1912, commissioned with a partial crew on 16 April and fully commissioned on 27 April. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,888,736 or £1,886,912. &quot;Monarch&quot; was assigned to the 2nd division of the Home Fleet which was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May. The ship, together with her sister ships and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913 and then participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres in August.
===World War I===
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Monarch&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, &quot;Monarch&quot; was conducting gunnery practice south-east of Fair Isle when she was unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine-fired torpedo. This was probably a false alarm as the area was too far to the west of the German U-boats&#x27; patrol zones to be likely. , however, has been suggested as a candidate for the attack, although the boat was sunk the following day with the loss of all hands and the truth will never be known.

Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and the dreadnought struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German armed merchant cruiser . Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Monarch&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender&#x27;s 2nd BS, including &quot;Monarch&quot; and her sister ships, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Conqueror&quot;, and Beatty&#x27;s four battlecruisers.

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn&#x27;s light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper&#x27;s ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty&#x27;s forces.

====1915–1916====

The Grand Fleet conducted another fruitless sweep of the North Sea in late December and, while trying to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, &quot;Monarch&quot; was accidentally rammed by &quot;Conqueror&quot; on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at the entrance and &quot;Conqueror&quot; could not avoid her. &quot;Monarch&quot; suffered moderate damage to her stern and received temporary repairs at Scapa before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.

On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Monarch&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. The 2nd BS conducted gunnery practice in the Moray Firth on 2 August and then returned to Scapa Flow. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Monarch&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November and repeated the exercise at the beginning of December.
The Grand Fleet sortied in response to an attack by German ships on British light forces near Dogger Bank on 10 February 1916, but it was recalled two days later when it became clear that no German ships larger than a destroyer were involved. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Monarch&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Monarch&quot;, under the command of Captain George Borrett, was the sixth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired three salvos of armour-piercing, capped (APC) shells from her main guns at a group of five battleships at 18:32, scoring one hit on the dreadnought that knocked out a gun, temporarily disabled three boilers and started several small fires. At 19:14, she engaged the battlecruiser at a range of with five salvos of APC shells and claimed to her with the last two salvos. &quot;Lützow&quot; was also fired at by &quot;Orion&quot; during this time and was hit five times between the sisters. They knocked out two of her main guns, temporarily knocked out the power to the sternmost turret and caused a fair amount of flooding. This was the last time that &quot;Monarch&quot; fired her guns during the battle, having expended a total of fifty-three 13.5-inch APC shells.

====Subsequent activity====

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the High Seas Fleet surrendered there on 21 November and she remained part of the 2nd BS through 1 March 1919.

By 1 May, &quot;Monarch&quot; had been assigned to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet. On 1 November, the 3rd BS was disbanded and &quot;Monarch&quot; was transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, together with her sisters. The ship had been transferred back to Portsmouth by 18 March 1920. She was temporarily recommissioned during the summers of 1920 and 1921 to ferry troops to the Mediterranean and back. On 5 May 1922, &quot;Monarch&quot; was paid off and placed on the disposal list in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Put up for sale in August, the ship was later withdrawn and attached to the gunnery school at as a hulk.
&quot;Monarch&quot; was paid off on 13 June 1923 and she was converted into a target ship at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth in October 1923. A replica of the underwater side protection of the s added to test the blast effects of large bombs detonating alongside the hull. A device consisting of of TNT (representing the explosives in a aerial bomb) was exploded at a depth of and from her side. Although damaged, the structure remained watertight after the test. The following year, live bombs of various sizes were dropped on the ship by Airco DH.9A bombers with little effect. Bombs were then positioned and detonated internally to evaluate their effects. On 20 January 1925, &quot;Monarch&quot; was towed out from Plymouth by dockyard tugs into Hurd&#x27;s Deep in the English Channel, approximately south of the Isles of Scilly. On 21 January she was attacked by a wave of Royal Air Force bombers, which scored several hits; this was followed by four light cruisers firing six-inch (152-mm) shells, and the destroyer , using her 4-inch guns. For the finale, the fast battleships and and the five s opened fire with their 15-inch (381-mm) guns. The number of hits on &quot;Monarch&quot; is unknown, but after nine hours of shelling she finally sank at 22:00 after a final hit by .
