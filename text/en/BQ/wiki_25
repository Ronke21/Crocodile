<text>Henry Clemens van de Velde (; 3 April 1863 – 15 October 1957) was a Belgian painter, architect, interior designer, and art theorist. Together with Victor Horta and Paul Hankar, he is considered one of the founders of Art Nouveau in Belgium.&quot;&quot; He worked in Paris with Siegfried Bing, the founder of the first gallery of Art Nouveau in Paris. Van de Velde spent the most important part of his career in Germany and became a major figure in the German Jugendstil. He had a decisive influence on German architecture and design at the beginning of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Van de Velde was born in Antwerp, where he studied painting under Charles Verlat at the famous Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Antwerp. He then went on to a year&#x27;s study with the painter Carolus-Duran in Paris. As a young painter he was strongly influenced by Paul Signac and Georges Seurat and soon adopted a neo-impressionist style, and pointillism. In 1889 he became a member of the Brussels-based artist group &quot;Les XX&quot;. After Vincent van Gogh exhibited some work on the yearly exhibition of Les XX van de Velde became one of the first artists to be influenced by the Dutch painter. During this period he developed a lasting friendship with the painter Théo van Rysselberghe and the sculptor Constantin Meunier.

== Career ==
In 1890, van de Velde wrote that &quot;there will be no place in the society of the future for anything which is not of use to everyone.&quot;&quot;&quot;

In 1892, he abandoned painting, devoting his time to the arts of decoration and interior design (silver and goldsmith&#x27;s trade, chinaware and cutlery, fashion design, carpet and fabric design). His meeting with Maria Sèthe, his future wife, was instrumental in this change. They collaborated on a number of projects together, including designing wallpapers and female clothing. Their first house, Bloemenwerf in Uccle, was van de Velde&#x27;s first attempt at architecture and was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement. Its exterior closely resembled the Red House of William Morris. Maria Sèthe designed the garden surrounding the house.

Henry van de Velde also designed interiors and furniture for the influential art gallery &quot;L&#x27;Art Nouveau&quot; of Samuel Bing in Paris in 1895, the shop from which Art Nouveau took its name. He participated in Bing&#x27;s pavilion at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 and showed his own work.

Van de Velde was strongly influenced by John Ruskin and William Morris&#x27;s English Arts and Crafts movement&quot;&quot; and he was one of the first architects or furniture designers to apply curved lines in an abstract style, rather than based on nature.

Van de Velde&#x27;s design work became known in Germany through periodicals such as &quot;Innen-Dekoration&quot;. As a result, he received commissions for interior designs in Berlin. Around the turn of the century, he designed Villa Leuring in the Netherlands, and Villa Esche in Chemnitz, two works that show his Art Nouveau style in architecture. He also designed the interior of the Folkwang Museum in Hagen (today the building houses the Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum) and the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar.

In 1899, he settled in Weimar, Germany, where he was employed as artistic advisor to William Ernest, Grand Duke Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. In 1907, he established the Grand-Ducal School of Arts and Crafts, under the patronage of the Grand Duke. Van de Velde designed the school&#x27;s building and was the school&#x27;s first director. He stepped down during World War I due to his Belgian citizenship and suggested that architect Walter Gropius succeed him. In 1919, the School merged with the Weimar Art Academy to form the famous modernist art school, Bauhaus.&quot;&quot;

Although a Belgian, van de Velde played an important role in the German Jugendstil.

In 1907, he co-founded the German Werkbund, an association to help improve and promote German design by establishing close relations between industry and designers.&quot;&quot; He would oppose Hermann Muthesius at the Werkbund meeting of 1914 and their debate would mark the history of Modern Architecture. Van de Velde called for the upholding of the individuality of artists while Hermann Muthesius called for standardization as a key to development. Van de Velde was a proponent of incorporating logic into all facets of design, taking inspiration from engineers application of reason and calculation.&quot;&quot;

During World War I, Van de Velde, as a foreign national, was obliged to leave Weimar (although on good terms with the Weimar government) and returned to his native Belgium. Later, he lived in Switzerland and in the Netherlands where he designed the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo. In 1925 he was appointed professor at the Ghent University Institute of Art History and Archaeology, where he lectured architecture and applied arts from 1926 to 1936. He was instrumental in founding in Brussels, in 1926, today&#x27;s renowned architecture and visual arts school , under the name of &quot;.&quot;

== Modernism ==

He continued his practice in architecture and design, which had demarcated itself significantly from the Art Nouveau phase, whose popularity was by 1910 in decline. During this period, he mentored the great Belgian architect, Victor Bourgeois. In 1933, he was commissioned to design the new building for the university library (the renowned Boekentoren). Construction started in 1936, but the work would not be completed until the end of the Second World War. For budget reasons, the eventual construction did not entirely match the original design. For instance, the reading room floor was executed in marble instead of the black rubber Van de Velde originally intended. He was also involved in the construction of the Ghent University Hospital.

He died, aged 94, in Zürich.

== Auctions and exhibitions ==
12 October 2005, a teapot designed by van de Velde made €170,000 at a public auction at the Brussels Beaux-Arts auction house – eleven times the opening bid. It is a teapot on a chafing dish, with a wooden handle, resting on an oval basis and made of silver-plated brass. During an Art Nouveau and Design exhibition at the Brussels Cinquantenaire Museum (&quot;Jubilee Park Museum&quot;) in 2005, Henry van de Velde&#x27;s tea set, two china plates and a silver dish were badly damaged in an unfortunate accident. The silver candle stand remained unharmed. The pieces had been given on temporary loan by Krefeld&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, the Museum für Angewandte Kunst in Cologne and a private collector.

== &quot;The Manuscript on Ornament&quot; ==
Henry Van De Velde played the role in elaborating an aesthetic theory a synthesis of the two opposite poles of rational conception associated with particular understanding of the ornamental function. &quot;The Manuscript on Ornament&quot; sheds further light on this aesthetic theory, and the role played therein by the notion of ornament. It constitutes an important document in the sequence of his intention of publishing a ‘historical—theoretical’ treatise on design.

<doc id="491663" wikidata="Q1773728" url="?curid=491663" title="Super Double Dragon">
<text>Super Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up video game released by Technōs Japan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan in 1992. It was published by Tradewest in North America the same year and the PAL region in 1993. &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; is the fourth console game in the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; series developed by Technōs Japan, following &quot;Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones&quot; for the NES. The game did not have an arcade release and was made specifically for the home market.

In 2018, a slightly enhanced Japanese version, &quot;Return of Double Dragon&quot;, was re-released by Tommo in Japan and under its Retroism brand in North America. Despite being officially licensed, this release is only guaranteed to work on third-party hardware.

==Gameplay==

As with previous installments of the series, the player takes control of martial artists Billy and Jimmy in their fight against the Shadow Warriors gang. The objective is to proceed through each stage and defeat all enemies, including a boss. The game consists of seven stages, which includes a casino, an airport, a martial arts dojo, a fight atop a moving truck, a city slum, a forest, and the hideout of the boss.

In addition to the punch, kick, and jump buttons, the player now has a guard button for blocking attacks. If the player times the guard button right, their character can not only defend against an enemy&#x27;s punch, they can also put certain enemies in an arm grab, leaving the enemy vulnerable to successive attacks. The arm grab only works on Williams, Roper, Steve, Jackson and the Chin brothers. There&#x27;s also a &quot;Dragon Power&quot; gauge under the life gauge, which the player can fill by holding down the L or R buttons. While the gauge is filling up, the player can perform special attacks which vary depending on how much power the player has accumulated, which includes a flying hurricane kick. If the power gauge is completely filled, then the player&#x27;s regular attacks will gain extra strength for a limited period.

&quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; is one of the few games in the series where the protagonists of Billy and Jimmy Lee were differentiated, not just in their in-game character designs (where the brothers were given different hair styles), but also in their fighting abilities. Particularly, the two characters have different basic punches (in &quot;Return of Double Dragon&quot;, Jimmy&#x27;s roundhouse kick is also different).

==Characters==
* - player 1&#x27;s character. A master of , which specializes in agility and flexibility. Billy retains his basic design from the NES versions of the previous games (red hair and blue outfit).
* - player 2&#x27;s character. A master of , which prioritizes strength. Jimmy now has a blond flat top hairstyle to distinguish him from Billy (in previous games, Jimmy was only depicted differently in cut-scenes and promotional art).
* and - the two common enemy types in the game. Williams has wild blond hair and wears a yellow vest with camouflage pants, while Roper has black hair with a bandanna tied around his head and wears a white vest and pants. Sometimes they come armed with all sorts of weapons, which can be used by the player.
* - another common enemy type who is always armed with twin dao blades. His attacks include single-sword slashes and helicopter-like spins. Unlike other enemies, he cannot be disarmed when knocked down. Also, unlike other weapons, the swords are unobtainable.
* - a recurring sub-boss who appears in the early stages. He&#x27;s a palette swap of Billy Lee with darker skin and green clothing, and thus has most of the same techniques (including the hurricane kick).
* - the boss of Mission 1. A suit-wearing martial arts master who specializes in kicks. Reappears as a sub-boss in subsequent stages.
* - the boss of Mission 2. A former heavyweight boxing champion. Reappears as a sub-boss in subsequent stages.
* and - the bosses of Mission 3. Twin martial arts masters who operate a Kenpo gym in Chinatown. They have the ability to grab the player&#x27;s kicks and twist his leg. Ron Foo (in the yellow vest) specializes in kicks, while Ron Pyo (in the red vest) specializes in punches. Ron Foo claims that he and his brother are the real Double Dragons.
* - the boss of Mission 5. A clown-like fat man who can block attacks with his stomach.
* - the boss of Mission 6. The giant gatekeeper of the enemy&#x27;s hideout. His special technique is a middle kick feared by his comrades as &quot;Death Leg&quot;.
* - the final boss, who uses a flashy martial arts style.

==Development==
Muneki Ebinuma, who worked as the lead game designer of &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;, published a commentary about his involvement in the development of the game in 2004, where he detailed his original plans for the game that he was unable to fully realize due to time constraints. The game was supposed to feature cut-scenes prior to boss battles and between stages, as well as a full ending sequence, in contrast to the lack of in-game plot in the retail release (where no explanation is given as to why Billy and Jimmy Lee are fighting the enemy). The plot would&#x27;ve involved Billy and Jimmy Lee investigating a criminal organization known as the Shadow Warriors following the disappearances of several local martial artists, eventually coming face to face with their leader Duke, who would&#x27;ve been revealed to had been a childhood friend of the Lee brothers. The character of Marian was also supposed to appear in the game as a policewoman who assisted the Lee brothers (an occupation she had in the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; comic book and animated series produced around the time). While Marian is still mentioned in the instruction manual and packaging description, she never actually appears in the retail version of the game. In addition to the cut-scenes, some of the stages were supposed to have more traps and obstacles, and there was supposed to an additional boss after defeating Duke.

&quot;Return of Double Dragon&quot; features several significant differences from &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;: the title theme and most of the background music were shuffled around (e.g. the Mission 1 theme from &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; is played during Mission 4 in &quot;Return of Double Dragon&quot;) and the player can perform certain actions which cannot be done in &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; (such as retrieving a boomerang after throwing it or hitting an opponent more than once successively with the hurricane kick). The enemy placement is also different in both versions and weapons such as knives and incendiary bombs do less damage in &quot;Return of Double Dragon&quot;. Jimmy&#x27;s punches are not as fast, but hit harder, and his roundhouse kick is performed faster than Billy&#x27;s. There are times where enemies will randomly crouch, particularly when Billy or Jimmy try to finish a combo, which makes them dodge the attack. The higher the difficulty, enemies will do this more frequently. The final Mission also features two additional levels before the final battle. An Option Mode is included in &quot;Return of Double Dragon&quot; as well, allowing players to adjust the game&#x27;s difficulty level, increase extra credits and also listen to the game&#x27;s music and sound effects.

== Reception ==
&quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game at 92nd in their &quot;Top 100 SNES of All Time&quot;.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Recording Package is one of a series of Grammy Awards presented for the visual look of an album. It is presented to the art director of the winning album. An art director in the context of a music album is a professional responsible for overseeing the visual aspects of the album&#x27;s production. 

Often, the performer also takes on the role of art director, rather than that of the designer. For larger projects or those associated with major labels, professional art directors and designers are typically involved, as specified by contractual agreements. Independent musicians, on the other hand, may handle these roles themselves.

This role includes designing the album cover, selecting artwork and photography, and coordinating the overall visual presentation that aligns with the music&#x27;s theme and the artist&#x27;s image. The art director works closely with graphic designers, photographers, and stylists to create a cohesive aesthetic that complements the music and enhances the artist&#x27;s branding. This position is crucial in shaping how listeners perceive the album through its visual elements.

The Grammy Award for Best Album Cover dates back to the first Grammy Awards in 1959. From 1962 to 1965 it was separated into Classical and Non-Classical divisions. From 1966 to 1968 it was separated into Graphic Arts and Photography divisions. In 1974, the name of the award was changed to Best Album Package, and changed again in 1994 to the current name.

In 1995, boxed sets were no longer eligible, as they were split off into a separate award, currently known as the Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package.

<doc id="491665" wikidata="Q49209" url="?curid=491665" title="Javanese people">
<text>The Javanese (, , , ; , ; ) are an Austronesian ethnic group native to the central and eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java. With more than 100 million people, Javanese people are the largest ethnic group in both Indonesia and in Southeast Asia as a whole. Their native language is Javanese, it is the largest of the Austronesian languages in number of native speakers and also the largest regional language in Southeast Asia. As the largest ethnic group in the region, the Javanese have historically dominated the social, political, and cultural landscape of both Indonesia and Southeast Asia.

There are significant numbers of Javanese diaspora outside of central and eastern Java regions, including the other provinces of Indonesia, as well as other countries such as Suriname, Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Yemen and the Netherlands. The Javanese ethnic group has many sub-groups (based on native Javanese community on the island of Java) that can be distinguished based on their characteristics, customs, traditions, dialects, or even their respective ways of life. These include Banyumasan, Cirebonese, Mataram, Osing, and Tenggerese. The majority of the Javanese people identify themselves as Sunni Muslims, with a small minority identifying as Christians and Hindus. With a large global population, the Javanese are considered significant as they are the largest Muslim ethnic group in the Far East and the fourth largest in the world after the Arabs, Bengalis, and Punjabis.

Javanese civilisation has been influenced by more than a millennium of interactions between the native animism Kejawen and the Indian Hindu—Buddhist culture, and this influence is still visible in Javanese history, culture, traditions, and art forms. The ancient Javanese kingdoms of Singhasari and Majapahit were among the most powerful maritime empires in the region, whose boundaries included most of Maritime Southeast Asia and parts of Indochina. Javanese heritage has created magnificent religious monuments such as Borobudur and Prambanan which are among the world&#x27;s largest temples. Javanese culture has a strong influence in most of the Southeast Asian countries. In Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore, the influence of Javanese culture can be seen in many aspects of modern Malay culture. Javanese culture has greatly influenced their traditional cuisine with many dishes such as satay, sambal, ketupat, &quot;nasi kuning&quot; (&quot;pulut kuning&quot;), and rojak. Kris weaponry, batik and ronggeng dance art, gamelan musical instruments, and wayang kulit puppetry were introduced to them through Javanese contact. Javanese culture has also spread widely beyond Southeast Asia to countries such as Sri Lanka, South Africa, and Suriname, where many of the Javanese diaspora live.

==History==


Like most Indonesian ethnic groups, including the Sundanese of West Java, the Javanese are of Austronesian origins whose ancestors are thought to have originated in Taiwan, and migrated through the Philippines to reach Java between 1,500 BC and 1,000 BC. However, according to recent genetic study, Javanese together with Sundanese and Balinese has a significant genetic admixture of Austroasiatic and Austronesian ancestries.

=== Ancient Javanese kingdoms and empires ===
Hindu and Buddhist influences arrived through trade contacts with the Indian subcontinent. Hindu and Buddhist — traders and visitors, arrived in the 5th century. The Hindu, Buddhist and Javanese faiths blended into a unique local philosophy.

The cradle of Javanese culture is commonly described as being in Kedu and Kewu Plain in the fertile slopes of Mount Merapi as the heart of the Mataram Kingdom. The earliest Sanjaya and Sailendra dynasties had their power base there. Between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of temple construction. The most notable of the temples constructed are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan. The Java valley was home to thousands of Hindu temples that co-existed with Buddhist temples, most of which were buried in the massive eruption of Mount Merapi in 1006 AD. At its peak, the Javanese kingdom had become a dominant empire that exercised its power—not only in Java island, but also in Sumatra, Bali, southern Thailand, Indianized kingdoms of the Philippines, and the Khmer in Cambodia. Jayavarman II, a prince who had lived at the Sailendra court in Java, brought Javanese art and culture, including the concept of the devaraja, to Cambodia, laying the foundations for Khmer civilization.

The centre of Javanese culture and politics was moved towards the eastern part of the island when Mpu Sindok (r. 929–947) moved the capital of the kingdoms eastward to the valleys of the Brantas River in the 10th century CE. The move was most likely caused by the volcanic eruption of Merapi and/or invasion from Srivijaya.

At the end of the 13th century, The major spread of Javanese influence occurred under King Kertanegara of Singhasari. The expansionist king launched several major expeditions to Madura, Bali in 1284, Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and most importantly to Sumatra in 1275. He also extended Javanese involvement in the lucrative spice trade with the Maluku Islands. Following the defeat of the Melayu Kingdom in eastern Sumatra, Singhasari controlled trade in the Strait of Malacca.

Singhasari dominance was cut short in 1292 by Kediri&#x27;s rebellion under Jayakatwang, killing Kertanegara. However, Jayakatwang&#x27;s reign as king of Java soon ended as he was defeated by Kertanegara&#x27;s son-in-law, Raden Wijaya with the help of invading Mongol troops in March 1293.

Raden Wijaya would later establish Majapahit near the delta of the Brantas River in modern-day Mojokerto, East Java. Kertanegara policies were later continued by the Majapahits under King Hayam Wuruk and his minister Gajah Mada, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 was marked by conquests that extended throughout Southeast Asia. This expansion marked the greatest extent of Majapahit, making it one of the most influential empires in Indonesian and Southeast Asian history.

Various kingdoms of Java were actively involved in the spice trade in the sea route of the Silk Road. Although not major spice producers, these kingdoms were able to stockpile spice by trading for it with rice, of which Java was a major producer. Majapahit is usually regarded as the greatest of these kingdoms. It was both an agrarian and a maritime power, combining wet-rice cultivation and foreign trade. The ruin of their capital can be found in Trowulan.

=== Javanese sultanates ===
Islam gained its foothold in port towns on Java&#x27;s northern coast such as Gresik, Ampel Denta (Surabaya), Tuban, Demak and Kudus. The spread and proselytising of Islam among the Javanese was traditionally credited to Wali Songo.

Java underwent major changes as Islam spread. Following succession disputes and civil wars, Majapahit power collapsed. After this collapse, its various dependencies and vassals broke free. The Sultanate of Demak became the new strongest power, gaining supremacy among city-states on the northern coast of Java.
Aside from its power over Javanese city-states, it also gained overlordship of the ports of Jambi and Palembang in eastern Sumatra. Demak played a major role in opposing the newly arrived colonial power, the Portuguese. Demak twice attacked the Portuguese following their capture of Malacca. They also attacked the allied forces of the Portuguese and the Sunda Kingdom, establishing in the process the Sultanate of Banten.

Demak was succeeded by the Kingdom of Pajang and finally the Sultanate of Mataram. The centre of power moved from coastal Demak, to Pajang in Blora, and later further inland to Mataram lands in Kotagede, near present-day Yogyakarta. The Mataram Sultanate reached its peak of power and influence during the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo between 1613 and 1645.

=== Colonial Java ===
In 1619 the Dutch established their trading headquarter in Batavia. Java slowly fell to the Dutch East India Company, which would also eventually control most of Maritime Southeast Asia. The internal intrigue and war of succession, in addition to Dutch interference, caused the Mataram Sultanate to break up into Surakarta and Yogyakarta. The further separation of the Javanese realm was marked by the establishment of the Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman princedom. Although the real political power in those days actually lay with the colonial Dutch, the Javanese kings, in their keratons, still held prestige as the supposed power centre of the Javanese realm, especially in and around Surakarta and Yogyakarta.

Dutch rule was briefly interrupted by British rule in the early 19th century. While short, the British administration led by Stamford Raffles was significant, and included the re-discovery of Borobudur. Conflict with foreign rule was exemplified by the Java War between 1825 and 1830, and the leadership of Prince Diponegoro.

Like the rest of the Dutch East Indies, Java was captured by the Empire of Japan during World War II. With Japan&#x27;s defeat, independence was proclaimed in the new Republic of Indonesia.

===Republic of Indonesia===
When the Indonesian independence was proclaimed on 17 August 1945, the last sovereign Javanese monarchies, represented by the Sri Sultan of Yogyakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta, Prince of Mangkunegara and Prince of Pakualaman declared that they would become part of the Republic of Indonesia.

Yogyakarta and Pakualaman were later united to form the Yogyakarta Special Region. The Sri sultan became Governor of Yogyakarta, and the Prince of Pakualaman became vice-governor; both were responsible to the President of Indonesia. The Special Region of Yogyakarta was created after the war of independence ended and formalized on 3 August 1950. Surakarta was later absorbed as part of the Central Java province.

==Culture==
 
The Javanese culture is one of the oldest civilizations and has flourished in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It has gradually absorbed various elements and influences from other cultures, including native reverence for ancestral and natural spirits, Buddhist and Hindu dharmic values, Islamic civilization, and to a lesser extent, Christianity, Western philosophy and modern ideas. Nevertheless, Javanese culture — especially in the Javanese cultural heartland; those of highly polished aristocratic culture of the &quot;keratons&quot; in Yogyakarta and Surakarta — demonstrates some specific traits, such as particular concern with elegance and refinement (Javanese: &quot;alus&quot;), subtlety, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one&#x27;s social stature. Javanese culture values harmony and social order highly, and abhors direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values are often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as Javanese dance, gamelan, wayang and batik. It is also reinforced through adherence to Javanese &quot;adat&quot; (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as &quot;Slametan, Satu Suro&quot;, Javanese weddings and &quot;Naloni Mitoni&quot;.

However, the culture of &quot;pesisiran&quot; of Javanese north coast and in Eastern Java demonstrates some slightly different traits. They tend to be more open to new and foreign ideas, more egalitarian, and less conscious of one&#x27;s social stature. Some of these northern settlements — such as Demak, Kudus, Tuban, Gresik and Ampel in Surabaya — have become more overtly Islamic, traditionally because these port towns are among the earliest places that Islamic teachings gained foothold in Java.

Javanese culture is traditionally centered in the Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java. Due to various migrations, it can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Suriname (where 15% of the population are of Javanese descent), the broader Indonesian archipelago region, Cape Malay, Malaysia, Singapore, Netherlands and other countries. The migrants bring with them various aspect of Javanese cultures such as Gamelan music, traditional dances and the art of Wayang kulit shadow play. The migration of Javanese people westward has created a coastal Javanese culture in West Java distinct from the inland Sundanese culture.

===Language===
Javanese is a member of the Austronesian family of languages and is closely related to, but distinct from, other languages of Indonesia. It is notable for its great number of nearly ubiquitous Sanskrit loans, found especially in literary Javanese. This is due to the long history of Hindu and Buddhist influences in Java.

Many Javanese in Indonesia are bilingual, being fluent in Indonesian (the standardized variant of the Malay language) and Javanese.
The Javanese language was formerly written with a script descended from the Brahmi script, natively known as &quot;Hanacaraka&quot; or &quot;Carakan&quot;. In addition, Javanese language can also written with right-to-left script descended from the Arabic script called &quot;Pegon&quot;. Upon Indonesian independence it was replaced with a form of the Latin alphabet.
While Javanese was not made an official language of Indonesia, it has the status of regional language for communication in the Javanese-majority regions. The language also can be viewed as an ethnic language because it is one of the defining characteristics of the Javanese ethnic identity.

===Literature and philosophy===
Javanese intellectuals, writers, poets and men of letters are known for their ability to formulate ideas and creating idioms for high cultural purpose, through stringing words to express a deeper philosophical meanings. Several philosophical idioms sprung from Javanese classical literature, Javanese historical texts and oral traditions, and have spread into several media and promoted as popular mottos. For example, &quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot;, used as the national motto of the Republic of Indonesia, &quot;Gemah Ripah Loh Jinawi, Toto Tentrem Kerto Raharjo&quot;, &quot;Jer Basuki Mawa Bea&quot;, &quot;Rawe-Rawe rantas, Malang-Malang putung&quot; and &quot;Tut Wuri Handayani&quot;.

===Social structure===

American anthropologist Clifford Geertz divided in the 1960s the Javanese community into three &quot;aliran&quot; or &quot;streams&quot;: santri, abangan and priyayi. According to him, the Santri followed an orthodox interpretation Islam, the abangan followed a syncretic form of Islam that mixed Hindu and animist elements (often termed &quot;Kejawen&quot;), and the priyayi were the nobility.

The Geertz opinion is often opposed today because he mixed the social groups with belief groups. It was also difficult to apply this social categorization in classing outsiders, for example other non-indigenous Indonesians such as persons of Arab, Chinese and Indian descent.

Social stratification is much less rigid in northern coast area.

===Calendar===
The Javanese calendar is used by the Javanese people concurrently with two other calendars, the Gregorian calendar and the Islamic calendar. The Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia, while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant Islamic holidays. The Javanese calendar is presently used mostly for cultural events (such as Siji Suro). The Javanese calendar system is currently a lunar calendar adopted by Sultan Agung in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the Hindu calendar.

Unlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the &quot;Pasaran&quot; cycle. This is still in use today and is superimposed with 7-day week of the Gregorian calendar and Islamic calendar to become what is known as the 35-day Wetonan cycle.

===Architecture===
====Historical temples located in Central Java and East Java====

Throughout their long history, the Javanese have produced many important buildings, ranging from Hindu monuments, Buddhist stupa, mortuary temples, palace complexes, and mosques.

Before the rise of Islam, between the 5th to 15th centuries, Dharmic faiths (Hinduism and Buddhism) were the majority in the Indonesian archipelago, especially in Java. As a result, numerous Hindu temples, locally known as &quot;Candi&quot;, were constructed and dominated the landscape of Java. According to local beliefs, the Java valley had thousands of Hindu temples that co-existed with Buddhist temples, most of which were buried in the massive eruption of Mount Merapi in 1006 AD.

Two important religious monuments are the Hindu temple of Prambanan and the Buddhist temple of Borobudur. Both of them are 9th century temples and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Both are located near Yogyakarta in the slope of Mount Merapi.

Meanwhile, examples of secular buildings can be seen in the ruins of the former capital city of the Majapahit Kingdom (14th to 16th century AD) in Trowulan, East Java. The complex covers an area of 11 km x 9 km. It consists of various brick buildings, a canal ranging from 20 to 40 meters wide, purification pools, temples and iconic split gates. The capital complex is currently being considered as a candidate for becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

====Traditional Javanese buildings====
Traditional Javanese buildings can be identified by their trapezoid shaped roofs supported by wooden pillars. Another common feature in Javanese buildings are &quot;pendopo&quot;, pavilions with open-sides and four large pillars. The pillars and other parts of the buildings can be richly carved. This architecture style can be found at &quot;kraton&quot;, or palaces, of the Sultanates of Yogyakarta (palaces of Hamengkubuwono and Pakualaman) and Surakarta (palaces of Pakubuwono and Mangkunegaran).

Traditional mosques in Java maintain a distinctive Javanese style. The &quot;pendopo&quot; model is used as the main feature of mosques as prayer halls. A trapezoidal roof is used instead of the more typically Muslim dome. These roofs are often multi-tiered and tiled. In addition to not using domes, traditional Javanese mosques also often lack minarets. The split gate from earlier Hindu-Buddhist period is still used in many mosques and public buildings in Java.

Some notable examples of mosques using traditional Javanese architecture include the Agung Demak Mosque, the Menara Kudus Mosque and the Great Mosque of Banten. The Kudus Mosque is also of note because it incorporates Hindu-style stone architecture.

===Cuisine===

Rice is the staple crop of Javanese cuisine; a meal in Java is not considered a meal without it. It is also an important part of the Javanese cultural identity, differentiating them from residents of other Indonesian islands who eat sago (for example Moluccans) and expatriates from western countries who tend more towards bread. Rice is seen as a symbol of development and prosperity, whereas tuber vegetables like cassava are associated with poverty.

Javanese cuisine varies by region. Eastern Java has a preference for hot and salty foods, while the Central Javanese tend to prefer sweeter foods.

A famous food in Javanese cuisine is &quot;Rujak Cingur&quot;, marinated cow lips and noses served with vegetable, shrimp prawn and peanut sauce with chili. &quot;Rujak Cingur&quot; is considered a traditional food in Surabaya in East Java.

&quot;Gudeg&quot; is a traditional food from Yogyakarta and Central Java which is made from young Nangka (jack fruit) boiled for several hours with palm sugar, and coconut milk.

&quot;Pecel&quot;, a type of peanut sauce with chili is a common ingredient in Javanese cuisine. It is used in various types of Rujak and Gado-gado. It can also be used as stand-alone sauce with rice, prawns, eggs and vegetables as &quot;Nasi Pecel&quot; (Pecel rice).

&quot;Tumpeng&quot;, is a rice served in the shape of a conical volcano, usually with rice coloured yellow using turmeric. It is an important part of many ceremonies in Java. &quot;Tumpeng&quot; is served at landmark events such as birthdays, moving house, or other ceremonies. Traditionally, &quot;Tumpeng&quot; is served alongside fried chicken, boiled egg, vegetables, and goat meat on a round plate made from bamboo called &quot;besek&quot;.

A notable food in Java is &quot;tempeh&quot;, a meat substitute made from soybean fermented with mould. It is a staple source of protein in Java and popular around the world as a meat substitute for vegetarians.

=== Names ===
Javanese do not usually have family names or surnames, with only a single name. Javanese names may come from traditional Javanese languages, many of which are derived from Sanskrit. Names with the prefix &quot;Su-&quot;, which means &quot;good&quot;, are very popular. After the advent of Islam, many Javanese began to use Arabic names, especially coast populations, where Islamic influences are stronger. Commoners usually only have one-word names, while nobilities use two-or-more-word names, but rarely a surname. Some people use a patronymic. Due to the influence of other cultures, many people started using names from other languages, mainly European languages. Christian Javanese usually use Latin baptism names followed by a traditional Javanese name.

===Religion===


Today, most Javanese officially follow Sunni Islam as their religion, first recorded instance of Islamic contact in Java is dated from 475 Hijri (1082 AD), as attested in the grave of Fatimah binti Maimun. However Islamic development only became more intensive during the Majapahit period, when they traded or made tributary relations with various states like Perlak and Samudra Pasai in modern-day Aceh. In the Troloyo/Tralaya cemetery of Trowulan (the capital of Majapahit), there are several Muslim tombstones with dates from the 14th century (1368 AD, 1376 AD). The close proximity of the site with the &quot;kraton&quot; means there were Muslim people in close relation with the court.

A sizeable minority of Javanese (around 3%) also follow Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), which are concentrated in Central Java (particularly Semarang, Surakarta, Salatiga, Magelang) and Yogyakarta for Catholicism. Native Christian churches such as the Javanese Christian Church (&quot;Gereja Kristen Jawa&quot;) and East Java Christian Church (&quot;Gereja Kristen Jawi Wetan&quot;) also exist. On a smaller scale, Hinduism and Buddhism are also found in the Javanese community. The Javanese of the Tengger tribe continue to practice Javanese-Hindu today, and live in villages on the slope of Mount Bromo.

&quot;Kebatinan&quot;, also called &quot;Kejawèn&quot;, &quot;Agama Jawa&quot; and &quot;Kepercayaan&quot; is a Javanese religious tradition, consisting of an amalgam of animistic, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic, especially Sufi, beliefs and practices. It is rooted in Javanese history and religiosity, syncretising aspects of different religions.

==Occupations==
In Indonesia, Javanese people can be found in all occupations, especially in the government and the military.

===Farming===
Traditionally, most Javanese people are farmers. Farming is especially common because of the fertile volcanic soil in Java. The most important agricultural commodity is rice. In 1997, it was estimated that Java produced 55% of Indonesia&#x27;s total output of the crop. Most farmers work in small-scale rice fields, with around 42% of farmers working and cultivating less than 0.5 hectares of land. In region where soil is less fertile of where rainy season is short, other staple crops is cultivated, such as cassava.

=== Merchant-sailor ===
Javanese merchants and sailors were already in frequent voyage in the seas between India and China as early as 1st century CE.

Champa was assaulted by Javanese or Kunlun vessels in 774 and 787. In 774 an assault was launched on Po-Nagar in Nha-trang where the pirates demolished temples, while in 787 an assault was launched on Phang-rang. Several Champa coastal cities suffered naval raids and assault from Java. Java armadas was called as &quot;Javabala-sanghair-nāvāgataiḥ&quot; (fleets from Java) which are recorded in Champa epigraphs.

The Javanese may have contacted Australia in 10th century AD, and migrated there, their settlement existing until early 1600s. According to Waharu IV inscription (931 AD) and Garaman inscription (1053 AD), the Mataram Kingdom and Airlangga&#x27;s era Kahuripan (1000–1049 AD) of Java experienced a long prosperity so that it needed a lot of manpower, especially to bring crops, packings, and send them to ports. Black labor was imported from Jenggi (Zanzibar), Pujut (Australia), and Bondan (Papua). According to Naerssen, they arrived in Java by trading (bought by merchants) or being taken prisoner during a war and then made slaves. According to Chiaymasiouro, the king of Demak, in 1601 AD a subgroup of Javanese people already settled in a land called &quot;Luca&quot; &quot;Antara&quot;, which is believed to be Australia. But when Eredia&#x27;s servant went to &quot;Luca&quot; &quot;Antara&quot; in 1610, the land had seemingly been abandoned.

The 10th century Arab account &quot;Ajayeb al-Hind&quot; (Marvels of India) gives an account of invasion in Africa by people called Wakwak or Waqwaq, probably the Malay people of Srivijaya or Javanese people of Mataram kingdom, in 945–946 CE. They arrived in the coast of Tanganyika and Mozambique with 1000 boats and attempted to take the citadel of Qanbaloh, though eventually failed. The reason of the attack is because that place had goods suitable for their country and for China, such as ivory, tortoise shells, panther skins, and ambergris, and also because they wanted black slaves from Bantu people (called &quot;Zeng&quot; or &quot;Zenj&quot; by Arabs, &quot;Jenggi&quot; by Javanese) who were strong and make good slaves. The existence of black Africans was recorded until the 15th century in Old Javanese inscriptions and the Javanese were still recorded as exporting black slaves during the Ming dynasty era.

The Malagasy people have genetic links to various Maritime Southeast Asian groups, particularly from southern Borneo. Parts of the Malagasy language are sourced from the Ma&#x27;anyan language with loan words from Sanskrit, with all the local linguistic modifications via Javanese or Malay language. As the Ma&#x27;anyan and Dayak people are not a sailor and were dry-rice cultivators while some Malagasy are wet rice farmers, it is likely that they are carried by the Javanese and Malay people in their trading fleets, as labor or slaves.

During the Majapahit era, almost all of the commodities from Asia were found in Java. This is because of extensive shipping by the Majapahit empire using various type of ships, particularly the jong, for trading to faraway places. Early 16th century European accounts noted the places which the Javanese merchants visited, which include Maluku Islands, Timor, Banda, Sumatra, Malacca, China, Tenasserim, Pegu (Bago), Bengal, Pulicat, Coromandel, Malabar, Cambay (Khambat), and Aden. There were also those who went to the Maldives, Calicut (Kozhikode), Oman, Aden, and the Red Sea. Ma Huan (Zheng He&#x27;s translator) who visited Java in 1413, stated that ports in Java were trading goods and offer services that were more numerous and more complete than other ports in Southeast Asia. It was also during Majapahit era that Nusantaran exploration reached its greatest accomplishment. Ludovico di Varthema (1470–1517), in his book &quot;Itinerario de Ludouico de Varthema Bolognese&quot; stated that the Southern Javanese people sailed to &quot;far Southern lands&quot; up to the point they arrived at an island where a day only lasted four hours long and was &quot;colder than in any part of the world&quot;. Modern studies have determined that such place is located at least 900 nautical miles (1666 km) south of the southernmost point of Tasmania. When Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca, the Portuguese recovered a chart from a Javanese maritime pilot, which already included part of the Americas. Regarding the chart Albuquerque said:

&quot;...a large map of a Javanese pilot, containing the Cape of Good Hope, Portugal and the land of Brazil, the Red Sea and the Sea of Persia, the Clove Islands, the navigation of the Chinese and the Gores, with their rhumbs and direct routes followed by the ships, and the hinterland, and how the kingdoms border on each other. It seems to me. Sir, that this was the best thing I have ever seen, and Your Highness will be very pleased to see it; it had the names in Javanese writing, but I had with me a Javanese who could read and write. I send this piece to Your Highness, which Francisco Rodrigues traced from the other, in which Your Highness can truly see where the Chinese and Gores come from, and the course your ships must take to the Clove Islands, and where the gold mines lie, and the islands of Java and Banda, of nutmeg and mace, and the land of the King of Siam, and also the end of the land of the navigation of the Chinese, the direction it takes, and how they do not navigate farther.&quot;

: — Letter of Albuquerque to King Manuel I of Portugal, 1 April 1512.
The Javanese people, like other Austronesian ethnicities, use a solid navigation system: Orientation at sea is carried out using a variety of different natural signs, and by using a very distinctive astronomy technique called &quot;star path navigation&quot;. Basically, the navigators determine the bow of the ship to the islands that are recognized by using the position of rising and setting of certain stars above the horizon. In the Majapahit era, compasses and magnets were used, and cartography (mapping science) was developed. In 1293 AD Raden Wijaya presented a map and census record to the Yuan Mongol invader, suggesting that mapmaking has been a formal part of governmental affair in Java. The use of maps full of longitudinal and transverse lines, rhumb lines, and direct route lines traveled by ships were recorded by Europeans, to the point that the Portuguese considered the Javanese maps were the best map in the early 1500s.

European colonial presence diminished the range of the Javanese merchant-sailors. In 1645, Diogo do Couto noted that the Javanese had communicated with the east coast of Madagascar. The decision of Amangkurat I of the Mataram Sultanate to destroy ships in coastal cities and close ports to prevent them from rebelling in the mid-17th century further reduced the Javanese people&#x27;s ability in long-distance sailing. In 1705 there is an agreement signed by VOC and Pakubuwana I of Mataram, which forbade the Javanese to sail to the east of Lombok, to the north of Kalimantan, and to the west of Lampung. In the second half of the 18th century, most of the Javanese merchant-sailors were restricted to only short-range travel.

=== Shipbuilder ===

The Javanese were known to produce large ships called K&#x27;un-lun po (&quot;po&quot; of the K&#x27;un-lun people). These ships already plied the seas between India and China as early as 2nd century CE, carrying up to 1000 people alongside 250–1000 tons of cargo. The characteristics of this ship are that it is large (more than 50–60 m long), the hull is made of multiple plankings, has no outrigger, mounted with many masts and sails, the sail is in the form of a tanja sail, and has a plank fastening technique in the form of stitching with plant fibers.

Javanese trading and slaving activities in Africa caused a strong influence on boatbuilding on Madagascar and the East African coast. This is indicated by the existence of outriggers and &quot;oculi&quot; (eye ornament) on African boats.

Another large ship built by the Javanese was the Jong, first recorded in an Old Javanese inscription from the 9th century AD. Although the characteristics may be similar, it has some differences from the &quot;po&quot; that it was using wooden dowels for joining the planks and has double passenger-to-deadweight ratio. During the Majapahit era, a jong usually carried 600–700 men with 1200–1400 tons deadweight, and was about 69.26–72.55 m LOD and 76.18–79.81 m LOA. The largest ones, carried 1000 men with 2000 tons deadweight, was about 80.51 m LOD and 88.56 m LOA. The jong was mainly constructed in two major shipbuilding centres around Java: north coastal Java, especially around Rembang–Demak (along the Muria strait) and Cirebon; and the south coast of Borneo (Banjarmasin) and the adjacent islands. Pegu, which is a large shipbuilding port at the 16th century, also produced jong, built by Javanese who resided there.

Impressed by the Javanese&#x27;s skill in shipbuilding, Afonso de Albuquerque hired 60 Javanese carpenters and shipbuilders to work in India for the Portuguese. They never arrived in India, as they mutinied and took the Portuguese ship they boarded to Pasai, where they were welcomed extraordinarily. The Dutch also realized Javanese proficiency in shipbuilding, in the 18th century, shipbuilding yards in Amsterdam employed Javanese people as the foremen. The shipbuilding in Java was hampered when the VOC gained a foothold in Java starting in the early 17th century. However, in the 18th century, the Javanese shipbuilding areas (particularly Rembang and Juwana) started building large European-styled vessels (bark and brigantine type), such ships may reach 400–600 tons burthen, with an average of 92 &quot;lasts&quot; (165.6–184 metric tons). In 1856, John Crawfurd noted that Javanese shipbuilding activity still existed on the north coast of Java, with the shipyards supervised by Europeans, but all of the workers were Javanese. The ships that were built in the 19th century had a maximum tonnage of 50 tons and were used for river transport.

===Blacksmith===

Blacksmiths are traditionally valued. Some blacksmiths fast and meditate to reach perfection. Javanese blacksmiths create a range of tools and farming equipment, and also cultural items such as gamelan instruments and kris. The art of kris-making provided the technical skills applied to gunmaking. Cannon and firearms required special expertise and may have been made by the same individuals. The blacksmith&#x27;s spiritual power was said to be transferred to the guns. Majapahit under &quot;Mahapatih&quot; (prime minister) Gajah Mada (in office 1331–1364) utilized gunpowder technology obtained from Yuan dynasty for use in the naval fleet. Pole gun (bedil tombak) was recorded as being used by Javanese people in 1413.

Duarte Barbosa ca. 1514 said that the inhabitants of Java are great masters in casting artillery and very good artillerymen. They make many one-pounder cannons (cetbang or rentaka), long muskets, &quot;spingarde&quot; (arquebus), &quot;schioppi&quot; (hand cannon), Greek fire, guns (cannons), and other fire-works. Every place are considered excellent in casting artillery, and in the knowledge of using it. In 1513, the Javanese fleet led by Pati Unus, sailed to attack Portuguese Malacca &quot;with much artillery made in Java, for the Javanese are skilled in founding and casting, and in all works in iron, exceeding what they have in India&quot;.

Zhang Xie in Dong Xi Yang Kao (1618) mentioned that city of Palembang, which has been conquered by Javanese, produces the furious fiery oil (&quot;meng huo yu&quot;), which according to the &quot;Hua I Kao&quot; is a kind of tree secretion (&quot;shu chin&quot;), and is also called mud oil (&quot;ni yu&quot;). Zhang Xie wrote:It much resemble camphor, and can corrode human flesh. When ignited and thrown on water, its light and flame become all the more intense. The barbarians use it as a fire-weapon and produce great conflagrations in which sails, bulwarks, upperworks and oars all catch fire and cannot withstand it. Fishes and tortoises coming in contact with it cannot escape from being scorched.Because there was no mention of projector pump, the weapon is probably breakable bottles with fuses.

Kris knives are important items, with many heirloom kris holding significant historical value. The design of the kris is to tear apart an opponent&#x27;s abdomen, making the injury more severe.

Kota Gede is famous for its silverworks and silver handicrafts.

Javanese people made several types of armor such as &quot;karambalangan&quot;, &quot;kawaca&quot;, &quot;siping-siping&quot;, and &quot;waju rante&quot;. They also made steel helmets called &quot;rukuh&quot;. Armor is probably only used by high-ranking soldiers and trained/salaried troops, with salaried standing army numbering as many as 30,000 existing during the Singhasari and Majapahit era (1222 to 1527 CE), with the first mention being in the Chinese record &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot; of 1225 CE. A part of the Javanese armies usually consisted of peasant levies who fought bare-chested.

===Batik making===
Batik are worn by both men and women, with patterns varying to denote social stature. Batik are also used ceremonially, with certain designs used to bring good luck to a newborn infant or a newly wed couple and their families. Some towns and villages have specialized in making batik, such as Pekalongan, Kauman, Kampung Taman and Laweyan.

===Wood carving===

The Javanese art of wood carving is traditionally applied to various cultural attributes such as statues, (wayang-)dolls, and masks. Woodcarving also prominent as house ornamentation and details. The elaborately carved Omah Kudus is a fine example of Javanese woodcarving mastery. The Central Java town of Jepara is famous as a center of Javanese woodcarving workshops, where artists and carpenters especially working on Javan teak wood.

==Migrations==
The Javanese were probably involved in the Austronesian migration to Madagascar in the first centuries C.E. While the culture of the migration is most closely related with the Ma&#x27;anyan people of Borneo, a portion of the Malagasy language is derived from loanwords from the Javanese language. It is possible that Ma&#x27;anyan people (or other indigenous people of Kalimantan closely related to the Ma&#x27;anyans) were brought as labourer and slaves by their Javanese masters in their trading fleets, which reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 AD.

A Portuguese account described how the Javanese people already had advanced seafaring skills and had communicated with Madagascar in 1645:

The Javanese are all men very experienced in the art of navigation, to the point that they claim to be the most ancient of all, although many others give this honor to the Chinese, and affirm that this art was handed on from them to the Javanese. But it is certain that they formerly navigated to the Cape of Good Hope and were in communication with the east coast of the island of São Lourenço (San Laurenzo — Madagascar), where there are many brown and Javanese-like natives who say they are descended from them.&lt;br&gt;— Diogo do Couto, &quot;Decada Quarta da Asia&quot;

Since the Hindu kingdom period, Javanese merchants settled at many places in the Indonesian archipelago. In the late 15th century, following the collapse of Majapahit and the rise of Muslim principalities on the northern coast of Java, many Hindu nobilities, artisans and courtiers migrated to Bali, where they would contribute to the refined culture of Bali. Others who refused to convert to Islam retreated to Tengger mountain, retaining their Hindu religion and becoming the Tenggerese people.

In the conflicts during the transitions of power between the Demak, the Pajang and the Mataram in the late 16th century, some Javanese migrated to Palembang in southern Sumatra. There they established a sultanate and formed a mix of Malay and Javanese culture. Palembang language is a dialect of Malay language with heavy influence of Javanese.

&quot;Declaraçam de Malaca e India Meridional com o Cathay&quot; by Manuel Godinho de Eredia (1613), described what he called &quot;India Meridional&quot; (Meridional India — Southern/South India). In his book he relates about the voyage of Chiaymasiouro (or Chiay Masiuro), king of &quot;Damuth&quot; (Demak) in Java, to a Southern land called &quot;Luca&quot; &quot;Antara&quot; (or &quot;Lucaantara,&quot; a peninsula in North Australia). The book explained that in Meridional India already settled a subgroup of Javanese people. A brief description of this country is given in a letter written by Chiaymasiouro to the King of Pahang and in a certificate made by Pedro de Carvalhaes at Malacca on 4 October 1601. In &quot;Report of Meridional India&quot; (1610) Eredia mentioned that the Javanese people of &quot;Luca&quot; &quot;Antara&quot; in all of their customs and in figure resemble the Javanese of Sunda (west Java), only a slight difference in the language, which he described as &quot;much the same as between the Castillian and the Portuguese&quot;. The hair extends as far as the shoulders, the tonsure resembles the tonsure of Balinese people, with a curiously curved contour.

During the reign of Sultan Agung (1613–1645), some Javanese began to establish settlements in coastal West Java around Cirebon, Indramayu and Karawang. These Javanese settlements were originally commissioned by Sultan Agung as rice farming villages to support the Javanese troop logistics on his military campaign against Dutch Batavia.

The Javanese were also present in Peninsular Malaya since early times. The Link between Java and Malacca was important during spread of Islam in Indonesia, when religious missionaries were sent from Malacca to seaports on the northern coast of Java. Large migrations to the Malay Peninsula occurred during the colonial period, mostly from Central Java to British Malaya. Migration also took place from 1880 to 1930 from other parts of Java with a secondary migration Javanese from Ponorogo, East Java and Sumatra. Those migrations were to seek a new life away from the Dutch colonists who ruled Indonesia at that time. Today these people live throughout Peninsular Malaysia and are mainly concentrated in parts of inland, west and northwest coasts of Johor, southwest Perak, west coast of Selangor, plus cities such as Kuala Lumpur.

Today, the Malaysian government classifies the descendants of these Javanese residing in Malaysia under the &quot;Malay&quot; label along with other native Indonesian ethnic groups which allows for socioeconomical privileges allocated for the so-called &quot;bumiputera&quot;, this assimilation is factored by integration under similar socioreligious infrastructures like mosques and intermarriage with the local Malay ethnic population in the Peninsular. Many immigrants of the colonial period retain their Javanese identity, and the Javanese language is still spoken, although the younger generation in urban centers mostly has shifted to Malay.

In Singapore, approximately 50–60% of its &quot;Malay&quot; population have some degree of Javanese ancestry, concentrated in Yishun, Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon, Sengkang and Hougang. Most of them have identified themselves as &quot;Malays&quot;, rather than Javanese.

Javanese merchants were also present in the Maluku Islands as part of the spice trade. Following the Islamisation of Java, they spread Islam in the islands, with Ternate being a Muslim sultanate circa 1484. Javanese merchants also converted coastal cities in Borneo to Islam. The Javanese thus played an important part in transmitting Islam from the western part to the eastern part of the Archipelago with trade based from northern coast of Java.
New migration patterns emerged during colonial periods. During the rise of VOC power starting in the 17th century, many Javanese were exiled, enslaved or hired as mercenaries for the Dutch colonies of Ceylon in South Asia and the Cape colony in South Africa. These included princes and nobility who lost their dispute with the company and were exiled along with their retinues. These, along with exiles from other ethnicities like Bugis and Malay became the Sri Lankan Malay and Cape Malay ethnic groups respectively. Other political prisoners were transported to closer places. Prince Diponegoro and his followers were transported to North Sulawesi, following his defeat in Java War in the early 19th century. Their descendants are well known as Jaton (abbreviation of &quot;Jawa Tondano&quot;/Tondano Javanese).

Major migrations started during the Dutch colonial period under transmigration programs. The Dutch needed many labourers for their plantations and moved many Javanese under the program as contract workers, mostly to other parts of the colony in Sumatra. They also sent Javanese workers to Suriname in South America. As of 2019, approximately 13.7% of the Suriname population is of Javanese ancestry. Outside of the Dutch colonies, Javanese workers were also sent to plantations administered by the Dutch colonial government in New Caledonia, a French territory.

The transmigration program that was created by the Dutch continued following independence. A significant Javanese population can be found in the Jabodetabek (Greater Jakarta) area, Lampung, South Sumatra and Jambi provinces. Several &quot;paguyuban&quot; (traditional community organisation) were formed by these Javanese immigrants, such as &quot;Pujakesuma&quot; (abbreviation of Indonesian: &quot;Putra Jawa Kelahiran Sumatera&quot; or Sumatra-born Javanese).

<text>Juan Bautista Alberdi (August 29, 1810 – June 19, 1884) was an Argentine political theorist and diplomat. Although he lived most of his life in exile in Montevideo, Uruguay and in Chile, he influenced the content of the Constitution of Argentina of 1853.

Based on his classical liberal and federal constitutional ideas, Alberdi at the same time tried to satisfy contrary social interests and establish a balance between national political centralization and provincial administrative decentralization: considering that both solutions would contribute to the consolidation and development of the original being of the single nation.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Juan Bautista Alberdi was born in San Miguel de Tucumán, capital city of the Tucumán Province, Argentina, on August 29, 1810. His father, Salvador Alberdi, was a Spanish Basque merchant; his mother, Josefa Aráoz y Balderrama, had been born into an Argentine family of Spanish descent. She died as a result of Juan Bautista&#x27;s birth. Salvador Alberdi supported the patriots during the Argentine War of Independence, and had interviews with general Manuel Belgrano during the Second Upper Peru campaign that was fought in Tucumán and northern areas in 1812 and 1813. His father died as well in 1822; as he was still a minor his siblings Felipe and Tránsita became his legal guardians.

He got a scholarship to the School of Moral sciences (today&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires&quot;) in Buenos Aires, along fellow Tucuman Marco Avellaneda. He studied alongside Vicente Fidel López and Esteban Echeverría. He could not endure the harsh discipline of the school, and briefly left his studies pretending to be sick. He became interested in music but preferred to teach himself rather than through formal artistic education. He wrote his first book in 1832, &quot;El espíritu de la música&quot; (). He got a job with Juan Maldes, a friend of his family, and continued the informal learning of his other studies. He resumed his formal studies in 1831 and moved to the University of Córdoba. He returned to his province for family business, and wrote &quot;Memoria descriptiva sobre Tucumán&quot; () at the request of governor Alejandro Heredia. He declined the governor&#x27;s request to stay in Tucumán, and returned to Buenos Aires.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.

===Civil war===

Once in Buenos Aires, Alberdi became friends with Juan María Gutiérrez and Esteban Echeverría. They established the &quot;Generation of &#x27;37&quot;, a group of liberal intellectuals that met at the Marcos Sastre literary hall. They criticized both factions of the Argentine Civil Wars, deeming the federalists too violent and the unitarians incapable to rule. They thought that both factions should end their disputes and work together. The governor Juan Manuel de Rosas forced Marcos Sastre to close the hall. Alberdi established then a women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;La Moda&quot; (), writing with the pseudonym &quot;Figarillo&quot;. Despite the main focus, the magazine contained political content as well. Alberdi was concerned about the legal system of Argentina as well and wrote &quot;Fragmento preliminar al estudio del derecho&quot; () to point problems and suggest solutions. The members of the Generation of &#x27;37 continued as a secret society, known as the &quot;May Association&quot; (in reference to the May Revolution), but the government discovered it. Most members emigrated to other countries; Alberdi emigrated to Uruguay in 1838. 

In Montevideo he got a degree as lawyer: he had already finished his studies in Buenos Aires but refused to make the oath under Rosas&#x27; government. Alberdi thought that the real problem in Argentina was not specifically Rosas, but the society that supported him. As a result, he thought that the generation of &#x27;37 should understand the reasons of such popular support, and how to earn it for themselves. He worked in antirosist publications, such as &quot;El Grito Arjentino&quot; () and &quot;Muera Rosas&quot; (). He also wrote theater plays, &quot;La Revolución de Mayo&quot; () and &quot;El gigante Amapolas&quot; (). The name of this last one was a word play with the last name of Rosas, as &quot;Rosas&quot; can be also understood in the Spanish language as the plural form of &quot;Rosa&quot;, the Rose flower. Alberdi worked as well as secretary to Juan Lavalle, who made a military campaign against Rosas during the French blockade of the Río de la Plata but left him for political disagreements. Manuel Oribe, president of Uruguay deposed during the Uruguayan Civil War and allied to Rosas, laid siege to Montevideo in 1840, so Alberdi left the city and moved to Europe, alongside Juan María Gutiérrez.

Alberdi met José de San Martín in Paris. The Argentine general of the war of independence was aged sixty-six at the time, Alberdi praised his modesty and vitality. Alberdi returned to the Americas in 1843. He tried to meet the former Argentine president Bernardino Rivadavia during his brief stay in Rio de Janeiro, to no avail. He settled in Valparaíso, Chile. He renewed his degree as lawyer, and worked both as a lawyer and journalist, again with the pseudonym &quot;Figarillo&quot;. He studied the United States Constitution, seeking ideas that might work in Argentina, and wrote &quot;Sobre la conveniencia de un Congreso General Americano&quot; () in 1844. He established the newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot; and wrote the report &quot;La República Argentina 37 años después de su Revolución de Mayo&quot; () in 1847, calling for an end to the disputes between parties. Rosas was finally defeated by Justo José de Urquiza in 1852, during the battle of Caseros.

===Diplomacy===

With Rosas deposed, Urquiza called the San Nicolás Agreement and convened a constituent assembly. Alberdi supported the project and wrote &quot;Bases y puntos de partida para la organización política de la República Argentina&quot; (), a draft for the new constitution. It was published by the printing house of the &quot;El Mercurio&quot; newspaper. It is heavily influenced by the United States Constitution. Alberdi complemented this work with &quot;Elementos de derecho público provincial Argentino&quot; (), a comparison between the Argentine Constitution of 1826 and the United States Constitution. He attributed most of the problems of Argentina to its low population density, as the country had a very small population for its huge size; he frequently described the countryside as a desert. His proposed solution was to promote an influx of European immigration. His most known quotation is &quot;Gobernar es poblar&quot; (). He proposed as well to improve the infrastructure in ports, roads and bridges, and introduce the recently invented telegraphy and rail transport in the country. He advocated as well for economic freedom, rejecting the protectionism of Rosas&#x27; government.

Urquiza, the new president of Argentina under the 1853 constitution, supported Alberdi&#x27;s work, and appointed him ambassador of the Argentine Confederation in Chile. By that time, Buenos Aires seceded from the Confederation as the State of Buenos Aires. The writer Domingo Faustino Sarmiento opposed Urquiza and extended his criticism to Alberdi. Sarmiento thought that Urquiza was just another &quot;caudillo&quot; similar to Rosas; and Alberdi thought that the State of Buenos Aires was keeping the policies of Rosas regarding the relations between Buenos Aires and the other provinces and the national organization. Alberdi&#x27;s ideas on the issue were detailed in the &quot;Cartas Quillotanas&quot;, written from Quillota. Sarmiento wrote his answer in &quot;Las ciento y una&quot;. Urquiza proposed Alberdi to be the minister of finances, he declined the offer. Urquiza gave him another appointment: move to Europe and seek recognition for the 1816 Argentine Declaration of Independence and its constitution and prevent recognition for the state of Buenos Aires as a different country. Alberdi visited the United States in his way to Europe and had an interview with the American president Franklin Pierce. He visited London, meeting Queen Victoria, and finally settled in Paris. He would stay in this city for 24 years.

Alberdi met the French emperor Napoleon III, who granted the French recognition to the Confederation. Alberdi convinced him as well to remove the French diplomat at the State of Buenos Aires and send another to the Confederation instead. Alberdi began negotiations with the marquis Pedro José Pidal for the Spanish recognition of the Argentine independence in 1857. He proposed two treaties between both countries: in the first, Spain would decline further sovereignty claims over the Argentine territory, and the second opened the country to commerce. He proposed as well that the Confederation would take the international debt of the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, the predecessor State of Argentina under Spanish rule; excluding those belonging to Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay (who had also been part of the viceroyalty but became different countries). The treaties were signed in 1857 and 1859 and ratified on February 26, 1860. The Spanish queen Isabella II confirmed the treaties. However, the governor of Buenos Aires Carlos Tejedor rejected Alberdi&#x27;s negotiations.

He also met Rosas, who was living in Southampton since he left power. The Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires were reunified in 1861, which ceased Alberdi&#x27;s work as ambassador. He opposed the War of the Triple Alliance and began a controversy about it with president Bartolomé Mitre. In this time, he began to write &quot;El crimen de la guerra&quot;, a book that he did not finish and was published posthumously in 1895.

===Late life===
Alberdi returned to Argentina in 1879, after more than forty years living abroad. He had been appointed representative for Tucuman but was rejected during the rebellion of Carlos Tejedor against Julio Argentino Roca. The civil war ended in 1880 with the federalization of Buenos Aires. Alberdi had received a number of recognitions by this time. The village of Alberdi in Santa Fe Province (which was later incorporated to Rosario as Barrio Alberdi) was named after him, and President Roca sent a bill to Congress to have all of Alberdi&#x27;s works published. The newspaper La Nación, established by Mitre, criticized those recognitions. Alberdi was sent to Europe, he had a stroke during the journey. His health rapidly declined, and he died near Paris on June 19, 1884.

==Legacy==

Juan Bautista Alberdi was one of the most notable exponents of the 1837 generation, which made it possible to imagine and begin the construction of a prosperous Argentina with full freedoms. In the field of ideas, Alberdi achieved victory and bequeathed to all Argentines a country project, a model of organization and coexistence based on rules, norms, values and ethics. He is also recognized as a great jurist.

His political as well as his economic projects are supported by contemporary Argentine classical liberal and libertarian economists such as Javier Milei, Agustín Etchebarne, Roberto Cachanosky among others.

<doc id="491674" wikidata="Q3714563" url="?curid=491674" title="Double Dragon Advance">
<text>is a 2003 beat &#x27;em up video game developed by Japanese studio Million and published by Atlus for the Game Boy Advance. It is a remake of Technōs Japan&#x27;s 1987 arcade game &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and incorporates elements from its sequels and home versions.

==Gameplay==

Like in the original arcade game, the player takes control of martial arts masters Billy Lee, or his brother Jimmy, as they fight their way against the members of the Shadow Warriors in order to rescue Billy&#x27;s girlfriend Marian. &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot; can be played alone or with another player via a Game Link Cable. A third game mode allows a single player to play the game as both Lee brothers, with one character being controlled by the player while the other stands idle until the player switches character. There is also a Survival Mode in which the player must defeat as many adversaries possible in a single life.

All of the player&#x27;s techniques from the original arcade game are featured, as well as several new ones based on later arcade and console versions (such as the Hyper Uppercut and the Hyper Knee from the NES version of &quot;The Revenge&quot;), as well as other beat-&#x27;em-ups by Technos such as &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;The Combatribes&quot; (like the sit-on-punch and the jump stomp respectively). New weapons are also added as well, including nunchakus and double kali sticks.

Four new stages were added as well, all taking place between the original stages from the arcade version. These include a Chinatown stage, a fight atop a moving truck (both inspired by &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;), a cavern stage (similar to the one from the first NES game), and a fortress before the final stage. Most of the enemy characters from the first two arcade games are featured, along with a few new ones introduced in this version such as the Twin Tigers Hong and Huang, Kikucho, and the Five Emperors led by Raymond (a group of rival martial artists modeled after the final boss from the NES version of &quot;Double Dragon II&quot;). Moves that could not be performed on certain enemies in the original arcade games can now be performed against them in this version such as the hair-pull on the big characters in Abobo, and Burnov.

==Development and release==
Former Technōs employee Muneki Ebinuma designed &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot;, having previously worked on both &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; for Neo Geo. Ebinuma conceived &quot;Advance&quot; as a way to preserve the legacy of the original &quot;Double Dragon&quot; arcade game while making up for the perceived shortcomings of the games in the series he had worked on before. To this end, the fighting mechanics of &quot;Advance&quot; largely mirror those of the original arcade game combined with elements from the NES games and &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;. Instead of making a second installment titled &quot;Double Dragon Advance II: The Revenge&quot;, Ebinuma chose to cram all of the sequel&#x27;s characters and elements into the game, which owes to limitations in both cartridge size and the scope of the project, the development team excised several planned features, including an extended playable prologue sequence and game modes where players could take control of either the enemy character Abobo or Marian.

The Japanese version of &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot;, released four months after the initial North American version, features a few slight changes. The Sound Test on the Option Mode is available by default and does not require a code, and a Gallery is made available on the main menu after the completing the game on the Expert setting. The Special Thanks on the end credits now mentions Bruce Lee, as well as Yoshihisa Kishimoto, the director of the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; arcade game. The game&#x27;s difficulty has been rebalanced and a few minor bugs were fixed. The Japanese version&#x27;s instruction manual includes additional character profiles, as well as a list of combos.

==Reception==
&quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot; garnered generally positive reviews, with a few of the criticisms aimed at the short length of the game. Alex Navarro of &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the game a score of 8.3 and wrote &quot;while (the game) may prove to be a bit too fleeting for anyone seeking a long-lasting gameplay experience and the additional gameplay modes are a bit too restrictive in the design for what they&#x27;re supposed to be, the game is still great fun and is definitely worth playing through long after you&#x27;ve beaten it the first time&quot;. Justin Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, who gave the game an overall score of 9, wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s still no 30-hour marathon, but Atlus has added a whole lot to an already-excellent beat ‘em up&quot;.

<doc id="491678" wikidata="Q7416591" url="?curid=491678" title="Sandra Diaz-Twine">
<text>Sandra Diaz-Twine (born July 30, 1974) is an American television personality who became known for her appearances on the reality game show &quot;Survivor&quot;. She won the first two seasons she appeared on, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, making her the show&#x27;s first two-time winner. She returned for &quot;Survivor&quot;″s 34th season, &quot;&quot;, where she was the 6th person voted out. Along with fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant Rob Mariano, she was a non-competing mentor on the show&#x27;s 39th season &quot;&quot;, and subsequently competed on the show&#x27;s 40th season, &quot;&quot;, where she was the 7th person voted out and only player to leave the game at the &quot;Edge of Extinction&quot;. Diaz-Twine is regarded among fans as one of the greatest players on the show. She also competed for a 5th time on the &quot;Blood V Water&quot; edition of the Australian version of &quot;Survivor&quot; with her daughter Nina, which premiered in Australia on January 31, 2022.

== Personal life ==
She was born in Stamford, Connecticut and for a time served in the United States Army as a chemical repair specialist and later an office administrator. She lives in Fayetteville, North Carolina with her husband Marcus, a career soldier, and her two children, while working as a secretary for a law firm.

== &quot;Survivor&quot; ==

=== &quot;Pearl Islands&quot; ===

Diaz-Twine seemed like an early target for her lack of physical strength and inability to swim, but her knowledge of the Spanish language and her resourcefulness, which helped their tribe Drake gather much needed resources from local traders at the start of the game, put her in good standing with the majority of her tribe. She eventually formed an alliance with Rupert Boneham, Christa Hastie, Trish Dunn, and Jonny Fairplay. Diaz-Twine was the first person to sit out of a challenge and the first to raid on Morgan&#x27;s camp as part of the reward, where she not only took their tarp, but sabotaged their shelter. When Drake lost the fourth and fifth immunity challenges, the alliance voted out the minority alliance&#x27;s Burton Roberts and Michelle Tesauro. When Drake lost the sixth immunity challenge, the originally-targeted Shawn Cohen was saved when Diaz-Twine turned the alliance against Dunn for instigating an attempted blindside of Boneham.

With the Drake and Morgan tribes even at five members each, they were shocked when the six contestants who had been previously voted out came back into the game as a third tribe, in a turn of events called the &quot;Outcast Twist.&quot; When the tribe of Outcasts competed against the Drake and Morgan tribes and subsequently won the immunity challenge, two of the Outcasts were allowed to return to the game. At the same time, both Drake and Morgan were forced to vote out a tribe member. In a game-changing move, Diaz-Twine, Boneham, and Hastie, unsure about whether to send home Cohen, the last minority alliance member left, or Fairplay, who betrayed them previously together with Dunn, asked them to publicly campaign for their spot. The alliance eventually eliminated Cohen, and received Roberts as a replacement from The Outcasts.

As the tribes merged into Balboa at 5–5, the Drake tribe, with the help of outcast Roberts, was able to sway Morgan outcast Lillian &quot;Lil&quot; Morris to vote with them, controlling the game and subsequently voting out Morgan leaders Andrew Savage and Ryan Opray. However, the game took a major shift when old Drake members Fairplay and Roberts aligned themselves with Morris, and recruited the remaining Morgan members Tijuana &quot;Ti&quot; Bradley and Darrah Johnson. This new alliance successfully targeted Boneham and he was blindsided.

At the Final Seven, it seemed that Diaz-Twine and Hastie were doomed by this newly created alliance, but Diaz-Twine swayed Bradley and Johnson by spying on Roberts and Fairplay to expose their intentions to eliminate the Morgan girls after getting rid of Diaz-Twine and Hastie. However, when Roberts and Fairplay learned of this impending mutiny, they regained the trust of Diaz-Twine and Hastie (with the help of Fairplay’s infamous &quot;dead grandmother&quot; lie) to successfully blindside Bradley. Soon after that, they were betrayed once again when Roberts and Dalton switched sides and Hastie was voted out next.

At the Final Five, Johnson was the next target of Roberts and Fairplay, but Morris started to have suspicions about her alliance (which would prove true eventually). Roberts made a potentially fatal error by inviting Dalton on his reward trip, leaving the three women, including an angered Morris, together back at camp, sparking a last minute scramble to break the bond between the two guys, eventually voting out Roberts for the second time in the game.

After Diaz-Twine made it to the Final Four, she was no longer a target, with Morris and Johnson targeting each other, each believing that no one could win against her in the Final Two. Diaz-Twine and Fairplay decided to side with Morris and vote out Johnson, propelling them into the Final Three. In the Final Three endurance immunity challenge, Morris won and chose to eliminate Fairplay, an error that led to Diaz-Twine&#x27;s ultimate win.

In the end, after having previously stated that no one could ever win against Morris because she was too nice, Diaz-Twine defeated Morris, winning by a vote of 6–1 to become the Sole Survivor. During her final statements at Tribal Council, Diaz-Twine described her strategy as being the one people would come to if they needed one more vote to oust someone (&quot;anyone, as long as it ain&#x27;t me&quot;). She gained the votes of Opray, Boneham, Hastie, Roberts, Johnson, and Fairplay. Only Bradley voted for Morris.

=== &quot;Heroes vs. Villains&quot; ===
After declining a spot on &quot;&quot; due to recovering from parasites that she got while being filmed for &quot;Pearl Islands&quot;, and then being cut at the last minute from &quot;&quot;, Diaz-Twine accepted a spot on &quot;&quot;. She was one of four previous winners chosen; the other three were Tom Westman of &quot;&quot;, Parvati Shallow of &quot;&quot;, and James &quot;J.T.&quot; Thomas, Jr. of &quot;&quot;. At the start, Diaz-Twine was placed on the Villains tribe, and in the first episode, when host Jeff Probst asked who believed they were on the wrong tribe, she was quick to raise her hand. During the first reward challenge, she deliberately tore Hero Jessica &quot;Sugar&quot; Kiper&#x27;s top off, which, according to Heroes member Cirie Fields, solidified why Diaz-Twine was chosen as a Villain.

In Episode Three, when the Villains faced their first Tribal Council, Diaz-Twine stuck with her strategy from &quot;Pearl Islands&quot; of &quot;anyone, as long as it ain&#x27;t me.&quot; She, along with the rest of the Villains tribe, unanimously voted out Randy Bailey from &quot;&quot;. Despite previously appearing to be in a comfortable six-person alliance, by Episode Eight, she found herself on the outs of her tribe alongside Courtney Yates of &quot;&quot;. Despite the pair being considered the weakest on the tribe, Diaz-Twine convinced Russell Hantz that Benjamin &quot;Coach&quot; Wade was against him, and she and Yates survived elimination at Tribal Council. Yates, however, would be voted off in the subsequent Tribal Council.

After the merge, Diaz-Twine pleaded with the Heroes not to trust Hantz. However, they did not listen, and despite several attempts to oust him, she remained with the Villains after her plans to help the Heroes failed to materialize. She made it to the Final Three, along with Shallow and Hantz. On May 16, 2010, Diaz-Twine received six jury votes from Yates, Heroes tribe members Thomas, Amanda Kimmel, Candice Woodcock, Boneham and Colby Donaldson to Shallow&#x27;s three and Hantz&#x27;s zero to win the game. She became the first contestant to win Survivor twice and proclaimed herself the &quot;Queen of Survivor.&quot;

=== &quot;Game Changers&quot; ===
Diaz-Twine entered &quot;Survivor: Game Changers&quot; as one of three former winners. She had an especially big target on her back since she had won twice before. She was initially assigned to the Mana tribe. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Mana made an easy vote and decided to unanimously vote off Ciera Eastin for playing too hard too early.

The day after Eastin&#x27;s elimination, Diaz-Twine made an alliance with &quot;&quot; winner Tony Vlachos on the basis that they were both major threats. The duo planned to link up with J.T. Thomas, the other past winner in the game, should they ever meet on the same tribe. She and Vlachos pulled in Aubry Bracco, Caleb Reynolds, and Malcolm Freberg, and thus the alliance of five seemed to control the nine-person Mana tribe. However, on night five, Vlachos caught Diaz-Twine talking with &quot;Troyzan&quot; Robertson in the middle of the night. Even though she had not reneged on the alliance, Vlachos misinterpreted the conversation and confronted her. As a result, Diaz-Twine and Vlachos turned against each other—he for seeing her as too much of a threat; she because Vlachos was too controlling. Mana narrowly lost the second challenge and went back to Tribal Council. Diaz-Twine gathered her troops; she spoke to those who were on the outs of the alliance of big threats, namely Hali Ford, Jeff Varner, Michaela Bradshaw, and Robertson. She wanted them to vote with her to take out Vlachos. At Tribal Council, Diaz-Twine voted against Bracco in the event that Vlachos played an idol. The rest of the tribe voted with her and sent Vlachos packing. As Vlachos left, Diaz-Twine coined the catch phrase she uttered at all subsequent councils until she was voted out: “And the Queen stays Queen”.

Day Seven brought a tribe swap, and Diaz-Twine was sent to the Nuku tribe. The former Manas had a 5–1 majority on the new Nuku, with Thomas being the odd man out. Nuku won the third Immunity Challenge, and later the first Reward Challenge, winning coffee, cookies, and pastries. During this time, Thomas was plotting behind Diaz-Twine&#x27;s back to take her out of the competition.

At the Day 11 Immunity Challenge, Jeff Probst revealed that the two tribes who lost the Immunity Challenge would be sent to one Tribal Council, where they would collectively vote out one person. Nuku had an early lead due to Varner&#x27;s proficient communication skills, but he ultimately lost the challenge at the table maze stage. Nuku was set to head to Tribal Council with Mana. During the afternoon, Thomas continued plotting against Diaz-Twine, mainly with his new ally Freberg. However, the rest of the tribe planned to vote together. They planned to vote against Sierra Dawn Thomas (no relation to J.T.). At a chaotic Tribal Council, J.T. had told Mana that Sierra was Nuku&#x27;s target, and hoped to get the Mana tribe to blindside Diaz-Twine. In the end, Nuku continued with their original plan, piling their votes onto Sierra. Tai Trang played his hidden immunity idol on Sierra, negating the six votes cast against her. Freberg was taken out, much to the chagrin of the Nuku tribe.

Freberg&#x27;s untimely blindside infuriated Diaz-Twine, who, after Tribal Council, confronted J.T. She planned to get him out for his &quot;dirty deed&quot; should Nuku lose the next Immunity Challenge. At the second Reward Challenge, she helped Nuku win peanut butter and jelly sandwiches by completing the puzzle. After the challenge, she played on the brewing feud between J.T. and Bradshaw. She escalated the tension by consuming the tribe&#x27;s sugar and putting the blame on Bradshaw. Nuku went on to lose the Immunity Challenge, sending Diaz-Twine to Tribal Council for the fourth time. She seized the opportunity to exact revenge on J.T. At Tribal Council, J.T. and Bradshaw&#x27;s fight reached a fever pitch. Diaz-Twine took advantage of this to secure Bradshaw&#x27;s vote. She pulled the wool over Bracco&#x27;s and J.T.’s eyes, and with Varner&#x27;s vote, J.T. was sent home with an idol in his pocket. After Tribal Council, Diaz-Twine made clear that Bracco was next on her list, since she had failed to get with the rest of the Manas during her time in the game.

A second tribe swap occurred on Day 14, but although Diaz-Twine remained on Nuku, she was relegated to the bottom with Varner, as the original Nukus who returned to the tribe held a five-to-two numbers advantage. The Nukus planned to get her out for being a two-time winner. Her fate was sealed when Nuku lost the Immunity Challenge. However, she saw through the Nukus&#x27; lie that she was safe over Trang, and she tried to gather votes by telling Ozzy Lusth, Sarah Lacina, and Andrea Boehlke that she would vote with them when the merge hit. Diaz-Twine planned to throw Trang under the bus at Tribal Council. But during Tribal Council, Trang whispered to her, telling her to vote against Lusth. She made a last-ditch attempt to gather votes against either Lusth or Trang (for his perceived duplicity), but it was all for naught. Diaz-Twine left the game in 15th place to an ovation, in a 5–2 vote. However, she emerged as the highest-placing former winner in the season.

=== &quot;Island of the Idols&quot; ===

Diaz-Twine, along with Rob Mariano, participated in the show&#x27;s 39th season which aired in late 2019. Neither participated in any direct aspect of the game, but instead, they served as mentors to any player sent to the island, offering advice on various topics deemed valuable attributes of a Survivor player. Both players stayed on the island until the Final 5, after which the players were left to play the game by themselves.

===&quot;Winners at War&quot;===

Diaz-Twine played the game for a fourth time on the show&#x27;s 40th season, &quot;Survivor: Winners at War&quot;. She was a member of the Dakal tribe. After sixteen days of riding a comfortable majority, she became the seventh person voted out of the game (again on Day 16) after Denise Stapley played two idols, blocking votes for herself and Jeremy Collins, thereby casting the sole vote that sent Diaz-Twine to the Edge of Extinction. After she was voted off, Sandra joined the previously eliminated players on the Edge of Extinction. As she explained to the other players and in confessions to the camera, she knew she had little chance to win any physical challenge and did not want to face the misery and harsh conditions on the Edge of Extinction. As a result, she decided to raise the flag and permanently leave the game shortly after her arrival, the only player in the season to do so, and forfeiting her opportunity to be on the jury.

===&quot;Australian Survivor: Blood V Water&quot;===

Diaz-Twine played for a fifth time on the ninth season of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;, titled &quot;Australian Survivor: Blood V Water&quot;, alongside her daughter Nina. Diaz-Twine became the second former American &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant to compete on &quot;Australian Survivor&quot; after Russell Hantz, as well as being the second contestant after Rob Mariano to play the game for a fifth time. She was eliminated after a tribe swap, and yet again on the 16th day of the competition.

== &quot;The Traitors&quot; ==

Diaz-Twine competed in the second season of &quot;The Traitors&quot;, along with fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; alumna, Parvati Shallow. She was given the role of a faithful and placed 5th, being the last player banished before the endgame.

== Other media appearances ==
In 2013, Diaz-Twine was in the audience of an episode of &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; to support her friend and fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; winner, Todd Herzog, who was struggling with alcoholism. 

In May 2022, Diaz-Twine competed as a celebrity tribe captain in the first season of the NMB Celebrity Survivor Challenge. She was the 9th person voted out and became the 5th member of the jury.

<doc id="491684" wikidata="Q7578290" url="?curid=491684" title="Spite and malice">
<text>Spite and malice, also known as cat and mouse, is a relatively modern American card game for two or more players. It is a reworking of the late 19th-century Continental game crapette, also known as Russian bank, and is a form of competitive solitaire, with a number of variations that can be played with two or three regular decks of cards.

It had a &quot;well-deserved following&quot; during the 1970s when bridge expert Easley Blackwood saw it being played on a cruise ship and subsequently published its rules. According to David Parlett, the game is a reworking of an old 19th-century patience called crapette or Russian bank, but he also identifies three early English patiences by Mary Whitmore Jones – carbouche, obstruction, and dowager&#x27;s patience – which bear a &quot;remarkable similarity&quot; to spite and malice.

A commercial variation sold by Hasbro is called &quot;Spite and Malice&quot;; a variation sold by Mattel is called &quot;Skip-Bo&quot;.

== History ==
This modern American card game is not recorded until the 1960s, an early reference being seen as a trend-setting game by &quot;The Santa Fe Magazine&quot; in 1963. The first rules are recorded by Richard L. Frey in 1965, who calls it &quot;a recent husband-and-wife game that in some places rivals Russian Bank in popularity&quot;. However, John McLeod points out that the version that appears in card books is &quot;rather different&quot; from those usually played.

== Rules ==

The deck consists of three regular playing card decks with the jokers removed (or jokers may be retained and used as wild), although the United States Playing Card Company&#x27;s version of the game uses two 52-card decks. The rank of the cards is ace low and proceeding normally up to queen, which is the highest card in the deck. Kings are wild and may substitute for any other card rank except ace. Suits have no bearing on the game.

The game is usually played with 2 to 4 players. The object is to be the first person to move all the cards in your goal pile into the playing piles. Players cut for the deal, with the highest card winning. Dealer deals 26 cards to each player (or 13 cards if a shorter game is desired). The players do not look at these cards but simply collect them into a pile called the goal pile. Once each goal pile is dealt, the top card is turned over by each player and placed face up on the pile. All undealt cards are left face down in a stack placed central to all players called the draw pile.

There are three kinds of piles in Spite and Malice:

*Goal piles 
**Each player tries to play through his goal pile. The one doing so first wins.
**If a player cannot play the card in his goal pile, he may attempt to block someone else from playing.
*Playing piles
**Play piles are community piles used by all players.
**There are a maximum of four playing piles open at any one time.
**Each playing pile is opened with an ace.
**Playing proceeds upward in normal rank all the way to the Queen.
**Once a queen is played on a playing pile, that pile is dead and it is removed from the immediate playing area until enough cards are collected to shuffle them and return them to the draw pile.
*Discard piles
**Discard piles belong only to the player who made them; players may not interfere with or play from one another&#x27;s discard piles.
**Each player has a maximum of four discard piles.
**Playing a card into a discard pile ends the player&#x27;s turn and passes it on to the next player.
**The cards played into the discard piles must be played out in reverse order of their being laid down; one must remove cards from the top of discard piles when putting them into the playing piles.
**Players often organize their discard piles by being all of the same number or by descending card ranks so that they may be played sequentially.
**Players cannot discard an ace.

== Play ==

Play starts with the dealer and goes around the table in a clockwise fashion. Each turn starts with a player drawing from the common draw pile to give themselves a five-card hand. They then make whatever plays they can until they have no more plays that they want to do, and then they discard a card from their hand into their personal discard area. 
If they put all 5 cards out before making a discard they pick up 5 more cards and continue. They may ONLY put one card out on their personal discard area and may NOT play a buried card in their personal discard area when they are playing. When they put a card out on their personal discard area and have 1 or more cards left in their hand, their turn is over

The best move would be to play the goal card directly on a playing pile (it would have to be an ace at this point, since all four playing piles are empty at this point). If this is not possible, the player may use the cards in their hand to put cards into the playing piles and &quot;play up&quot; to the value of the goal card. If the player cannot do either of these things, the turn might simply consist of making a discard to one of their four discard piles.

However, if all five cards in the hand can be played in the playing piles (for example, if a player drew A, 2, 3, A, 2, they could play ace, two, three on one playing pile and ace and then 2 on a second pile), resulting in running out of cards before making a discard, that player may draw five more playing cards to replenish their hand. It is possible, if not probable, for this to happen more than once, or even a few times in a row, before someone is forced to make a discard because they cannot make any further plays.

Once a discard is made, the turn moves to the next player. That person starts their turn by drawing cards from the draw pile to make their five-card hand. On someone&#x27;s first turn they will always draw five cards, but on subsequent turns they will draw however many cards are required. For example, suppose they are able to play three cards and then ends their first turn with their discard. On the next turn, they would have one card left in their hand and would then draw four more to reconstitute a five-card hand. If a player&#x27;s only possible move on their first play is to discard because they have no playable card on the playing piles, they would discard one card, leaving them with four, in which case on their next turn they would simply draw one card to end up with the standard five-card hand. No matter how many cards are able to be played, a turn ends with a player placing a card from their hand into one of their discard piles (unless they play the winning move of putting their last goal card into play, in which case they win and no discard is required).

If everyone has a high goal card at the start of play, there may be many turns where the players draw just one card and then decide which card to add to the discard piles until someone gets a sufficient number of cards saved up in the discard piles of cards to reach their high number. Or one person may end up with a low goal card and, in reaching that one and then ending their turn, they will have unavoidably helped someone else to reach their higher number goal card.

As play continues, many cards can accumulate in the discard piles. In order to make your goal card or prevent your opponent from reaching theirs, you can use cards from both your hand and your discard piles during your turn.

==Scoring==
After each hand has ended, scoring takes place. Only the player who cleared their goal pile can score: They score five points for clearing the goal pile and one point per card left in their opponents&#x27; goal piles. If, in the rare instance that the draw pile is exhausted and there is no possible way to furnish a new one, a drawn hand is declared, and the person closest to a cleared goal pile scores the difference between their opponents&#x27; leftover cards and their own. Games are usually played to 25, 50, or 100 points.

==Variants==
Some rules use unlimited center stacks; they are only removed when the draw stack is depleted. Also, sometimes a rule is employed requiring aces and deuces to be played any time a player is able to do so.

Spite and Malice is similar to a game called Misery. It is played with 2 players. Two decks are used instead of three (unless three people play—then three decks are used) and two (goal) piles of 12 per player and a hand of 6.

Another variation calls for all piles to be built up to the king, with jokers used as wild cards. (Wild represents all cards besides A, 2, 7, and J.)

Yet another variant requires a wild card to be immediately covered by the next card, but also does not allow wild cards to be used in place of 7&#x27;s (or Queens, because a Queen ends the stack and cannot be covered).

One variation calls for one deck for every player (e.g., 3 players play with 3 decks) with a maximum of four center stacks to be built from ace to queen, with kings as wilds. (Jokers are not used here.)

Another variation requires a natural A and 2 (no wild cards for A or 2) but does permit discarding of pairs of cards (e.g., two queens, two 7&#x27;s, etc.), but no more than two cards at a time.

==Commercial versions==

A commercial variation sold by Hasbro is called &quot;Spite and Malice&quot;; Mattel&#x27;s version is called &quot;Skip-Bo&quot;.
William Henry Storey designed a card game &quot;Starturn&quot; which was published by Chad Valley in 1935, and which had almost the same rules as Spite and Malice.

Two packs, 44 very dark gray and 52 stop sign red, are used in a game primarily for two players although there were versions for three or four players. Black cards are divided equally between the players, placed face down with only the top card visible, as the Stack. Five red cards are dealt to each player, made up to five on each pass, and the rest placed as the draw Pack. The aim is to make up to four Build piles starting at 1 through to 15, using cards from the player&#x27;s Stack where possible. Each player must discard one card at the end of each pass (except when all cards in the hand have been used on Build piles) on to one of four discard piles in front of each player, from which cards may be used (strictly, top card first) in forming Build piles. Completed Build piles are shuffled into the Pack as soon as completed. The first player to use up all of their Stack cards is the winner.

<text>USS &quot;F-3&quot; (SS-22), was a F-class submarine. She was named &quot;Pickerel&quot; when her keel was laid down by The Moran Company of Seattle, Washington, making her the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pickerel, a type of pike. She was renamed &quot;F-3&quot; on 17 November 1911, launched on 6 January 1912 sponsored by Mrs. M. F. Backus, and commissioned on 5 August 1912.

==Service history==
&quot;F-3&quot; completed her trials in the Puget Sound area before reporting for duty at San Francisco, California, on 15 October 1912, when she joined the First Submarine Group, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla. The Flotilla operated along the coast of California, conducting constant exercises and experiments to develop the techniques of submarine warfare, and from August 1914 to November 1915, carried out similar operations in the Hawaiian Islands out of Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor. &quot;F-3&quot; was placed in ordinary at Mare Island Navy Yard at Mare Island in Vallejo, California, on 15 March 1916, returning to full commission on 13 June 1917.

After training her new crew, &quot;F-3&quot; was assigned to the Coast Torpedo Force, Pacific Fleet, based at San Pedro, California&#x27;s San Pedro Submarine Base. She engaged in daily operations, surfaced and submerged, training students of the submarine school. During maneuvers on 17 December 1917, she and collided, the latter sinking almost immediately. &quot;F-3&quot;, along with other submarines with whom she was operating, rescued only three men out of the 22 on board the &quot;F-1&quot;. &quot;F-3&quot; suffered a cracked bow cap and after repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard was assigned operations in cooperation with a civilian motion picture company in experiments with underwater photography. From 1919 to 1921, &quot;F-3&quot; served at San Pedro, California, as training ship, and on 15 March 1922 she was decommissioned. She was sold on 17 August 1922.

<text>The American Library Association (ALA) is a nonprofit organization based in the United States that promotes libraries and library education internationally. It is the oldest and largest library association in the world.

==History==
===19th century===
During the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, 103 librarians, 90 men, and 13 women, responded to a call for a &quot;Convention of Librarians&quot; to be held October 4–6, 1876, at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. At the end of the meeting, according to Edward G. Holley in his essay &quot;ALA at 100&quot;, &quot;the register was passed around for all to sign who wished to become charter members&quot;, making October 6, 1876, the date of the ALA&#x27;s founding.

Among the 103 librarians in attendance were Justin Winsor (Boston Public Library and Harvard University), William Frederick Poole (Chicago Public Library and Newberry College), Charles Ammi Cutter (Boston Athenæum), Melvil Dewey, Charles Evans (Indianapolis Public Library) and Richard Rogers Bowker. Attendees came from as far west as Chicago and from England. The ALA was chartered in 1879 in Massachusetts. Its headquarters office is in Chicago.
Another important founder was Frederick Leypoldt, publisher of Library Journal, who published the conference proceedings.

Justin Winsor was the first president of the ALA, serving from 1876 until 1885.

Many early presidents were also officers in the Bibliographical Society of America. See List of presidents of the Bibliographical Society of America.

===20th century===
In 1911, Theresa Elmendorf became ALA&#x27;s first woman president. An analysis of the writings of the first fifteen women presidents gives more insight into the expanded role of women in the association.
During World War I the ALA Executive Board initiated by Walter Lewis Brown established the Library War Service Committee to supply books and periodicals to military personnel at home and overseas. The American Library in Paris was founded as part of this effort.

In the 1930s, library activists pressured the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues such as peace, segregation, library unions, and intellectual freedom. In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA.
The first Library Bill of Rights (LBR) was drafted by Forrest Spaulding to set a standard against censorship and was adopted by the ALA in 1939. This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read. 
ALA appointed a committee to study censorship and recommend policy after the banning of the novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; in Kern County, California and the implementation of the Library Bill of Rights. The committee reported in 1940 that intellectual freedom and professionalism were linked and recommended a permanent committee – Committee on Intellectual Freedom. The ALA made revisions to strengthen the Library Bill of Rights in June 1948, approved the Statement on Labeling in 1951 to discourage labeling material as subversive, and adopted the Freedom to Read Statement and the Overseas Library Statement in 1953.

The ALA has worked throughout its history to define, extend, protect and advocate for equity of access to information.

In 1945 the ALA established an Office in Washington, D.C. named the National Relations Office under the direction of Paul Howard.

In 1961, the ALA took a stand regarding service to African Americans and others, advocating for equal library service for all. An amendment to the Library Bill of Rights was passed in 1961 that made clear that an individual&#x27;s library use should not be denied or abridged because of race, religion, national origin, or political views. Some communities decided to close their doors rather than desegregate. In 1963, the ALA commissioned a study, &quot;Access to Public Libraries&quot;, which found direct and indirect discrimination in American libraries.

In 1967, some librarians protested against a pro-Vietnam War speech given by General Maxwell D. Taylor at the annual ALA conference in San Francisco; the former president of Sarah Lawrence College, Harold Taylor, spoke to the Middle-Atlantic Regional Library Conference about socially responsible professionalism; and less than one year later a group of librarians proposed that the ALA schedule a new round table program discussion on the social responsibilities of librarians at its annual conference in Kansas City. This group called themselves the Organizing Committee for the ALA Round Table on Social Responsibilities of Libraries. This group drew in many other under-represented groups in the ALA who lacked power, including the Congress for Change in 1969. This formation of the committee was approved in 1969 and would change its name to the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT) in 1971. After its inception, the Round Table of Social Responsibilities began to press ALA leadership to address issues such as library unions, working conditions, wages, and intellectual freedom.

The Freedom to Read Foundation was founded by Judith Krug, Alexander Allain, and Carrie C Robinson and established by ALA&#x27;s executive board in 1969.

The Black Caucus of the ALA and the Office for Literacy and Outreach were established in 1970.

In 1971, Barbara Gittings staffed a kissing booth at the ALA Conference underneath the banner, &quot;Hug a Homosexual.&quot; This was the precipitating event that evolved into the Rainbow Round Table dedicated to supporting the information needs of LGBTQIA+ people.

====Centennial====
The American Library Association celebrated its centennial in 1976. In commemoration the association published &quot;Libraries and the Life of the Mind in America.&quot;

The American Library Association Archives, established at the time of the centennial, created an online exhibit which includes a history of the centennial. Clara Stanton Jones, president, Inaugural address was titled, “The First Step into ALA’s Second Century.”

====1976–2000====
Clara Stanton Jones was the first African American president of the ALA, serving as its acting president from April 11 to July 22 in 1976 upon the death of Allie Beth Martin and then elected president from July 22, 1976 to 1977.

In 1979 and 1991 the ALA collaborated with the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science on two White House Conferences.

In 1983 in response to the National Commission on Excellence in Education Report, &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;, leaders in library and information science launched the project, &quot;Libraries and the Learning Society.&quot; Librarians examined how public libraries, academic libraries, library and information science training institutions, and school library media centers could best respond to &quot;A Nation at Risk.&quot;

In June 1990, the ALA approved &quot;Policy on Library Services to the Poor&quot; and in 1996 the Task Force on Hunger, Homelessness, and Poverty was formed to resurrect and promote the ALA guidelines on library services to the poor.

The Office for Information Technology Policy was established in 1995 to act as a public policy advocate for libraries in the area
of information technology.

The &quot;Congress on Professional Education&quot; took place from April 30 to May 1, 1999 in Washington, D.C. Its purpose was to reach consensus among stakeholder groups on the values and core competencies of the profession and on strategies for action to address common issues and concerns.

===21st century===
At the beginning of the century The Congress on Professional Education recommended that the Association develop a set of Core Values.

In 2007, Loriene Roy was elected as the first Native American President of the ALA.

In 2009, Camila Alire became the first Hispanic president of the ALA.

In 2014, Courtney Young, president of the association, commented on the background and implications of a racist joke author Daniel Handler made as African American writer Jacqueline Woodson received a National Book Award for &quot;Brown Girl Dreaming&quot;. &quot;His comments were inappropriate and fell far short of the association&#x27;s commitment to diversity,&quot; said Young. &quot;Handler&#x27;s remarks come at a time when the publishing world has little diversity. Works from authors and illustrators of color make up less than 8 percent of children&#x27;s titles produced in 2013. The ALA hopes this regrettable incident will be used to open a dialogue on the need for diversity in the publishing industry, particularly in regards to books for young people.&quot;

In 2020 Wanda Kay Brown was the first president from a historically black college or university. She also was president during COVID-19 and the live annual conference was cancelled and delivered virtually. Brown characterized her presidency as one of &quot;change, loss, and hope.&quot;

In 2021, Patty Wong became the first Asian-American president of the ALA.

In 2022 Lessa Kananiʻopua Pelayo-Lozada became the first Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander American president of the ALA.

In 2023 the Public Library Association of ALA published the &quot;Public Library Services for Strong Communities Report&quot; addressing the myriad ways libraries nationwide serve and sustain their 
communities. 
That same year, the Montana State Library Commission withdrew from the ALA, citing comments made by Emily Drabinski, who self-identified as a &quot;Marxist lesbian&quot;.

The &quot;Digital Public Library Ecosystem&quot; was published by ALA in 2023. It is a comprehensive overview of the current state and operations of the relationships and roles of stakeholders including authors, 
agents, publishers, distributors, the library community, governments, and trade organizations.

In 2024, in response to proposed Georgia legislation that would prohibit public expenditures on the ALA, the ALA responded that the legislation &quot;is based on false narratives&quot;, and the ALA &quot;does not promote any &#x27;ideology&#x27;&quot;.

The Association received the Toni Morrison Achievement Award from the National Book Critics Circle.

The Library History Round Table published the &quot;Bibliography of Library History&quot; database containing over 7,000 entries for books, articles, and theses in library history and related fields published from 1990 to 2022.

Cindy Hohl, the first SPECTRUM Scholar to be elected president was inaugurated in July 2024. Her presidential theme is “A Good Way for ALA.”

&quot;Standards for Library Services for the Incarcerated or Detained&quot; was published in 2024.

===Archives===
The ALA Archives, including historical documents, non-current records, and digital records, are held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign archives. The establishment of the archives and the roles of David Horace Clift, Robert Wedgeworth, Beta Phi Mu, and the Library History Round Table has been documented by the first archivist, Maynard Britchford.

Additionally, the American Library Association Institutional Repository (ALAIR) provides digital access to the publications and intellectual work of the Association.

==Membership==
ALA membership is open to any person or organization, though most of its members are libraries or librarians. Most members live and work in the United States, with international members comprising 3.5% of total membership.

==Governing structure==
The ALA is governed by an elected council and an executive board. Policies and programs are administered by committees and round tables. One of the organization&#x27;s most visible tasks is overseen by the Office for Accreditation, which formally reviews and authorizes American and Canadian academic institutions that offer degree programs in library and information science.

===President and executive directors===
ALA&#x27;s President for the 2024–2025 term is Cindy Hohl. President-elect, Sam Helmick, will preside in 2025-2026.

The executive director of the American Library Association delegates authority within ALA headquarters to ALA’s department heads, who, in carrying out their assigned duties, are called upon to use ALA’s name, and, in that name, to commit the Association to programs, activities, and binding agreements.

Secretaries of the Association prior to Carl Milam were George Burwell Utley (1911–20); Chalmers Hadley (1909–11); Edward C. Hovey (1905–7); James Ingersoll Wyer (1902–09); Frederick Winthrop Faxon (1900–02); Henry James Carr (1898–1900); Melvil Dewey (1897–98); Rutherford Platt Hayes (1896–97); Henry Livingston Elmendorf (1895–96); Frank Pierce Hill (1891–95); Mary Salome Cutler (1891); William E. Parker (1890– 1891) and Melvil Dewey (1879–90).

The ALA is affiliated with regional, state, and student chapters across the country. It organizes conferences, participates in library standards development, and publishes books and periodicals. The ALA publishes the journals &quot;American Libraries&quot;, &quot;Booklist&quot; and &quot;Choice&quot;.

The Graphics Program creates and distributes products that promote libraries, literacy and reading. Along with other organizations, it sponsors the annual Banned Books Week the last week of September. The Young Adult Library Services Association also sponsors Teen Read Week, the third week of each October, and Teen Tech Week, the second week of each March. In addition, the ALA helps to promote diversity in the library profession with various outreach activities, including the Spectrum Scholarship program, which awards academic scholarships to minority library students each year. 
Additionally, the ALA&#x27;s Office for Library Advocacy has an initiative called &quot;I Love Libraries&quot;, also known as &quot;ilovelibraries&quot;, which attempts to &quot;spread the world about the value of today&#x27;s libraries,&quot; promotes value of librarians and libraries, explains key library issues, and &quot;urges readers to support and take action for their libraries.&quot;

The ALA provides many scholarships (over $300,000 annually), a list of which can be found on their website.

National Library Week, the second week of each April, is a national observance sponsored by the ALA since 1958. Libraries across the country celebrate library resources, library champions and promote public outreach.

The Coretta Scott King Award honorees are awarded by the Coretta Scott King Book Awards Round Table.

The young-adult division, YALSA, administers the Margaret Edwards Award for significant and lasting contribution to YA literature, a lifetime recognition of one author annually, and annual awards that recognize particular works: the Michael L. Printz Award for a YA book judged on literary merit alone, the William C. Morris Award for an author&#x27;s first YA book, the new &quot;YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction for Young Adults,&quot; and the &quot;Alex Award&quot; list of ten adult books having special appeal for teens. Jointly with the children&#x27;s division ALSC there is the Odyssey Award for excellence in audiobook production.

The award for YA nonfiction was inaugurated in 2012, defined by ages 12 to 18 and publication year November 2010 to October 2011. The first winner was &quot;The Notorious Benedict Arnold: A True Story of Adventure, Heroism &amp; Treachery&quot; by Steve Sheinkin (Roaring Brook Press, November 2010) and four other finalists were named.

In 2000, the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services (OLOS) launched the Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture in tribute to the work of the first OLOS director, Jean E. Coleman. Barbara J. Ford gave the inaugural lecture, &quot;Libraries, Literacy, Outreach and the Digital Divide.&quot;

Since 2006, the ALA has selected a class of Emerging Leaders, typically comprising about 100 librarians and library school students. This minor distinction is a form of organizational outreach to new librarians. The Emerging Leaders are allocated to project groups tasked with developing solutions to specified problems within ALA divisions. The class meets at the ALA Midwinter and Annual Meetings, commonly January and June. Project teams may present posters of their completed projects at the Annual.

==Conferences==

The ALA and its divisions hold numerous conferences throughout the year. The two largest conferences are the annual conference and the midwinter meeting, now called LibLearnX. The latter is typically held in January and focuses on innovative session design concepts, while the annual conference is typically held in June and focuses on programs, exhibits, and presentations. The ALA annual conference is notable for being one of the largest professional conferences in existence, typically drawing over 25,000 attendees.

In 2020, Wanda Kay Brown was the first president in 75 years under whom the Annual Conference, scheduled for Chicago in June 2020, was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a press release about cancellation of the conference, Brown stated: &quot;ALA&#x27;s priority is the health and safety of the library community, including our members, staff, supporters, vendors and volunteers.&quot;

==Political positions==

The ALA advocates positions on United States political issues that it believes are related to libraries and librarianship. For court cases that touch on issues about which the organization holds positions, the ALA often files amici curiae briefs, voluntarily offering information on some aspect of the case to assist the court in deciding a matter before it. The ALA has a Public Policy and Advocacy office in Washington, D.C., that lobbies Congress on issues relating to libraries, information and communication. It also provides materials to libraries that may include information on how to apply for grants, how to comply with the law, and how to oppose a law.

===Intellectual freedom===

The primary documented expressions of the ALA&#x27;s intellectual freedom principles are the Freedom to Read Statement and the Library Bill of Rights; the Library Bill of Rights urges libraries to &quot;challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment.&quot; The ALA Code of Ethics also calls on librarians to &quot;uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources.&quot;

The ALA maintains an Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF), which is charged with &quot;implementing ALA policies concerning the concept of intellectual freedom,&quot; defined as &quot;the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. It provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question, cause or movement may be explored.&quot; Its goal is &quot;to educate librarians and the general public about the nature and importance of intellectual freedom in libraries.&quot; The OIF compiles lists of challenged books as reported in the media and submitted to them by librarians across the country.

The first director, Judith Krug, headed the office for four decades, until her death in April 2009.

In 1950, the Intellectual Freedom Committee, the forerunner of the OIF, investigated the termination of Ruth W. Brown as librarian of the Bartlesville Public Library, a position she held in the Oklahoma town for 30 years. Brown&#x27;s termination was based on the false allegation that she was a communist and that she had as part of the library&#x27;s serials collection two left wing publications, &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. The ALA support for her and the subsequent legal case was the first such investigation undertaken by the ALA or one of its state chapters.

In 1999, radio personality Laura Schlessinger campaigned publicly against the ALA&#x27;s intellectual freedom policy, specifically in regard to the ALA&#x27;s refusal to remove a link on its web site to a specific sex-education site for teens. Sharon Priestly said, however, that Schlessinger &quot;distorted and misrepresented the ALA stand to make it sound like the ALA was saying porno for &#x27;children&#x27; is O.K.&quot;

In 2002, the ALA filed suit with library users and the ACLU against the United States Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which required libraries receiving federal E-rate discounts for Internet access to install a &quot;technology protection measure&quot; to prevent children from accessing &quot;visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors.&quot; At trial, the federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional. The government appealed this decision, and on June 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the law as constitutional as a condition imposed on institutions in exchange for government funding. In upholding the law, the Supreme Court, adopting the interpretation urged by the U.S. Solicitor General at oral argument, made it clear that the constitutionality of CIPA would be upheld only &quot;if, as the Government represents, a librarian will unblock filtered material or disable the Internet software filter without significant delay on an adult user&#x27;s request.&quot;

===Privacy===

==== 1970s ====
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) attempted to use librarians as possible informants in the conspiracy case of the Harrisburg Seven in 1971. The Harrisburg Seven, a group of religious anti-war activists, were primarily accused of conspiring to kidnap National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger. The supposed leader of the group, Philip Berrigan, was serving time at the Lewisburg penitentiary. The FBI sought &quot;to use library surveillance and librarian informants&quot; at Bucknell University as evidence of the Harrisburg Seven&#x27;s &quot;characters and intentions.&quot; Boyd Douglas became one such informant for the FBI: he was a prisoner at the same penitentiary with a work-release position at the library. Boyd presented himself as an anti-war activist and offered to smuggle letters he collected while at work to Philip Berrigan at the prison.

The FBI also attempted to use Zoia Horn, a librarian at the Bucknell library, and interviewed other library workers. The FBI met with Horn in her home to debrief her, but Horn refused to answer their questions. She refused to testify, even after she was given immunity from self-incrimination. Horn stated, &quot;To me it stands on: Freedom of thought&quot; and for the government to practice &quot;spying in homes, in libraries and universities inhibits and destroys this freedom.&quot; Zoia Horn was charged with contempt of the court and served 20 days in jail. She was &quot;the first librarian who spent time in jail for a value of our profession&quot; according to Judith Krug of the American Library Association&#x27;s Office for Intellectual Freedom. Horn continued to fight for intellectual freedom in libraries and beyond. The Intellectual Freedom Committee of the California Library Association now awards the Zoia Horn Intellectual Freedom Award in honor of those who make contributions to intellectual freedom.

In the 1970s, United States Department of the Treasury agents also pressured public libraries across the country to &quot;release circulation records recording the names and identifying information of people who checked out books on bomb making.&quot; The ALA believed this to be an &quot;unconscionable and unconstitutional invasion of library patrons&#x27; privacy.&quot;

As a result of these two situations and many others, the ALA affirmed the confidential status of all records which held patron names in a &quot;Policy on the Confidentiality of Library Records&quot;. The ALA also released the ALA Statement on Professional Ethics in 1975 which advocated for the protection of the &quot;confidential relationship&quot; between a library user and a library.

==== 1980s ====
The FBI tried to use surveillance in library settings as part of its Library Awareness Program of the 1980s; it aimed to use librarians &quot;as partners in surveillance.&quot; The program was known to the FBI as &quot;The Development of Counterintelligence Among Librarians,&quot; indicating that the FBI believed that librarians might be supportive in its counterintelligence investigations. The FBI attempted to profile &quot;Russian or Slavic-sounding last names&quot; of library patrons to look for possible &quot;national security threats.&quot; The FBI wanted libraries to help it trace &quot;the reading habits of patrons with those names.&quot;

The ALA responded by writing to the FBI director. The Intellectual Freedom Committee also created &quot;an advisory statement to warn libraries&quot; of the Library Awareness Program, including ways to help librarians &quot;avoid breaking their ethical obligations if faced with FBI surveillance.&quot;

==== USA PATRIOT Act ====
In 2003, the ALA passed a resolution opposing the USA PATRIOT Act, which called sections of the law &quot;a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users.&quot; Since then, the ALA and its members have sought to change the law by working with members of Congress and educating their communities and the press about the law&#x27;s potential to violate the privacy rights of library users. ALA has also participated as an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; in lawsuits filed by individuals challenging the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act, including a lawsuit filed by four Connecticut librarians after the library consortium they managed was served with a national security letter seeking information about library users. After several months of litigation, the lawsuit was dismissed when the FBI decided to withdraw the National Security Letter. In 2007, the &quot;Connecticut Four&quot; were honored by the ALA with the Paul Howard Award for Courage for their challenge to the National Security Letter and gag order provision of the USA PATRIOT Act.

In 2006, the ALA sold humorous &quot;radical militant librarian&quot; buttons for librarians to wear in support of the ALA&#x27;s stances on intellectual freedom, privacy, and civil liberties. Inspiration for the button&#x27;s design came from documents obtained from the FBI by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The request revealed a series of e-mails in which FBI agents complained about the &quot;radical, militant librarians&quot; while criticizing the reluctance of FBI management to use the secret warrants authorized under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.

===Renaming of Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal===
In 2018, the organization changed the name of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal to the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the name change was made &quot;in order to distance the honor&quot; from what the ALA described as &quot;culturally insensitive portrayals&quot; in Wilder&#x27;s books.
===Copyright===
The ALA &quot;supports efforts to amend the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and urges the courts to restore the balance in copyright law, ensure fair use and protect and extend the public domain.&quot; It supports changing copyright law to eliminate damages when using orphan works without permission; is wary of digital rights management; and, in &quot;ALA v. FCC,&quot; successfully sued the Federal Communications Commission to prevent regulation that would enforce next-generation digital televisions to contain rights-management hardware. It has joined the Information Access Alliance to promote open access to research. The Copyright Advisory Network of the association&#x27;s Office for Information Technology Policy provides copyright resources to libraries and the communities they serve. The ALA is a member of the Library Copyright Alliance, along with the Association of Research Libraries and the Association of College and Research Libraries, which provides a unified voice for over 300,000 information professionals in the United States.
Currently, the ALA supports bill H.R. 905, also known as the You Own Devices Act, stating &quot;to foster the social and commercial evolution of the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; by codifying the right of the owner of a device containing &#x27;essential software&#x27; intrinsic to its function to transfer [e.g. sell or lease] both the device and the software.&quot;

==Accredited programs in library and information studies==
ALA-accredited programs can be found at schools in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada. These programs offer degrees with names such as Master of Library Science, Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, and Master of Science. To be accredited, the program must undergo an external review and meet the Standards for Accreditation of Master&#x27;s Programs in Library and Information Studies.

<text>Fabriano is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of Ancona province in the Italian region of the Marche, at above sea level. It lies in the Esino valley upstream and southwest of Jesi; and east-northeast of Fossato di Vico and east of Gubbio (both in Umbria). Its location on the main highway and rail line from Umbria to the Adriatic make it a mid-sized regional center in the Apennines. Fabriano is the headquarters of the giant appliance maker Indesit (partly owned by Whirlpool).

Fabriano, with Roma, Parma, Torino and Carrara, is an Italian creative city (UNESCO). The town is in the category &quot;Folk Arts&quot; (for the Fabriano&#x27;s handmade paper production).

==History==

Fabriano appears to have been founded in the early Middle Ages by the inhabitants of a small Roman town south at Attiggio (Latin &quot;Attidium&quot;), of which some slight remains and inscriptions are extant. In 1276, Fabriano became one of the earliest places in Europe to produce paper. Since the 13th century and even today, the town has a reputation for fine watermarked paper. This led to Fabriano&#x27;s prosperity in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and was also one of the factors that led to the establishment of nearby Foligno in Umbria as one of the earliest printing centers in Italy in the 15th century, from 1470 onwards.

==Geography==
The municipality borders with Cerreto d&#x27;Esi, Costacciaro (PG), Esanatoglia (MC), Fiuminata (MC), Fossato di Vico (PG), Genga, Gualdo Tadino (PG), Matelica (MC), Nocera Umbra (PG), Poggio San Vicino (MC), Sassoferrato, Serra San Quirico and Sigillo (PG).

<doc id="491696" wikidata="Q4338318" url="?curid=491696" title="Awareness">
<text>Awareness, in philosophy and psychology, is the perception or knowledge of something. The concept is often synonymous with consciousness. However, one can be aware of something without being explicitly conscious of it, such as in the case of blindsight.

The states of awareness are also associated with the states of experience so that the structure represented in awareness is mirrored in the structure of experience.

==Concept==
Awareness is a relative concept. It may refer to an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception. It is analogous to sensing something, a process distinguished from observing and perceiving (which involves a basic process of acquainting with the items we perceive). Awareness can be described as something that occurs when the brain is activated in certain ways, such as when the color red is seen once the retina is stimulated by light waves. This conceptualization is posited due to the difficulty in developing an analytic definition of awareness or sensory awareness.

Awareness is also associated with consciousness in the sense that it denotes a fundamental experience such as a feeling or intuition that accompanies the experience of phenomena. Specifically, this is referred to as awareness of experience.

Mocenni C. and Bizzarri F. wrote: &quot;The awareness literature can be organized around three core concepts: &quot;cognitive awareness,&quot; which corresponds to the accurate and deep individual&#x27;s understanding of one&#x27;s perception and thinking.&quot;(sic)&quot; The second perspective argues that awareness is &quot;multilevel&quot; considering both conscious and unconscious, with an end-stage of awareness... The third considers awareness concerning the recognition of the &quot;feelings of others&quot;.&quot;

==Peripheral awareness==
Peripheral awareness refers to the human ability to process information regarding all five senses at the periphery of attention, such as acknowledging the distant sounds of people outside while sitting indoors and concentrating on a specific task, such as reading. Peripheral vision is defined as the perception of visual stimuli at or near the edge of the field of vision.

This type of awareness allows one to be prepared to respond to unexpected events. For example, when walking down a busy street while talking to a friend, peripheral awareness will allow for alertness to potential hazards such as cars or pedestrians coming into proximity that may not have been noticed otherwise.

Studies have shown having peripheral awareness enhances overall cognition. By improving peripheral awareness, overall quality of life and productivity will subsequently be improved.

==Self-awareness==

Popular ideas about consciousness suggest the phenomenon describes self-awareness, the condition of being aware of oneself. Modern systems theory, which offers insights into how the world works through an understanding that all systems follow system rules, approaches self-awareness within its understanding of how large complex living systems work. According to Gregory Bateson, the mind is the dynamics of self-organization and awareness is crucial in this process. Modern systems theory maintains that humans, as living systems, not only have awareness of their environment but also self-awareness particularly with their capability for logic and curiosity.

Efforts to describe consciousness in neurological terms have focused on describing networks in the brain that develop awareness of the qualia developed by other networks. As awareness provides the materials from which one develops subjective ideas about their experience, it is said that one is aware of one&#x27;s own awareness state. This organization of awareness of one&#x27;s own inner experience is given a central role in self-regulation.

==Neuroscience==
Neural systems that regulate attention serve to attenuate awareness among complex animals whose central and peripheral nervous systems provide more information than cognitive areas of the brain can assimilate. Within an attenuated system of awareness, a mind might be aware of much more than is being contemplated in a focused extended consciousness.

===Basic awareness===
Basic awareness of one&#x27;s internal and external world depends on the brain stem. Bjorn Merker, an independent neuroscientist in Stockholm, Sweden, argues that the brain stem supports an elementary form of conscious thought in infants with hydranencephaly. &quot;Higher&quot; forms of awareness, including self-awareness, require cortical contributions, but &quot;primary consciousness&quot; or &quot;basic awareness&quot; as an ability to integrate sensations from the environment with one&#x27;s immediate goals and feelings in order to guide behavior springs from the brain stem which human beings share with most vertebrates. Psychologist Carroll Izard emphasizes that this form of primary consciousness consists of the capacity to generate emotions and awareness of one&#x27;s surroundings, but not an ability to talk about what one has experienced. In the same way, people can become conscious of a feeling that they cannot label or describe, a phenomenon that is especially common in pre-verbal infants.

Due to this discovery, medical definitions of brain death as a lack of cortical activity face a serious challenge.

===Basic interests===
Throughout the brain stem, there are interconnected regions that regulate eye movement that are also involved in organizing information about what to do next, such as reaching for a piece of food or pursuing a potential mate.

===Changes in awareness===
The ability to consciously detect an image when presented at near-threshold stimulus varies across presentations. One factor is &quot;baseline shifts&quot;, due to top down attention that modulates ongoing brain activity in sensory cortex areas that affects the neural processing of subsequent perceptual judgments. Such top down biasing can occur through two distinct processes: an attention driven baseline shift in the alpha waves, and a decision bias reflected in gamma waves.

==Living systems view==
Outside of the field of neuroscience, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela contributed their Santiago theory of cognition in which they wrote:
This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at organic levels that people do not usually consider to be aware. Given the possible relationship between awareness and cognition, and consciousness, this theory contributes an interesting perspective in the philosophical and scientific dialogue of awareness and living systems theory.

==Communications and information systems==

In cooperative settings, awareness is a term used to denote &quot;knowledge created through the interaction of an agent and its environment — in simple terms &#x27;knowing what is going on&#x27;&quot;. In this setting, awareness is meant to convey how individuals monitor and perceive the information surrounding their colleagues and the environment they are in. This information is incredibly useful and critical to the performance and success of collaborations. Awareness can be further defined by breaking it down into a set of characteristics:
* Knowledge about the state of some environment
* Environments are continually changing, therefore awareness knowledge must be constantly maintained 
* Individuals interact with the environment, and maintenance of awareness is accomplished through this interaction. 
* Generally part of some other activity, making it a secondary goal to the primary goal of the activity.

Different categories of awareness have been suggested based on the type of information being obtained or maintained:
* Informal awareness – the sense of who&#x27;s around and what are they up to; information you might know from being collocated with an individual
* Social awareness – the information you maintain about a social or conversational context. This is a subtle awareness maintained through non-verbal cues, such as eye contact, facial express, etc.
* Group-structural awareness – the knowledge of others roles, responsibilities, and status in a group. It is an understanding of group dynamics and the relationship another individual has to the group.
* Workspace awareness – awareness with a focus on the workspace&#x27;s influence and mediation of awareness information, particularly the location, activity, and changes of elements within the workspace.

These categories are not mutually exclusive, as there can be significant overlap in what a particular type of awareness might be considered. Rather, these categories serve to help understand what knowledge might be conveyed by a particular type of awareness or how that knowledge might be conveyed. Workspace awareness is of particular interest to the CSCW community, due to the transition of workspaces from physical to virtual environments.

While the type of awareness above refers to knowledge a &quot;person&quot; might need in a particular situation, &quot;context awareness&quot; and &quot;location awareness&quot; refer to information a &quot;computer system&quot; might need in a particular situation. These concepts of large importance especially for AAA (authentication, authorization, accounting) applications.

The term of location awareness still is gaining momentum with the growth of ubiquitous computing. First defined by networked work positions (network location awareness), it has been extended to mobile phones and other mobile communicable entities. The term covers a common interest in whereabouts of remote entities, especially individuals and their cohesion in operation. The term of context awareness is a superset including the concept of location awareness. It extends the awareness to context features of an operational target as well as to the context of an operational area.

==Covert awareness== 

Covert awareness is the knowledge of something without knowing it. The word covert means not openly shown, engaged in. Some patients with specific brain damage are, for example unable to tell if a pencil is horizontal or vertical. Patients who are clinically in a vegetative state (show no awareness of their surroundings) are found to have no awareness but they are able to sometimes detect covert awareness with neuro imaging (fMRI). The presence of awareness is clinically measured by the ability to follow commands -either verbally, or behaviorally. Awareness was detected by asking participants to imagine hitting a tennis ball and to imagine walking from room to room in their house while in the scanner. Using this technique, a patient who fulfilled all of the clinical criteria for the vegetative state was shown to be covertly aware and able to willfully respond to commands by looking at their brain activity.

==Awareness versus attention==
Some scientists have proposed that awareness is closely related and in some ways synonymous with attention while others have argued that they are different. There is evidence to demonstrate that awareness and attention have distinct neural correlates, though the majority of research analyses the attention, awareness, and perception of only visual stimuli.

<text>Ponhea Yat (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ; c. 1390 – 1463), also known as Borom Reachea II (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ), was the last king of the Khmer Empire and the first Khmer king of the post-Angkor period.

Ponhea Yat complained to the Yongle Emperor in 1408 and 1414 of raids by the Champa King Indravarman VI. He dispatched Kun Si-li Ren-nong-la to visit China.

He was forced to flee Yasodharapura in 1431 as it was indefensible against attack by the Siamese, resettling first in Basan (Srey Santhor), but after it became flooded, fled to Chaktomuk (now part of Phnom Penh).

In Phnom Penh, the king ordered the land to be built up to protect it from flooding, and a palace to be built. During his reign he also ordered the construction of six Buddhist monasteries around the city, and his remains are housed in a stupa behind the Wat Phnom.

King Ponhea Yat was succeeded on his death by his first son Noreay Reachea, who reigned until 1469 and who was succeeded in turn by Ponhea Yat&#x27;s second son, Srey Reachea.

<text>Terence Cooper (5 July 1933 – 16 September 1997) was a British film actor, best known for his roles in Australian and New Zealand television and film.

==Biography==

Born in 1933 at Carnmoney, a district of the modern-day borough of Newtownabbey in Northern Ireland, he became a stage actor and appeared in ITC British television series such as &quot;The Buccaneers&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of William Tell&quot;.

Cooper is most famous for appearing in the 1967 film, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, a James Bond satire based on Ian Fleming&#x27;s first Bond novel of the same name. Producer Charles K. Feldman kept him on a contract for two years before the film was made. He also claimed to be a candidate for the role of Bond in a Kevin McClory version of the movie series that predated Eon Productions series.

In New Zealand he starred in many New Zealand TV series such as &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1977), an episode of Ngaio Marsh Theatre (1977), &quot;Gather Your Dreams&quot; (1978), &quot;Children of Fire Mountain&quot; (1979), &quot;Jack Holborn&quot; (1982) and &quot;Mortimer&#x27;s Patch&quot; (1982). He played the part of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s bombastic character &#x27;Professor George Edward Challenger&#x27; in a 1982 New Zealand radio dramatisation of Doyle&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost World&quot; (produced by Peggy Wells and Barry Campbell).

In Australia, he appeared in guest roles in local drama series including &quot;Homicide&quot;, &quot;Division 4&quot;, &quot;Matlock Police&quot;, and &quot;Rafferty&#x27;s Rules&quot;, with a regular role as Inspector Leo Vincetti in &quot;Bony&quot; (1992).

He was also famed as a water colour artist. He retired in Far North Queensland, Australia where he painted a collection of water colours depicting Australian tropical rain forests and birdlife.

Perhaps one of Cooper&#x27;s lesser known achievements was his 1982 publication, &quot;Trouper Cooper&#x27;s Curry Cookbook&quot; (William Collins Publishers, Auckland 1982). At the time, Cooper ran a successful Curry restaurant in Auckland, New Zealand, &quot;Trouper Cooper&#x27;s Curry House&quot;. He also wrote &quot;The Parnell Cookbook&quot;,

<doc id="491709" wikidata="Q314362" url="?curid=491709" title="Bartolomé Mitre">
<text>Bartolomé Mitre Martínez (26 June 1821 – 19 January 1906) was an Argentine statesman, soldier and author. He was President of Argentina from 1862 to 1868 and the first president of unified Argentina.

Mitre is known as a versatile statesman, military man, politician, journalist, historian, writer and poet. He was a major figure in the history of Argentina during the second half of the 19th century.

He was the figure that best characterized liberalism in Argentina, but he was a moderate and flexible liberal, not dogmatic.

==Early life==
Mitre was born on 26 June 1821 in Buenos Aires. His father was of Greek descent and the family name was originally Mitropoulos.

In 1831, his family settled in Uruguay. He became a soldier, and graduated in 1839 from the Military School of Montevideo, with the rank of second lieutenant of artillery. Also a journalist, his writings supported Fructuoso Rivera, who, in 1846, made him a lieutenant colonel in the Uruguayan Army.

Later he joined the Colorado Party in the civil wars against the Blancos, in the Banda Oriental (Uruguay). This closeness with the Colorados led him to support the &quot;unitario&quot; faction of Argentina, which simultaneously fought against the &quot;Rosista&quot; regime in Buenos Aires, ally of the Uruguayan Blancos.

His first poems and journalistic publications in the Uruguayan media date from that time.

He then moved to Bolivia, and later to Chile, where he met fellow Argentine exile Juan Bautista Alberdi. Both wrote for the Valparaíso newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot;. Later, he wrote in &quot;El Progreso&quot;, in Santiago, under the direction of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.

==End of exile and return to Argentina==
Mitre returned to Argentina after the defeat of longtime caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas at the 1852 Battle of Caseros. He was a leader of the revolt of Buenos Aires Province against Justo José de Urquiza&#x27;s federal system in the Revolution of 11 September 1852, and was appointed to important posts in the provincial government after the Province seceded from the Confederation.

==President of Argentina==
The civil war of 1859, after the revolt of Buenos Aires against Justo José de Urquiza&#x27;s federal system, resulted in Mitre&#x27;s defeat by Urquiza at the Battle of Cepeda, in 1860. Issues of customs revenue sharing were settled, and Buenos Aires reentered the Argentine Confederation. Victorious at the 1861 Battle of Pavón, however, Mitre obtained important concessions from the national army, notably the amendment of the Constitution to provide for indirect elections through an electoral college. In October 1862, Mitre was elected president of the republic, and national political unity was finally achieved; a period of internal progress and reform then commenced. During the Paraguayan War, Mitre was initially named the head of the allied forces.

Mitre was also the founder of &quot;La Nación&quot;, one of South America&#x27;s leading newspapers, in 1870. His opposition to Autonomist Party nominee Adolfo Alsina, whom he viewed as a veiled Buenos Aires separatist, led Mitre to run for the presidency again, though the seasoned Alsina outmaneuvered him by fielding Nicolás Avellaneda, a moderate lawyer from remote Tucuman Province where the independence of Argentina had been declared in 1816. The electoral college met on 12 April 1874, and awarded Mitre only three provinces, including Buenos Aires.
Mitre took up arms again. Hoping to prevent Avellaneda&#x27;s 12 October inauguration, he hijacked a gunboat; he was defeated, however, and only President Avellaneda&#x27;s commutation spared his life. Following the 1890 Revolution of the Park, he broke with the conservative National Autonomist Party (PAN) and co-founded the Civic Union with reformist Leandro Alem. Mitre&#x27;s desire to maintain an understanding with the ruling PAN led to the Civic Union&#x27;s schism in 1891, upon which Mitre founded the National Civic Union, and Alem, the Radical Civic Union (the oldest existing party in Argentina).

He dedicated much of his time in later years to writing. According to some of his critics, as a historian Mitre made questionable judgments, often ignoring key documents and events on purpose in his writings. This caused his student Adolfo Saldías to distance himself from him, and for future revisionist historians such as José María Rosa to question the validity of his work altogether. He also wrote poetry and fiction (Soledad: novela original), and translated Dante&#x27;s &quot;La divina commedia&quot; (&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;) into Spanish. He was the grandfather of the poet Margarita Abella Caprile. Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.

==Death and legacy==
Bartolomé Mitre died in 1906, affected by a gastrointestinal illness. The charismatic leader was mourned by a crowd rarely seen until then, who accompanied the funeral procession from his home to La Recoleta Cemetery.

Bartolomé Mitre was the paradigm of the Argentine statesman of the 19th century. Mitre thematically returns to the ideals of May Revolution and lists the principles of the Freedom Party, the first Argentine party that consciously launches itself into political struggle with a liberal program. The program of the Freedom Party is the faithful synthesis of the democratic progressivism that Esteban Echeverría longed for to overcome the sterile antagonism of unitarians and federalists.

As an intellectual, he wrote poetry, theater, countless newspaper articles, cemented historical science with his exemplary biographies, translated classic works, and authored fiery harangues. Mitre was a leading figure in politics and culture until his death in 1906.

Mitre supported the establishment of universal direct suffrage, which was ultimately established in 1912, during the presidency of Roque Sáenz Peña.

When he assumed the presidency in 1862, the conditions in which the republic was found were precarious. The treasury was exhausted, the debts were large, the three national powers needed to be organized, buildings to house them separately from the provincial authorities had to be established, the question of the residence of the national authorities in the city of Buenos Aires had to be solved, the army and updated salaries had to be established, the minimum structures of the national public administration were created, and the basic program of their generation was promoted: education, immigration, foreign investment, railways, and land occupation. An appreciation of Mitre&#x27;s government work that ignores his point of origin will not do him enough justice.

Referring to Mitre&#x27;s financial rectitude, the explorer Sir Richard Burton wrote: 

Wrote Robert Avrett: 

==Bibliography==
Mitre ranks as an important South-American historiographer. He wrote the best accounts of South America&#x27;s wars of independence and published many works, amongst which are:
* &quot;Historia de Belgrano y de la independencia argentina&quot; [&quot;History of Belgrano and of the argentine independence&quot;] (1857; fifth edition, four volumes, 1902)
* &quot;Historia de San Martín y de la emancipación sudamericana&quot; [&quot;History of San Martín&quot;] (1869; third edition, six volumes, 1907) 
* &quot;Rimas&quot; [&quot;Rimes&quot;] (new edition, 1890) 
* &quot;Ulrich Schmidl, primer historiador del Rio de la Plata&quot; [&quot;Ulrich Schmidl, first historian of the Rio de la Plata&quot;] (1890)

There is an abridged translation of the &quot;Historia de San Martín&quot;, entitled &quot;The Emancipation of South America&quot; (London, 1893) by W. Pilling. Mitre&#x27;s speeches were collected as &quot;Arengas&quot; (third edition, three volumes, 1902).

<text>Gerardus &quot;Gerard&quot; &#x27;t Hooft (; born July 5, 1946) is a Dutch theoretical physicist and professor at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. He shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics with his thesis advisor Martinus J. G. Veltman &quot;for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions&quot;.

His work concentrates on gauge theory, black holes, quantum gravity and fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. His contributions to physics include a proof that gauge theories are renormalizable, dimensional regularization and the holographic principle.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Gerard &#x27;t Hooft was born in Den Helder on July 5, 1946, but grew up in The Hague. He was the middle child of a family of three. He comes from a family of scholars. His great uncle was Nobel prize laureate Frits Zernike, and his grandmother was married to Pieter Nicolaas van Kampen, a professor of zoology at Leiden University. His uncle Nico van Kampen was an (emeritus) professor of theoretical physics at Utrecht University, and his mother married a maritime engineer. Following his family&#x27;s footsteps, he showed interest in science at an early age. When his primary school teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he replied, &quot;a man who knows everything.&quot;

After primary school Gerard attended the Dalton Lyceum, a school that applied the ideas of the Dalton Plan, an educational method that suited him well. He excelled at science and mathematics courses. At the age of sixteen he won a silver medal in the second Dutch Math Olympiad.

=== Education ===
After Gerard &#x27;t Hooft passed his high school exams in 1964, he enrolled in the physics program at Utrecht University. He opted for Utrecht instead of the much closer Leiden, because his uncle was a professor there and he wanted to attend his lectures. Because he was so focused on science, his father insisted that he join the Utrechtsch Studenten Corps, a student association, in the hope that he would do something else besides studying. This worked to some extent; during his studies he was a coxswain with their rowing club &quot;Triton&quot; and organized a national congress for science students with their science discussion club &quot;Christiaan Huygens&quot;.

In the course of his studies he decided he wanted to go into what he perceived as the heart of theoretical physics, elementary particles. His uncle had grown to dislike the subject and in particular its practitioners, so when it became time to write his &quot;doctoraalscriptie&quot; (former name of the Dutch equivalent of a master&#x27;s thesis) in 1968, &#x27;t Hooft turned to the newly appointed professor Martinus Veltman, who specialized in Yang–Mills theory, a relatively fringe subject at the time because it was thought that these could not be renormalized. His assignment was to study the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly, a mismatch in the theory of the decay of neutral pions; formal arguments forbid the decay into photons, whereas practical calculations and experiments showed that this was the primary form of decay. The resolution of the problem was completely unknown at the time, and &#x27;t Hooft was unable to provide one.

In 1969, &#x27;t Hooft started on his doctoral research with Martinus Veltman as his advisor. He would work on the same subject Veltman was working on, the renormalization of Yang–Mills theories. In 1971 his first paper was published. In it he showed how to renormalize massless Yang–Mills fields, and was able to derive relations between amplitudes, which would be generalized by Andrei Slavnov and John C. Taylor, and become known as the Slavnov–Taylor identities.

The world took little notice, but Veltman was excited because he saw that the problem he had been working on was solved. A period of intense collaboration followed in which they developed the technique of dimensional regularization. Soon &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s second paper was ready to be published, in which he showed that Yang–Mills theories with massive fields due to spontaneous symmetry breaking could be renormalized. This paper earned them worldwide recognition, and would ultimately earn the pair the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics.

These two papers formed the basis of &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s dissertation, &quot;The Renormalization procedure for Yang–Mills Fields&quot;, and he obtained his PhD degree in 1972. In the same year he married his wife, Albertha A. Schik, a student of medicine in Utrecht.

=== Career ===

After obtaining his doctorate &#x27;t Hooft went to CERN in Geneva, where he had a fellowship. He further refined his methods for Yang–Mills theories with Veltman (who went back to Geneva). In this time he became interested in the possibility that the strong interaction could be described as a massless Yang–Mills theory, i.e. one of a type that he had just proved to be renormalizable and hence be susceptible to detailed calculation and comparison with experiment.

According to &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s calculations, this type of theory possessed just the right kind of scaling properties (asymptotic freedom) that this theory should have according to deep inelastic scattering experiments. This was contrary to popular perception of Yang–Mills theories at the time, that like gravitation and electrodynamics, their intensity should decrease with increasing distance between the interacting particles; such conventional behaviour with distance was unable to explain the results of deep inelastic scattering, whereas &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s calculations could.

When &#x27;t Hooft mentioned his results at a small conference at Marseilles in 1972, Kurt Symanzik urged him to publish this result; but &#x27;t Hooft did not, and the result was eventually rediscovered and published by Hugh David Politzer, David Gross, and Frank Wilczek in 1973, which led to their earning the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In 1974, &#x27;t Hooft returned to Utrecht where he became assistant professor. In 1976, he was invited for a guest position at Stanford and a position at Harvard as Morris Loeb lecturer. His eldest daughter, Saskia Anne, was born in Boston, while his second daughter, Ellen Marga, was born in 1978 after he returned to Utrecht, where he was made full professor. In the academic year 1987–1988 &#x27;t Hooft spent a sabbatical in the Boston University Physics Department along with Howard Georgi, Robert Jaffe and others arranged by the then new Department chair Lawrence Sulak.

In 2007 &#x27;t Hooft became editor-in-chief for &quot;Foundations of Physics&quot;, where he sought to distance the journal from the controversy of ECE theory. &#x27;t Hooft held the position until 2016.

On July 1, 2011 he was appointed Distinguished professor by Utrecht University.

=== Personal life ===
He is married to Albertha Schik (Betteke) and has two daughters.

== Honors ==
In 1999 &#x27;t Hooft shared the Nobel prize in Physics with his thesis adviser Veltman for &quot;elucidating the quantum structure of the electroweak interactions in physics&quot;. Before that time his work had already been recognized by other notable awards. In 1981, he was awarded the Wolf Prize, possibly the most prestigious prize in physics after the Nobel prize. Five years later he received the Lorentz Medal, awarded every four years in recognition of the most important contributions in theoretical physics. In 1995, he was one of the first recipients of the Spinozapremie, the highest award available to scientists in the Netherlands. In the same year he was also honoured with a Franklin Medal. In 2000, &#x27;t Hooft received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Since his Nobel Prize, &#x27;t Hooft has received a slew of awards, honorary doctorates and honorary professorships. He was knighted commander in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and officer in the French Legion of Honor. The asteroid 9491 Thooft has been named in his honor, and he has written a constitution for its future inhabitants.

He is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) since 1982, where he was made academy professor in 2003. He is also a foreign member of many other science academies, including the French Académie des Sciences, the American National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Britain and Ireland based Institute of Physics.

&#x27;t Hooft has appeared in season 3 of &quot;Through the Wormhole&quot; with Morgan Freeman.

== Research ==
&#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s research interest can be divided in three main directions: &#x27;gauge theories in elementary particle physics&#x27;, &#x27;quantum gravity and black holes&#x27;, and &#x27;foundational aspects of quantum mechanics&#x27;.

=== Gauge theories in elementary particle physics ===
&#x27;t Hooft is most famous for his contributions to the development of gauge theories in particle physics. The best known of these is the proof in his PhD thesis that Yang–Mills theories are renormalizable, for which he shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics. For this proof he introduced (with his adviser Veltman) the technique of dimensional regularization.

After his PhD, he became interested in the role of gauge theories in the strong interaction, the leading theory of which is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD. Much of his research focused on the problem of color confinement in QCD, i.e. the observational fact that only color neutral particles are observed at low energies. This led him to the discovery that SU(N) gauge theories simplify in the large &quot;N&quot; limit, a fact which has proved important in the examination of the conjectured correspondence between string theories in an Anti-de Sitter space and conformal field theories in one lower dimension. By solving the theory in one space and one time dimension, &#x27;t Hooft was able to derive a formula for the masses of mesons.

He also studied the role of so-called instanton contributions in QCD. His calculation showed that these contributions lead to an interaction between light quarks at low energies not present in the normal theory. Studying instanton solutions of Yang–Mills theories, &#x27;t Hooft discovered that spontaneously breaking a theory with SU(N) symmetry to a U(1) symmetry will lead to the existence of magnetic monopoles. These monopoles are called &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopoles, after Alexander Polyakov, who independently obtained the same result.

As another piece in the color confinement puzzle &#x27;t Hooft introduced &#x27;t Hooft loops, which are the magnetic dual of Wilson loops. Using these operators he was able to classify different phases of QCD, which form the basis of the QCD phase diagram.

In 1986, he was finally able to show that instanton contributions solve the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly, the topic of his master&#x27;s thesis.

=== Quantum gravity and black holes ===

When Veltman and &#x27;t Hooft moved to CERN after &#x27;t Hooft obtained his PhD, Veltman&#x27;s attention was drawn to the possibility of using their dimensional regularization techniques to the problem of quantizing gravity. Although it was known that perturbative quantum gravity was not completely renormalizible, they felt important lessons were to be learned by studying the formal renormalization of the theory order by order. This work would be continued by Stanley Deser and another PhD student of Veltman, Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, who later found patterns in the renormalization counter terms, which led to the discovery of supergravity.

In the 1980s, &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s attention was drawn to the subject of gravity in 3 spacetime dimensions. Together with Deser and Jackiw he published an article in 1984 describing the dynamics of flat space where the only local degrees of freedom were propagating point defects. His attention returned to this model at various points in time, showing that Gott pairs would not cause causality violating timelike loops, and showing how the model could be quantized. More recently he proposed generalizing this piecewise flat model of gravity to 4 spacetime dimensions.

With Stephen Hawking&#x27;s discovery of Hawking radiation of black holes, it appeared that the evaporation of these objects violated a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, unitarity. &#x27;t Hooft refused to accept this problem, known as the black hole information paradox, and assumed that this must be the result of the semi-classical treatment of Hawking, and that it should not appear in a full theory of quantum gravity. He proposed that it might be possible to study some of the properties of such a theory, by assuming that such a theory was unitary.

Using this approach he has argued that near a black hole, quantum fields could be described by a theory in a lower dimension. This led to the introduction of the holographic principle by him and Leonard Susskind.

=== Fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics ===
&#x27;t Hooft has &quot;deviating views on the physical interpretation of quantum theory&quot;. He believes that there could be a deterministic explanation underlying quantum mechanics. Using a speculative model he has argued that such a theory could avoid the usual Bell inequality arguments that would disallow such a local hidden-variable theory. In 2016 he published a book length exposition of his ideas which, according to &#x27;t Hooft, has encountered mixed reactions.

<text>BSE Limited, also known as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), is an Indian stock exchange with highest number of companies (5,246 (as of 8th February 2022)) which is located on Dalal Street. Established with the efforts of cotton merchant Premchand Roychand in 1875, it is the oldest stock exchange in Asia, and also the tenth oldest in the world. The BSE is the world&#x27;s 6th largest stock exchange with a market capitalization exceeding US$5 trillion on May 21, 2024.

==History==
Bombay Stock Exchange was founded by Premchand Roychand in 1875. While BSE Limited is now synonymous with Dalal Street, it was not always so. In the 1850s, four Gujarati and one Parsi stockbroker gathered together under a Banyan tree in front of Bombay (now Mumbai) Town Hall, where Horniman Circle is now situated. A decade later, the brokers moved their location to under the banyan trees at the junction of Meadows Street and what was then called Esplanade Road, now Mahatma Gandhi Road. With a rapid increase in the number of brokers, they had to shift places repeatedly. At last, in 1874, the brokers found a permanent location, the one that they could call their own. The brokers group became an official organization known as &quot;The Native Share &amp; Stock Brokers Association&quot; in 1875.

On 12 March 1993, a car bomb exploded in the basement of the building during the 1993 Bombay bombings.

<doc id="491717" wikidata="Q1049705" url="?curid=491717" title="Sailor Uranus">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; media franchise. Sailor Uranus&#x27; alternate identity is , a teenage Japanese student and race car driver. Haruka is a member of the Sailor Guardians, female supernatural fighters who protect the Solar System from evil.

Sailor Uranus fights alongside her partner and lover Sailor Neptune. Sailor Uranus possesses powers associated with the wind and sky, precognition, as well as sword combat.

==Profile==
Haruka is a stubborn, protective individual, as well as strong-willed, capable, charming, and occasionally even daring. She is formally introduced in the third story arc, although she appears in silhouette alongside Sailor Neptune in the final episode of &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot;. She is the tallest of the Sailor Guardians at 5&#x27;11&quot;, followed by Sailor Pluto at 5&#x27;10&quot;.

Haruka is a racecar driver, even though she is barely sixteen years old at her first appearance. However, the timing of her birthday to the Japanese school year means she is one grade ahead of the Sailor Guardians.

Haruka loves to tease pretty girls. In the manga, she even kisses Usagi. Throughout the manga, she lightly flirts with Usagi, either out of habit in her first appearance or just for fun, and eventually Usagi flirts back. Their relationship in the anime is different, as Haruka also refers to Usagi as &quot;Odango&quot;, or dumpling, in the same way Tuxedo Mask does—as a playful nickname. By the time she returns in &quot;Sailor Stars&quot;, however, she begins to refer to Usagi as &quot;Kitten&quot;.

Although her relationship with Michiru Kaioh, or Sailor Neptune, is not implicitly sexual until later in the series, their romantic situation is referred to early on and generally understood by most of the metaseries&#x27; characters fairly quickly. It is sometimes a source of good-natured humor, particularly because few of the other Guardians have serious romantic prospects in comparison and because the otherwise bold Haruka finds it impolite to discuss romantic matters in public. In the anime, however, the physical aspects of their relationship are limited to handholding, flirting, and sometimes even humorous implications, but generally remains circumspect.

She complicates the perception of her gender by appearing as a &quot;Tuxedo Mask&quot; instead of a Sailor Guardian in her first appearance. This form is never mentioned again. In her civilian form, she also wears the male Mugen Academy uniform. In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, the most recent anime version for the franchise, Sailor Neptune remarks that Sailor Uranus is both male and female. As for pronouns, the characters often refer to Haruka as &quot;her&quot; in the English translation however, after Hotaru reawakens as Sailor Saturn in Episode 2 of &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal&quot; she refers to Haruka as ‘Daddy Haruka’.

Besides her relationship with Michiru, Haruka is also close friends with Setsuna Meioh, because the three of them work closely together. Following the destruction of the Death Busters and the rebirth of Sailor Saturn as an infant, they vow to be her family and care for her. Later story arcs show that the four live together happily for some time. Nothing about Haruka&#x27;s family life is ever discussed, although she and Michiru appear noticeably wealthy by unknown means. In the manga, Haruka says that she and Michiru have &quot;wealthy patrons&quot;.

The anime and manga versions of the character are reasonably interchangeable, although her standoffishness is more pronounced in the anime. Like Michiru, Haruka is sometimes considered an antihero.

In the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; musicals (Seramyu), Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s relationship remains largely unchanged; they are always shown together, which is consistent with both manga and anime, and while their romance in the musicals is usually kept low-key, the actresses for the two do kiss on stage in the omake of &quot;Kaguya Shima Densetsu Kaiteiban&quot;. They are also the only two Guardians to engage in physical combat with Sailor Galaxia. The other Guardians only use their powers to combat her. As in the anime, however, neither Uranus or Neptune are capable of harming Galaxia in combat. It is seen that Uranus has the ability to sense Neptune&#x27;s death when Galaxia gravely injures Neptune, who had been weakened while protecting Sailor Mars. Otherwise, the two are shown to be more willing to work as a team with the other Sailor Guardians in the musicals than in the anime, except where plot-lines are directly drawn from the anime, such as their pretended betrayal of the other Guardians in &quot;Sailor Stars&quot;.

Haruka&#x27;s ambition prior to becoming a Sailor Guardian was to be a professional racer. Thereafter, driving is still a well-loved hobby and is listed in the manga as her best skill. She is also an accomplished runner, belonging to the track and field club at school. On occasion, Haruka can be seen playing piano in accompaniment during Michiru&#x27;s violin performances. While physical education is her best class, modern Japanese language is her worst. Haruka is highly private, able to tease others while becoming flustered if teased herself, and has difficulty with confessions. Her favorite food is salad and her least favorite is nattō (fermented soybeans); she also likes the color gold. According to Michiru, Haruka has had trouble with popular men on more than one occasion. Haruka denies this, but it clearly annoys her.

Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna appear in &quot;Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie&quot;, although this conflicts with the general timeline of the series in several ways. Notably, they are more overtly friendly and helpful than they had been when they last met, and Sailor Pluto is present (which conflicts with certain events in the third series).

==Aspects and forms==
As a character with different incarnations, special powers, transformations, and a long lifetime that spans the Silver Millennium era to the 30th century, Haruka gains multiple aspects and aliases as the series progresses.

===Sailor Uranus===
Haruka&#x27;s Guardian identity. She wears a uniform colored in navy and yellow. Unlike most of the other Guardians, her gloves extend only to mid-forearm. In transformed state, she wears two golden hoop earrings. She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Guardian of Sky (or &quot;the Skies&quot; in the English manga) and Guardian of Flight. She is known to run as fast as the wind, and can forecast bad things from the sky. Perhaps her titles regarding the sky is in reference to the Greco-Roman Uranus, who was the embodiment of the sky. Sailor Uranus is one of the more aggressive, and yet also intelligent, Sailor Guardians, and carries the Space Sword, which is one of three Talisman carried by herself, Sailor Neptune, and Sailor Pluto. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, although certain powers are unavailable to her in that form. Sailor Neptune is her constant companion, and they are rarely separated.

As she grows stronger, Sailor Uranus gains additional powers, and at key points her uniform changes to reflect this. The first change takes place in Act 44 of the manga, when she obtains the Uranus Crystal and her outfit becomes similar to that of Super Sailor Moon. She is not given a new title. A similar event takes place in Episode 167 of the anime, and she is given the name Super Sailor Uranus. A third form appears in Act 49 of the manga, unnamed but similar to Eternal Sailor Moon (without wings). In the official visual book for Sailor Moon Eternal, this form was named &quot;Eternal Sailor Uranus&quot;.

===Princess Uranus===
On Silver Millennium, Sailor Uranus was also the princess of her home planet. She was among those given the duty of protecting the Solar System from outside invasion. As Princess Uranus, she dwelt in Miranda Castle and wore a deep blue gown—she appears in this form in the original manga Act 48, as well as in supplementary art.

==Special powers and items==

Although Haruka is extremely strong and has some psychic sensitivity (mostly in the form of dreams, shared by Michiru and Setsuna, or by &quot;hearing&quot; ill omens in the wind), she is not shown using any special powers in her civilian form. She must first transform into a Sailor Guardian by either raising her hand or using a special device called the Lip Rod in the anime into the air and shouting a special phrase, originally &quot;Uranus Planet Power, Make-up!&quot; In the manga she eventually gains her Uranus Crystal and this phrase changes to evoke &quot;Uranus Crystal Power&quot;. In the anime, although she does upgrade to Super Sailor Uranus, the Crystal is never mentioned and her transformation is not shown on screen.

Sailor Uranus&#x27; powers are inspired by Greek mythology, where Uranus is the god of the sky. They are also inspired by Western astrology, where the planet Uranus is associated with natural disasters, such as &quot;earthquakes, tornadoes, typhoons and hurricanes.&quot; Her first attack is &quot;World Shaking&quot;; she gathers energy from the sky and sends it toward her foes by smashing the energy against the ground. She is given three major attacks in the series, and although they all have English names (like those of the other Sailor Guardians), each is also given kanji in the manga to denote the meaning to Japanese readers. For example, &quot;World Shaking&quot; is given kanji which translate to , , and . The intended English pronunciation is given in furigana. This is Sailor Uranus&#x27;s primary attack for most of the anime series.

Haruka carries a special blade, the Space Sword, which is one of three powerful Talismans, the other two of which are carried by Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto. In the manga, she seems to already know it is a Talisman; in the anime, she does not gain the sword until it is revealed as such. In either case, it is used in her second attack, &quot;Space Sword Blaster&quot; , which fires damaging energy, as well as in physical strikes.

Her third and final attack, appearing only in the manga, is called , which uses no item at all. The Uranus Crystal is perhaps her most important possession, as it is her Sailor Crystal and the source of all her power, which becomes especially important in the fifth story arc. It is given to her by Sailor Saturn.

==Development==
The character of Sailor Uranus was not developed until partway through the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series, after the Sailor Guardians were well-established. She was created in tandem with Sailor Neptune, as &quot;complementary but opposite characters,&quot; and meant from the beginning to work alongside Sailor Pluto. Creator Naoko Takeuchi has said that she was shocked by the changes made to Haruka&#x27;s personality in the anime series, but that she was glad fans still liked the character.

Initial drawings of Haruka are softer and more feminine than they would later become; she was originally intended to be involved in the all-female Takarazuka Revue, playing male roles on stage. Although this was not included in the series itself, Takeuchi stated in an interview that she feels Takarazuka is &quot;the maximum level of feminine emancipation. These actress cover all roles of the plays, even the male ones. I was inspired by them to create Haruka.&quot; She also described such a figure as &quot;the female best friend and the fairy tale prince in one,&quot; stating that she had wanted for a long time to include a character like this in one of her works. Haruka is intended as an older sister figure for the younger girls populating the series, and as a counterpoint to Mamoru, Takeuchi&#x27;s ideal man.

Haruka is relatively androgynous in the manga and the &quot;Crystal&quot;, wearing both feminine and masculine outfits, in tune with the traditional depiction of a beautiful androgynous woman in shōjo comics. Takeuchi drew Haruka as physically different when she dresses in male clothes, with a more masculine figure than otherwise. She even refers to Haruka as being &quot;in male form&quot; at these times, and stated that she wanted this to continue in the anime—which it did. In the anime, Haruka&#x27;s sometimes-feminine appearance is downplayed, and she almost always appears masculine.

Haruka&#x27;s fascination with racing draws at least some of its details from Takeuchi herself; in the manga, they even share a favorite car, the Ferrari 512M. In the anime, she is seen driving either a yellow or white 1968 Toyota 2000GT open-top (resembling the custom &quot;Bond Model&quot;), or, once, a 1990 montego blue Mazda Mx-5 Miata.

The kanji of Haruka&#x27;s surname translate as and . Together, they constitute most of the name of the planet Uranus in Japanese, . Her given name is in hiragana and so its meaning is not inherent, but the word itself means &quot;distant&quot; . Her family name is sometimes incorrectly romanized as &quot;Tennō&quot;, which is in fact a more common writing of the planet&#x27;s name, but the manga invariably glosses Haruka&#x27;s surname as &quot;Ten&#x27;ō&quot; where furigana are used, and it is pronounced this way in the anime.

===Actresses===
In the Japanese anime and movies, Haruka Tenoh is voiced by veteran voice actress Megumi Ogata, who had previously portrayed a monster-of-the-day, Petz, and a young Mamoru in the series. Ogata was instructed by the director to portray Haruka as if she and Michiru were a married couple. In 1995, Ogata won the 16th Animage Anime Grand Prix award for best voice actress, largely because of her work as Sailor Uranus, breaking up a 12-win streak by Megumi Hayashibara. The previous year she had ranked third, and she ranked second for the next three years before dropping to ninth place in 1999. In the third season of &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, she is voiced by Junko Minagawa.

In the original English dub, her name is changed to &quot;Amara&quot; and she is voiced by Sarah Lafleur. Haruka is voiced by Erica Mendez in the Viz Media English dub.

In the Russian version (which is closer to the Japanese version rather than the English one), she is voiced by Lyudmila Ilyina. However, she voices all the female and child characters in the series, changing the timbre of her voice according to the variety of roles. Haruka&#x27;s name has not been changed.

In the stage musicals, Haruka has been played by 6 actresses: Sanae Kimura, Nao Takagi, Asako Uchida, Akiko Nakayama, Shu Shiotsuki and Shinjyu Terada. Sanae Kimura regarded the betrayal of Uranus and Neptune in her last musical, &quot;Eien Densetsu kaiteiban&quot;, to be a very difficult scene for her and cried during it.

Nao Takagi, the longest-running of the musical actresses, decided that she wanted to play the role of the &quot;Sailor Soldier with the blonde hair&quot; when she saw one of the earlier musicals, despite having never performed before. Takagi said she was &quot;really happy to be able to play Uranus&quot; and regarded Uranus as &quot;a completely cool, handsome Soldier&quot;. She has stated that certain scenes involving herself and Yuhka Asami (as Sailor Neptune) were specially created just for the two of them, the song &quot;Destined Couple&quot; in particular.

==Reception and influence==
The official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; popularity polls listed Haruka Tenoh and Sailor Uranus as separate characters. In 1994, with fifty one choices, Sailor Uranus was the sixth most popular character, receiving over nine thousand votes more than Haruka, who was the tenth. In early 1996, with fifty one choices, Uranus was the tenth most popular character, and Haruka was the twelfth. Haruka Tenoh came first in the favorite female character poll in Animage 1995. The following year she came seventh. Mari Nishimura found that Haruka became &quot;very popular&quot; with female fans due to her &quot;clear male attributes&quot;.

Sailor Uranus has been described as having &quot;clearly masculine traits&quot;, and that she protects Usagi &quot;as a man would a woman.&quot; She is presented as more willing to resort to whatever means is necessary, and as physically stronger. In her response to an academic essay on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; by Mary Grigsby, author Emily Ravenwood compared Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s relationship with Zoisite and Kunzite&#x27;s relationship explaining that &quot;in both cases, the feminine and masculine attributes are highlighted with a heavy hand (deliberate display of stereotypes).&quot; According to her, Kunzite and Haruka are stoic and show no emotions, and in the relationship with Michiru, &quot;Haruka is the fighter, the physically directed one, the one who restrains her emotional involvement, the protective one, in short the perfect butch.&quot;

===Censorship===
In an effort to avoid the controversy that a lesbian character in a cartoon aimed towards a younger audience would cause, given the social mores, Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s relationship has been censored in certain countries. In North America, the former English dub stated that Haruka and Michiru are cousins, even going so far as to occasionally state this through characters who should not know such information. However, whether in an attempt to be more faithful to the original Japanese or through failure to edit consistently, several episodes of the former English dub retained a noticeable amount of their casual flirting. Due to the censorship and problematic dubbing, some viewers inferred not only a homosexual relationship between the two girls, but also an incestuous one. It has even been implied that the difficulties in dubbing Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s relationship are part of the reason why there was a gap of several years between the dubbing of the earlier series and the dubbing of &quot;Sailor Moon S&quot;. However, in Japan, there were also some controversies around the character.

Viz Media and Studiopolis&#x27; English-language redub of the series in 2016 would address the censorship issue by restoring any deleted scenes and preserving the integrity of the original Japanese scripts. In 2020, Viz Media released a new dub of &quot;Sailor Moon Sailor Stars&quot;, but in what they call a &quot;translation error&quot;, they refer to Haruka and Michiru in a booklet as &quot;friends&quot; rather than a lesbian couple. The company later issued an apology on Twitter, in which they acknowledge that the two characters &quot;are not friends, but in fact, partners.&quot;

<text>Martinus Justinus Godefriedus &quot;Tini&quot; Veltman (; 27 June 1931 – 4 January 2021) was a Dutch theoretical physicist. He shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics with his former PhD student Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft for their work on particle theory.

==Biography==
Martinus Justinus Godefriedus Veltman was born in Waalwijk, Netherlands, on 27 June 1931. His father was the head of the local primary school. Three of his father&#x27;s siblings were primary school teachers. His mother&#x27;s father was a contractor and also ran a café. He was the fourth child in a family with six children. He started studying mathematics and physics at Utrecht University in 1948. 

As a youth he had a great interest in radio electronics, which was a difficult hobby to work on because the occupying German army had confiscated most of the available radio equipment.

In 1955, he became an assistant to Prof. Michels of the Van Der Waals laboratory in Amsterdam. Michels was an experimental physicist, working in high pressure physics. His primary task was the upkeep of a large library collection and occasional lecture preparations for Michels. 

His research career advanced when he moved to Utrecht to work under Léon Van Hove in 1955. He received his MSc degree in 1956, after which he was drafted into military service for two years, returning in February 1959. Van Hove then hired him as a doctoral researcher. He obtained his PhD degree in theoretical physics in 1963 and became professor at Utrecht University in 1966.

In 1960, Van Hove became director of the theory division at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the European High Energy laboratory. Veltman followed him there in 1961. Meanwhile, in 1960, he married his wife Anneke, who gave birth to their daughter Hélène in the Netherlands, before moving to Geneva to live with Martinus. Hélène followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps and in due time completed her particle physics thesis with Mary Gaillard at Berkeley, though she now works in the financial industry in London.

In 1963/64, during an extended stay at SLAC he designed the computer program Schoonschip for symbolic manipulation of mathematical equations, which is now considered the very first computer algebra system.

Veltman was closely involved in the 1963 CERN neutrino experiment, analyzing images as they were generated by the detectors. When no spectacular events came out, enthusiasm waned, and after a while Veltman and Bernardini were the only ones analyzing the images. As a result, Veltman became the spokesman for the group at the Brookhaven Conference in 1963.

In 1971, Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft, who was completing his PhD under the supervision of Veltman, renormalized Yang–Mills theory. They showed that if the symmetries of Yang–Mills theory were to be realized in the spontaneously broken mode, referred to as the Higgs mechanism, then Yang–Mills theory can be renormalized. Renormalization of Yang–Mills theory is a major achievement of twentieth century physics.

In 1980, Veltman became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1981, Veltman left Utrecht University for the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, from where he retired in 1996. 
 He subsequently moved back to the Netherlands.

Eventually, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1999 with &#x27;t Hooft, &quot;for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics&quot;. Veltman and &#x27;t Hooft joined in the celebrations at Utrecht University when the prize was awarded.

In 2003, Veltman published a book about particle physics for a broad audience, entitled &quot;Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics&quot;.

On 4 January 2021, Veltman died in his home in Bilthoven, the Netherlands.

Asteroid 9492 Veltman is named in his honor.

<text>Metropolitan is a fantasy novel by American writer Walter Jon Williams, first published in 1995. A sequel, &quot;City on Fire&quot;, was published in 1997.

==Setting==

&quot;Metropolitan&quot; is set on an unnamed world where, in the distant past, some agency or agencies enclosed the planet in a barrier known as the &quot;Shield&quot;. The Shield emits light and heat, incinerates all matter that rises above a certain altitude, and absorbs all electromagnetic energy directed into it. As a result, the world has no day, night, or seasons (although it does have weather phenomena like clouds and rain). Its inhabitants divide time into &quot;shifts&quot;, which appear to correspond to about eight hours (as they are referred to as &quot;work&quot;, &quot;service&quot;, and &quot;sleep&quot; shifts). The nature of who placed the Shield around the world, and why, is a major part of the theology of the world&#x27;s many religions.

Over the millennia the population of the world has grown and all available land surface has been covered with a single city, divided into areas called &quot;metropolises&quot; that are analogous to nations. The metropolises have governments that span the gamut from democracies to dictatorships; &quot;Metropolitan&quot; is used as a title for powerful individuals who rule entire metropolises.

Life on the planet would be impossible without the existence of &quot;plasm&quot;, an energy responsive to human will that is created by the arrangement of matter (such as buildings, or the structural elements within buildings) in certain geometric patterns. When plasm arises, it can be tapped and used directly by humans, but is usually channeled into batteries so it can be used safely. In almost all cases, plasm sources are under the control of the metropolitan government, which either keeps the plasm for its own use or sells it to its citizens, like electricity or water. Plasm use is a form of magic, and its users are referred to as mages; among many other effects it can be used to create or transmute matter (for example, to manufacture food), perform medical treatments or genetic modifications, enhance senses, create illusions, and kill people with energy blasts.

==Plot summary==

The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Aiah, is a minor functionary for the Plasm Authority in the metropolis of Jaspeer; the Authority is the public utility company that taps plasm wells and sells the plasm (at very high rates) to those who would use it. Aiah is one of the Barkazi, an ethnic group whose metropolis, Barkazil, was engulfed by civil war several generations ago, its territory partitioned and occupied by the adjacent metropolises and its population dispersed as refugees. Barkazi religion centers around a trickster god, Karlo, who is constantly running scams on others, and the tradition of the scam, or &quot;chonah,&quot; is central to their culture. Aiah briefly studied plasm use at university, but ended her studies because of the high cost of the plasm required to continue them.

Working for an emergency response team investigating a huge flaming apparition of a woman that damages several city blocks, she discovers a previously unknown plasm well of tremendous power (the apparition being caused by a woman who blundered into the well and tapped the plasm directly, killing herself in the process). Instead of disclosing its location, she leads the Authority on a wild goose chase while trying to decide on how best to use it to her advantage.

She decides to reveal it to Constantine, a resident of a luxury apartment complex near her own. Constantine is a skilled mage and visionary political theorist with dreams of moving the world beyond its stagnant situation. He became Metropolitan of his home metropolis and attempted to implement many reforms, but was betrayed, forced from power, and exiled by those closest to him. Aiah, an admirer of his political thought, discloses the plasm source to him so that he might make another attempt at realizing his plans for the &quot;New City&quot;, asking only that she be made a part of whatever he carries out.

Aiah then effectively runs a &quot;chonah&quot; of enormous scale, misleading the Authority, dealing with her Barkazi extended family (who want a piece of whatever action she is in on) and the local organized crime group, keeping her Jaspeeri husband (working in a distant metropolis) in the dark, and avoiding the potentially lethal attentions of Constantine&#x27;s right-hand-woman, Sorya. Through all of this she has a love affair with Constantine and receives training in magery from him, for which she has a great deal of natural talent.

At the novel&#x27;s climax, Aiah&#x27;s plasm source, and her own magical assistance, is a crucial element when Constantine orchestrates a revolution in the metropolis of Caraqui and installs himself in its post-revolutionary power structure, from which position he hopes to enact his New City reforms. Realizing that she has no hope of using her full potential as a bureaucrat in Jaspeer, Aiah leaves her job, family, and marriage behind and travels to Caraqui to help Constantine achieve his dream.

==Reception==

&quot;Metropolitan&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in the same year.

The &quot;SF Site&quot;″s Donna McMahon praised Williams for &quot;creat(in)g a complex world and plot&quot; and &quot;successfully weaving (its) details into his narrative without resorting to any awkward contrivances&quot;, noting as well that the &quot;descriptions are excellent, and his characters are strong&quot;; ultimately, she judged that although the book &quot;unsatisfying&quot;, it was nevertheless &quot;worth reading&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; similarly felt that it was &quot;by Williams&#x27;s own high standards, unsatisfying&quot;, with a &quot;curious, fascinating yet disconnected scenario&quot;.

<doc id="491750" wikidata="Q7489556" url="?curid=491750" title="Shared residency in England">
<text>Shared residence, joint residence, or shared parenting refers to the situation where a child of parents who have divorced or separated live with each parent at different times, such as every other week. With shared residency, both parents have parental responsibility. Shared residency does not mean that the &quot;time&quot; the child spends with each parent must be equal.

==Rationale==
Shared residency is an option when both parents want to be fully involved in their children&#x27;s upbringing, when either or both parents consent to the order, and when the Court certifies that the Order as being in the best interests of the child. Compared to children in sole residency that live with only one of their parents, scientific research has shown that children with a shared residency arrangement have better physical health (e.g. sleep, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use), higher psychological wellbeing (e.g. self-perception, life satisfaction, anxiety, depression), fewer behavioural problems (e.g. delinquency, school misbehaviour, bullying) and stronger social relationships (with friends, parents, step-parents and grandparents).

==Frequency==
Shared residence is relatively uncommon in the United Kingdom. Among children not living in an intact family with both their mother and father, a 2005/06 survey found that only 7% had a shared residence arrangement while 83% lived only with their mother and 10% lived only with their father.

==Legal statutes and cases==
The Children Act 1989 defines a residence order as one &quot;...settling the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom a child is to live&quot;. A sole residence order settles the child(ren) in the home of one parent. The other parent will usually be allowed contact. A joint or shared residence order allows the child(ren) to alternate periods of residence between the homes of both parents.

The &quot;Children Act 1989 Guidance and Regulations, Volume 1, Court Orders&quot; produced by the President of the Family Division (the leading judge of the Family Court, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss) and published by the Stationery Office in 1991 discussed shared orders in paragraph 2.2(8) at page 10: -
:&quot;...it is not expected that it would become a common form of order, partly because most children will still need the stability of a single home, and partly because in the cases where shared care is appropriate there is less likely to be a need for the court to make any order at all. However, a shared care order has the advantage of being more realistic in those cases where the child is to spend considerable amount of time with both parents, brings with it certain other benefits (including the right to remove the child from accommodation provided by a local authority under s.20), and removes any impression that one parent is good and responsible whereas the other parent is not.&quot;
This was the approach in &quot;D v D (Shared Residence Order)&quot; (2001) 1 FLR 495 , in which it was held that residence of the children involved could be shared, even when one of the parents was hostile to the idea. The principle was clearly stated: it is not necessary to show that exceptional circumstances exist before a shared residence order may be granted. Nor is it probably necessary to show a positive benefit to the child. What is required is to demonstrate that the order is in the interest of the child in accordance with the requirements of s1 Children Act 1989 which makes the interests of the children the first and paramount concern of the Courts in any litigation. In the case of very young children, there is an informal rebuttable presumption in disputed cases that a very young child&#x27;s interests are more likely to be served by having a single &#x27;base&#x27; with one parent, regardless of how the other has performed. This may be rebutted by evidence to demonstrate that the child&#x27;s interests will be better served by shared residence, or by sole residence with one spouse or with other significant persons. Recently, Baroness Morris of Bolton commented:
:&quot;If a parent is considered a fit parent when they are married or living together, there is no reason in a normal case why that assumption should change just because they separate or divorce. They should not have to prove that they are able to care for their children by being subject to reversal of the burden of proof that the current system operates. That in no way undermines the presumption that the welfare of the child is a paramount concern; it supports it. &quot;

The issue of hostility was addressed in &quot;Re M (Intractable Contact Dispute: Interim Care Order)&quot; (2003) 2 FLR 636, which provides for the making of an order under s37 Children Act 1989 inviting the local authority to investigate and report. Wall J. found that the mother had caused the children to believe that they had suffered abuse at the hands of the father and paternal grandparents, and that an assessment was needed when the children were not at home with the mother. This was secured away from the home under an interim care order. Free from the mother&#x27;s influence, the children were rapidly able to re-establish their relationship with the father. Subsequently, an Order was made that they reside with him. Although this approach is not appropriate in all cases involving disputing parents, it is a useful tool to have available. If it is clear that contact is desirable but one parent obstructs it, the risk of significant harm may be present. The judge must prepare a coherent care plan, identifying the reasons for making a Section 37 Order, and stating the consequences of the Order and possible removal. In these proceedings, it is essential that the children are separately represented and that there the same judge is allocated to deal with all aspects arising from the proceedings.

In Family Law, each case is held to be unique on its facts, but the usual process of the interpretation of the law being based on precedents applies. Hence, since &quot;D v D&quot;, there have been a number of cases where &quot;shared residence&quot; has been awarded to children in spite of one parent&#x27;s initial objections or continuing hostility including:
*&quot;Re A (Children) (Shared Residence)&quot; (2002) 1 FCR 177, where a sole order was varied by consent to a joint order in part, because a joint residence order confirms both spouses on an equal authority vis-à-vis the world. That might have practical implications, particularly, for instance, in relation to the Child Benefit Agency and to the drawing of child benefit which would have been drawn by one spouse alone. This acknowledgement of the equal competence of the parents, also buttresses the spouse&#x27;s sense of well-being and of self-esteem as parents.
*&quot;Re F (Shared Residence Order)&quot; (2003) 2 FLR 397 records a well-balanced decision for a joint order by the judge of first instance made the subject of an appeal by an unhappy spouse. The appeal was withdrawn in the face of the comments of the Court of Appeal demonstrating the fairness of the joint order.
*&quot;A Father and A Mother v Their Two Children (B and C)&quot; (2004) EWHC 142 (FAM) in which a bitter contest was finally resolved by a joint order.

<text>Doom is a 2005 science fiction action horror film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. Loosely based on the video game series of the same name by id Software, the film stars Karl Urban, Rosamund Pike, Razaaq Adoti, and Dwayne Johnson (credited as The Rock). In the film, marines are sent on a rescue mission to a facility on Mars, where they encounter demon-like creatures.

After film rights deals with Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures expired, id Software signed a deal with Warner Bros. with the stipulation that the film would be greenlit within a year. Warner Bros. lost the rights, which were subsequently given back to Universal, which started production in 2004. The film was an international co-production of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, and Germany.

&quot;Doom&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on October 21, 2005 to negative reviews. The film was a box office bomb, grossing $58.7 million worldwide against a production budget between $60–70 million. In 2019, Universal released a second live-action film direct-to-video titled &quot;&quot;.

==Plot==
In 2026, a wormhole portal, the Ark, to an ancient city on Mars is discovered deep below the Nevada desert. Twenty years later, the 85 personnel at the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on Mars are attacked by an unknown assailant. Following a distress call sent by Dr. Carmack, a squad of eight marines are sent to the research facility. The team includes squad leader Sgt. Asher &quot;Sarge&quot; Mahonin, &quot;Duke&quot;, &quot;Goat&quot;, &quot;Destroyer&quot;, Portman, &quot;Mac&quot;, &quot;Kid&quot;, and John &quot;Reaper&quot; Grimm. They are sent on a search-and-destroy mission to Mars, with UAC only concerned with the retrieval of computer data from their anthropology, archeology, and genetics experiments.

The team uses the Ark to reach Mars, ordering the Earth site on lockdown. Arriving on Mars, they are met by UAC employee &quot;Pinky&quot;. Reaper finds his twin sister, Dr. Sam Grimm, and escorts her to retrieve the data. He learns that a dig site, where their parents were accidentally killed years earlier, was reopened and ancient skeletons of a humanoid race genetically enhanced with an artificial 24th chromosome pair were discovered.

While searching for survivors in the facility, the marines find a traumatized and injured Dr. Carmack and escort him to the medical lab for treatment, but he later disappears. The marines shoot at an unknown creature in the genetics lab that leads them down into the facility&#x27;s sewer, where it attacks and kills Goat. They kill the creature and take it to the medical lab, where Sam performs an autopsy and discovers that its organs are human. She and Duke witness Goat resurrecting and killing himself by smashing his head against a reinforced window. The two are attacked by a creature which they soon deduce is a mutated Dr. Carmack.

The squad methodically tracks down and destroys several of the creatures, though Mac, Destroyer, and Portman die in the process. An angered Sarge kills the mutated Dr. Carmack. Sam, Reaper, and Sarge learn that UAC was experimenting on humans using the extra Martian Chromosome (C24) harvested from the remains of the ancient skeletons, but the mutants got loose, leading to the outbreak. Sam and Reaper try to convince Sarge that the creatures are humans from the facility, mutated by the C24 serum and that not all of those infected will fully transform into the creatures. Sam hypothesizes that some of those injected with C24 will develop superhuman abilities but retain their humanity, while others with a predisposition for violent or psychotic behavior will become creatures, a pattern she believes also happened with the Martians, who built the Ark to escape.

Some creatures use the Ark to reach Earth, where they slaughter or mutate the research staff. The marines, Sam, and Pinky follow, and Sarge orders the squad to sanitize the entire facility. When Kid informs Sarge that he found, but refuses to kill, a group of survivors, Sarge executes Kid for insubordination, leading to a standoff with an armed Pinky. The group is suddenly attacked by creatures who kill Duke and drag Sarge and Pinky away. Reaper is wounded by a ricocheting bullet. To prevent him from bleeding to death, Sam injects her brother with the C24 serum.

Reaper regains consciousness and finds his wounds have healed and that Sam has gone missing. Using his new C24 superhuman abilities, he fights his way through the facility, even battling a mutated and monstrous Pinky before finding an unconscious Sam with Sarge, who has become infected and has killed the group of survivors Kid had previously found. Reaper and Sarge battle, both of them enhanced with superhuman powers. Reaper is able to gain the upper hand and throws Sarge through the Ark back to Mars along with a grenade, which destroys Sarge and the Mars facility. Reaper then carries his unconscious sister into the elevator and rides back up to the ground level in Nevada.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Between 1994 and 1995, following the success of &quot;Doom II&quot;, Hollywood began gaining interest in producing a live-action film adaptation of &quot;Doom&quot;. Universal Pictures initially acquired the rights, which were later obtained by Columbia TriStar. Former CEO of id Software Todd Hollenshead stated that a number of factors prevented the project from moving forward such as the Columbine High School massacre, lack of producers, and poor scripts. The id Software team screened a presentation of &quot;Doom 3&quot; to agents from Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to see if they were interested in the property. Producers Lorenzo di Bonaventura and John Wells eventually obtained the rights.

Di Bonaventura and Wells initially set development for the film at Warner Bros., however, the duo moved development of the project to Universal after Warner Bros. failed to move the project into production after 15 months. The terms of the deal with Universal included gross point royalties for the developer and rights holder. In 2004, Enda McCallion was attached to direct the film and David Callaham was named the screenwriter, with the script loosely adapting elements from &quot;Doom 3&quot;. Callaham&#x27;s early draft featured the Cacodemon, Arch-Vile, and other demons from the games but were cut due to time and budgetary reasons. That September, McCallion dropped out as director and Andrzej Bartkowiak joined the project. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were approached to polish the script&#x27;s dialogue, but declined and Wesley Strick was hired instead. Production was scheduled to begin in Winter 2004 in Prague.

===Pre-production===
Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for the lead. Vin Diesel was offered the lead but turned it down. Dwayne Johnson was offered the role of &quot;John Grimm&quot; but turned it down in favor of &quot;Sarge&quot;, stating, &quot;For some reason I was drawn more to Sarge, I thought &#x27;Sarge&#x27; was, to me, more interesting and had a darker side.&quot; In September 2004, Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike were cast as John and Samantha Grimm. The Rapid Response Tactical Squad actors underwent military training for two weeks under military advisor Tom McAdams.

===Effects===
Monsters and creature effects for the film were created by Stan Winston Studios, supervised by John Rosengrant. The visual effects were supervised by Jon Farhat. The film included 350 effects shots, the work was shared between two companies, Framestore who focused on character animation and creature work in 130 shots, and Double Negative who worked on environments, dimensional effects and futuristic weapons in about 200 shots. Pictures of Johnson were taken to conceptualize his demon makeup. The second layer of prosthetics took two hours to apply on Johnson while the third level of prosthetics took three hours to apply. Acrylic paint was used to cover Johnson&#x27;s tattoos. After the 2D concept art, the creatures were sculpted and body-cast. Brian Steele and Doug Jones underwent head and shoulder life casting and body casting to get an impression for their body frames. An earpiece was added into the suits so that Jones and Steele could receive directions from Rosengrant, however, their mics were not enabled for them to reply. The team drew upon forensic pathology books to give the creatures a repulsive nature.

===First person shooter sequence===
The first person shooter sequence was completely directed by Farhat and was filmed in 14 days after a planning period of three months. While the scene is one continuous shot, multiple cuts, that Farhat called &quot;hook-ups&quot;, were made during filming, Farhat stated, &quot;you can do it by moving a camera, and passing something, and cutting. And then rolling the camera again on a subsequent date.&quot; Other hook-up styles were used by using a green screen or blue screen when a door opens or jump cutting by whipping an object. The gun was only used on-screen when it was needed due to its size affecting the aspect ratio.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Clint Mansell, upon which he produced a remix of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;You Know What You Are?&quot;, which was used in the film&#x27;s ending credits. The song &quot;Switchback&quot; by Celldweller was licensed for the trailers.

==Release==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend, &quot;Doom&quot; debuted in 3,043 theaters and earned $15.5 million. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $28.2 million and grossed $30.5 million internationally, grossing $58.7 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Doom&quot; received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of , based on 137 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;The FPS sections are sure to please fans of the video game, but lacking in plot and originality to please other moviegoers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average rating of 34 out of 100, based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B− on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert said, &quot;&quot;Doom&quot; is like some kid came over and is using your computer and won&#x27;t let you play.&quot; Rob Gonsalves gave it two stars, citing incoherent action sequences, flat and humorless characters, and poor acting: &quot;Only Richard Brake, as the sleazy and duplicitous grunt Portman, gives a performance of any interest, and even that&#x27;s on the level of caricature.&quot; Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called it &quot;Not quite as dreadful as &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, but that&#x27;s hardly a major achievement.&quot; Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a mixed review and was critical of Johnson’s performance but positive about the &quot;tongue-in-cheek sensibility&quot; and the faithful display of weapons from the game. In summary: &quot;It&#x27;s really not all that bad. Ultra-derivative bigscreen transplant of one of the most successful (and controversial) games ever made plays like a mutant cross between a biotech thriller and a zombie movie, with all the alien autopsies, blood-gushing protuberances and meaningless scientific jargon that come with the territory.&quot;

Richard James Havis of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote: &quot;Plot, character development and dialogue are so sparse that the screenwriters are fortunate they&#x27;re not paid by the word. But this basic approach doesn&#x27;t render it ineffectual. There&#x27;s so little to go wrong that those who like their entertainment mindless and violent will find little fault.&quot;
Chris Carle at &quot;IGN&quot; gave it 3 out of 5 and called it &quot;easily the best videogame-to-film adaptation yet&quot;, saying although it is not big on plot or characterization &quot;it succeeds in the things it sets out to do&quot;.

====Other responses====

John Carmack (co-founder of id Software and co-creator of &quot;Doom&quot;) spoke favorably of the film, stating, &quot;I liked it. Nobody expects a video game movie to be Oscar material, but I thought it was a solid action movie with lots of fun nods to the gaming community.&quot; John Romero declined to comment on the film in a 2018 WeAreDevelopers Q&amp;A session. In 2009, Dwayne Johnson described the film as an example of &quot;trying and failing&quot; to do a good video game adaptation, and that it was a cautionary tale of what &quot;not to do&quot;.

In 2021, Rosamund Pike expressed embarrassment for not familiarizing herself with the source material, commenting, &quot;I feel partly to blame in that respect because I think I failed just through ignorance and innocence to understand, to fully get a picture of what &quot;Doom&quot; meant to fans at that point. I wasn’t a gamer. I didn’t understand. If I knew what I knew now, I would have dived right into all of that and got fully immersed in it like I do now. And I just didn’t understand. I feel embarrassed, really.&quot;

===Accolades===

In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; listed the film on its list of top-10 worst video games movies. 
Johnson received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for his performance.

===Home media===
&quot;Doom&quot; was released on UMD and DVD on February 7, 2006, HD DVD on April 26, 2006, and on Blu-ray Disc on February 10, 2009. The DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray releases only feature the unrated extended cut, with no options for the theatrical cut. The extended cut runs 113 minutes. In the United States and Canada, the DVD earned $29.2 million in domestic video sales. The extended cut was released on 4K Blu-ray on August 9, 2022.

==Reboot==

In an October 2005 interview, executive producer John Wells stated that a second film would be put into production if the first was a box office success. In April 2018, Universal Pictures announced plans for a new &quot;Doom&quot; film. &quot;&quot; was released direct-to-video on October 1, 2019.

<doc id="491758" wikidata="Q4716439" url="?curid=491758" title="Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince of Civitella-Cesi">
<text>[[Don (honorific)|Don]] Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince of Civitella-Cesi (7 December 1911 – 1 May/12 May 1986) was an Italian banking heir and a member of the House of Torlonia.

== About ==
Born in Rome on 7 December 1911, Torlonia was the son of Marino Torlonia, 4th Prince di Civitella-Cesi and his American wife, Mary Elsie Moore. Don Alessandro&#x27;s youngest sister was &quot;Donna&quot; Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi, grandmother of the American actress Brooke Shields. Thus he was Shields&#x27;s grand-uncle. On the death of his father in 1933, he inherited large estates as well as his father&#x27;s princely and other titles.

In 1941, when his mother was dying in New York City, Torlonia took a high speed boat from Portugal and was arrested in error by FBI, thinking he was an enemy of the state and taken to Ellis Island.

In the 1980s, Torlonia held the title as the &quot;richest man in Rome&quot;, as he was the heir to a banking fortune. He died in the Palazzo Torlonia, Rome, in 1986.

* &quot;Donna&quot; Alessandra (&quot;Sandra&quot;) Vittoria Torlonia (1936–2014), married to Count Clemente Lecquio di Assaba (1925–1971); they have two children: Count Alessandro Lecquio di Assaba and &quot;Donna&quot; Desideria Lecquio di Assaba (Countess Oddone Tournon).

<doc id="491766" wikidata="Q220239" url="?curid=491766" title="HMS Hood">
<text>HMS &quot;Hood&quot; (pennant number 51) was a battlecruiser of the Royal Navy (RN). &quot;Hood&quot; was the first of the planned four s to be built during the First World War. Already under construction when the Battle of Jutland occurred in mid-1916, that battle revealed serious flaws in her design, and despite drastic revisions she was completed four years later. For this reason, she was the only ship of her class to be completed, as the Admiralty decided it would be better to start with a clean design on succeeding battlecruisers, leading to the never-built G-3 class. Despite the appearance of newer and more modern ships, &quot;Hood&quot; remained the largest warship in the world for 20 years after her commissioning, and her prestige was reflected in her nickname, &quot;The Mighty Hood&quot;.

&quot;Hood&quot; was involved in many exercises between her commissioning in 1920 and the outbreak of war in 1939, including training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and a circumnavigation of the globe with the Special Service Squadron in 1923 and 1924. She was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet following the outbreak of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935. When the Spanish Civil War broke out the following year, &quot;Hood&quot; was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until she had to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul. By this time, advances in naval gunnery had reduced &quot;Hood&quot;″s usefulness. She was scheduled to undergo a major rebuild in 1941 to correct these issues, but the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 kept the ship in service without the upgrades.

When war with Germany was declared, &quot;Hood&quot; was operating in the area around Iceland, and she spent the next several months hunting for German commerce raiders and blockade runners between Iceland and the Norwegian Sea. After a brief overhaul of her propulsion system, she sailed as the flagship of Force H, and participated in the destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir. Transferred to the Home Fleet shortly afterwards, &quot;Hood&quot; was dispatched to Scapa Flow, and operated in the area as a convoy escort and later as a defence against a potential German invasion fleet. In May 1941, &quot;Hood&quot; and the battleship were ordered to intercept the and the heavy cruiser , which were en route to the Atlantic, where they were to attack convoys. On 24 May 1941, early in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, &quot;Hood&quot; was struck by several German shells, exploded, and sank with the loss of all but 3 of her crew of 1,418.

The RN conducted two inquiries into the reasons for the ship&#x27;s quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship&#x27;s loss, concluded that &quot;Hood&quot;″s aft magazine had exploded after one of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s shells penetrated the ship&#x27;s armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship&#x27;s torpedoes. It was more thorough than the first board but concurred with the first board&#x27;s conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship&#x27;s loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship&#x27;s gun turrets that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship&#x27;s wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown, since that portion of the ship was obliterated in the explosion.

==Design and description==

The Admiral-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the German s, which were reported to be more heavily armed and armoured than the latest British battlecruisers of the and the es. The design was revised after the Battle of Jutland to incorporate heavier armour and all four ships were laid down. Only &quot;Hood&quot; was completed, because the ships were very expensive and required labour and material that could be put to better use building merchant ships needed to replace those lost to the German U-boat campaign.

The Admirals were significantly larger than their predecessors of the &quot;Renown&quot; class. As completed, &quot;Hood&quot; had an overall length of , a maximum beam of , and a draught of at deep load. This was longer and wider than the older ships. She displaced at load and at deep load, over more than the older ships. The ship had a metacentric height of at deep load, which minimised her roll and made her a steady gun platform.

The additional armour added during construction increased her draught by about at deep load, which reduced her freeboard and made her very wet. At full speed, or in heavy seas, water would flow over the ship&#x27;s quarterdeck and often entered the messdecks and living quarters through ventilation shafts. This characteristic earned her the nickname of &quot;the largest submarine in the Navy&quot;. The persistent dampness, coupled with the ship&#x27;s poor ventilation, was blamed for the high incidence of tuberculosis aboard. The ship&#x27;s complement varied widely over her career; in 1919, she was authorised 1,433 men as a squadron flagship; in 1934, she had 81 officers and 1,244 ratings aboard.

The Admirals were powered by four Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by 24 Yarrow boilers. The battlecruiser&#x27;s turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ship at , but during sea trials in 1920, &quot;Hood&quot;″s turbines provided , which allowed her to reach . She carried enough fuel oil to give her an estimated range of at .

===Armament===
The main battery of the Admiral-class ships consisted of eight BL Mk I guns in hydraulically powered twin gun turrets. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern, and 120 shells were carried for each gun. The ship&#x27;s secondary armament consisted of twelve BL Mk I guns, each with 200 rounds. They were shipped on shielded single-pivot mounts fitted along the upper deck and the forward shelter deck. This high position allowed them to be worked during heavy weather, as they were less affected by waves and spray compared with the casemate mounts of earlier British capital ships. Two of these guns on the shelter deck were temporarily replaced by QF Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns between 1938 and 1939. All the 5.5-inch guns were removed during another refit in 1940.
The ship&#x27;s original anti-aircraft armament consisted of four QF 4-inch Mk V guns on single mounts. These were joined in early 1939 by four twin mounts for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI dual-purpose gun. The single guns were removed in mid-1939 and a further three twin Mark XIX mounts were added in early 1940. In 1931, a pair of octuple mountings for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun &quot;pom-pom&quot; were added on the shelter deck, abreast of the funnels, and a third mount was added in 1937. Two quadruple mountings for the Vickers Mk III machine gun were added in 1933 with two more mountings added in 1937. To these were added five unrotated projectile (UP) launchers in 1940, each launcher carrying 20 rockets. When they detonated, the rockets shot out lengths of cable that were kept aloft by parachutes; the cable was intended to snag aircraft and draw up the small aerial mine that would destroy the aircraft.

The Admirals were fitted with six fixed torpedo tubes, three on each broadside. Two of these were submerged forward of &#x27;A&#x27; turret&#x27;s magazine and the other four were above water, the rear funnel. About 28 torpedoes were carried.

===Fire control===
The ship&#x27;s main battery was controlled by two fire-control directors. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and was fitted with a rangefinder. The other was fitted in the spotting top above the tripod foremast and equipped with a rangefinder. Each turret was also fitted with a rangefinder. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the bridge. They were supplemented by two additional control positions in the fore-top, which were provided with rangefinders, fitted in 1924–1925. The antiaircraft guns were controlled by a simple high-angle rangefinder mounted on the aft control position, fitted in 1926–1927. Three torpedo-control towers were fitted, each with a rangefinder. One was on each side of the amidships control tower and the third was on the centreline abaft the aft control position.
During the 1929–1931 refit, a high-angle control system (HACS) Mark I director was added on the rear searchlight platform and two positions for 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; antiaircraft directors were added at the rear of the spotting top, although only one director was initially fitted. The 5.5-inch control positions and their rangefinders on the spotting top were removed during the 1932 refit. In 1934, the &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors were moved to the former locations of the 5.5-inch control positions on the spotting top and the rangefinders for the 5.5-inch control positions were reinstalled on the signal platform. Two years later, the &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors were moved to the rear corners of the bridge to get them out of the funnel gases. Another &quot;pom-pom&quot; director was added on the rear superstructure, abaft the HACS director in 1938. Two HACS Mark III directors were added to the aft end of the signal platform the following year, and the Mark I director aft was replaced by a Mark III.

During &quot;Hood&quot;″s last refit in 1941, a Type 279 early-warning radar for aircraft and surface vessels and a Type 284 gunnery radar were installed, although the Type 279 radar lacked its receiving aerial and was inoperable according to Roberts. An Admiralty document indicates however that, following the 1941 refit at Rosyth, &quot;Hood&quot;″s Type 279 radar was indeed functional. The early-warning radar was of a modified type, known as Type 279M, the difference between this and Type 279 being the number of aerials. While Type 279 used two aerials, a transmitter and a receiver, the Type 279M used only a single transceiver aerial. &quot;Hood&quot; reported an accuracy of 3 degrees with her 279M set.

===Protection===
The armour scheme of the Admirals was originally based on that of the battlecruiser with an waterline belt. Unlike &quot;Tiger&quot;, the armour was angled outwards 12° from the waterline to increase its relative thickness in relation to flat-trajectory shells. This change increased the ship&#x27;s vulnerability to plunging (high-trajectory) shells, as it exposed more of the vulnerable deck armour. Some of armour were added to the design in late 1916, based on British experiences at the Battle of Jutland, at the cost of deeper draught and slightly decreased speed. To save construction time, this was accomplished by thickening the existing armour, rather than redesigning the entire ship. &quot;Hood&quot;″s protection accounted for 33% of her displacement, a high proportion by British standards, but less than was usual in contemporary German designs (for example, 36% for the battlecruiser ).

The armoured belt consisted of face-hardened Krupp cemented armour (KC), arranged in three strakes. The main waterline belt was thick between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes and thinned to towards the ship&#x27;s ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7 inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast &#x27;A&#x27; barbette. The upper belt was 5 inches thick amidships and extended forward to &#x27;A&#x27; barbette, with a short 4-inch extension aft.

The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs, which were 5 inches thick. The decks were made of high-tensile steel. The forecastle deck ranged from in thickness, while the upper deck was thick over the magazines and elsewhere. The main deck was thick over the magazines and elsewhere, except for the 2-inch-thick slope that met the bottom of the main belt. The lower deck was 3 inches thick over the propeller shafts, 2 inches thick over the magazines and 1 inch elsewhere.

Live-firing trials with the new 15-inch APC (armour-piercing, capped) shell against a mock-up of &quot;Hood&quot; showed that this shell could penetrate the ship&#x27;s vitals via the 7-inch middle belt and the 2-inch slope of the main deck as a result 3-inch plating on the main deck over the slopes was added alongside the magazine spaces at a very late stage of construction and the four aftermost 5.5-inch guns and their ammunition hoists were removed in partial compensation.. A proposal was made to increase the armour over the forward magazines to 5 inches and 6 inches over the rear magazines in July 1919 in response to these trials. To compensate for the additional weight, the 4 midships above water torpedo tubes and the armour for the rear torpedo warheads were removed, and the armour for the aft torpedo-control tower was reduced in thickness from 6 to . However, the additional armour was never fitted pending further trials. As completed, &quot;Hood&quot; remained susceptible to plunging shells and bombs. The torpedo-warhead armour was reinstated during the ship&#x27;s 1929–1931 refit.

For protection against torpedoes, she was given a deep torpedo bulge that ran the length of the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into an empty outer compartment and an inner compartment filled with five rows of water-tight &quot;crushing tubes&quot; intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The bulge was backed by a 1.5-inch-thick torpedo bulkhead.

===Aircraft===

&quot;Hood&quot; was initially fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on top of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–1931 refit, the platform was removed from &#x27;X&#x27; turret and a rotating, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force (RAF). During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved to be difficult to operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on &#x27;B&#x27; turret.

===Battlecruiser or fast battleship===
Although the Royal Navy always designated &quot;Hood&quot; as a battlecruiser, some modern writers such as Antony Preston have classified her as a fast battleship, since &quot;Hood&quot; appeared to have improvements over the fast s. On paper, &quot;Hood&quot; retained the same armament and level of protection, while being significantly faster.
Around 1918, American commanders, including Vice Admiral William Sims, commander of US naval forces in Europe, and Admiral Henry T. Mayo, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, became extremely impressed by &quot;Hood&quot;, which they described as a &quot;fast battleship&quot;, and they advocated that the US Navy develop a fast battleship of its own. However, the US continued with their established design direction, the slower, but well-protected, battleship and the fast and lightly armoured , both of which were later cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.

Influences from &quot;Hood&quot; showed on subsequent &quot;Lexington&quot; designs, with the reduction of the main armour belt, the change to sloped armour, and the addition of four above-water torpedo tubes to the four underwater tubes of the original design. To add to the confusion, Royal Navy documents of the period often describe any battleship with a maximum speed over as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour. For instance, the never-built G3 battlecruiser was classified as such, although it would have been more of a fast battleship than &quot;Hood&quot;.

The scale of &quot;Hood&quot;″s protection, though adequate for the Jutland era, was at best marginal against the new generation of gunned capital ships that emerged soon after her completion in 1920, typified by the American and the Japanese s. The Royal Navy were fully aware that the ship&#x27;s protection flaws still remained, even in her revised design, so &quot;Hood&quot; was intended for the duties of a battlecruiser, and she served in the battlecruiser squadrons through most of her career.

==Construction==

Construction of &quot;Hood&quot; began at the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, as yard number 460 on 1 September 1916. Following the loss of three British battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland, 5,000 tons of extra armour and bracing were added to &quot;Hood&quot;″s design. Most seriously, the deck protection was flawed—spread over three decks, it was designed to detonate an incoming shell on impact with the top deck, with much of the energy being absorbed as the exploding shell had to penetrate the armour of the next two decks. The development of effective time-delay shells at the end of the First World War made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship. In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.

She was launched on 22 August 1918 by the widow of Rear-Admiral Sir Horace Hood, a great-great-grandson of Admiral Samuel Hood, after whom the ship was named. Sir Horace Hood had been killed while commanding the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron and flying his flag on —one of the three battlecruisers which blew up at the Battle of Jutland. To make room in the shipyard for merchant construction, &quot;Hood&quot; sailed for Rosyth to complete her fitting-out on 9 January 1920. After her sea trials, she was commissioned on 15 May 1920, under Captain Wilfred Tompkinson. She had cost £6,025,000 to build.

With her conspicuous twin funnels and lean profile, &quot;Hood&quot; was widely regarded as one of the finest-looking warships ever built. She was also the largest warship afloat when she was commissioned, and retained that distinction for the next 20 years. Her size and powerful armament earned her the nickname of &quot;Mighty Hood&quot; and she came to symbolise the might of the British Empire itself.

==Interwar service==

Shortly after commissioning on 15 May 1920, &quot;Hood&quot; became the flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. After a cruise to Scandinavian waters that year, Captain Geoffrey Mackworth assumed command. &quot;Hood&quot; visited the Mediterranean in 1921 and 1922 to show the flag and to train with the Mediterranean fleet, before sailing on a cruise to Brazil and the West Indies in company with the battlecruiser squadron.

Captain John Im Thurn was in command when &quot;Hood&quot;, accompanied by the battlecruiser and s of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal in November 1923. The objective of the cruise was to remind the dominions of their dependence on British sea power and encourage them to support it with money, ships, and facilities. They returned home 10 months later in September 1924, having visited South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Newfoundland, and other colonies and dependencies, and the United States.

While in Australia in April 1924, the squadron escorted the battlecruiser out to sea, where she was scuttled in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty. The battlecruiser squadron visited Lisbon in January 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on to the Mediterranean for exercises. &quot;Hood&quot; continued this pattern of a winter training visit to the Mediterranean for the rest of the decade. Captain Harold Reinold relieved Captain im Thurn on 30 April 1925 and was relieved in turn by Captain Wilfred French on 21 May 1927.

&quot;Hood&quot; was given a major refit from 1 May 1929 to 10 March 1931, and afterwards resumed her role as flagship of the battlecruiser squadron under the command of Captain Julian Patterson. Later that year, her crew participated in the Invergordon Mutiny over pay cuts for the sailors. It ended peacefully and &quot;Hood&quot; returned to her home port afterwards. The battlecruiser squadron made a Caribbean cruise in early 1932, and &quot;Hood&quot; was given another brief refit between 31 March and 10 May at Portsmouth. Captain Thomas Binney assumed command on 15 August 1932 and the ship resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in the Mediterranean the next year. Captain Thomas Tower replaced Captain Binney on 30 August 1933. Her secondary and antiaircraft fire-control directors were rearranged during another quick refit between 1 August and 5 September 1934.

While en route to Gibraltar for a Mediterranean cruise, &quot;Hood&quot; was rammed in the port side quarterdeck by the battlecruiser on 23 January 1935. The damage to &quot;Hood&quot; was limited to her left outer propeller and an dent, although some hull plates were knocked loose from the impact. Temporary repairs were made at Gibraltar before the ship sailed to Portsmouth for permanent repairs between February and May 1935. The captains of both ships were court-martialled, as was the squadron commander, Rear-Admiral Sidney Bailey. Tower and Bailey were acquitted, but &quot;Renown&quot;″s Captain Sawbridge was relieved of command. The Admiralty dissented from the verdict, reinstated Sawbridge, and criticised Bailey for ambiguous signals during the manoeuvre.

The ship participated in King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead the following August. She was attached to the Mediterranean fleet shortly afterwards and stationed at Gibraltar at the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in October. Captain Arthur Pridham assumed command on 1 February 1936 and &quot;Hood&quot; returned to Portsmouth for a brief refit between 26 June and 10 October 1936. She formally transferred to the Mediterranean fleet on 20 October, shortly after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. On 23 April 1937, the ship escorted three British merchantmen into Bilbao harbour despite the presence of the Nationalist cruiser that attempted to blockade the port. &quot;Hood&quot; was refitted at Malta in November and December 1937, and had her submerged torpedo tubes removed. Captain Pridham was relieved by Captain Harold Walker on 20 May 1938 and he, in turn, was relieved when the ship returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August.

&quot;Hood&quot; was due to be modernised in 1941 to bring her up to a standard similar to that of other modernised First World War-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin gun turrets, and six octuple 2-pounder &quot;pom-poms&quot;. Her 5-inch upper-armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition, the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship&#x27;s near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy&#x27;s most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s, she was in need of a lengthy overhaul. The outbreak of the Second World War made removing her from service near impossible, and as a consequence, she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as &quot;Renown&quot; and several of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships. The ship&#x27;s condensers were in such bad condition by this time that much of the output from the fresh-water evaporators was required to replenish the boiler feedwater and could not be used by the crew to wash and bathe or even to heat the mess decks during cold weather, as the steam pipes were too leaky. These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.

==Second World War==
Captain Irvine Glennie assumed command in May 1939 and &quot;Hood&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet&#x27;s Battlecruiser Squadron while still refitting. When war broke out later that year, she was employed principally to patrol in the vicinity of Iceland and the Faroe Islands to protect convoys and intercept German merchant raiders and blockade runners attempting to break out into the Atlantic. On 25 September 1939, the Home Fleet sortied into the central North Sea to cover the return of the damaged submarine . The fleet was spotted by the Germans and attacked by aircraft from the KG 26 and KG 30 bomber wings. &quot;Hood&quot; was hit by a bomb from a Junkers Ju 88 bomber that damaged her port torpedo bulge and her condensers. By early 1940, &quot;Hood&quot;″s machinery was in dire shape and limited her best speed to ; she was refitted between 4 April and 12 June.

===Operation Catapult===

&quot;Hood&quot; and the aircraft carrier were ordered to Gibraltar to join Force H on 18 June where &quot;Hood&quot; became the flagship. Force H took part in the destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940. Just eight days after the French surrender, the British Admiralty issued an ultimatum that the French fleet at Oran intern its ships in a British or neutral port to ensure they would not fall into Axis hands. The terms were rejected, and the Royal Navy opened fire on the French ships berthed there. The results of &quot;Hood&quot;″s fire are not known exactly, but she damaged the , which was hit by four fifteen-inch shells and was forced to beach herself. &quot;Hood&quot; was during the engagement by &quot;Dunkerque&quot;; shell splinters wounded two men. &quot;Dunkerque&quot;″s sister ship, , managed to escape from the harbour. &quot;Hood&quot; and several light cruisers gave chase, but gave up after two hours; &quot;Hood&quot; had dodged a salvo of torpedoes from a French sloop and had damaged a turbine reaching .

===Return to home waters===
&quot;Hood&quot; was relieved as flagship of Force H by &quot;Renown&quot; on 10 August, after returning to Scapa Flow. On 13 September she was sent to Rosyth along with the battleships and and other ships, to be in a better position to intercept a German invasion fleet. When the threat of an invasion diminished, the ship resumed her previous roles in convoy escort and patrolling against German commerce raiders. &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were deployed to the Bay of Biscay on 5 November to prevent the heavy cruiser from using French ports after she had attacked Convoy HX 84, but the German ship continued into the South Atlantic.

In January 1941, the ship began a refit that lasted until March; even after the refit she was still in poor condition, but the threat from the German capital ships was such that she could not be taken into dock for a major overhaul until more of the battleships came into service. Captain Ralph Kerr assumed command during the refit, and &quot;Hood&quot; was ordered to sea in an attempt to intercept the German battleships and upon the refit&#x27;s completion in mid-March. Unsuccessful, she was ordered to patrol the Bay of Biscay against any breakout attempt by the German ships from Brest, France. &quot;Hood&quot; was ordered to the Norwegian Sea on 19 April when the Admiralty received a false report that the had sailed from Germany. Afterwards, she patrolled the North Atlantic before putting into Scapa Flow on 6 May.

===Battle of the Denmark Strait===
When &quot;Bismarck&quot; sailed for the Atlantic in May 1941, &quot;Hood&quot;, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland, together with the newly commissioned battleship , was sent out in pursuit along with several other groups of British capital ships to intercept the German ships before they could break into the Atlantic and attack Allied convoys. The German ships were spotted by two British heavy cruisers ( and ) on 23 May, and Holland&#x27;s ships intercepted &quot;Bismarck&quot; and her consort, the heavy cruiser , in the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland on 24 May.

The British squadron spotted the Germans at 05:37 (ship&#x27;s clocks were set four hours ahead of local time—the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already aware of their presence, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;″s hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with &quot;Hood&quot; engaging &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on &quot;Hood&quot;. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit &quot;Hood&quot;″s boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.

Just before 06:00, while &quot;Hood&quot; was turning 20° to port to unmask her rear turrets, she was hit again on the boat deck by one or more shells from &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s fifth salvo, fired from a range of approximately (or 10.3 mi.). A shell from this salvo appears to have hit the spotting top, as the boat deck was showered with body parts and debris. A huge jet of flame burst out of &quot;Hood&quot; from the vicinity of the mainmast, followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of &quot;Hood&quot;, and the last sight of the ship, which sank in only three minutes, was her bow, nearly vertical in the water.

Only three men survived: Ordinary Signalman Ted Briggs (1923–2008), Able Seaman Robert Tilburn (1921–1995), and Midshipman William John Dundas (1923–1965). The three were rescued about two hours after the sinking by the destroyer , which spotted substantial debris but no bodies.

===Aftermath of the sinking===
&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was forced to disengage by a combination of damage from German hits and mechanical failures in her guns and turrets after &quot;Hood&quot; was sunk. Despite these problems, she had hit &quot;Bismarck&quot; three times. One of these hits contaminated a good portion of the ship&#x27;s fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in occupied France where she could be repaired. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was temporarily able to evade detection, but was later spotted and sunk on 27 May.

The official Admiralty communiqué on the loss, broadcast on the day of the sinking, reported that: &quot;during the ... action, HMS &quot;Hood&quot; ... received an unlucky hit in a magazine and blew up.&quot; The first formal board of enquiry into the loss, presided over by Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Blake, reported on 2 June, less than a fortnight after the loss. It endorsed this opinion, stating that:
The Vice Chief of Naval Staff, Acting Vice-Admiral Tom Phillips and others criticised the conduct of the inquiry, largely because no verbatim record of witnesses&#x27; testimony had been kept. Moreover, Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction came forward with an alternative theory, that the &quot;Hood&quot; had been destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. As a result, a second Board was convened under Rear-Admiral Harold Walker and reported in September 1941. This investigation was, in the words of one author, &quot;much more thorough than was the first, taking evidence from a total of 176 eyewitnesses to the disaster&quot;, and examined both Goodall&#x27;s theory and others (see below). The Board came to a conclusion almost identical to that of the first board, expressed as follows:

Both boards of enquiry exonerated Vice-Admiral Holland from any blame regarding the loss of &quot;Hood&quot;.

Memorials to those who died are spread widely around the UK, and some of the crew are commemorated in different locations. One casualty, George David Spinner, is remembered on the Portsmouth Naval memorial, the &quot;Hood&quot; Chapel at the Church of St John the Baptist, in Boldre, Hampshire, and also on the gravestone of his brother, who died while serving in the Royal Air Force in 1942, in the Hamilton Road Cemetery, Deal, Kent.

==Modern theories on the sinking==
The exact cause of the loss of &quot;Hood&quot; remains a subject of debate. The principal theories include the following causes:
* A direct hit from a shell penetrated to a magazine aft. Such a shell could only have come from &quot;Bismarck&quot;, since &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was no longer firing at &quot;Hood&quot; at the time of the explosion. As noted above, this version of events was almost taken for granted at the time of the sinking. Doubt first arose as a result of eyewitness testimony that the explosion that destroyed &quot;Hood&quot; originated near the mainmast, well forward of the aft magazines (for example, the sketch shown prepared for the second board of enquiry by Captain Leach of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;).

At the second board, expert witnesses suggested that what was observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch shell magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.
* A shell, falling short and travelling underwater, struck below the armoured belt and penetrated a magazine. During the same action, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; received a hit of this type from a 15-inch shell, which travelled underwater for about , struck about below the waterline, penetrated several light bulkheads and fetched up, without exploding, against the torpedo bulkhead. The second board considered this theory improbable, arguing that the fuse, had it worked at all, would have detonated the shell before it reached the ship. According to Jurens&#x27;s calculations, one of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s shells that fell approximately short of &quot;Hood&quot; could have penetrated the side of the ship beneath the armour belt and would have detonated in the vicinity of the ship&#x27;s magazines if the fuse worked.
* The ship was destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall&#x27;s theory, the ship&#x27;s torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from &quot;Bismarck&quot;. This would have blown out the side of the ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section from the rest of the hull.
* The fire on the boat deck penetrated to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame could have been the ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through the floor of a 15-inch gunhouse.
* The explosion was initiated by 4-inch ammunition stored outside the magazines. Writing in 1979, the naval historian Antony Preston claimed that the aft magazines of &quot;Hood&quot; were &quot;surrounded by additional 4-inch (102 mm) anti-aircraft shells outside the armoured barbettes. Such unprotected stowage could have been detonated either by the boat-deck fire or by a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot;.&quot;
* The ship was blown up by her own guns. At the second board, eyewitnesses reported unusual types of discharge from the 15-inch guns of &quot;Hood&quot;, suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to prevent such an explosion reaching the magazines, could have failed.

An extensive review of these theories (excepting that of Preston) is given in Jurens&#x27;s 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that there are several ways this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens&#x27;s opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating &quot;Hood&quot;″s deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of &quot;Hood&quot; show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated if &quot;Hood&quot; had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.

Inspection of the wreck has confirmed that the aft magazines did indeed explode. The stern of the &quot;Hood&quot; was located, with the rudder still in place, and it was found that this was set to port at the time of the explosion. Furthermore, a section of the bow immediately forward of &#x27;A&#x27; turret is missing, which has led historian and former Dartmouth lecturer Eric J. Grove and expedition leader David Mearns to believe that &quot;either just before or just after leaving the surface, the bow suffered massive internal damage from an internal explosion&quot;, possibly a partial detonation of the forward 15-inch magazines.

It has been suggested that the fatal fire spread from the aft end of the ship through the starboard fuel tanks, since the starboard side of &quot;Hood&quot; &quot;appears to be missing most, if not all, of its torpedo bulge plating&quot;.

The evidence of the wreck refutes Goodall&#x27;s theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness evidence of venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with the theory that &quot;Hood&quot; was blown up by her own guns. The other theories listed above remain valid possibilities.

In their study of the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s operational history released in 2019, including its engagement with &quot;Hood&quot;, Jurens, William Garzke, and Robert O. Dulin Jr. concluded that &quot;Hood&quot;″s destruction was most likely caused by a 380-mm shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot; that penetrated the deck armour and exploded in the aft 4-inch magazine, igniting its cordite propellant, which in turn ignited the cordite in the adjacent aft 15-inch magazine. Rapid expansion of the resulting combustion gases from the conflagration then caused structural failure, passing out through the sides of the ship as well as forward and upwards via the engine room vents, expelling the aft main battery turrets and causing the stern to be detached from the rest of the hull at the aft armoured bulkhead.

==Wreck==
In 2001, British broadcaster Channel 4 commissioned shipwreck hunter David Mearns and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, to locate the wreck of &quot;Hood&quot;, and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, &quot;Bismarck&quot;. This was to be used for a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships&#x27; battle. This was the first time anyone had attempted to locate &quot;Hood&quot;″s resting place. Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of &quot;Hood&quot; with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS &quot;Hood&quot; Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, Ted Briggs.

The search team and equipment had to be organised within four months, to take advantage of a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to stream video from the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) directly to Channel 4&#x27;s website.

After footage of &quot;Bismarck&quot; was collected, Mearns and the search team began scanning a search box for &quot;Hood&quot;; completely covering the area was estimated to take six days. Areas that Mearns felt were more likely to hold the wreck were prioritised, and the side-scan sonar located the battlecruiser in the 39th hour of the search.

&quot;Hood&quot;″s wreck lies on the seabed in pieces among two debris fields at a depth of about . The eastern field includes the small piece of the stern that survived the magazine explosion, as well as the surviving section of the bow and some smaller remains, such as the propellers. The 4-inch fire-control director lies in the western debris field. The heavily armoured conning tower is located by itself, a distance from the main wreck. The amidships section, the biggest part of the wreck to survive the explosions, lies inverted south of the eastern debris field in a large impact crater. The starboard side of the amidships section is missing down to the inner wall of the fuel tanks and the plates of the hull are curling outward; this has been interpreted as indicating the path of the explosion through the starboard fuel tanks.

It is further supposed that the small debris fields are the fragments from the aft hull where the magazines and turrets were located, since that section of the hull was totally destroyed in the explosion. The fact that the bow section separated just forward of &#x27;A&#x27; turret is suggestive that a secondary explosion might have occurred in this area. Other researchers have claimed that the final salvo fired by &quot;Hood&quot; was not a salvo at all, but flame from the forward magazine explosion, which gave the illusion of &quot;Hood&quot; firing for the last time. This damage, ahead of the armoured bulkhead, could have been implosion damage suffered while &quot;Hood&quot; sank, as a torpedo room that had been removed during one of her last refits approximates the site of the break.

It was the opinion of Mearns and White who investigated the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points out that there was no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship&#x27;s structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates at the edge of the break reflects only their last position, not the direction they had first moved.

The forward section lies on its port side, with the amidships section keel up. The stern section rises from the seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship&#x27;s heading and bring the aft turrets &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; to bear on the German ships.

In 2002, the site was officially designated a war grave by the British government. As such, it remains a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act of 1986.

===Expeditions to retrieve ship&#x27;s bell===
In 2012, the British government gave permission for Mearns to return to the site of &quot;Hood&quot;″s final resting place to retrieve one of her two ship&#x27;s bells which were lying in a small open debris field some way from the wreck herself. With the backing of the HMS &quot;Hood&quot; Association, Mearns planned to return the bell to Portsmouth where it would form part of the first official and permanent memorial to the sacrifice of her last crew at the newly refitted National Museum of the Royal Navy.

The expedition also took the opportunity to re-film the wreck and survey her using techniques unavailable in 2001. As before, with the exception of the attempted retrieval of the ship&#x27;s bell, a strict look-but-do not-touch policy was adhered to. The original attempt, sponsored by Paul Allen and using his yacht &quot;Octopus&quot;, was abandoned after ten days in September 2012 due to unfavourable weather conditions. In 2015, the same team attempted a second recovery operation and &quot;Hood&quot;″s bell was retrieved on 7 August 2015. After conservation work, Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, unveiled the bell at the museum on 24 May 2016 – the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The bell was rung eight times in a commemorative service at midday attended by descendants of crew members who died in the battle before being placed in the museum&#x27;s exhibit on the Battle of Jutland.

The recovered bell was originally carried on the pre-dreadnought battleship . Before being installed on the battlecruiser, the bell was inscribed around its base with the words: &quot;This bell was preserved from HMS &quot;Hood&quot; battleship 1891–1914 by the late Rear Admiral, The Honourable Sir Horace Hood KCB, DSO, MVO killed at Jutland on 31st May 1916.&quot; Ironically, Hood was killed when his ship HMS Invincible suffered an explosion resulting from a hit to the forward magazine, similar to the hit that would doom HMS Hood. There is a second inscription on the side of the bell that reads &quot;In accordance with the wishes of Lady Hood it was presented in memory of her husband to HMS &quot;Hood&quot; battle cruiser the ship she launched 22nd August 1918.&quot; In addition to the two inscriptions, the bell still wears vivid royal blue paint work on its crown as well as its interior.

===Surviving relics===
Some relics from the time of &quot;Hood&quot;″s sinking still exist. A large fragment of the wooden transom from one of &quot;Hood&quot;″s boats was washed up in Norway after her loss and is preserved in the National Maritime Museum in London. A metal container holding administrative papers was discovered washed ashore on the Norwegian island of Senja in April 1942, almost a year after the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The container and its contents were subsequently lost, but its lid survived and was eventually presented to the Royal Navy shore establishment HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; in 1981.

Other surviving relics are items that were removed from the ship prior to her sinking:

====5.5-inch guns====
Two of &quot;Hood&quot;″s 5.5-inch guns were removed during a refit in 1935, and shipped to Ascension Island, where they were installed as a shore battery in 1941, sited on a hill above the port and main settlement, Georgetown, where they remain. The guns were restored by the RAF in 1984.

The Ascension Island guns saw action only once, on 9 December 1941, when they fired on the , as it approached Georgetown on the surface to shell the cable station or sink any ships at anchor. No hits were scored, but the submarine crash-dived and retreated.

====Fragments of propeller====
As a result of a collision off the coast of Spain on 23 January 1935, one of &quot;Hood&quot;″s propellers struck the bow of &quot;Renown&quot;. While dry-docked for repairs, &quot;Renown&quot; had fragments of this propeller removed from her bilge section. The pieces of the propeller were kept by dockyard workers: &quot;&quot;Hood&quot; v &quot;Renown&quot; Jan. 23rd. 1935&quot; was stamped on one surviving example, and &quot;Hood V Renown off Arosa 23–1–35&quot; on another. Of the known surviving pieces, one is privately held and another was given by the Hood family to the &quot;Hood&quot; Association in 2006. A third piece was found in Glasgow, where &quot;Hood&quot; was built. It is held by a private collector and stamped &quot;HMS HOOD v HMS RENOWN 23 1 35&quot;.

<doc id="491767" wikidata="Q493960" url="?curid=491767" title="Flag Desecration Amendment">
<text>The Flag Desecration Amendment (often referred to as the Flag-Burning Amendment) is a proposed addition to the Constitution of the United States that would allow the U.S. Congress to prohibit by statute and provide punishment for the physical &quot;desecration&quot; of the flag of the United States. The concept of flag desecration continues to provoke a heated debate over protecting a national symbol, preserving free speech, and upholding the liberty said to be represented by that national symbol. While the proposal passed by the two-thirds majority required in the House of Representatives several times, in each instance it failed to attain the same required super-majority in the Senate, or was never voted upon in the Senate at all.

While the proposed amendment is frequently referred to colloquially in terms of expression of political views through &quot;flag burning&quot;, the language would permit the prohibition of all forms of flag desecration, which may take forms other than burning, such as using the flag for clothing or napkins.

The most recent legislative attempt to propose a flag desecration amendment to come to a vote in both the House and Senate in the same congressional session failed in the Senate by one vote on June 27, 2006. Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) introduced a joint resolution to make it an unconstitutional ban on flag burning on June 14, 2019, and received support from the Trump administration, but the resolution was unsuccessful. Daines reintroduced the resolution on June 14, 2021.

==Historical background==
The first federal Flag Protection Act was passed by Congress in 1968 in response to protest burnings of the flag at demonstrations against the Vietnam War. Over time, 48 of the 50 U.S. states also enacted similar flag protection laws. In 1989, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned all of these statutes by a 5–4 vote in the case &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot; as unconstitutional restrictions of public expression. Congress responded to the &quot;Johnson&quot; decision afterwards by passing another flag protection act. In 1990, the Supreme Court reaffirmed &quot;Johnson&quot; by the same 5–4 majority in &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot; declaring that flag burning was constitutionally protected free speech.

In both cases, William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the majority opinion, joined by Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy (Kennedy also authored a separate concurrence in &quot;Johnson&quot;), and the dissenters in both cases were then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist (who authored a dissent in &quot;Johnson&quot;), and justices John Paul Stevens (who authored dissents in both cases), Byron White and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor.

The decisions were controversial and have prompted Congress to consider the only remaining legal avenue to enact flag protection statutes—a constitutional amendment. Following the &quot;Johnson&quot; decision, successive sessions of Congress considered creating a flag desecration amendment. From 1995 to 2005, beginning with the 104th Congress, the proposed amendment was approved biennially by the two-thirds majority necessary in the U.S. House of Representatives, but it consistently failed to achieve the same constitutionally required super-majority vote in the U.S. Senate. During some sessions, the proposed amendment did not even come to a vote in the Senate before the expiration of the Congress&#x27; term. In June 2006 during the 109th Congress, the amendment failed by one vote in the Senate. Some Senate Republican aides indicated that almost a dozen of the Republican senators who voted for the amendment were privately opposed to it, and they believed that these senators would have voted to defeat the amendment if required.

==Proposed amendment==
The full text of the amendment (passed several times by the U.S. House of Representatives) is as follows:

This proposed amendment would empower Congress to enact statutes criminalizing the burning or other &quot;desecration&quot; of the United States flag in a public protest. The wording is permissive rather than mandatory; that is, it permits Congress to prohibit flag burning, but it does not require it. The question of whether flag burning should be banned would become a matter for the legislature to decide, rather than the courts.

Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed. Opponents maintain that giving Congress such power would essentially limit the principle of freedom of speech, enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and symbolized by the flag itself.

The theories underlying these First Amendment principles include: a robust national discourse about political and social ideas; individual self-realization; the search for truth; and speech as a &quot;safety valve&quot;. These concepts are expounded in both the majority and dissenting opinions of the cases described below. There Justice William J. Brennan Jr. noted that the &quot;principal function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute; it may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.&quot;

==Polls==
A USA Today/Gallup Poll in June 2006 has shown 56% supporting a constitutional amendment, down from 63% favoring a flag burning amendment in Gallup&#x27;s 1999 poll. Another poll conducted by CNN in June 2006 also found that 56% of Americans supported a flag desecration amendment. In contrast, a summer 2005 poll by the First Amendment Center found that 63% of Americans opposed amending the constitution to outlaw flag burning, up from 53% in 2004.

A June 2020 YouGov poll found that 49% think it should be illegal to burn or intentionally destroy the flag, while 34% said it should be legal.

===Congressional votes===
During each term of Congress from 1995 to 2005, the proposed amendment was passed by the House of Representatives, but not the Senate, falling four votes short on two occasions in the upper house. As approved by the House of Representatives each time, the joint resolutions called for ratification by state legislatures, of which a minimum of 38 state legislative approvals would be required (three-fourths of the 50 states), within a period of seven years following the proposal by both houses of Congress. As can be seen by the votes in the House of Representatives, support for the amendment appears to be slipping with only 286 &#x27;yea&#x27; votes during the 109th Congress in 2005, in contrast to the 312 &#x27;yea&#x27; votes almost a decade earlier during the 104th.

The chronology of the Congress&#x27; action upon the flag-desecration amendment runs over a period of more than ten years:

To be added to the Constitution, it must be approved by a two-thirds vote of those present and voting in both houses of Congress, as well as be ratified by at least three-fourths of either (1) the 50 state legislatures or (2) ratifying conventions in each of the 50 states (Congress has the power to choose the mode of ratification). Senators had until the end of 2006 to take action on H.J. Res. 10 during the remainder of the 109th Congress. On March 7, 2006, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist announced that he would bring the bill for consideration in June 2006. On Monday, June 26, 2006, the Senate began debate on the proposed amendment. The following day, the amendment, sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch, fell one vote short in the Senate, with 66 in support and 34 opposed. The Republican nay votes were Bob Bennett (UT), Lincoln Chafee (RI), and Mitch McConnell (KY). The vote on Senator Richard Durbin&#x27;s alternative amendment, which would have given Congress the power to ban flag desecration intended to intimidate or breach peace on federal land, was 36–64. Opponents pointed to the proximity of the vote to the November 7, 2006 Congressional Election, and claimed that the vote (and a recent vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment) was election year grandstanding.

==Potential interpretations of the amendment==
In 2005, the First Amendment Center published a report titled &quot;Implementing a Flag-Desecration Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: An end to the controversy ... or a new beginning?&quot; The report pointed out that the effect of the proposed amendment would likely be challenged on collateral matters in ways that will require the courts, and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court, to parse the exact meaning of ambiguous terms contained therein. The focus of the report was on the meanings that would be assigned to the phrases, &quot;physical desecration&quot; and &quot;flag of the United States&quot;.
The phrase &quot;physical desecration&quot; might be open to various interpretations concerning the uncertainty of the context of desecration. For example, uncertainty exists over whether the term includes the wearing of the flag as clothing, as a tattoo, or flying a flag upside-down. It is uncertain what can be interpreted as &quot;physical desecration&quot;. Does it require that the flag be physically damaged, or made to appear damaged? It is also unclear whether &quot;virtual flag desecration&quot; (which could be defined as an artistic depiction of flag desecration, a computerized simulation of flag desecration, or burning any object which has a flag on it) would be subject to the amendment. There is also the question whether the perpetrator of such an act is required to have a specific intent to &quot;desecrate&quot; to be prosecuted. The Report of the 108th Congress, in proposing this amendment, stated:

... &#x27;desecrate&#x27; means deface, damage, or otherwise physically mistreat in a way that the actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons likely to observe or discover his action...

This seems to suggest that the amendment will apply only to acts where the actor intends offense.

Since the amendment would allow prohibition against only &quot;the flag of the United States&quot;, it could be construed as only applying to flags that are the &quot;property&quot; of the United States government, as opposed to personal or private property. This language could also be interpreted as being limited to flags that meet the exact specifications for the United States flag laid out in federal law. It is unclear what effect the amendment would have with respect to former flags of the United States, such as the 48-star flag that preceded the admission of Alaska and Hawaii, or the original 13-star Betsy Ross flag, or how far from the traditional definition of a flag a symbol could deviate (for example, having orange stripes instead of red) before falling out of the ambit of the amendment&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The First Amendment Center concluded that the Supreme Court was likely to interpret this language narrowly, resulting in decisions that would not satisfy either proponents or opponents of the proposed amendment. These questions would necessarily await the interpretative role of the courts, and such a process would likely require several years for the resolution of each issue.

<doc id="491775" wikidata="Q2339134" url="?curid=491775" title="John Ball (golfer)">
<text>John Ball Jr (24 December 1861 – 2 December 1940) was an English amateur golfer of the late 19th and early 20th century.

==Early life==
Ball was born in Hoylake, Cheshire (now Merseyside). His father was the prosperous owner of the Royal Hotel, located near the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, in Hoylake. Ball grew up playing golf as a youth on the Royal Liverpool course, which was established in his early boyhood.

In 1878, at the age of 16, Ball finished fifth in The Open at Prestwick. His run of Amateur titles began in 1888 and stretched until 1912, when he was 51 years old. His best year was 1890, when he won both the Amateur and Open Championships. Bobby Jones, who won the Grand Slam in 1930, is the only other golfer in history to win those two tournaments in the same year.

==Golf career==
After winning The Amateur Championship in 1888, Ball became the first English-born player to win The Open Championship in 1890, and in the same year won his second Amateur, the first to win both titles in the same year. Ball subsequently won the 1892, 1894, 1899, 1907, 1910, and 1912 Amateurs, a record eight titles in all, in addition to two runner-up finishes. Ball also won four Irish Amateur titles. He retired with a 99–22 record (81.8%) at The Amateur Championship. Ball was also runner-up in the 1892 Open Championship, finishing three strokes behind Harold Hilton.

Ball dominated amateur golf in Great Britain. He won all the important golf championships as well as the hearts and respect of his country. In the words of British golf historian Donald Steele, &quot;No golfer ever came to be more of a legend in his own lifetime.&quot;

Although he gripped the club tightly in the palms of both hands, Ball&#x27;s swing was the most graceful and stylish of his era. Bernard Darwin wrote, &quot;I have derived greater aesthetic and emotional pleasure from watching John Ball than from any other spectacle in the game.&quot; Ball learned the game competing against Harold Hilton on the links at Hoylake. In 1878, at the age of 16, he competed in his first Open Championship and finished fourth at Prestwick.
Ball was famous for refusing to carry a niblick, which had the loft of a modern-day 8- or 9-iron. He scorned the use of that club, describing it as &quot;another bloody spade,&quot; and admonished the Rules of Golf Committee of the Royal and Ancient for permitting such horrid-looking contraptions to be allowed in competition. In a bunker, Ball would simply lay open the blade of a mid-iron and float the ball toward the hole with a smooth swing. He disliked the introduction of the increasing number of shallow cross bunkers to many courses, often parkland courses, calling them in derisory terms, &#x27; geranium beds&#x27;.

It was this stubbornness and dogged determination that made Ball such a lion in match play. Darwin once noted that Ball had &quot;a strong vein of hostility and if he wanted a particular player&#x27;s blood, he would fight his way through a tournament with the sole object of getting at him.&quot; Darwin added, &quot;That was not a personal hostility, but rather a desire to measure himself against a foe really worthy of him.&quot;

Words from Ball are hard to find. He was a shy, modest man who went about his business promptly without wasted motion. In his book, &quot;Sixty Years of Golf&quot;, Robert Harris wrote that &quot;John&#x27;s soft, whispering voice, his stoicism, his pawky jibs at easy rules and innovations, his relentless criticism of moderns with their fuss, and his total outlook on the game, were the very essence of golf.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Ball died in Holywell, Wales, on 2 December 1940. Ball served his country during the Second Boer War. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1977, and in 2018 a blue plaque was installed at Royal Liverpool Golf Club to commemorate his achievements.

<doc id="491776" wikidata="Q3067766" url="?curid=491776" title="Fleadh Cheoil">
<text>The Fleadh Cheoil (), or &quot;music festival&quot; in English, is an annual Irish arts festival and competition run by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (), or CCÉ, a non-profit organisation which aims to promote the learning of and performance of Irish traditional music and dance internationally and domestically, as the group maintains international branches in several countries. 

Each year, a different town or city plays host to the &quot;Fleadh Cheoil&quot;, facilitating exposure to new musicians and styles, as well as opportunities to discover new repertoire, for all in attendance. Over the decades, the Fleadh has been held everywhere from large cities and towns to rural villages, such as Mullingar, Sligo, and Tullamore, among many others. The competition, arguably the most prestigious and &quot;serious&quot; portion of the event, is held alongside a parade, countless impromptu jam sessions and performing musicians—many of global renown and previous All-Ireland winners, themselves. The public music sessions—which occur spontaneously at the festival and throughout the hosting town—are often a highlight of the Fleadh for many, involving musicians on street corners, in pubs, restaurants, or other public places. Competitors and attendees of the Fleadh Cheoil come from across the whole of Ireland, as well as many European countries, the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and more.

There are various stages within the competition, with varying degrees of local, prerequisite titles one must accomplish before competing at the Fleadh. In Ireland, there are county and provincial competitions leading to the Fleadh.

Competitions are in solo and duo categories, and divided into the following age ranges: under 12, 12–15, 15–18, over 18 (senior),U,18, Any Age, U-18, U-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15, 15-18 (for Cómhra) and O-35.The Fleadh Cheoil (Irish pronunciation: [ˌfʲlʲaː ˈçoːlʲ]), or &quot;music festival&quot; in English, is an annual Irish arts festival and competition run by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (Irish pronunciation: [ˈkoːl̪ˠt̪ˠəsˠ ˈcoːl̪ˠt̪ˠoːɾʲiː ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ]), or CCÉ, a non-profit organisation which aims to promote the learning of and performance of Irish traditional music and dance internationally and domestically, as the group maintains international branches in several countries.

== Fleadhanna around the world ==

=== Great Britain ===
Since its establishment in 1957, Comhaltas in Britain holds regional fleadhanna followed by a national Fleadh called the All-Britain Fleadh, or Fleadh Cheoil na Breataine in Irish, stages of qualification prior to the All-Ireland. The organisation&#x27;s charitable status was recognised in 2019 in England and Wales, followed by charity registration in Scotland in 2024. 

=== America ===
The North American branches of CCÉ oversee two regional, pre-All-Ireland qualifying events: the Mid-Atlantic Fleadh (for residents of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, as well as eastern Canada and the Maritimes) and the Midwest Fleadh (catering to most of the rest of North America). The latter event is not restricted to the American Midwest specifically, as it caters to regions with historically prominent Irish populations and associated music scenes, such as Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco and St. Louis, among others. Upon winning in a respective category at any of these festivals, one may be considered for entry into the All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil, the most prestigious level of the system.

==History==
The first national festival of Irish traditional music was held in Mullingar in 1951. At its inaugural meeting in September 1951, CCÉ came up with the title of Fleadh Cheoil, aiming to make this a great national festival of traditional music. The fleadh has been held in many different venues.

In the years that followed, the number of would-be competitors grew so large that qualifying stages had to be arranged at county and provincial levels. Since then, Fleadh Nua (the new fleadh), Fleadh na Breataine (an All-Britain fleadh) and regional Fleadhanna in Britain, and two major Fleadhanna in the USA have also become annual CCÉ events.

From its beginning, the goal of the Fleadh Cheoil was to establish standards in Irish traditional music through competition. The fleadh developed as a mainly competitive event, but it also included many concerts, , parades, and sessions.

Today, nearly 55 years on, fleadhanna (plural of fleadh) at each level provide a platform and a meeting place for the thousands of musicians, singers and dancers who carry on the tradition. Around 20,000 performers compete in Fleadhanna each year.

The 2008 festival was held in Tullamore, County Offaly and attracted an estimated crowd of 250,000 people making it Ireland&#x27;s largest festival, music or otherwise. The Fleadh came to Sligo in 2014 and 2015.

The 2016 festival was held in Ennis, County Clare and attracted an estimated crowd of 400,000 people over the nine days from 14 to 22 August. Among the visitors to the 2016 Fleadh was President Michael D Higgins, who went to school near Ennis. 10,000 musicians took part in 2016, with 6,000 of them participating in 180 All-Ireland competitions. An estimated €38 million was spent as 80,000 visitors were in Ennis at any one time. There were 28 concerts, with five held in the 2,000-seater Shannon Aerodome at Tim Smythe Park in the town. 
The 2017 Fleadh Cheoil returned to Ennis from 13 to 21 August. The 2017 festival was opened by Michael Flatley, and over 450,000 people attended, peaking on the Saturday. 

The largest fleadh to date was 2024 in Wexford, an event estimated to have attracted over 650,000 people. The 2023 Fleadh Cheoil in Mullingar held the record before Wexford, totaling 600,000 attendees. 

==Competition categories==
According to CCÉ&#x27;s official rules for 2005:

: Solo competitions are held for the following instruments: fiddle, button accordion, flute, whistle, piano accordion, concertina, uileann pipes, Irish harp, mouth organ, banjo, mandolin, piano, melodeon, miscellaneous (instruments not named here), accompaniment, Bódhrán and Céilí Drums. 
: Solo competitions for slow airs shall be held for the following instruments: fiddle; uileann pipes, flute, whistle and Irish harp.

There are also competitions for the following ensembles: duet, trio, Céilí band, instrumental group (), accordion band, pipe band, flute band and miscellaneous ensemble.

The full rule set, which may change from year to year, is available from CCÉ web site in the Press Room section. Comhaltas has a constitution () in the Irish language.

==Application==
Towns and cities wishing to host Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann must submit several applications to Ardchomhairle an Chomaltais – the highest committee within CCÉ. Certain members of the Ardchomhairle then inspect the applicant towns and the locations that have been proposed as competition venues, before coming to a final decision several weeks after the preceding fleadh, usually in September. Once a town has been chosen to host the Fleadh, it undertakes to host the festival for two consecutive years. However, Comhaltas has the right to deny any the successful town the Fleadh for the second year if poor venues, organisational problems, etc. are demonstrated on the town&#x27;s first year of hosting. On 10 September 2011, the 2012 All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil was awarded to Cavan, County Cavan, for the third year in succession. The other towns who applied for the 2012 festival were Ennis, County Clare; and Sligo, County Sligo. The Fleadh was held in Derry in 2013, the first time that it was held in Northern Ireland. One of the primary reasons for holding the Fleadh in Derry was due to that city being awarded the UK City of Culture for 2013. In 2014, it was confirmed that the Fleadh Cheoil would be held in Sligo for 2014 and 2015. Ennis hosted the Fleadh in August 2016 and 2017, with Drogheda hosting in 2018 and 2019. Mullingar were the planned hosts for 2020 and 2021 (cancelled due to COVID-19 in Ireland), and finally hosted in 2022, the first in-person Fleadh Cheoil since 2019. An online &quot;FleadhFest&quot; took place in 2021, with a showpiece in Sligo. The 2023 All-Ireland Fleadh also took place in Mullingar for a second consecutive year; Belfast and Wexford made unsuccessful bids to host the event in 2023. However in 2024, it moved to Wexford. It will return to Wexford in August 2025.

<doc id="491777" wikidata="Q957519" url="?curid=491777" title="John Ball (naturalist)">
<text>John Ball (20 August 1818 – 21 October 1889) was an Irish politician, naturalist and Alpine traveller.

==Background and education==
Ball was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Nicholas Ball, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) and his wife Jane Sherlock. He was educated at Oscott College near Birmingham, and at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was 41st Wrangler but as a Roman Catholic could not be admitted to a BA degree. He showed in his early years a taste for natural science, particularly botany; and after leaving Cambridge he travelled in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe and North Africa, studying his favourite pursuits, and contributing papers on botany and the Swiss glaciers to scientific periodicals.

==Political career==
In 1846 Ball was made an assistant poor-law commissioner, but resigned in 1847, and in 1848 stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for Sligo. In 1849 he was appointed second poor-law commissioner, but resigned in 1852 and successfully contested the County Carlow constituency in the Whig interest. In 1854, while grave doubts were raised in well-informed quarters about entering a war with Russia, the voice of the people found expression in Ball who assured the government that justification of the Crimean war was vast, high and noble: &#x27;the maintenance in civilised society of the principles of right and justice&#x27;. In the British House of Commons he attracted Lord Palmerston&#x27;s attention by his abilities, and in 1855 was made Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, a post which he held for two years.

At the colonial office he had great influence in furthering the cause of natural science, particularly in connection with equipment of the Palliser Expedition in Canada (for his efforts, the Ball Range in the Canadian Rockies was named after him), and with William Jackson Hooker&#x27;s efforts to obtain a systematic knowledge of the colonial floras.

==Alpinist==

In 1858 Ball stood for County Limerick, but was defeated, and he then gave up politics and devoted himself to natural history. He was the first president of the Alpine Club (founded 1857), and it is for his work as an alpinist that he is chiefly remembered. His well-known &quot;Alpine Guide&quot; (London, 1863–1868) was the result of innumerable climbs and journeys and of careful observation recorded in a clear and often entertaining style. Among his accomplishments, he was the first to climb a major Dolomites peak (Monte Pelmo in 1857). He also travelled in Morocco (1871) and South America (1882), and recorded his observations in books which were recognised as having scientific value.

==Personal life==
His wife was Elisa Parolini, daughter of the Italian naturalist Alberto Parolini. Ball died in London in October 1889, aged 71.

<text>John Ball (October 1585 – 20 October 1640) was an English puritan divine.

==Life==

He was born in Cassington, Oxfordshire.

After taking his BA degree from St Mary Hall, Oxford, in 1608, he went into Cheshire to act as tutor to the children of Lady Cholmondeley. He adopted Puritan views, and after being ordained without subscription, was appointed to the small curacy of Whitmore in Staffordshire. He was soon deprived by John Bridgeman, the high church bishop of Chester, who put him to much suffering.

He became a schoolmaster and earned a wide and high reputation for his scholarship and piety. He died on 20 October 1640.

==Works==

The most popular of his numerous works was &quot;A Short Catechisme, containing all the Principal Grounds of Religion&quot; (14 editions before 1632). His &quot;Treatise of Faith&quot; (1632), and &quot;Friendly Trial of the Grounds tending to Separation&quot; (1640), the latter of which defines his position with regard to the church, are also valuable. His &quot;A Tryall of the New-Church Way in New-England and Old&quot;, written in 1637 but published in 1644, was a reply to the responses of the New England puritans to nine questions which he had posed to them concerning the constitution and doctrine of their churches. His &quot;Treatise of the Covenant of Grace&quot; (1645) was also published posthumously.

<text>John Ball ( 1338 – 15 July 1381) was an English priest who took a prominent part in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. Although he is often associated with John Wycliffe and the Lollard movement, Ball was actively preaching &quot;articles contrary to the faith of the church&quot; at least a decade before Wycliffe started attracting attention.

==Biography==
It is possible that John Ball was the son of William and Joan Ball of Peldon near Colchester. He was born and it has been suggested that his name is first mentioned in the Colchester Court Rolls of 30 January 1352, when, on coming of age in 1350 he acknowledged the tenancy of a tenement between East and West Stockwell Street in the town. Whether this is the John Ball from the Peasants&#x27; Revolt is not clear and others see this among the &quot;speculative attempts&quot; at reconstructing Ball&#x27;s early life.

Ball trained as a priest in York and referred to himself, according to Thomas Walsingham, as &quot;Seynte Marie priest of York&quot;. He later moved to Norwich and to Colchester. At that time, England was exhausted by death on a massive scale and crippling taxes. The Black Death was followed by years of war, which had to be paid for. The population was nearly halved by disease, and overworked, and onerous flat-rate poll taxes were imposed.

Ball was imprisoned in Maidstone, Kent, at the time of the 1381 Revolt. What is recorded of his adult life comes from hostile sources emanating from the religious and political social order. He is said to have gained considerable fame as a roving preacher without a parish or any link to the established order by expounding the doctrines of John Wycliffe, and especially by his insistence on social equality. He delivered radical sermons in many places, including Ashen, Billericay, Bocking, Braintree, Cressing Temple, Dedham, Coggeshall, Fobbing, Goldhanger, Great Baddow, Little Henny, Stisted and Waltham.

His utterances brought him into conflict with Simon of Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was thrown in prison on several occasions. He also appears to have been excommunicated; owing to which, in 1366 it was forbidden for anyone to hear him preach. These measures, however, did not moderate his opinions, nor diminish his popularity, and he took to speaking to parishioners in churchyards after official services.
Shortly after the Peasants&#x27; Revolt began, Ball was released by the Kentish rebels from his prison. He preached to them at Blackheath (the peasants&#x27; rendezvous to the south of Greenwich) in an open-air sermon that included the following:

When the rebels had dispersed, Ball was taken prisoner at Coventry, given a trial in which, unlike most, he was permitted to speak. He was hanged, drawn and quartered at St Albans in the presence of King Richard II on 15 July 1381. His head was displayed stuck on a pike on London Bridge, and the quarters of his body were displayed at four different towns. Called by Froissart &quot;the mad priest of Kent,&quot; Ball seems to have possessed the gift of rhyme. He voiced the feelings of a section of the discontented lower orders of society at that time, who chafed at villeinage and the lords&#x27; rights of unpaid labour, or &quot;corvée&quot;.

== John Ball in popular culture ==
Historian James Crossley has shown that Ball was largely portrayed negatively for four centuries after his death in theological works, plays, poems, and popular histories. After the 1790s, Ball became a hero for radicals, revolutionaries, socialists, and communists as well as becoming a more respected figure in English history and a recurring figure in novels.

Ball is also mentioned at John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; line 793. Morley translates this as:

&lt;poem&gt; 
Ball was the preacher, the prophet and teacher, inspired by a spirit of hell,
And every fool advanced in his school, to be taught as the devil thought well.&lt;/poem&gt;

Ball appears as a character in the anonymous play &quot;The Life and Death of Jack Straw&quot;, published in London in 1593, which deals with the events of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt.
William Morris wrote a short story called &quot;A Dream of John Ball&quot;, which was serialised in the &quot;Commonweal&quot; between November 1886 and February 1887. It was published in book form in 1888.

Ball appears in the historical novel &quot;Robert Annys: A Poor Priest&quot; (1901) by Annie Nathan Meyer. Ball appears as a sympathetic character in the novel &quot;Long Will&quot; (1903) by Florence Converse.

There is a steep hill on the A5199 road in Leicestershire, between Shearsby and Husbands Bosworth, that is colloquially called &quot;John Ball Hill&quot;.

A tower chapel at the parish church of Thaxted in Essex was dedicated to John Ball under the Anglo-Catholic socialist vicar, Conrad Noel (1910–1942).

&quot;The Bedfordshire on Sunday&quot;, a free local newspaper based in Bedford, runs a weekly column by a fictional journalist called &quot;John Ball&#x27;s Diary&quot;, which features behind-the-scenes life in the office of the newspaper. The column is written by all the members of the editorial staff.

John Ball appears in the 1954 historical novel &quot;Katherine&quot; by Anya Seton.

Ball made an appearance in the Newbery Medal-winning 2002 novel &quot;&quot;. He was a priest, as he usually is, and was assisting a character by the name of Bear in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381.

John Ball is referenced several times in T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, most prominently in the fourth book, &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot;. In the final chapter (14), King Arthur muses on his failure to unite England. King Arthur tries to understand what forces are at work that make mankind fight wars and references the &quot;communism&quot; of John Ball as a precursor to Mordred&#x27;s Thrashers.

John Ball&#x27;s line, &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?&quot; serves as the epigraph to Zadie Smith&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;NW&quot;, which follows characters who grew up on a council estate in northwest London.

In Act V Scene 1 of Hamlet, Shakespeare has the Gravedigger (First Clown) discuss the line &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?&quot; with a bit of a reversed sense: in Adam&#x27;s time there were none but gentlemen.

&lt;poem&gt;
First Clown: ... Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam&#x27;s profession.

Second Clown: Was he a gentleman?

First Clown: He was the first that ever bore arms.

Second Clown: Why, he had none.

First Clown: What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The 
Scripture says &#x27;Adam digged:&#x27; could he dig without arms?
&lt;/poem&gt;

English songwriter Sydney Carter wrote an eponymously titled song about Ball that has been recorded by a number of artists. &#x27;Sing John Ball&#x27; is regularly performed in the UK by folk musicians including The Young&#x27;uns, The Melrose Quartet, and in 2015 the group Sweet Liberties performed the song in the Houses of Parliament.

<text>Assendelft () is a town in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. It is a part of the municipality of Zaanstad. Assendelft was a separate municipality until 1974, when the municipality of Zaanstad was formed. However, Assendelft didn&#x27;t want to be part of Zaanstad and pled together with Krommenie to be part of a new municipality called Krommenie-Assendelft. Zaanstad is part of the Amsterdam Agglomeration (GA).

The North Sea Canal connects Assendelft with Amsterdam and Velsen, and it lies about 13 km northeast of Haarlem and about 15 km south of Alkmaar. 

== History ==
Assendelft is one of the oldest settlements in North Holland, with signs of settlement dating from as early as 500BC. The earliest written form of the name appears as &#x27;Ascmannedilf&#x27; in 1063. The name is derived from the old Germanic word for Norsemen, &#x27;Ascomanni&#x27;, &#x27;dilf&#x27; most likely meaning &#x27;dug by&#x27;.

==Train services==

The town is served by Krommenie-Assendelft railway station. From here, there are four trains an hour to Amsterdam, with a journey time of 25 minutes.

==Rural culture==

<text>Koog aan de Zaan () is a town in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Zaanstad, and lies about 11 km northwest of Amsterdam.

== History ==
Koog aan de Zaan developed in the 16th century on the western bank of the Zaan River from Westzaan. In 1867, the Koog aan de Zaan railway station opened and in the 1870s, it started to industrialise and fill-in the area before the river and the station.

The Dutch Reformed church is an aisleless cruciform church which was built in 1685. The tower burnt down in 1920, and the church was restored between 1920 and 1922.

Koog aan de Zaan was a separate municipality until 1974, when the municipality of Zaanstad was created. Koog aan de Zaan is one of the smallest submunicipalities in Zaanstad, having a surface area of 320 hectare.

A8ernA, an urban renewal project for the space under the A8 motorway as it passes through Koog aan de Zaan, was a joint winner of the 2006 European Prize for Urban Public Space.

==Trains==

There are two small stations within the borders of Koog aan de Zaan. These are:

* Koog aan de Zaan railway station, which serves Koog aan de Zaan itself.
* Zaandijk Zaanse Schans railway station, which mainly serves Zaandijk and the Zaanse Schans, an open-air museum nearby in Zaandijk.

Zaandam railway station is the nearest main station. For Purmerend, Hoorn and Enkhuizen use Zaandam Kogerveld railway station.

<text>Krommenie () is a town in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Zaanstad, and lies about 15 km northeast of Haarlem.

==History==
Krommenie developed in the 11th century as a peat excavation settlement. In 1702, it severely damaged by fire. During the 19th century, Krommenie started to industrialise.

The Dutch Reformed church is a single aisled church from the 15th century. It was severely damaged in 1574 by fire and extensively modified and restored between 1657 and 1658. The Old Catholic Church was built in 1602 as a clandestine church in a farm. It was enlarged in 1633 and modified in 1826.

Krommenie was a separate municipality until 1974, when the new municipality of Zaanstad was created.

Krommenie is the first town in the world to have a solar bikepath (SolaRoad), a path made of a transparent surface over solar cells to generate electricity fed back to the grid. The path, over 70 meters long, was to test engineering feasibility.

==Train services==
The town is served by Krommenie-Assendelft railway station. From here there are 4 trains an hour to Amsterdam in one direction and Uitgeest – Alkmaar in the other, with a journey time of 25 minutes.

<text>John Ball (November 12, 1794 – February 5, 1884) was a settler, educator, lawyer and member of the Michigan State Legislature.

==Early life==
Ball was born at Tenny Hill, Hebron, Grafton County, New Hampshire. He had a common school education that he got from short times at winter with a local clergyman when his father would let him leave his tough labors at the farm. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1820, having started there as a student when he was 21. He studied law two years at Lansingburgh, New York and then went to Darien, Georgia where he was shipwrecked and taught school for the winter of 1822–23 to earn his passage back to New York. He was admitted to the bar in 1824.

Ball&#x27;s sister Deborah married William Powers who set up an oil cloth factory in New York. When William Powers died Deborah continued to run the factory and hired Ball as foreman who at that point left his law practice.

==Oregon==
As a member of Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth&#x27;s first expedition, in 1832 he traveled to the Oregon Country. While overwintering at Fort Vancouver from 1832 to 1833, he was employed by John McLoughlin to teach the children of the fort. The Chief Factor told the New Englander that &quot;you will have the reputation of teaching the first school in Oregon&quot;, making him the first white teacher of Oregon. In the spring of 1833 McLoughlin tried to convince the American to continue running the school, but Ball desired to begin practicing agriculture.

McLoughlin gave Ball farming equipment, potatoes, corn, 25 bushels of wheat. Ball and a friend departed in March to the Salem, Oregon area and temporarily resided with retired HBC employee Jean Baptiste Depatie McKay. With help from his white neighbors and a &quot;wild Indian&quot; he planted, raised and harvested a wheat crop. This made him the first American to farm on the French Prairie, several French-Canadians having already begun farming operations some years prior. By September he described being tired of living a &quot;primitive life&quot; and interacting with the Kalapuya people. To afford passage back to the United States of America, Ball sold his wheat crop to McLoughlin to travel aboard a HBC vessel, the Dryad. He returned via the Hawaiian Islands and Cape Horn in 1833–34.

==Later life==

Despite returning to his hometown of Lansingburgh, Ball settled at Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1837. He opened a law office and partnered with, among others, the George Martin, formerly Chief Justice of Michigan and Solomon Lewis Withey, late United States District Judge. Ball represented eastern capitalists in locating lands during the &quot;wildcat banking&quot; era.

In 1842 he was appointed by Governor John Barry to select 300,000 acres (1,200 km2) of the 500,000 acres (2,000 km2) of land granted to Michigan by Congress for internal improvements. These were mainly selected about Grand Rapids and were mostly taken up with internal improvement warrants, and as these warrants could be bought for about forty cents on the dollar, it resulted in a speedy settlement of the Grand River Valley. Ball was a strong promoter of Grand Rapids. He was interested in schools, geology, lyceums and all local enterprises; he provided the first written account of the geology of Oregon. Ball was a key figure in creating Michigan&#x27;s public school system.

In politics he was a conservative Democrat and served in the Michigan State Legislature.

He donated the land in Grand Rapids, Michigan that is now John Ball Park and John Ball Zoo.

<text>A position line or line of position (LOP) is a line (or, on the surface of the Earth, a curve) that can be both identified on a chart (nautical chart or aeronautical chart) and translated to the surface of the Earth. The intersection of a minimum of two position lines is a fix that is used in position fixing to identify a navigator&#x27;s location.

There are several types of position line:
* Compass bearing – the angle between north and the line passing through the compass and the point of interest
* Transit – a line passing through the observer and two other reference points
* Leading line – the line passing through two marks indicating a safe channel
* Leading lights – the line passing through two beacons indicating a safe channel
* Sector lights – the lines created by masked colored lights that indicate a safe channel

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1994.

* In Germany, a new Article 182 introduces a common age of consent of 14. Previously, the age of consent was 18 in the former West Germany (for sex between men), and 14 in the former East Germany for all.
* In the United Kingdom, the age of consent for gay men is reduced to 18, still two years more than that for heterosexuals.

===January===

* 27 — The Interim Constitution of South Africa comes into force, including a clause explicitly prohibiting discrimination (both government and private) on the basis of sexual orientation.

<doc id="491818" wikidata="Q16153334" url="?curid=491818" title="2004 North Carolina Council of State election">
<text>Elections to choose members of the North Carolina Council of State (who head executive branch departments) were held on Tuesday, November 2, 2004. The U.S. Presidential election, U.S. House election, U.S. Senate election, the North Carolina General Assembly election, and North Carolina judicial elections were all held on the same day.

In all but two races (Superintendent of Public Instruction and Labor Commissioner), incumbent Democrats sought re-election and Democrats held both. However, two Democratic incumbents lost for Auditor and Agriculture Commissioner.

==Governor==
The general election was between the Democratic incumbent Mike Easley and the Republican nominee Patrick J. Ballantine. Easley won by 56% to 43%, winning his second term as governor.

==Lieutenant Governor== 


The 2004 North Carolina lieutenant governor election was held on November 2, 2004, as part of the elections to the Council of State. North Carolina also held a gubernatorial election on the same day, but the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected independently. Incumbent Bev Perdue was re-elected with 55% of the vote.

==Secretary of State==


Incumbent Democratic Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated both a primary challenge from Doris A. Sanders and from Republican challenger Jay Rao.

==State Auditor==


Les Merritt, a former Wake County commissioner, and 2000 candidate, narrowly defeated 3-term incumbent State Auditor Ralph Campbell.

==Attorney General==

North Carolina&#x27;s incumbent Attorney General, Roy Cooper, defeated Republican challenger Joe Knott.

==State Treasurer==


Incumbent State Treasurer Richard H. Moore defeated Republican challenger Edward Meyer by an eight-point margin.

==Superintendent of Public Instruction==
===Results of November 2, 2004===


===General Assembly vote of August 24, 2005===



With the resignation of Mike Ward, the Superintendent of Public Instruction race was the only 2004 Council of State contest in which there was no incumbent; consequently both major parties saw contested primaries. On the Republican side, former Wake County board of education member Bill Fletcher easily bested retired professor Jeanne Smoot. The Democratic primary between state Department of Instruction official June Atkinson, North Carolina Board of Education member J. B. Buxton and state agricultural education coordinator Marshall Stewart led to a second primary. Stewart polled narrowly ahead of Atkinson in the first primary, but failed to capture the 40% support needed to take the nomination. In a statewide runoff primary, Atkinson captured the Democratic nomination.

The race, along with the race for Agriculture Commissioner (see below) was caught up for nearly a month in a statewide recount because of the narrow margin. Fletcher argued that provisional ballots, required under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 for federal races, were improperly counted in state races under North Carolina law. However, on 30 November 2004, the State Board of Elections certified Atkinson the winner. Fletcher appealed the recision to the North Carolina Supreme Court. Atkinson, in turn, petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to resolve the disputed election. On August 24, 2005, the General Assembly met in a joint session to vote on the disputed election, as the state constitution called for. Atkinson won this vote and was sworn in that afternoon.

The election of the Superintendent of Public Instruction was the last American election from 2004 to be decided.

==North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture==


Interim Agriculture Commissioner Britt Cobb defeated former state representative Tom Gilmore to take the Democratic nomination; Steve Troxler, the 2000 candidate for this position, was unopposed for the Republican nomination.

Due to the loss of about 4,000 votes in Carteret County, North Carolina, the race for State Agriculture Commissioner could not be resolved for several months. Although the North Carolina Board of Elections certified the close race for State Superintendent of Public Instruction on 30 November 2004, they reached an impasse on the Agriculture Commissioner Race, splitting 3–2 in favor of calling a new statewide election for the seat over calling a new election in Carteret County alone; 4 votes would have been required to take action on either option.

In early December, the North Carolina Board of Elections ordered a new election for January 11, 2005, in Carteret County alone, for voters whose ballots had been lost or who had not voted in the November 2 election. Both candidates appealed the decision, Cobb arguing that a statewide revote should be held, Troxler arguing that a revote should be limited to those voters whose votes were lost. A Wake County superior court judge overturned this decision on December 17, calling it &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; and &quot;contrary to law&quot;, requiring the State Board of Elections to revisit the issue.

On December 29, the State Board of Elections ordered a new statewide election for the post. On January 13, 2005, the superior court invalidated this order as well, and sent the contest back to the Elections Board for resolution. Following this ruling, Cobb conceded defeat. On February 4, the State Board of Elections officially certified Troxler as the winner of the 2004 election.

==Commissioner of Labor==


Incumbent Cherie Berry, the only sitting Republican on the Council of State, defeated both a primary challenge from Lloyd T. Funderburg and a general election challenge from state representative Wayne Goodwin.

==State Insurance Commissioner==


Five-term incumbent Jim Long defeated a challenge from Republican C. Robert Brawley to win the greatest number of votes for any candidate in the 2004 Council of State elections.

<text>A working dog is a dog used to perform practical tasks, as opposed to pet or companion dogs.

Definitions vary on what a working dog is, they are sometimes described as any dog trained for and employed in meaningful work; other times as any dog whose breed heritage or physical characteristics lend itself to working irrespective of an individual animal&#x27;s training or employment; and other times again it is used as a synonym for herding dog.

== Working dog types ==
Roles performed by dogs that sometimes sees them classified as working dogs include:
* Assistance or service dog trained to help a disabled person in some way, such as guiding a visually impaired person, providing mobility assistance, and psychiatric service. Often overlap with Therapy dog used to provide companionship or to help people rehabilitate from injuries.
* Carriage dog historically used to provide protection to carriage passengers or merchandise 
* Detection dog or sniffer dog, trained to detect for example drugs or land mines.

==Working dogs in Australia==

Working dogs are known as an Australian icon. They are prevalent in Australia due to the large agricultural industry. Working dogs can be seen herding cattle or sheep and are also used to guard poultry from foxes and cats. A report in 2019 stated that there were over 270,000 stock herding dogs in Australia. Some popular breeds for farm work include Border Collies, Kelpies, Maremmas and Australian Cattle Dogs.

Events to showcase the skills of working dogs are held through Australia alongside key local festivals and events. Trials and performances include high jumps, sheepdog speed trials and sled or weighted pulls.

==Kennel club classification==

When competing in conformation shows, a number of kennel clubs classify various pedigree dog breeds into a &quot;working group&quot; or &quot;working dogs group&quot;, although it varies between kennel club what breeds are so classified. The Kennel Club classifies mastiff, pinscher, sled dog, select livestock guardian dog and some other breeds in their working group. The American Kennel Club&#x27;s working group and the Canadian Kennel Club&#x27;s working dogs group are very similar to The Kennel Club&#x27;s except they include all livestock guardian dog breeds and all full sized spitz breeds (not just sled dogs) recognised by the clubs. Both the Australian National Kennel Council&#x27;s and New Zealand Kennel Club&#x27;s working dogs groups comprise herding dog breeds and select livestock guardian dog breeds recognised by those clubs. The Fédération cynologique internationale has no working group.

<text>Johannes &quot;Hans&quot; Bouwens (born 8 December 1944), known as George Baker, is a Dutch singer and songwriter who, with his band George Baker Selection, scored three international hits; &quot;Little Green Bag&quot; (1969), &quot;Paloma Blanca&quot; (1975) and &quot;Santa Lucia by Night&quot; (1985).

==Childhood==
Bouwens was born near the end of World War II on 8 December 1944 as the son of a single mother on the Gravenstraat in Hoorn, at or near the location where Jan Pieterszoon Coen was born in 1587. Months before Bouwens was born, his father, Peppino Caruso, a former Italian soldier from Calabria put to labor by the Germans in nearby Grosthuizen, had been killed while attempting to escape when he was to be transferred to Germany. Bouwens was raised by his mother and his grandparents, Willemke Woudstra and Johannes Bouwens (1886–1952), first in Hoorn and from 1957 on the Wandelweg in Wormerveer. There, he sang and played guitar in a schoolband (&quot;The Jokers&quot;) with Bob Ketzer, but at the age of 14 he left school and took jobs unloading ships on the Zaan and eventually as a factory worker at a lemonade factory. In 1961, he took the stage name &quot;Body&quot; and formed the band &quot;Body and the Wild Cats&quot;, with Bob Ketzer and his brother Ruud as well as Gerrit Bruyn on bass, all from Wormerveer.

==George Baker Selection==

In 1968, Bouwens joined the band Soul Invention, a soul band which was founded the previous year by Henk Kramer in Assendelft and played covers of songs by Otis Redding and Sam and Dave. The band consisted of Job Netten (guitar), Henk Kramer and Eric Bardoen (saxophone), Jacques Greuter (keyboard and flute), Theo Vermast and later Jan Visser (bass), and Ton Vredenburg (drums). Visser and Bouwens wrote the song &quot;Little Green Bag&quot; in the summer of 1969. The band recorded their first album in September 1969, after which, considering this was not soul music, they changed their name to The George Baker Selection, Bouwens naming himself for a character from a detective novel. This first album, &quot;Little Green Bag&quot; (1970), produced an immediate worldwide hit: their debut single, &quot;Little Green Bag,&quot; reached No. 16 on the Cash Box magazine chart and No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. The success came as a surprise for Baker, who remembers hearing it on the radio while he was working in a lemonade factory. The single sold over one million copies globally, and received a gold disc. 

A string of singles and albums followed; the second single, &quot;Dear Ann&quot;, was such a success that Baker resigned from his job in the lemonade factory and became a full-time musician. Not all band members followed suit, and besides Bouwens, the &quot;Selection&quot; from mid 1970 was formed by Jan Visser, Jan Hop (drums), Jacques Greuter and George Thé (voice, guitar, bass). In March 1971 Jan Visser left the band to be replaced by Cor Veerman. Besides scoring hits with his own Selection, he also wrote songs for others, including BZN, The Shoes, Andy Star, and Next One. In 1974, singer Lida Bond joined the Selection, and combining her voice with Baker&#x27;s proved highly successful.

The Selection&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Paloma Blanca,&quot; was released in 1975, and the single &quot;Paloma Blanca&quot; reached No. 1 on charts in several countries. By this time Nelleke Brzoskowsky was the singer; she had joined in 1975. &quot;Paloma Blanca&quot; sold more than seven million copies worldwide, making it one of the most successful Dutch singles ever.

In 1978, Baker disbanded the Selection because &quot;the pressure had become too much.&quot; The band has sold over 20 million records worldwide. However, Baker formed a new George Baker Selection in 1985, which stayed together until 1989. The second version of the Selection has released twelve albums and several compilation albums.

Baker was one of the artists who recorded the song &quot;Shalom from Holland&quot; (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991.

The Selection experienced a brief return to the international charts in 1992 when the song &quot;Little Green Bag&quot; was used in the title sequence of the film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Little Green Bag&quot; was used in the fadeout of some episodes of series two of the Australian drama &quot;LOVE CHILD.&quot; In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Baker recorded new versions for commercials by Lidl supermarket chainstore.

==Solo career==
After he disbanded the Selection in 1978, Baker performed as a solo artist till 1985, when he briefly returned with a new roster of the Selection. In 1989, he returned to solo work. In 2005, he released a remix of the song &quot;Paloma Blanca&quot; for the film &quot;Too Fat Too Furious.&quot; As a solo artist, he had released nine albums as of early September 2017. He was managed by Jaap Buijs, who died in 2015.

<text>Fania Borach (October 29, 1891 – May 29, 1951), known professionally as Fanny Brice or Fannie Brice, was an American comedian, illustrated song model, singer, and actress who made many stage, radio, and film appearances. She is known as the creator and star of the top-rated radio comedy series &quot;The Baby Snooks Show&quot;.

Her life story was loosely adapted into the stage musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. Brice was famously portrayed by Barbra Streisand in both the original Broadway production of the musical and its 1968 film adaptation.

==Early life==
Fania Borach was born in Manhattan, New York City, United States, the third child of Rose (née Stern; 1867–1941), a Jewish Hungarian woman who immigrated to the U.S. at age 10, and Alsatian immigrant Charles Borach. The Borachs were saloon owners and had four children: Phillip, born in 1887; Carrie, born in 1889; Fania, born in 1891; and Louis, born in 1893. Under the name Lew Brice, her younger brother also became an entertainer and was the first husband of actress Mae Clarke.

In 1908, Brice dropped out of school to work in a burlesque revue, &quot;The Girls from Happy Land Starring Sliding Billy Watson&quot;. Two years later, she began her association with Florenz Ziegfeld, headlining his &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; in 1910 and 1911. She was hired again in 1921 and performed in the &quot;Follies&quot; into the 1930s. 

In the 1921 &quot;Follies&quot;, she was featured singing &quot;My Man&quot;, which became both a big hit and her signature song. She made a popular recording of it for the Victor Talking Machine Company. The second song most associated with Brice is &quot;Second Hand Rose&quot;, which she also introduced in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1921&quot;.

She recorded nearly two dozen record sides for Victor, and also cut several for Columbia Records. She is a posthumous recipient of a Grammy Hall of Fame Award for her 1921 recording of &quot;My Man&quot;.

Brice&#x27;s Broadway credits include &quot;Fioretta&quot;, &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;, and &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Crazy Quilt&quot;. Her films include &quot;My Man&quot; (1928, a lost film), &quot;Be Yourself!&quot; (1930), and &quot;Everybody Sing&quot; (1938) with Judy Garland. Brice, Ann Pennington, and Harriet Hoctor were the only original Ziegfeld performers to portray themselves in &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936) and &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946).

==Radio==

Brice&#x27;s first radio show was the &quot;Philco Hour&quot; in February 1930. Brice&#x27;s first regular radio show was probably &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;, a 30-minute program which ran on Wednesday nights at 8 pm in 1933.

From the 1930s until her death in 1951, Fanny made a radio presence as a bratty toddler named Snooks, a role she had premiered in a &quot;Follies&quot; skit co-written by playwright Moss Hart. Baby Snooks premiered in &quot;The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air&quot; in February 1936 on CBS, with Alan Reed playing Lancelot Higgins, her beleaguered &quot;Daddy.&quot; Brice moved to NBC in December 1937, performing the Snooks routines as part of the &quot;Good News&quot; show, then back to CBS on &quot;Maxwell House Coffee Time&quot;, with the half-hour divided between the Snooks sketches and actor Frank Morgan.

By September 1944, Brice&#x27;s sketch writers Philip Rapp and David Freedman brought in Arthur Stander and Everett Freeman, who developed a half-hour comedy program, &quot;Post Toasties Time&quot;, later &quot;The Baby Snooks Show&quot;. Produced by Everett Freeman, it launched on CBS in 1944, moving to NBC in 1948. Hanley Stafford played the Daddy and Fannie Brice the main character, Baby Snooks. Other co-stars included Lalive Brownell, Lois Corbet, and Arlene Harris each in turn as her mother, Danny Thomas as Jerry, Charlie Cantor as Uncle Louie, and Ken Christy as Mr. Weemish.

She returned on Tallulah Bankhead&#x27;s big-budget, large-scale radio variety show &quot;The Big Show&quot; in November 1950, sharing the bill with Groucho Marx and Jane Powell.

==Television appearance==
Fanny Brice&#x27;s only appearance on television was on June 12, 1950, in a performance on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Popsicle Parade of Stars&quot;, as Baby Snooks.

==Later years==
Fanny Brice resided in a house built in 1938 on North Faring Road in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, designed by the architect John Elgin Woolf (1908-1980). The house was entirely gutted and rebuilt from the foundation up between 2001 and 2008.

==Personal life==
Brice had a short-lived marriage in her late teens to a barber, Frank White, whom she met in 1910 in Springfield, Massachusetts, when she was touring in &quot;College Girl.&quot; The marriage lasted three years and she brought suit for divorce in 1913.
Her second husband was professional gambler and con man Nicky Arnstein. Brice and Arnstein lived together for three years before he was convicted of a wiretapping swindle in 1915. Brice visited Arnstein in prison every week during the 14 months he served in Sing Sing, pawned her jewelry to pay for appeals and eventually secured him a pardon. They were married in 1918, one week after Arnstein obtained a divorce from his first wife. In 1920, Arnstein was charged with conspiracy to sell $5 million of stolen Wall Street bonds. Brice insisted on his innocence and funded his legal defense at great expense and the case went to the Supreme Court while Arnstein remained free on bail. Eventually Arnstein was sentenced to two years in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth. Arnstein was released December 22, 1925 with 72 days time off for good behavior and joined Brice in Chicago where she was performing. Brice divorced him in Chicago on September 14, 1927 on grounds of infidelity and loss of affection. They had two children: Frances (1919–1992), who married film producer Ray Stark, and William (1921–2008), who became an artist using his mother&#x27;s surname. Ray Stark later went on to produce the stage musical and film &quot;Funny Girl&quot; loosely based on the life of Fanny. Stark also produced a follow-up film &quot;Funny Lady&quot;.

Brice wed lyricist and stage producer Billy Rose in 1929 and appeared in his revue &quot;Crazy Quilt&quot;, among others. Brice sued Rose for divorce in 1938.

==Death==

Six months after her &quot;Big Show&quot; appearance, on May 29, 1951, Brice died at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Hollywood from a cerebral hemorrhage at 11:15 am; she was 59. She was interred at Home of Peace Memorial Park but in 1999 her remains were relocated to 
Westwood Village Memorial Park.

==Legacy==

For her contributions to the film and radio industries, Brice was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with two stars. Her motion-pictures star is located at 6415 Hollywood Boulevard, while her radio star is located at 1500 Vine Street.

The Stony Brook campus of the State University of New York (SUNY at Stony Brook) had a Fannie Brice Theatre, a 75-seat venue that was used for a variety of performances, including a 1988 production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, staged readings, and a studio classroom space. 

Mexican comedian Maria Elena Saldana was influenced by Brice and created a character similar to Brice&#x27;s Baby Snooks, La Guereja. 
In 1991, the US Postal Service featured Brice on a first-class stamp, the only woman included as part of a &quot;Comedian Commemorative Issue&quot;, illustrated by Al Hirschfeld.

In 2006, Brice was featured in the film &quot;Making Trouble-Three Generations of Funny Jewish Women&quot;, a tribute to Jewish women comedians produced by the Jewish Women&#x27;s Archive.

&quot;Fanny&#x27;s&quot;, the restaurant in the Academy Museum in Los Angeles is named after Fanny Brice.

=== Brice portrayals ===
The 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Quentin Quail&quot; features a character based on Brice&#x27;s characterization of Baby Snooks.

Barbra Streisand starred as Brice in the 1964 Broadway musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, which centered on Brice&#x27;s rise to fame and troubled relationship with Arnstein. In 1969, Streisand won an Academy Award for Best Actress for reprising her role in the film version. The 1975 film sequel, &quot;Funny Lady&quot;, focused on Brice&#x27;s turbulent relationship with impresario Billy Rose and was as highly fictionalized as the original film. Streisand also recorded the Brice songs &quot;My Man&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Blue Over You (Than Happy with Somebody Else)&quot;; and &quot;Second Hand Rose&quot;, which reached &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top 40.

&quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and its sequel &quot;Funny Lady&quot;, took liberties with the events of Brice&#x27;s life. They make no mention of Brice&#x27;s first husband and suggest that Arnstein turned to crime because his pride would not allow him to live off Fanny and that he was wanted by the police for selling phony bonds. In reality, however, Arnstein sponged off Brice even before their marriage, and was eventually named as a member of a gang that stole $5 million worth of Wall Street securities. Instead of turning himself in, as in the movie, Arnstein went into hiding. When he finally surrendered, he did not plead guilty as he did in the movie, but fought the charges, taking a toll on his wife&#x27;s finances.

Beanie Feldstein starred as Brice in the Broadway revival of &quot;Funny Girl,&quot; which opened in April 2022. Lea Michele replaced Feldstein on September 6, 2022. 

Though an actress does not portray Brice, her name is mentioned in three scenes of a movie that was successful at the box office and merited two Academy Award nominations: &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; (2018). The protagonist, Lee Israel, portrayed by Melissa McCarthy, is a biographer who hopes she can get paid to work on a project about Brice&#x27;s life. Her literary agent Marjorie, portrayed by Jane Curtin, tells her sharply that that is not going to happen. Marjorie shouts at Lee, &quot;Nobody wants a book about Fanny Brice! There is nothing new or sexy about Fanny Brice! I couldn&#x27;t get you a ten-dollar advance for a book about Fanny Brice.&quot;

Kimberly Faye Greenberg originated the role of Fanny Brice in &quot;One Night With Fanny Brice&quot; Off-Broadway at St. Luke&#x27;s Theatre, NYC (2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;archive/one-night-2010-OCR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg has also played Brice in three other shows. These portrayals of Fanny Brice include &quot;Speakeasy Dollhouse: Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic&quot; at Broadway&#x27;s Liberty Theatre, NY (2015); 

Other recent portrayals of Fanny Brice were in &quot;Ghostlight&quot; at the New York Musical Theatre Festival at the Signature Theatre, NYC (2011); and in the solo show &quot;Fabulous Fanny: The Songs &amp; Stories of Fanny Brice&quot;, which has been touring the United States since 2014 and is streaming on the Stellar Platform.

<doc id="491827" wikidata="Q3715633" url="?curid=491827" title="Duality (Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke album)">
<text>Duality is a collaborative album by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke released in 1998. It was Lisa Gerrard&#x27;s second post-Dead Can Dance album after &quot;The Mirror Pool&quot; from 1995. Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry released their last album in 1996 and had officially disbanded Dead Can Dance earlier in 1998.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best World Music Album.

==Overview==
The beginning of the song &quot;Shadow Magnet&quot; influenced, in part, the music at the beginning of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; soundtrack (music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard). The track &quot;Nadir (Synchronicity)&quot; was initially intended for use at the end of that film. However, due to copyright issues, a song &#x27;influenced&#x27; by this track was used instead.

&quot;Tempest&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot; were used for the &quot;Insider&quot; soundtrack.

==Track listing==
All tracks by Pieter Bourke and Lisa Gerrard except where noted.

<doc id="491834" wikidata="Q2269863" url="?curid=491834" title="North Carolina Senate">
<text>The North Carolina Senate is the upper chamber of the North Carolina General Assembly, which along with the North Carolina House of Representatives—the lower chamber—comprises the state legislature of North Carolina. The Senate has 50 members, and the term of office for each senator is two years.

The Senate&#x27;s prerogatives and powers are similar to those of the other house, the House of Representatives. Its members do, however, represent districts that are larger than those of their colleagues in the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, but the lieutenant governor has very limited powers and only votes to break a tie. Before the office of lieutenant governor was created in 1868, the Senate was presided over by a &quot;speaker.&quot; After the 1988 election of James Carson Gardner, the first Republican lieutenant governor since Reconstruction, Democrats in control of the Senate shifted most of the power held by the lieutenant governor to the senator who is elected president pro tempore (or pro-tem). The president pro tempore appoints members to standing committees of the Senate, and holds great sway over bills.

According to the state constitution, the Senate is also the &quot;Court for the Trial of Impeachments&quot;. The House of Representatives has the power to impeach state officials, after which the Senate holds an impeachment trial, as in the federal system. If the governor or lieutenant governor is the official who has been impeached, the chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court presides.

==History==
During the Reconstruction era, African Americans served in the state senate (African American officeholders from the end of the Civil War until before 1900). By 1874 four African Americans, all Republicans, were in the body as Democrats had already regained a large majority 38 to 12. In 1920, Loula Roberts Platt, became the first woman to run for a seat in the state senate.

==Qualifications==
The qualifications to be a senator are found in the state Constitution: &quot;Each Senator, at the time of his election, shall be not less than 25 years of age, shall be a qualified voter of the State, and shall have resided in the State as a citizen for two years and in the district for which he is chosen for one year immediately preceding his election.&quot;

<text>The North Carolina House of Representatives is one of the two houses of the North Carolina General Assembly. The House is a 120-member body led by a Speaker of the House, who holds powers similar to those of the President pro-tem in the North Carolina Senate. Representatives serve two-year terms.

The qualifications to be a member of the House are found in the state Constitution: &quot;Each Representative, at the time of his election, shall be a qualified voter of the State, and shall have resided in the district for which he is chosen for one year immediately preceding his election.&quot; Elsewhere, the constitution specifies that qualified voters that are 21 are eligible for candidacy except if otherwise disqualified by the constitution, and that no elected officials may deny the existence of God, although the latter provision is no longer enforced.

Prior to the Constitution of 1868, the lower house of the North Carolina Legislature was known as the North Carolina House of Commons.

<text>Leslie Merritt Jr. (born November 19, 1951) is an American accountant and politician. A Republican, he served as the State Auditor of North Carolina from January 15, 2005 to January 10, 2009. Merrit was born in Sampson County. After graduating from college and marrying he moved to Zebulon and ran an accounting firm. He served on the Wake County Board of Commissioners from 1994 to 1998. He ran for the office of State Auditor of North Carolina in 2000 and lost, but was elected four years later. He lost a reelection bid four years later.

== Early life ==
Leslie Merritt was born on November 19, 1951 in Sampson County, North Carolina, United States. He graduated from Union High School in 1970 and earned a Bachelor of Science in economics and accounting at North Carolina State University. He married and had two children. Following his marriage and the completion of his college degree, he and his wife moved to Zebulon. In 1984 he became owner of an accounting firm, Merritt, Petway, Mills and Hockaday, managing it until 2004.

== Political career ==
=== Wake County Board of Commissioners ===
Merritt, a member of the Republican Party, ran for a seat on the Wake County Board of Commissioners in 1994, defeating Democrat Thurston Debnam. He served on the commission from December 5, 1994 to 1998.

=== State Auditor of North Carolina ===
Merrit challenged Democratic incumbent Ralph Campbell Jr. in the 2000 election for the office of North Carolina State Auditor. Campbell collected a significant amount of his campaign contributions from Atlanta-area donors, where his brother Bill was serving as mayor. Merritt, attempted to tie Ralph Campbell to a federal corruption investigation into Atlanta&#x27;s city government and turned over his campaign financial disclosures to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Campbell won over Merritt in November with 51 percent of the vote. Merritt ran again in 2004, receiving about 28,000 more votes Campbell and winning the election.

Merritt assumed the office of State Auditor of North Carolina on January 15, 2005. He was the first Certified Public Accountant to serve as State Auditor of North Carolina. Shortly after he took office, North Carolina Senate Majority Leader Tony Rand, fearing that Merrit would seek out legislators&#x27; emails, filed a bill that barred the auditor&#x27;s office from accessing legislature computers. Two Democrats in the North Carolina House of Representatives subsequently introduced a bill which prohibited the office from accessing any state government computers and assigned their responsibility to the state chief technology officer. The Democratic legislators denied the move was politically-motivated, though some Republican members of the General Assembly believed such. Merritt attributed the proposals to misunderstandings, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to get to know them, and they&#x27;ve got to get to know me&quot;. He opposed the latter measure, saying the technology officer could not conduct an independent audit of state computers since they were appointed by the governor. He also began an audit into the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles to investigate the strength of its driver&#x27;s license application process, and declared his support for the adoption of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights and zero-based budgeting for all state agencies.

In 2007 Merritt convinced the Senate to delay passage of a measure which would permit citizens to register to vote and cast a ballot immediately before an election, citing a risk of voter fraud. The State Board of Elections denounced his warnings as flawed and Merritt yielded. He later said, &quot;I think there was a better way to handle that. It wasn&#x27;t partisan, but it sure did lead into some accusations.&quot; He objected to the complete privatization of the state&#x27;s mental health care network, saying &quot;It should have been a pilot program. [...] We have to go back and build that safety net.&quot; In 2008 Merritt began a public dispute with the North Carolina State Ethics Commission over its handling of investigations into Lieutenant Governor Bev Perdue and State Senator Martin Nesbitt, accusing the body of giving the two preferential treatment. The General Assembly ended the feud by passing legislation which limited the auditor&#x27;s purview concerning ethics disclosures. His office later found that Perdue and State Treasurer Richard H. Moore had misused official resources to support their own political campaigns.

On October 31, 2008, Merritt delivered an audit of various overseas trips First Lady of North Carolina Mary P. Easley. The trips cost $110,000 and were intended to secure art loans and promote cultural exchange. Merritt found that $45,000 of the overseas charges were &quot;unreasonable&quot; and of minimal benefit to the state. The audit was released days before the 2008 state elections, leading Merritt&#x27;s opponent, Democrat Beth Wood, to accuse him of politicizing his office. She defeated him in November by over 290,000 votes. Political observers were surprised by Merritt&#x27;s defeat. He left office on January 10, 2009.

=== Later activities ===
In February 2009, Merritt formed an investment consulting firm, Merritt Wealth Strategies, with his son. From May 2009 to April 2011, Merritt served as the executive director of the Foundation For Ethics in Public Service, a conservative organization that sought to promote ethical standards for public officials. On January 1, 2013, he was appointed to the North Carolina State Ethics Commission by Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger. On May 13, he was contracted by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to serve as chief financial officer for the state Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services. After journalists from WRAL-TV questioned whether this created a conflict of interest, Merritt resigned from the ethics commission.

<text>Tegea (; ) was a settlement in ancient Arcadia, and it is also a former municipality in Arcadia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the Tripoli municipality, of which it is a municipal unit with an area of 118.350 km2. It is near the modern villages of Alea and Episkopi.

The legendary founder of Tegea was Tegeates, a son of Lycaon.

==History==
Tegea (; ) was one of the most ancient and powerful towns of ancient Arcadia, situated in the southeast of the country. Its territory, called Tegeatis (Τεγεᾶτις), was bounded by Cynuria and Argolis on the east, from which it was separated by Mount Parthenium, by Laconia on the south, by the Arcadian district of Maenalia on the west, and by the territory of Mantineia on the north. The Tegeatae are said to have derived their name from Tegeates, a son of Lycaon, and to have dwelt originally in eight, afterwards nine, demoi or townships. In the Archaic period the nine demoi that underlie Tegea banded together in a synoecism to form one city; the inhabitants of the demoi were incorporated, by Aleus in the city of Tegea, of which this hero was the reputed founder. The names of these nine townships, which are preserved by Pausanias, are: Gareatae (Γαρεᾶται), Phylaceis (Φυλακεῖς), Caryatae (Καρυᾶται), Corytheis (Κορυθεῖς), Potachidae (Πωταχίδαι), Oeatae (Οἰᾶται), Manthyreis (Μανθυρεῖς), Echeuetheis (Εχευήθεἱς), to which Apheidantes (Ἀφείδαντες) was added as the ninth in the reign of king Apheidas. The Tegeatae were early divided into 4 tribes (phylai) (φυλαί), called respectively Clareotis (Κλαρεῶτις, in inscriptions Κραριῶτις), Hippothoitis (Ἱπποθοῖτις), Apolloneatis (Ἀπολλωνεᾶτις), and Athoneatis (Ἀθανεᾶτις), to each of which belonged a certain number of metoeci (μέτοικοι) or resident aliens.

Tegea is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as one of the places whose troops are led by Agapenor. It was probably the most celebrated of all the Arcadian towns in the earliest times. This appears from its heroic renown, since its king Echemus is said to have slain Hyllus, the son of Heracles, in single combat. The Tegeatae offered a long-continued and successful resistance to the Spartans, when the latter attempted to extend their dominion over Arcadia. In one of the wars between the two peoples, Chariläus or Charillus, king of Sparta, deceived by an oracle which appeared to promise victory to the Spartans, invaded Tegeatis, and was not only defeated, but was taken prisoner with all his men who had survived the battle. More than two centuries afterwards, in the reign of Leon and Agesicles, the Spartans again fought unsuccessfully against the Tegeatae; but in the following generation, in the time of their king Anaxandridas II, the Spartans, having obtained possession of the bones of Orestes in accordance with an oracle, defeated the Tegeatae and compelled them to acknowledge the supremacy of Sparta, about 560 BC. Thus, Tegea&#x27;s struggle against Spartan hegemony in Arcadia came to an end, and it was forced into some form of collaboration, maybe as one of the earliest members of what would become the Sparta-centered Peloponnesian League.

Tegea, however, still retained its independence, though its military force was at the disposal of Sparta; and in the Greco-Persian Wars it appears as the second military power in the Peloponnesus, having the place of honour on the left wing of the allied army. Five hundred of the Tegeatae fought at the Battle of Thermopylae, and 3000 at the Battle of Plataea, half of their force consisting of hoplites and half of light-armed troops. As it was not usual to send the whole force of a state upon a distant march, William Smith and Henry Fynes Clinton estimate the force of the Tegeatae on this occasion as not more than three-fourths of their whole number. This would give 4000 for the military population of Tegea, and about 17,400 for the whole free population.

Soon after the Battle of Plataea, the Tegeatae were again at war with the Spartans, of the causes of which, however, we have no information. We only know that the Tegeatae fought twice against the Spartans between 479 and 464 BCE, and were each time defeated; first in conjunction with the Argives, and a second time together with the other Arcadians, except the Mantineians at Dipaea, in the Maenalian district. About this time, and also at a subsequent period, Tegea, and especially the temple of Athena Alea in the city, was a frequent place of refuge for persons who had rendered themselves obnoxious to the Spartan government. Hither fled the seer Hegesistratus and the kings Leotychides, and Pausanias, son of Pleistoanax.

In the Peloponnesian War the Tegeatae were the firm allies of the Spartans, to whom they remained faithful both on account of their possessing an aristocratical constitution, and from their jealousy of the neighbouring democratical city of Mantineia, with which they were frequently at war. Thus the Tegeatae not only refused to join the Argives in the alliance formed against Sparta in 421 BCE, but they accompanied the Lacedaemonians in their expedition against Argos in 418 BCE. They also fought on the side of the Spartans in the Corinthian War, 394 BCE. The Temple of Athena Alea burned in 394 BCE and was magnificently rebuilt, to designs by Scopas of Paros, with reliefs of the Calydonian boar hunt in the main pediment. After the Battle of Leuctra (371 BCE), however, the Spartan party in Tegea was expelled, and the city joined the other Arcadian towns in the foundation of Megalopolis and in the formation of the Arcadian League. When Mantineia a few years afterwards quarrelled with the supreme Arcadian government, and formed an alliance with its old enemy Sparta, Tegea remained faithful to the new confederacy, and fought under Epaminondas against the Spartans at the great Battle of Mantineia, 362 BCE.

Tegea at a later period joined the Aetolian League, but soon after the accession of Cleomenes III to the Spartan throne it formed an alliance with Sparta, together with Mantineia and Orchomenus. It thus became involved in hostilities with the Achaeans, and in the war which followed, called the Cleomenic War, it was taken by Antigonus Doson, the ally of the Achaeans, and annexed to the Achaean League, 222 BCE. In 218 BCE, Tegea was attacked by Spartan king Lycurgus, who obtained possession of the whole city with the exception of the acropolis. It subsequently fell into the hands of Machanidas, the tyrant of Sparta, but was recovered by the Achaeans after the defeat of Machanidas, who was slain in battle by Philopoemen. In the time of Strabo Tegea was the only one of the Arcadian towns which continued to be inhabited, and it was still a place of importance in the time of Pausanias, who has given us a minute account of its public buildings. The &quot;tombs&quot; he saw there were shrines to the chthonic founding &quot;daemones&quot;: &quot;There are also tombs of Tegeates, the son of Lycaon, and of Maira (or Maera), his wife.&quot; Maira was a daughter of Atlas, and Homer makes mention of her in the passage where Odysseus tells to Alkinous his journey to Hades, and of those whose ghosts he beheld there.&quot;

Ancient Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece, containing the Temple of Athena Alea. The &quot;temenos&quot; was founded by Aleus, Pausanias was informed. Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are sealstones and fibulae.

The city retained civic life under the Roman Empire; Tegea survived being sacked by the Goths in AD 395–396. The Roman poets use the adjective Tegĕēus or Tegeaeus as equivalent to Arcadian: thus it is given as an epithet to Pan (Verg. G. 1.18), Callisto, daughter of Lycaon (Ov. Ar. Am. 2.55, Fast. 2.167), Atalanta (Ov. Met. 8.317, 380), Carmenta (Ov. Fast. 1.627), and Mercury (Stat. Silv. 1.54)

In the Middle Ages, through some unclear process, Tegea received the name of Amyklion (later usually shortened to Amykli and Nikli) by the 10th century. In 1082, it became the seat of the Diocese of Amyclae, a suffragan see of the Metropolis of Lacedaemon. Nikli and the rest of Arcadia were captured by the Crusaders in , becoming part of the new Frankish Principality of Achaea, which soon came to encompass most of the Peloponnese. The &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; depicts Nikli as a site of some importance and fortified, which fell to the Crusaders only after a siege. It became the seat of a secular barony, while a Roman Catholic bishop was installed in the episcopal see. Nikli was still in Frankish hands in 1280, but was lost to the resurgent Byzantines by 1302, who also restored the local see to the Orthodox clergy.

The site of ancient Tegea is now located within the modern village of Alea (referred to as &quot;Piali&quot; before 1915). Alea is located about 10 kilometers southeast of Tripoli. The municipality of Tegea has its seat at Stadio.

===Tegea and Crete===
In ancient times, the people of Tegea said that Cydon, Archedius, and Gortys, the surviving sons of their king Tegeates, migrated voluntarily to Crete, and that the cities Kydonia, Gortyna, and Catreus, were named after them. Yet the Cretans denied this; instead they tried to portray these three characters as the offspring of the local heroes Minos and Rhadamantus.

<text>A position circle is a circle that can be measured both from a chart and from the surface of the earth for the purpose of position fixing. For the purposes of land or coastal navigation, a position circle can be generated by making a horizontal angle measurement between two landmarks using a sextant. Two overlapping position circles, or one position circle and one or more other observations can be used to give a position fix.

When a horizontal angle measurement is made between two known points on land, the observer will be located at the apex of a triangle, with the other two corners of this triangle consisting of the landmark pair. The observer will also be sitting on a set of points that fall along a large circle. The diameter of the circle will be dependent upon the distance between the landmark pair and the range of the observer to the landmark pair. At each point along this circle, the angular separation between the landmark pairs will be the same. Two such circles exist, one in front of the landmark pair, and one on the backside. It is usually straightforward to tell which circle is relevant. After the observation is made, the angular reading can be transferred onto a nautical chart (or map) by means of a protractor instrument.

The origin of the circle can be found as follows. Draw a baseline connecting the two landmarks. Bisect the line using a compass. Construct a line 90 degrees to the baseline using a compass. Using a protractor, draw a line from either landmark to intersect the 90 degree line off the baseline at the observed angle. This point is the origin of the circle of position. Using a compass again, the entire circle can be drawn.

<text>The Forbes family is one of the components of the Boston Brahmins—a wealthy extended American family long prominent in Boston, Massachusetts. The family&#x27;s fortune originates from trading opium and tea between North America and China in the 19th century plus other investments in the same period. The name descends from Scottish immigrants and can be traced back to Sir John de Forbes in Scotland in the 12th century. Family members include businessman John Murray Forbes (1813–1898), part of the first generation who accumulated wealth, and politician John Forbes Kerry (born 1943).

==Family origins==

The first member of the Forbes family to live in the United States was Rev. John Forbes (1740–1783). He was a clergyman who arrived in the colonies in 1763. The Reverend&#x27;s first post on the North American continent was in British East Florida, where he became the first Anglican clergyman licensed to officiate during the British period of 1763–1783. The Forbes family has a link to the Dudley–Winthrop family directly from Thomas Dudley (1576–1653), father of Anne Bradstreet (1612–1672), the first English-language female poet from America. John Forbes left Florida for Boston in 1769 and married Dorothy Murray on February 2, 1769 in Milton, Massachusetts, where their first son James Grant Forbes was born. John Forbes has two other sons: John Murray Forbes and Ralph Bennet Forbes.

==Accumulation of wealth==

=== Trade with China ===

The Boston trading firm Perkins &amp; Company sent many young men of their extended family to participate in their business activities abroad. Ralph Forbes being married to Margaret Perkins, their children were encouraged in the business. Following the death overseas of his older brother, Thomas Tunno Forbes, the Perkinses encouraged John Murray Forbes to travel to China, too. There John was mentored by the Chinese merchant Houqua who treated him like a son and therefore entrusted very significant sums of capital to invest on his behalf in the US after he left China (see below).

Perkins &amp; Co., like many other Boston trading firms in the early 19th century, sent ships to China to get tea for sale in America (although some was ultimately re-exported to Britain and Europe). To pay for the tea, they exported to China large quantities of silver and also furs, manufactured goods, cloth, wood, opium and any other items that they thought the Chinese market would absorb. 

Active trading houses, particularly those from Boston, usually kept representatives resident in Hong Kong whose main role was to look for and secure quality tea for export at good prices. This was John Murray Forbes&#x27; main job during the two years he spent in China. John Murray Forbes&#x27; brother, Robert Bennet Forbes, was more intimately involved in the importing side of the business and, at least by their own writings, had a more direct role than did John in the opium trade.

Until recently, the Museum of the American China Trade in Milton, Mass., on Boston&#x27;s South Shore, was curated by a Forbes great-grandson, Dr. H. A. Crosby Forbes, an expert on Chinese porcelain. In 1992 H. A. Crosby Forbes donated his family&#x27;s papers, beginning with those of Henry Ashton and Mary (Leavitt) Crosby, to the Massachusetts Historical Society. The museum, which was housed in Robert Bennet Forbes&#x27; 1833 Greek Revival style house, was a monument to the China merchants and the great wealth in Boston that both drove and resulted from the China trade. The China trade museum was merged with the Peabody Essex Museum in 1984 leaving the house in the management of the Forbes House Charitable Trust which operates it now as the Captain Forbes House Museum.

Neither John nor Robert spent more than a relatively short time in China—John was there for two years. Upon his return to Boston, John continued his interest in the China trade for a few more years, serving as a business/investment manager for voyages undertaken by Robert and others. Fairly soon, however, he recognized that the China trade was becoming increasingly difficult to pursue profitably and that railroads offered a new and much more lucrative opportunity.

===Railroad investment===

Due to the close bond relationship and trust he still maintained in Boston with Howqua, he was given $200,000 of Howqua capital to invest in US business opportunities, to invest on behalf of his Chinese mentor in the US (Ujifusa 2018 Chapter 3). Deploying this capital in the US, John Murray Forbes made a considerable fortune from investments in railroads from the 1840s onwards. Some of the population growth of Chicago and Midwestern Plains states in the middle to late 19th century was due to John Murray Forbes&#x27; railroad projects in Michigan and Chicago. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad, from Chicago west to the Mississippi, was built by John Murray Forbes who had a reputation for sound financial management amongst the railroad tycoons of the day.

==Family assets==

Some Forbes family members remain generally influential in local or national politics.

In the 1840s, John Murray Forbes bought Naushon Island, which is one of the Elizabeth Islands northwest of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Osterville, and within the town of Gosnold, Massachusetts. Forbes and his descendants have used the property as a summer retreat since then. The property is presently owned by a Forbes family corporation, the Naushon Trust, Inc.

<text>In radio communications, a radio receiver, also known as a receiver, a wireless, or simply a radio, is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information carried by them to a usable form. It is used with an antenna. The antenna intercepts radio waves (electromagnetic waves of radio frequency) and converts them to tiny alternating currents which are applied to the receiver, and the receiver extracts the desired information. The receiver uses electronic filters to separate the desired radio frequency signal from all the other signals picked up by the antenna, an electronic amplifier to increase the power of the signal for further processing, and finally recovers the desired information through demodulation.

Radio receivers are essential components of all systems that use radio. The information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound, video (television), or digital data. A radio receiver may be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electronic circuit within another device. The most familiar type of radio receiver for most people is a broadcast radio receiver, which reproduces sound transmitted by radio broadcasting stations, historically the first mass-market radio application. A broadcast receiver is commonly called a &quot;radio&quot;. However radio receivers are very widely used in other areas of modern technology, in televisions, cell phones, wireless modems, radio clocks and other components of communications, remote control, and wireless networking systems.

==Applications==
===Broadcasting===

====Broadcast audio reception====
====Broadcast television reception====

Televisions receive a video signal representing a moving image, composed of a sequence of still images, and a synchronized audio signal representing the associated sound. The television channel received by a TV occupies a wider bandwidth than an audio signal, from 600 kHz to 6 MHz.
**&quot;Terrestrial television receiver&quot;, &quot;broadcast television&quot; or just &quot;television&quot; (TV) - Televisions contains an integral receiver (TV tuner) which receives free broadcast television from local television stations on TV channels in the VHF and UHF bands.
**&quot;Satellite TV&quot; receiver - a set-top box which receives subscription direct-broadcast satellite television, and displays it on an ordinary television. A rooftop satellite dish receives many channels all modulated on a Ku band microwave downlink signal from a geostationary direct broadcast satellite above the Earth, and the signal is converted to a lower intermediate frequency and transported to the box through a coaxial cable. The subscriber pays a monthly fee.

===Voice communications===

====Two-way voice communications====

A two-way radio is an audio transceiver, a receiver and transmitter in the same device, used for bidirectional person-to-person voice communication. The radio link may be half-duplex, using a single radio channel in which only one radio can transmit at a time. so different users take turns talking, pressing a push to talk button on their radio which switches on the transmitter. Or the radio link may be full duplex, a bidirectional link using two radio channels so both people can talk at the same time, as in a cell phone.
**&quot;Cellphone&quot; - a portable telephone that is connected to the telephone network by radio signals exchanged with a local antenna called a cell tower. Cellphones have highly automated digital receivers working in the UHF and microwave band that receive the incoming side of the duplex voice channel, as well as a control channel that handles dialing calls and switching the phone between cell towers. They usually also have several other receivers that connect them with other networks: a WiFi modem, a bluetooth modem, and a GPS receiver. The cell tower has sophisticated multichannel receivers that receive the signals from many cell phones simultaneously.
**&quot;Cordless phone&quot; - a landline telephone in which the handset is portable and communicates with the rest of the phone by a short range duplex radio link, instead of being attached by a cord. Both the handset and the base station have radio receivers operating in the UHF band that receive the short range bidirectional duplex radio link.
**&quot;Citizens band radio&quot; - a two-way half-duplex radio operating in the 27 MHz band that can be used without a license. They are often installed in vehicles and used by truckers and delivery services.
**&quot;Walkie-talkie&quot; - a handheld short range half-duplex two-way radio. 
**&quot;Scanner&quot; - a receiver that continuously monitors multiple frequencies or radio channels by stepping through the channels repeatedly, listening briefly to each channel for a transmission. When a transmitter is found the receiver stops at that channel. Scanners are used to monitor emergency police, fire, and ambulance frequencies, as well as other two way radio frequencies such as citizens band. Scanning capabilities have also become a standard feature in communications receivers, walkie-talkies, and other two-way radios. 
**&quot;Communications receiver&quot; or &quot;shortwave receiver&quot; - a general purpose audio receiver covering the LF, MF, shortwave (HF), and VHF bands. Used mostly with a separate shortwave transmitter for two-way voice communication in communication stations, amateur radio stations, and for shortwave listening.

====One-way voice communications====
**&quot;Wireless microphone&quot; receiver - these receive the short range signal from wireless microphones used onstage by musical artists, public speakers, and television personalities.
**&quot;Baby monitor&quot; - this is a cribside appliance for parents of infants that transmits the baby&#x27;s sounds to a receiver carried by the parents, so they can monitor the baby while they are in other parts of the house. Many baby monitors now have video cameras to show a picture of the baby.

===Data communication===
**&quot;Wireless (WiFi) modem&quot; - an automated short range digital data transmitter and receiver on a portable wireless device that communicates by microwaves with a nearby access point, a router or gateway, connecting the portable device with a local computer network (WLAN) to exchange data with other devices. 
**&quot;Bluetooth&quot; modem - a very short range (up to 10 m) 2.4-2.83 GHz data transceiver on a portable wireless device used as a substitute for a wire or cable connection, mainly to exchange files between portable devices and connect cellphones and music players with wireless earphones.
**&quot;Microwave relay&quot; - a long-distance high bandwidth point-to-point data transmission link consisting of a dish antenna and transmitter that transmits a beam of microwaves to another dish antenna and receiver. Since the antennas must be in line-of-sight, distances are limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 miles. Microwave links are used for private business data, wide area computer networks (WANs), and by telephone companies to transmit distance phone calls and television signals between cities.
*Satellite communications - Communication satellites are used for data transmission between widely separated points on Earth. Other satellites are used for search and rescue, remote sensing, weather reporting and scientific research. Radio communication with satellites and spacecraft can involve very long path lengths, from 35,786 km (22,236 mi) for geosynchronous satellites to billions of kilometers for interplanetary spacecraft. This and the limited power available to a spacecraft transmitter mean very sensitive receivers must be used.
**&quot;Satellite transponder&quot; - A receiver and transmitter in a communications satellite that receives multiple data channels carrying long-distance telephone calls, television signals. or internet traffic on a microwave uplink signal from a satellite ground station and retransmits the data to another ground station on a different downlink frequency. In a direct broadcast satellite the transponder broadcasts a stronger signal directly to satellite radio or satellite television receivers in consumer&#x27;s homes. 
**&quot;Satellite ground station receiver&quot; - communication satellite ground stations receive data from communications satellites orbiting the Earth. Deep space ground stations such as those of the NASA Deep Space Network receive the weak signals from distant scientific spacecraft on interplanetary exploration missions. These have large dish antennas around 85 ft (25 m) in diameter, and extremely sensitive radio receivers similar to radio telescopes. The RF front end of the receiver is often cryogenically cooled to −195.79 °C (−320 °F) by liquid nitrogen to reduce radio noise in the circuit.
*Remote control - Remote control receivers receive digital commands that control a device, which may be as complex as a space vehicle or unmanned aerial vehicle, or as simple as a garage door opener. Remote control systems often also incorporate a telemetry channel to transmit data on the state of the controlled device back to the controller. Radio controlled model and other models include multichannel receivers in model cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. A short-range radio system is used in keyless entry systems.

===Other applications===

**&quot;Radar&quot; - a device that transmits a narrow beam of microwaves which reflect from a target back to a receiver, used to locate objects such as aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, ships or land vehicles. The reflected waves from the target are received by a receiver usually connected to the same antenna, indicating the direction to the target. Widely used in aviation, shipping, navigation, weather forecasting, space flight, vehicle collision avoidance systems, and the military. 
**&quot;Global navigation satellite system&quot; (GNSS) receiver, such as a GPS receiver used with the US Global Positioning System - the most widely used electronic navigation device. An automated digital receiver that receives simultaneous data signals from several satellites in low Earth orbit. Using extremely precise time signals it calculates the distance to the satellites, and from this the receiver&#x27;s location on Earth. GNSS receivers are sold as portable devices, and are also incorporated in cell phones, vehicles and weapons, even artillery shells. 
**&quot;VOR&quot; receiver - navigational instrument on an aircraft that uses the VHF signal from VOR navigational beacons between 108 and 117.95 MHz to determine the direction to the beacon very accurately, for air navigation.

**&quot;Measuring receiver&quot; - a calibrated, laboratory grade radio receiver used to measure the characteristics of radio signals. Often incorporates a spectrum analyzer.
**&quot;Radio telescope&quot; - specialized antenna and radio receiver used as a scientific instrument to study weak radio waves from astronomical radio sources in space like stars, nebulas and galaxies in radio astronomy. They are the most sensitive radio receivers that exist, having large parabolic (dish) antennas up to 500 meters in diameter, and extremely sensitive radio circuits. The RF front end of the receiver is often cryogenically cooled by liquid nitrogen to reduce radio noise.

==Principles==

A radio receiver is connected to an antenna which converts some of the energy from the incoming radio wave into a tiny radio frequency AC voltage which is applied to the receiver&#x27;s input. An antenna typically consists of an arrangement of metal conductors. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the radio wave push the electrons in the antenna back and forth, creating an oscillating voltage.

The antenna may be enclosed inside the receiver&#x27;s case, as with the ferrite loop antennas of AM radios and the flat inverted F antenna of cell phones; attached to the outside of the receiver, as with whip antennas used on FM radios, or mounted separately and connected to the receiver by a cable, as with rooftop television antennas and satellite dishes.

Practical radio receivers perform three basic functions on the signal from the antenna: filtering, amplification, and demodulation:

===Reception===
The signal strength of radio waves decreases the farther they travel from the transmitter, so a radio station can only be received within a limited range of its transmitter. The range depends on the power of the transmitter, the sensitivity of the receiver, atmospheric and internal noise, as well as any geographical obstructions such as hills between transmitter and receiver. AM broadcast band radio waves travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the Earth, so AM radio stations can be reliably received at hundreds of miles distance. Due to their higher frequency, FM band radio signals cannot travel far beyond the visual horizon; limiting reception distance to about 40 miles (64 km), and can be blocked by hills between the transmitter and receiver. However FM radio is less susceptible to interference from radio noise (RFI, sferics, static) and has higher fidelity; better frequency response and less audio distortion, than AM. So in countries that still broadcast AM radio, serious music is typically only broadcast by FM stations, and AM stations specialize in radio news, talk radio, and sports radio. Like FM, DAB signals travel by line of sight so reception distances are limited by the visual horizon to about 30–40 miles (48–64 km).

=== Bandpass filtering ===

Radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other and are received by the antenna. These can be separated in the receiver because they have different frequencies; that is, the radio wave from each transmitter oscillates at a different rate. To separate out the desired radio signal, the bandpass filter allows the frequency of the desired radio transmission to pass through, and blocks signals at all other frequencies.

The bandpass filter consists of one or more resonant circuits (tuned circuits). The resonant circuit is connected between the antenna input and ground. When the incoming radio signal is at the resonant frequency, the resonant circuit has high impedance and the radio signal from the desired station is passed on to the following stages of the receiver. At all other frequencies the resonant circuit has low impedance, so signals at these frequencies are conducted to ground.
*Bandwidth and selectivity: See graphs. The information (modulation) in a radio transmission is contained in two narrow bands of frequencies called sidebands &quot;(SB)&quot; on either side of the carrier frequency &quot;(C)&quot;, so the filter has to pass a band of frequencies, not just a single frequency. The band of frequencies received by the receiver is called its &quot;passband&quot; &quot;(PB)&quot;, and the width of the passband in kilohertz is called the bandwidth &quot;(BW)&quot;. The bandwidth of the filter must be wide enough to allow the sidebands through without distortion, but narrow enough to block any interfering transmissions on adjacent frequencies (such as &quot;S2&quot; in the diagram). The ability of the receiver to reject unwanted radio stations near in frequency to the desired station is an important parameter called &quot;selectivity&quot; determined by the filter. In modern receivers quartz crystal, ceramic resonator, or surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters are often used which have sharper selectivity compared to networks of capacitor-inductor tuned circuits. 
*Tuning: To select a particular station the radio is &quot;tuned&quot; to the frequency of the desired transmitter. The radio has a dial or digital display showing the frequency it is tuned to. &quot;Tuning&quot; is adjusting the frequency of the receiver&#x27;s passband to the frequency of the desired radio transmitter. Turning the tuning knob changes the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit. When the resonant frequency is equal to the radio transmitter&#x27;s frequency the tuned circuit oscillates in sympathy, passing the signal on to the rest of the receiver.

=== Amplification ===
The power of the radio waves picked up by a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the transmitting antenna. Even with the powerful transmitters used in radio broadcasting stations, if the receiver is more than a few miles from the transmitter the power intercepted by the receiver&#x27;s antenna is very small, perhaps as low as picowatts or femtowatts. To increase the power of the recovered signal, an amplifier circuit uses electric power from batteries or the wall plug to increase the amplitude (voltage or current) of the signal. In most modern receivers, the electronic components which do the actual amplifying are transistors.

Receivers usually have several stages of amplification: the radio signal from the bandpass filter is amplified to make it powerful enough to drive the demodulator, then the audio signal from the demodulator is amplified to make it powerful enough to operate the speaker. The degree of amplification of a radio receiver is measured by a parameter called its &quot;sensitivity&quot;, which is the minimum signal strength of a station at the antenna, measured in microvolts, necessary to receive the signal clearly, with a certain signal-to-noise ratio. Since it is easy to amplify a signal to any desired degree, the limit to the sensitivity of many modern receivers is not the degree of amplification but random electronic noise present in the circuit, which can drown out a weak radio signal.

=== Demodulation ===
After the radio signal is filtered and amplified, the receiver must extract the information-bearing modulation signal from the modulated radio frequency carrier wave. This is done by a circuit called a demodulator (detector). Each type of modulation requires a different type of demodulator
*an AM receiver that receives an (amplitude modulated) radio signal uses an AM demodulator
*an FM receiver that receives a frequency modulated signal uses an FM demodulator
*an FSK receiver which receives frequency-shift keying (used to transmit digital data in wireless devices) uses an FSK demodulator 
Many other types of modulation are also used for specialized purposes.

The modulation signal output by the demodulator is usually amplified to increase its strength, then the information is converted back to a human-usable form by some type of transducer. An audio signal, representing sound, as in a broadcast radio, is converted to sound waves by an earphone or loudspeaker. A video signal, representing moving images, as in a television receiver, is converted to light by a display. Digital data, as in a wireless modem, is applied as input to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with human users.

:AM demodulation

:The easiest type of demodulation to understand is AM demodulation, used in AM radios to recover the audio modulation signal, which represents sound and is converted to sound waves by the radio&#x27;s speaker. It is accomplished by a circuit called an envelope detector &quot;(see circuit)&quot;, consisting of a diode &quot;(D)&quot; with a bypass capacitor &quot;(C)&quot; across its output.

:See graphs. The amplitude modulated radio signal from the tuned circuit is shown at &quot;(A)&quot;. The rapid oscillations are the radio frequency carrier wave. The audio signal (the sound) is contained in the slow variations (modulation) of the amplitude (size) of the waves. If it was applied directly to the speaker, this signal cannot be converted to sound, because the audio excursions are the same on both sides of the axis, averaging out to zero, which would result in no net motion of the speaker&#x27;s diaphragm. &quot;(B)&quot; When this signal is applied as input &quot;V&quot;I to the detector, the diode &quot;(D)&quot; conducts current in one direction but not in the opposite direction, thus allowing through pulses of current on only one side of the signal. In other words, it rectifies the AC current to a pulsing DC current. The resulting voltage &quot;V&quot;O applied to the load &quot;R&quot;L no longer averages zero; its peak value is proportional to the audio signal. &quot;(C)&quot; The bypass capacitor &quot;(C)&quot; is charged up by the current pulses from the diode, and its voltage follows the peaks of the pulses, the envelope of the audio wave. It performs a smoothing (low pass filtering) function, removing the radio frequency carrier pulses, leaving the low frequency audio signal to pass through the load &quot;R&quot;L. The audio signal is amplified and applied to earphones or a speaker.
===Automatic gain control (AGC)===

The signal strength (amplitude) of the radio signal from a receiver&#x27;s antenna varies drastically, by orders of magnitude, depending on how far away the radio transmitter is, how powerful it is, and propagation conditions along the path of the radio waves. The strength of the signal received from a given transmitter varies with time due to changing propagation conditions of the path through which the radio wave passes, such as multipath interference; this is called &quot;fading&quot;. In an AM receiver, the amplitude of the audio signal from the detector, and the sound volume, is proportional to the amplitude of the radio signal, so fading causes variations in the volume. In addition as the receiver is tuned between strong and weak stations, the volume of the sound from the speaker would vary drastically. Without an automatic system to handle it, in an AM receiver, constant adjustment of the volume control would be required.

With other types of modulation like FM or FSK the amplitude of the modulation does not vary with the radio signal strength, but in all types the demodulator requires a certain range of signal amplitude to operate properly. Insufficient signal amplitude will cause an increase of noise in the demodulator, while excessive signal amplitude will cause amplifier stages to overload (saturate), causing distortion (clipping) of the signal.

Therefore, almost all modern receivers include a feedback control system which monitors the &quot;average&quot; level of the radio signal at the detector, and adjusts the gain of the amplifiers to give the optimum signal level for demodulation. This is called automatic gain control (AGC). AGC can be compared to the dark adaptation mechanism in the human eye; on entering a dark room the gain of the eye is increased by the iris opening. In its simplest form, an AGC system consists of a rectifier which converts the RF signal to a varying DC level, a lowpass filter to smooth the variations and produce an average level. This is applied as a control signal to an earlier amplifier stage, to control its gain. In a superheterodyne receiver, AGC is usually applied to the IF amplifier, and there may be a second AGC loop to control the gain of the RF amplifier to prevent it from overloading, too.

In certain receiver designs such as modern digital receivers, a related problem is DC offset of the signal. This is corrected by a similar feedback system.

==Designs==
=== Tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver ===


In the simplest type of radio receiver, called a tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, the three functions above are performed consecutively: (1) the mix of radio signals from the antenna is filtered to extract the signal of the desired transmitter; (2) this oscillating voltage is sent through a radio frequency (RF) amplifier to increase its strength to a level sufficient to drive the demodulator; (3) the demodulator recovers the modulation signal (which in broadcast receivers is an audio signal, a voltage oscillating at an audio frequency rate representing the sound waves) from the modulated radio carrier wave; (4) the modulation signal is amplified further in an audio amplifier, then is applied to a loudspeaker or earphone to convert it to sound waves.

Although the TRF receiver is used in a few applications, it has practical disadvantages which make it inferior to the superheterodyne receiver below, which is used in most applications. The drawbacks stem from the fact that in the TRF the filtering, amplification, and demodulation are done at the high frequency of the incoming radio signal. The bandwidth of a filter increases with its center frequency, so as the TRF receiver is tuned to different frequencies its bandwidth varies. Most important, the increasing congestion of the radio spectrum requires that radio channels be spaced very close together in frequency. It is extremely difficult to build filters operating at radio frequencies that have a narrow enough bandwidth to separate closely spaced radio stations. TRF receivers typically must have many cascaded tuning stages to achieve adequate selectivity. The Advantages section below describes how the superheterodyne receiver overcomes these problems.

=== The superheterodyne design ===

The superheterodyne receiver, invented in 1918 by Edwin Armstrong is the design used in almost all modern receivers except a few specialized applications.

In the superheterodyne, the radio frequency signal from the antenna is shifted down to a lower &quot;intermediate frequency&quot; (IF), before it is processed. The incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with an unmodulated signal generated by a &quot;local oscillator&quot; (LO) in the receiver. The mixing is done in a nonlinear circuit called the &quot;mixer&quot;. The result at the output of the mixer is a heterodyne or beat frequency at the difference between these two frequencies. The process is similar to the way two musical notes at different frequencies played together produce a beat note. This lower frequency is called the &quot;intermediate frequency&quot; (IF). The IF signal also has the modulation sidebands that carry the information that was present in the original RF signal. The IF signal passes through filter and amplifier stages, then is demodulated in a detector, recovering the original modulation.

The receiver is easy to tune; to receive a different frequency it is only necessary to change the local oscillator frequency. The stages of the receiver after the mixer operates at the fixed intermediate frequency (IF) so the IF bandpass filter does not have to be adjusted to different frequencies. The fixed frequency allows modern receivers to use sophisticated quartz crystal, ceramic resonator, or surface acoustic wave (SAW) IF filters that have very high Q factors, to improve selectivity.

The RF filter on the front end of the receiver is needed to prevent interference from any radio signals at the image frequency. Without an input filter the receiver can receive incoming RF signals at two different frequencies. The receiver can be designed to receive on either of these two frequencies; if the receiver is designed to receive on one, any other radio station or radio noise on the other frequency may pass through and interfere with the desired signal. A single tunable RF filter stage rejects the image frequency; since these are relatively far from the desired frequency, a simple filter provides adequate rejection. Rejection of interfering signals much closer in frequency to the desired signal is handled by the multiple sharply-tuned stages of the intermediate frequency amplifiers, which do not need to change their tuning. This filter does not need great selectivity, but as the receiver is tuned to different frequencies it must &quot;track&quot; in tandem with the local oscillator. The RF filter also serves to limit the bandwidth applied to the RF amplifier, preventing it from being overloaded by strong out-of-band signals.

To achieve both good image rejection and selectivity, many modern superhet receivers use two intermediate frequencies; this is called a &quot;dual-conversion&quot; or &quot;double-conversion&quot; superheterodyne. The incoming RF signal is first mixed with one local oscillator signal in the first mixer to convert it to a high IF frequency, to allow efficient filtering out of the image frequency, then this first IF is mixed with a second local oscillator signal in a second mixer to convert it to a low IF frequency for good bandpass filtering. Some receivers even use triple-conversion.

At the cost of the extra stages, the superheterodyne receiver provides the advantage of greater selectivity than can be achieved with a TRF design. Where very high frequencies are in use, only the initial stage of the receiver needs to operate at the highest frequencies; the remaining stages can provide much of the receiver gain at lower frequencies which may be easier to manage. Tuning is simplified compared to a multi-stage TRF design, and only two stages need to track over the tuning range. The total amplification of the receiver is divided between three amplifiers at different frequencies; the RF, IF, and audio amplifier. This reduces problems with feedback and parasitic oscillations that are encountered in receivers where most of the amplifier stages operate at the same frequency, as in the TRF receiver.

The most important advantage is that better selectivity can be achieved by doing the filtering at the lower intermediate frequency. One of the most important parameters of a receiver is its bandwidth, the band of frequencies it accepts. In order to reject nearby interfering stations or noise, a narrow bandwidth is required. In all known filtering techniques, the bandwidth of the filter increases in proportion with the frequency, so by performing the filtering at the lower formula_1, rather than the frequency of the original radio signal formula_2, a narrower bandwidth can be achieved. Modern FM and television broadcasting, cellphones and other communications services, with their narrow channel widths, would be impossible without the superheterodyne.

<doc id="491852" wikidata="Q11741880" url="?curid=491852" title="Receiver (firearms)">
<text>In firearms terminology and law, the firearm frame or receiver is the part of a firearm which integrates other components by providing housing for internal action components such as the hammer, bolt or breechblock, firing pin and extractor, and has threaded interfaces for externally attaching (&quot;receiving&quot;) components such as the barrel, stock, trigger mechanism and iron/optical sights. Some firearm designs, such as the AR-15 platform, feature receivers that have 2 separate sub-assemblies called the upper receiver which houses the barrel/trunnion, bolt components etc and the lower receiver (Trigger Mechanism Housing in some cases) that holds the fire control group, pistol grip, selector, stock etc.

The receiver is often made of forged, machined, or stamped steel or aluminium. Apart from these traditional materials, modern techniques have introduced polymer and sintered metal powder receivers to the market.

== Mounting ==
A barrel may typically be affixed to a firearm receiver using barrel and receiver action threads or similar methods.

== In US law ==
For the purposes of United States law, the receiver or frame is legally the firearm, and as such it is the controlled part. The definition of which assembly is the legal receiver varies from firearm to firearm, under US law. Generally, the law requires licensed manufacturers and importers to mark the designated receiver with a serial number, the manufacturer or importer, the model and caliber. Makers of receivers are restricted by International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Thus, in the case of a firearm that has multiple receiver parts, such as the AR-15, which has an upper and a lower receiver, the legally controlled part is the one that is serialized.

For the AR-15 rifle, the lower receiver assembly is legally considered the actual receiver, although it is functionally a chassis that also houses the separate trigger group. In the FN-FAL rifle, it is the upper assembly that is serialized and legally considered the receiver. This has led to prosecutors dropping charges against illegal manufacturing of AR-type firearms to avoid court precedents establishing that neither the upper nor the lower receiver individually contain all the components to be legally classified as a firearm.

===Unfinished receivers===
&quot;Unfinished receivers&quot;, also called &quot;80 percent receivers&quot; or &quot;blanks&quot;, are partially completed receivers with no serial numbers. Purchasers must perform their own finishing work in order to make the receiver usable. The finishing of receivers for sale or distribution by unlicensed persons is against US law. Because an unfinished 80% receiver is not a firearm, purchasers do not need to pass a background check. The resulting firearm is known as a &quot;ghost gun&quot;.

During the Biden Administration, the ATF imposed regulations on the sale and marketing of unfinished receivers and kits containing them by revising the legal definition of receivers to include &quot;a partially complete, disassembled, or nonfunctional frame or receiver, including a frame or receiver parts kit, that is designed to or may readily be completed, assembled, restored, or otherwise converted to function as a frame or receiver&quot;. (The term &quot;receiver&quot; was also redefined as referring to non-handgun firearms, while &quot;frame&quot; was redefined as referring to handguns exclusively.) The new definitions went into effect on August 24, 2022. In the case VanDerStok v. Garland, filed on June 30, 2023, a federal court in Texas ruled that the new ATF regulations exceeded the agency&#x27;s statutory authority, and struck them down. However, on August 8, 2023, the Texas court&#x27;s nationwide vacatur was temporarily placed on hold by the Supreme Court of the United States, leaving the new ATF regulations on unfinished receivers in place.

===Zero Percent Receiver===
A Zero Percent Receiver is a rectangular billet of metal of the appropriate size to make a finished receiver, but without any machining whatsoever. In California it is unlawful to possess an unserialized zero percent receiver, and it is unlawful to ship one into the state

==3D printed receivers==
, several designs and at least two designs for 3D printable polymer lower unfinished receivers for the AR-15 have been released: the AR Lower V5 and the Charon. 3D printed designs may also be used to produce privately made firearms.

== In Canadian law ==

The receiver or frame is legally the firearm, and as such it is the part that requires a manufacturer&#x27;s serial number and valid Possession and Acquisition Licence to acquire and own. In the case of a handgun frame or revolver frame, it is the part that requires a Restricted-class PAL (RPAL), and registration.

<text>A dichotomy () is a partition of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
* jointly exhaustive: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* mutually exclusive: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

If there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition. The two parts thus formed are complements. In logic, the partitions are opposites if there exists a proposition such that it holds over one and not the other. Treating continuous variables or multicategorical variables as binary variables is called dichotomization. The discretization error inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for modeling purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;dichotomy&quot; is from the Greek &quot;dichotomía&quot; &quot;dividing in two&quot; from δίχα &quot;dícha&quot; &quot;in two, asunder&quot; and τομή &quot;tomḗ&quot; &quot;a cutting, incision&quot;.

== Usage and examples==

* In set theory, a dichotomous relation &quot;R&quot; is such that either &quot;aRb&quot;, &quot;bRa&quot;, but not both.
* A false dichotomy is an informal fallacy consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also undistributed middle).
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification – classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups. As Lewis Carroll explains, &quot;After dividing a Class, by the Process of Dichotomy, into two smaller Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes; and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition. For example, we may divide &quot;books&quot; into &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; (i.e. &quot;not-old&quot;): we may then sub-divide each of these into &quot;English&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; (i.e. &quot;not-English&quot;), thus getting four Classes.&quot; 
* In statistics, dichotomous data may only exist at first two levels of measurement, namely at the nominal level of measurement (such as &quot;British&quot; vs &quot;American&quot; when measuring nationality) and at the ordinal level of measurement (such as &quot;tall&quot; vs &quot;short&quot;, when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a dummy variable. 
* In computer science, more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language&#x27;s design. For instance, C++ has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In astronomy dichotomy is when the Moon or an inferior planet is exactly half-lit as viewed from Earth. For the Moon, this occurs slightly before one quarter Moon orbit and slightly after the third quarter of the Moon&#x27;s orbit at 89.85° and 270.15°, respectively. (This is not to be confused with quadrature which is when the Sun-Earth-Moon/superior planet angle is 90°.)
* In botany, branching may be dichotomous or axillary. In dichotomous branching, the branches form as a result of an equal division of a terminal bud (i.e., a bud formed at the apex of a stem) into two equal branches. This also applies to root systems as well.

<text>Dragonets are small percomorph marine fish of the diverse family Callionymidae (from the Greek &quot;kallis&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;name&quot;) found mainly in the tropical waters of the western Indo-Pacific. They are benthic organisms, spending most of their time near the sandy bottoms, at a depth of roughly two hundred meters. There exist 139 species of the fish, in nineteen genera.

Due to similarities in morphology and behavior, dragonets are sometimes confused with members of the goby family. However, male dragonets can be differentiated from the goby by their very long dorsal fins, and females by their protruding lower jaws. The Draconettidae may be considered a sister family, whose members are very much alike, though rarely seen.

==Genera==
The following genera are classified within the Callionymidae: 

* &quot;Anaora&quot; 
* &quot;Bathycallionymus&quot; 
* &quot;Callionymus&quot; (including &quot;Calliurichthys&quot;)
* &quot;Diplogrammus&quot; (including &quot;Chalinops&quot;)
* &quot;Draculo&quot; 
* &quot;Eleutherochir&quot; 
* &quot;Eocallionymus&quot; 
* &quot;Foetorepus&quot; 
* &quot;Neosynchiropus&quot; 
* &quot;Paracallionymus&quot; 
* &quot;Protogrammus&quot; 
* &quot;Pseudocalliurichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Repomucenus&quot; 
* &quot;Spinicapitichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Synchiropus&quot; 
* &quot;Tonlesapia&quot; 

==Description==
These &quot;little dragons&quot; are generally very colorful and possess cryptic patterns. Their bodies are elongated and scaleless. A large preopercular spine is characteristic of this fish, and has been reported to be venomous in some species. All fins are large, showy and elongated; the first high dorsal fin usually has four spines; in males, the first of these spines may be further adorned with filamentous extensions. Dragonets have flattened, triangular heads with large mouths and eyes; their tail fins are fan-shaped and tapered.

The largest species, the longtail dragonet (&quot;Callionymus gardineri&quot;) reaches a length of . At the other end of the spectrum, the Saint Helena dragonet (&quot;Callionymus sanctaehelenae&quot;) reaches a length of just . Many species exhibit marked sexual dimorphism: males and females are coloured and patterned differently from each other, and (in addition to the spine filament) males have a much higher dorsal fin. This difference is extreme in the high-finned dragonet (&quot;Synchiropus rameus&quot;).

==Reproduction==

Dragonet spawning occurs during late afternoons, right before the sun sets. The fish&#x27;s spawning behavior is divided into four distinctive stages: courtship display, pairing, ascending, and the release of eggs and milt. Both male and female dragonets have been observed displaying and courting each other, although the practice is much more frequent in the males. Females only do so when they are ready to spawn and are in need of a mate. Both sexes display by spreading their pectoral and caudal fins, and moving around or by the side of the other sex. Males will sometimes also spread their dorsal fins, repeatedly open and close their mouths, and position themselves on top of the females and rub their abdomens with their bodies. If a female accepts a male for spawning, they form a pair. Occasionally, another male might intrude upon the pair as they are mating and attempt to sneak fertilizations with the female. Such an act would result in aggression by the original male.

Prior to spawning, a male and female dragonet pair will ascend approximately 0.7-1.2 meters up a water column from the sand at the bottom of the ocean. The male assumes a parallel position to the female, touching the female&#x27;s side with the part of its body near its ventral fin. The pair rises slowly up the water column, moving in a semicircular manner by swimming with their pectoral fins. The ascent occurs in two phases. During the first phase, the dragonet pair moves upward about fifteen centimeters and rests for around five seconds. Then it proceeds with its second rise. During this second phase of the ascent, the male and female flex their bodies and move their genital papillae toward each other. The male releases its ejaculate and the female releases its eggs. The release of eggs occurs singly and continuously for approximately five seconds. The eggs are pelagic, floating freely in the water column. The female releases a high number of eggs during each spawning, and the dragonets do not guard their offspring. The eggs are buoyant, so they intermingle with plankton and get swept away by the ocean current. After the spawning, the dragonet pair parts from each other and swims back down to the ocean floor. Male dragonets are polygynous, and will begin to search for other females to repeat the mating process with. They generally spawn with several different females within one reproductive day. Dragonets are very sexually dimorphic, with the males being much larger and having longer fins than the females. This sexual dimorphism may have evolved in males in response to female mate choice, male-male competition, or both.

==Competition/aggression==

Male dragonets form dominance hierarchies and act extremely aggressively towards each other. They are often observed chasing and biting, which occurs primarily when two males are close to a female during courtship and pairing. Fights can be very intense; when one male recognizes another male near its breeding site, it will rush toward it and bite at its rival&#x27;s mouth. The two may bite at each other and twist their bodies around one another for longer than a minute. As a result of this behavior, male dragonets suffer higher mortality rates than females do after attaining maturation. The highest mortality rates in adult males occur during breeding. Males have evolved larger bodies, as well as longer spines and rays, in order to achieve dominance in reproduction. They have also developed bright colors so as to more effectively compete for female attention. These secondary sex characteristics further reduce the survival potential of male dragonets, as they increase the risk of predation, require greater energy costs, and escalate the risk of suffering injuries.

==Feeding==

Feeding by the dragonet occurs throughout the day, including the intervals between courtships and spawning. The fish feeds entirely on benthic sources, primarily copepods, amphipods, and other small invertebrates living on blades of sea grass. Species of dragonets from different locations show variations in specific food preference, attributable to the different availabilities and abundances of food organisms in those places. All of them feed by extending their highly protractible jaws toward their food and drawing it into the mouths, frequently followed by the expulsion of sand. No evidence suggests that dragonets are territorial. Individuals do not defend specific areas of substrate, as well as any resources that might be present on them, from intrusion by conspecifics or other fish species.

Among &quot;Calliurichthys japonicus&quot; and &quot;Repomucenus huguenini&quot;, the two most abundant dragonet species, amphipods are the most plentiful prey during the spring and winter months. The fish also supplement their diets with polychaetes, bivalves, and gastropods in these periods. During the summer, the dragonets feed primarily on ophiuroids and amphipods. In this season, ophiuroids are the most dominant in number. Finally, in the fall, the two species predominantly consume polychaetes, amphipods, and gastropods, with polychaetes contributing the highest amount.

==Locomotion==

Four types of swimming are observed in the dragonet. The first is burst swimming, the most common of the four, and utilized during foraging. The dragonet uses its pelvic fins to propel its body off of a substrate, and then its pectoral fins to guide itself forward. The second is continuous swimming, often utilized by males when approaching a potential mate or retreating during an aggressive encounter with another male. The dragonet uses its pectoral fins to propel its body forward, and its pelvic fins to lift and guide itself. The third type of swimming is rapid swimming, which is observed when the dragonet is attacking or fleeing. The fish primarily uses its caudal fins to achieve a quick speed. Finally, the fourth type is vertical swimming, utilized by the dragonet during spawning when it ascends. The pectoral fins are used to propel the fish&#x27;s body up the water column.

==Defense==

In defense against its predators, the dragonet rapidly buries itself under the sand at the bottom of the ocean so that only its eyes remain visible. Many species of the fish also are capable of producing and secreting foul-tasting and -smelling substances that may ward off any potential predators.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1996.

==Events==
* Homosexuality is decriminalised in Bosnia and Herzegovina, although Republika Srpska did not remove homosexuality from its criminal code until 1998.

===May===
* 8 – South Africa becomes the first nation in the world to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in its constitution.
* 20 – In &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States rules 6–3 that Colorado&#x27;s Amendment 2, which would have voided existing gay rights laws in Colorado and prevented any new gay rights laws from taking effect, is unconstitutional.
* 21 – Hungary legalizes same-sex unions, first among the ex-communist countries, and fifth country worldwide. The Parliament voted 207–73 in favor for the bill.

===June===
* 17 – The United States Supreme Court, in light of its decision in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, vacates and remands the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in &quot;Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, et al. v. The City of Cincinnati&quot;, which had found the city&#x27;s anti-gay Issue 3 constitutional.

===July===
* 1 – The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacates and remands the district court in &quot;Able v. United States of America&quot;, which had ruled the military&#x27;s gay-exclusionary &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy unconstitutional.

===September===
* 10 – The United States Senate passes the Defense of Marriage Act (85–14) and rejects prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the private sector (49–50).
* 15 – The European Parliament calls for an end to anti-gay discrimination.
* 21 – United States President Bill Clinton signs the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) into law. DOMA allows individual states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions and creates federal definitions for the terms &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;spouse&quot;.

===December===
* 3 – In &quot;Baehr v. Miike&quot; Hawaii judge Kevin S.C. Chang rules in favor of the plaintiffs and enjoins the state of Hawaii from refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The following day Chang stays his ruling, acknowledging the &quot;legally untenable&quot; position couples would be in should the Hawaii Supreme Court reverse him on appeal.

==Deaths==
*November 18 – Evelyn Hooker, whose research helped lead to declassifying homosexuality as a mental illness (b. 1907)

<doc id="491876" wikidata="Q787078" url="?curid=491876" title="Sector light">
<text>A sector light is a man-made pilotage and position fixing aid that consists of strictly delineated horizontal angle light beams to guide water-borne traffic through a safe channel at night in reasonable visibility. Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.

Sectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true, as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.

The colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage system that is designed by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities:
* white - this sector is in the middle of the safe channel
* red - indicates the port edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source
* green - indicates the starboard edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source.
A ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.

The world has different navigation standards managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling standard which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is &quot;red on right returning&quot;.

== Examples of sector lights ==
An example of a sector light is the light of the Fisgard Lighthouse in British Columbia. The lighthouse was built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely. The rest shows a red light from 195 to 322°. If a vessel sees this light, it should alter its course.

Another example is the PEL sector light at Diego Garcia. The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon. The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°. This was required because the PEL sector light was built over 7NM (13 km) from the atoll entrance and it had to illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.

A more complex example is Kolnesholmane, on the southern approach to Risavika in SW Norway. This has multiple white green and red sectors, indicating safe passage from several directions.

<doc id="491886" wikidata="Q1930418" url="?curid=491886" title="Leading lights">
<text>Leading lights, also known as range lights in the United States, are a pair of light beacons used in navigation to indicate a safe passage for vessels entering a shallow or dangerous channel; they may also be used for position fixing. At night, the lights are a form of leading line that can be used for safe navigation. The beacons consist of two lights that are separated in distance and elevation, so that when they are aligned, with one above the other, they provide a bearing. Range lights are often illuminated day and night.

In some cases the two beacons are unlighted, in which case they are known as a &quot;range&quot; in the United States or a &quot;transit&quot; in the UK. The beacons may be artificial or natural.

==Operation==
Two lights are positioned near one another. One, called the front light, is lower than the one behind, which is called the rear light. At night when viewed from a ship, the two lights only become aligned vertically when a vessel is positioned on the correct bearing.

During the day, the lights may not easily be seen and therefore leading lights are often fitted with secondary visual aids, e.g. large red flags with wide black lines running down them. When both red flags and black lines line up, the navigator knows that the vessel is on the correct bearing. The structures are usually painted to make them more prominent.

Some major rivers, such as the Elbe River in Germany, have a series of leading lines. When it is necessary to make a turn, the navigator lines up the next pair of leading lights. This provides guidance from Hamburg to the sea, using successive pairs of leading lights.

Leading lights were used in Great Britain as early as 1763 to mark the Port of Liverpool. The first set of range lights in the United States were privately established by subscription at Newburyport Harbor in Massachusetts in 1788.

Leading lights are sometimes designed to be movable, allowing their position to be shifted in the event of a change in the safe channel; these include one at Hilton Head, South Carolina, the original Chatham Light, and the Nantucket Beacon, predecessor to the Nantucket Harbor Range shown above.

<doc id="491887" wikidata="Q1822234" url="?curid=491887" title="Lewy body">
<text>Lewy bodies are the inclusion bodies – abnormal aggregations of protein – that develop inside neurons affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD), the Lewy body dementias (Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)), and some other disorders. They are also seen in cases of multiple system atrophy, particularly the parkinsonian variant (MSA-P).

Lewy bodies appear as spherical masses in the cytoplasm that displace other cell components. For instance, some Lewy bodies tend to displace the nucleus to one side of the cell. There are two main kinds of Lewy bodies – classical and cortical. A classical Lewy body is an eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion consisting of a dense core surrounded by a halo of 10 nm wide radiating fibrils, the primary structural component of which is alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein). While similar in many other respects, cortical Lewy bodies are only faintly eosinophilic, do not have a surrounding halo, and do not show a radial filamentous substructure. Lewy bodies may be found in the midbrain (within the substantia nigra) or within the cortex.

==History==
In 1910, Fritz Heinrich Lewy was studying in Berlin for his doctorate. He was the first doctor to notice some unusual proteins in the brain, comparing them to earlier findings by Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora. In 1913, Lafora described another case, and acknowledged Lewy as the discoverer, naming them &quot;cuerpos intracelulares de Lewy&quot; (intracellular Lewy bodies). Konstantin Nikolaevich Trétiakoff found them in 1919 in the substantia nigra of PD brains, called them &quot;corps de Lewy&quot; and is credited with the eponym. In 1923, Lewy published his findings in a book, &quot;The Study on Muscle Tone and Movement. Including Systematic Investigations on the Clinic, Physiology, Pathology, and Pathogenesis of Paralysis agitans&quot;. Eliasz Engelhardt, who is in the neurology department at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, argued in 2017 that Lafora should be credited with the eponym, because he named them six years before Trétiakoff. Nonetheless, Trétiakoff is still the primary figure acknowledged for coining the term, &quot;Lewy bodies&quot;.

According to the &quot;Journal of the History of the Neurosciences&quot;, Dr. Lewy became interested in studying more about the brain (neurology), because of the discovery that Alois Alzheimer made in 1906. The article mentions that the third reported case of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease had histological structures that happened to be similar to Lewy body histology slides, but the contribution was not given to Lewy&#x27;s finding.

== Cell biology ==

A Lewy body is composed of the protein α-synuclein associated with other proteins, such as ubiquitin, neurofilament protein, and alpha B crystallin. Tau proteins may also be present, and Lewy bodies may occasionally be surrounded by neurofibrillary tangles. Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles can occasionally exist in the same neuron, particularly in the amygdala.

Alpha-synuclein modulates DNA repair processes, including repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the process of non-homologous end joining The repair function of alpha-synuclein appears to be greatly reduced in Lewy body bearing neurons, and this reduction may trigger cell death. Mutations are the reason behind their damaged repair function. One mutation in particular, in the gene encoding for presynaptic alpha-synuclein, was found to have been passed down from family members with PD. Similarly in regards to DLB, Lewy bodies retrieved from DLB brains were found to contain alpha-synuclein proteins that were shortened by mutations.

Lewy bodies are believed to represent an aggresome response in the cell. When misfolded proteins aggregate, or clump together, many diseases are more likely to develop, including those that are associated with Lewy bodies. Aggregation is believed to occur when there is a high amount of misfolded proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which are then brought to a resulting aggresome so they can be organized into one place. Since Lewy bodies are made of ubiquitinated proteins that would be handled in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, they may be made from this or a similar process if the pathway capacity is indeed exceeded by misfolded proteins that aggregate together. Accordingly, the aggresome, where the damaged proteins fully aggregate, is akin to the Lewy body.

Despite their differences, there is evidence that a particular protein family, called 14-3-3, plays a role in the formation of both cortical and classical Lewy bodies. This makes it an important protein family in regards to Lewy body-associated diseases, and there are at least 7 forms of it that have been clearly identified in mammals.

Cortical Lewy bodies are also composed of alpha-synuclein fibrils, but are less defined and lack halos. This kind of Lewy body is one of those aforementioned that regularly displaces the nucleus. In histopathology, cortical Lewy bodies are a distinguishing feature for dementia with Lewy bodies, but may occasionally be seen in ballooned neurons characteristic of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal degeneration, as well as in patients with other tauopathies.

==Lewy neurites==

Lewy neurites are abnormal neurites in diseased neurons, containing granular material and abnormal α-synuclein filaments similar to those found in Lewy bodies. Like Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites are a feature of α-synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and multiple system atrophy. They are also found in the CA2-3 region of the hippocampus in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="491891" wikidata="Q7614166" url="?curid=491891" title="Steve Troxler">
<text>Steve W. Troxler (born 1952) is an American farmer and politician who has served as the 16th Agriculture Commissioner of North Carolina since 2005. Because of a contested election due to lost ballots in the November 2004 statewide elections, he was not sworn in until February 8, 2005. He was re-elected in 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024.

==Biography==
Troxler was born and grew up in Browns Summit, North Carolina, where he attended local schools. He studied conservation at North Carolina State University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1974.

Troxler originally leased farmland in Browns Summit before he purchased some after he got his degree and primarily grew tobacco. After he was elected to office, he planted less tobacco in favor of wheat and produce.

== Political career ==
Troxler was originally a member of the Democratic Party, but left the organization in the late 1990s, feeling that Democrats were hostile to tobacco production. Jerry Blackwelder, a Republican Party consultant, recruited him as a candidate for the office of North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture. Troxler ran in 2000, losing to Meg Scott Phipps. Due to a financial corruption scandal, Phipps was replaced by Democrat Britt Cobb in 2003.

Troxler ran again for the same position in the 2004 Council of State election, finishing 2,287 votes ahead of incumbent Cobb. However, because more than 4,000 votes were lost in Carteret County, the race was unresolved for more than three months. After extended legal challenges between Cobb and Troxler, Cobb conceded the race on February 4, 2005.

Troxler was sworn in as North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner on February 8, 2005. He was the first Republican to be elected as Agriculture Commissioner in the state&#x27;s history, reflecting the ascendancy of the party in the state. After his inauguration at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, Troxler rode a tractor to his downtown offices. Troxler was re-elected in 2008 as Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the state of North Carolina. As of 2025 he is currently serving his sixth term.

Because of a state law passed in 2013 that expanded venues for carrying legally permitted weapons, in 2014 a gun owners group challenged the no-guns policy of the North Carolina State Fair. Troxler enforced the ban that year while court cases were litigated. A Wake County Superior Court upheld the ban at the fair later that year. By early 2015, some legislators introduced bills to allow guns, while others introduced a bill to maintain the ban on carrying guns at the fair. The ban continues as of 2023.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBTQ rights that took place in the year 2000.

==Events==
* Voters in US state of Maine reject a proposal to reinstate the ban on sexual orientation discrimination in the private sector, with 50.5 per cent against and 49.5 per cent for.

===January===
* 12 – The ban on lesbians and gay men serving in the United Kingdom armed forces is lifted.

===February===
* 14 – Jerrold Nadler, congressman from New York, introduces the Permanent Partners Immigration Act (H.R 3650) in the United States Congress.

===March===
* 7 – California voters approve Proposition 22, a preemptive measure stating that California will not recognize same-sex marriages, even if the marriages took place in states that permitted them.
* 15 – Equality Mississippi is formed in response to a hate-crime murder and attempts in the U.S. state to ban adoption by same-sex couples.

===April===
* 28—30 – Millennium March on Washington in the United States.

===June===
*21 – The parliament of Scotland repeals Section 28, the law that banned local authorities from &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot;. It is the first part of the United Kingdom to do so.

===July===
* 1
** In the U.S. state of Vermont, civil union law goes into effect, granting most state-level marriage rights to registered same-sex couples.
** Mississippi becomes the third U.S. state to ban adoption by same-sex couples.

===November===
* Montana governor Marc Racicot issues an executive order banning sexual orientation discrimination in the public sector.
* The Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, in &quot;In re John/Jane Doe&quot;, rules that gender identity discrimination is included in the existing ban on sex discrimination in the private sector.

===December===
* The age of consent across the United Kingdom is equalised at 16. Previously, the age of consent was 18 for homosexual acts and 16 for heterosexual acts. The equalisation took place after a long struggle, in which the Labour party eventually invoked the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 after the House of Lords repeatedly blocked the bill. 
*Tom Vilsack, governor of the U.S. state of Iowa, rescinds an executive order he issued in 1999 banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in the public sector. Vilsack would later reinstate the order for sexual orientation only.
* 15 – Delaware governor Thomas Carper issues an executive order banning sexual orientation discrimination in the public sector.
==Deaths==
* December 18 – Hal Call, American businessman and homophile leader (Mattachine Society).

<doc id="491903" wikidata="Q1477120" url="?curid=491903" title="Thue–Morse sequence">
<text>In mathematics, the Thue–Morse or Prouhet–Thue–Morse sequence is the binary sequence (an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s) that can be obtained by starting with 0 and successively appending the Boolean complement of the sequence obtained thus far. It is sometimes called the fair share sequence because of its applications to fair division or parity sequence. The first few steps of this procedure yield the strings 0, 01, 0110, 01101001, 0110100110010110, and so on, which are the prefixes of the Thue–Morse sequence. The full sequence begins:

:01101001100101101001011001101001... 

The sequence is named after Axel Thue, Marston Morse and (in its extended form) Eugène Prouhet.

== Definition ==
There are several equivalent ways of defining the Thue–Morse sequence.

=== Direct definition ===
To compute the &quot;n&quot;th element &quot;tn&quot;, write the number &quot;n&quot; in binary. If the number of ones in this binary expansion is odd then &quot;tn&quot; = 1, if even then &quot;tn&quot; = 0. That is, &quot;tn&quot; is the even parity bit for &quot;n&quot;. John H. Conway &quot;et al&quot;. deemed numbers &quot;n&quot; satisfying &quot;tn&quot; = 1 to be &quot;odious&quot; (intended to be similar to &quot;odd&quot;) numbers, and numbers for which &quot;tn&quot; = 0 to be &quot;evil&quot; (similar to &quot;even&quot;) numbers.

=== Fast sequence generation ===
This method leads to a fast method for computing the Thue–Morse sequence: start with , and then, for each &quot;n&quot;, find the highest-order bit in the binary representation of &quot;n&quot; that is different from the same bit in the representation of . If this bit is at an even index, &quot;tn&quot; differs from , and otherwise it is the same as . 

In Python:

def generate_sequence(seq_length: int):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Thue–Morse sequence.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 value = 1
 for n in range(seq_length):
 # Note: assumes that (-1).bit_length() gives 1
 x = (n ^ (n - 1)).bit_length() + 1
 if x &amp; 1 == 0:
 # Bit index is even, so toggle value
 value = 1 - value
 yield value

The resulting algorithm takes constant time to generate each sequence element, using only a logarithmic number of bits (constant number of words) of memory.

=== Recurrence relation ===
The Thue–Morse sequence is the sequence &quot;tn&quot; satisfying the recurrence relation

:formula_1

for all non-negative integers &quot;n&quot;.

=== L-system ===
The Thue–Morse sequence is a morphic word: it is the output of the following Lindenmayer system:
=== Characterization using bitwise negation ===
The Thue–Morse sequence in the form given above, as a sequence of bits, can be defined recursively using the operation of bitwise negation.
So, the first element is 0.
Then once the first 2&quot;n&quot; elements have been specified, forming a string &quot;s&quot;, then the next 2&quot;n&quot; elements must form the bitwise negation of &quot;s&quot;.
Now we have defined the first 2&quot;n&quot;+1 elements, and we recurse.

Spelling out the first few steps in detail:
* We start with 0.
* The bitwise negation of 0 is 1.
* Combining these, the first 2 elements are 01.
* The bitwise negation of 01 is 10.
* Combining these, the first 4 elements are 0110.
* The bitwise negation of 0110 is 1001.
* Combining these, the first 8 elements are 01101001.
* And so on.

So
* &quot;T&quot;0 = 0.
* &quot;T&quot;1 = 01.
* &quot;T&quot;2 = 0110.
* &quot;T&quot;3 = 01101001.
* &quot;T&quot;4 = 0110100110010110.
* &quot;T&quot;5 = 01101001100101101001011001101001.
* &quot;T&quot;6 = 0110100110010110100101100110100110010110011010010110100110010110.
* And so on.

In Python:

def thue_morse_bits(n):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Return an int containing the first 2**n bits of the Thue-Morse sequence, low-order bit 1st.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 bits = 0
 for i in range(n):
 bits |= ((1 « (1 « i)) - 1 - bits) « (1 « i)
 return bits
Which can then be converted to a (reversed) string as follows: 

n = 7
print(f&quot;{thue_morse_bits(n):0{1«n}b}&quot;)
=== Infinite product ===
The sequence can also be defined by:
: formula_2
where &quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the &quot;j&quot;th element if we start at &quot;j&quot; = 0.

== Properties ==
The Thue–Morse sequence contains many &quot;squares&quot;: instances of the string formula_3, where formula_4 denotes the string formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, or formula_8, where formula_9 for some formula_10 and formula_6 is the bitwise negation of formula_5. For instance, if formula_13, then formula_14. The square formula_15 appears in formula_16 starting at the 16th bit. Since all squares in formula_16 are obtained by repeating one of these 4 strings, they all have length formula_18 or formula_19 for some formula_20. formula_16 contains no &quot;cubes&quot;: instances of formula_22. There are also no &quot;overlapping squares&quot;: instances of formula_23 or formula_24. The critical exponent of formula_16 is 2.

The Thue–Morse sequence is a uniformly recurrent word: given any finite string &quot;X&quot; in the sequence, there is some length &quot;nX&quot; (often much longer than the length of &quot;X&quot;) such that &quot;X&quot; appears in &quot;every&quot; block of length &quot;nX&quot;. Notably, the Thue-Morse sequence is uniformly recurrent &quot;without&quot; being either periodic or eventually periodic (i.e., periodic after some initial nonperiodic segment).

The sequence &quot;T&quot;2&quot;n&quot; is a palindrome for any &quot;n&quot;. Furthermore, let &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; be a word obtained by counting the ones between consecutive zeros in &quot;T&quot;2&quot;n&quot; . For instance, &quot;q&quot;1 = 2 and &quot;q&quot;2 = 2102012. Since &quot;Tn&quot; does not contain &quot;overlapping squares&quot;, the words &quot;qn&quot; are palindromic squarefree words.

The Thue–Morse morphism &quot;μ&quot; is defined on alphabet {0,1} by the substitution map &quot;μ&quot;(0) = 01, &quot;μ&quot;(1) = 10: every 0 in a sequence is replaced with 01 and every 1 with 10. If &quot;T&quot; is the Thue–Morse sequence, then &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is also &quot;T&quot;. Thus, &quot;T&quot; is a fixed point of &quot;μ&quot;. The morphism &quot;μ&quot; is a prolongable morphism on the free monoid {0,1}∗ with &quot;T&quot; as fixed point: &quot;T&quot; is essentially the &quot;only&quot; fixed point of &quot;μ&quot;; the only other fixed point is the bitwise negation of &quot;T&quot;, which is simply the Thue–Morse sequence on (1,0) instead of on (0,1). This property may be generalized to the concept of an automatic sequence.

The &quot;generating series&quot; of &quot;T&quot; over the binary field is the formal power series

:formula_26

This power series is algebraic over the field of rational functions, satisfying the equation

:formula_27

=== In combinatorial game theory ===
The set of &quot;evil numbers&quot; (numbers formula_28 with formula_29) forms a subspace of the nonnegative integers under nim-addition (bitwise exclusive or). For the game of Kayles, evil nim-values occur for few (finitely many) positions in the game, with all remaining positions having odious nim-values.

=== The Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem === 
The Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem can be defined as: given a positive integer &quot;N&quot; and a non-negative integer &quot;k&quot;, partition the set &quot;S&quot; = { 0, 1, ..., &quot;N&quot;-1 } into two disjoint subsets &quot;S&quot;0 and &quot;S&quot;1 that have equal sums of powers up to k, that is:
:formula_30 for all integers &quot;i&quot; from 1 to &quot;k&quot;.

This has a solution if &quot;N&quot; is a multiple of 2&quot;k&quot;+1, given by:
* &quot;S&quot;0 consists of the integers &quot;n&quot; in &quot;S&quot; for which &quot;tn&quot; = 0,
* &quot;S&quot;1 consists of the integers &quot;n&quot; in &quot;S&quot; for which &quot;tn&quot; = 1.

For example, for &quot;N&quot; = 8 and &quot;k&quot; = 2,
:

The condition requiring that &quot;N&quot; be a multiple of 2&quot;k&quot;+1 is not strictly necessary: there are some further cases for which a solution exists. However, it guarantees a stronger property: if the condition is satisfied, then the set of &quot;k&quot;th powers of any set of &quot;N&quot; numbers in arithmetic progression can be partitioned into two sets with equal sums. This follows directly from the expansion given by the binomial theorem applied to the binomial representing the &quot;n&quot;th element of an arithmetic progression.

For generalizations of the Thue–Morse sequence and the Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem to partitions into more than two parts, see Bolker, Offner, Richman and Zara, &quot;The Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem and generalized Thue–Morse sequences&quot;.

=== Fractals and turtle graphics ===
Using turtle graphics, a curve can be generated if an automaton is programmed with a sequence.
When Thue–Morse sequence members are used in order to select program states:

* If &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0, move ahead by one unit,
* If &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 1, rotate by an angle of π/3 radians (60°)

The resulting curve converges to the Koch curve, a fractal curve of
infinite length containing a finite area. This illustrates the fractal nature of the Thue–Morse Sequence.

It is also possible to draw the curve precisely using the following instructions:

*If &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0, rotate by an angle of π radians (180°),
* If &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 1, move ahead by one unit, then rotate by an angle of π/3 radians.

===Equitable sequencing===
In their book on the problem of fair division, Steven Brams and Alan Taylor invoked the Thue–Morse sequence but did not identify it as such. When allocating a contested pile of items between two parties who agree on the items&#x27; relative values, Brams and Taylor suggested a method they called &quot;balanced alternation&quot;, or &quot;taking turns taking turns taking turns . . . &quot;, as a way to circumvent the favoritism inherent when one party chooses before the other. An example showed how a divorcing couple might reach a fair settlement in the distribution of jointly-owned items. The parties would take turns to be the first chooser at different points in the selection process: Ann chooses one item, then Ben does, then Ben chooses one item, then Ann does.

Lionel Levine and Katherine E. Stange, in their discussion of how to fairly apportion a shared meal such as an Ethiopian dinner, proposed the Thue–Morse sequence as a way to reduce the advantage of moving first. They suggested that “it would be interesting to quantify the intuition that the Thue–Morse order tends to produce a fair outcome.”

Robert Richman addressed this problem, but he too did not identify the Thue–Morse sequence as such at the time of publication. He presented the sequences &quot;Tn&quot; as step functions on the interval [0,1] and described their relationship to the Walsh and Rademacher functions. He showed that the &quot;n&quot;th derivative can be expressed in terms of &quot;Tn&quot;. As a consequence, the step function arising from &quot;Tn&quot; is orthogonal to polynomials of order &quot;n&quot; − 1. A consequence of this result is that a resource whose value is expressed as a monotonically decreasing continuous function is most fairly allocated using a sequence that converges to Thue–Morse as the function becomes flatter. An example showed how to pour cups of coffee of equal strength from a carafe with a nonlinear concentration gradient, prompting a whimsical article in the popular press.

Joshua Cooper and Aaron Dutle showed why the Thue–Morse order provides a fair outcome for discrete events. They considered the fairest way to stage a Galois duel, in which each of the shooters has equally poor shooting skills. Cooper and Dutle postulated that each dueler would demand a chance to fire as soon as the other&#x27;s &quot;a priori&quot; probability of winning exceeded their own. They proved that, as the duelers’ hitting probability approaches zero, the firing sequence converges to the Thue–Morse sequence. In so doing, they demonstrated that the Thue–Morse order produces a fair outcome not only for sequences &quot;Tn&quot; of length &quot;2n&quot;, but for sequences of any length.

Thus the mathematics supports using the Thue–Morse sequence instead of alternating turns when the goal is fairness but earlier turns differ monotonically from later turns in some meaningful quality, whether that quality varies continuously or discretely.

Sports competitions form an important class of equitable sequencing problems, because strict alternation often gives an unfair advantage to one team. Ignacio Palacios-Huerta proposed changing the sequential order to Thue–Morse to improve the &quot;ex post&quot; fairness of various tournament competitions, such as the kicking sequence of a penalty shoot-out in soccer. He did a set of field experiments with pro players and found that the team kicking first won 60% of games using ABAB (or &quot;T&quot;1), 54% using ABBA (or &quot;T&quot;2), and 51% using full Thue–Morse (or &quot;T&quot;n).  As a result, ABBA is undergoing extensive trials in FIFA (European and World Championships) and English Federation professional soccer (EFL Cup). An ABBA serving pattern has also been found to improve the fairness of tennis tie-breaks. In competitive rowing, &quot;T&quot;2 is the only arrangement of port- and starboard-rowing crew members that eliminates transverse forces (and hence sideways wiggle) on a four-membered coxless racing boat, while &quot;T&quot;3 is one of only four rigs to avoid wiggle on an eight-membered boat.

Fairness is especially important in player drafts. Many professional sports leagues attempt to achieve competitive parity by giving earlier selections in each round to weaker teams. By contrast, fantasy football leagues have no pre-existing imbalance to correct, so they often use a “snake” draft (forward, backward, etc.; or &quot;T&quot;1). Ian Allan argued that a “third-round reversal” (forward, backward, backward, forward, etc.; or &quot;T&quot;2) would be even more fair. Richman suggested that the fairest way for “captain A” and “captain B” to choose sides for a pick-up game of basketball mirrors &quot;T&quot;3: captain A has the first, fourth, sixth, and seventh choices, while captain B has the second, third, fifth, and eighth choices.

=== Hash collisions ===
The initial bits of the Thue–Morse sequence are mapped to 0 by a wide class of polynomial hash functions modulo a power of two, which can lead to hash collisions.

===Riemann zeta function===
Certain linear combinations of Dirichlet series whose coefficients are terms of the Thue–Morse sequence give rise to identities involving the Riemann Zeta function (Tóth, 2022 ). For instance:
:formula_31
where formula_32 is the formula_33 term of the Thue-Morse sequence. In fact, for all formula_34 with real part greater than formula_35, we have
:formula_36

== History ==
The Thue–Morse sequence was first studied by in 1851, who applied it to number theory.
However, Prouhet did not mention the sequence explicitly; this was left to Axel Thue in 1906, who used it to found the study of combinatorics on words.
The sequence was only brought to worldwide attention with the work of Marston Morse in 1921, when he applied it to differential geometry.
The sequence has been discovered independently many times, not always by professional research mathematicians; for example, Max Euwe, a chess grandmaster and mathematics teacher, discovered it in 1929 in an application to chess: by using its cube-free property (see above), he showed how to circumvent the threefold repetition rule aimed at preventing infinitely protracted games by declaring repetition of moves a draw. At the time, consecutive identical board states were required to trigger the rule; the rule was later amended to the same board position reoccurring three times at any point, as the sequence shows that the consecutive criterion can be evaded forever.

<doc id="491904" wikidata="Q3521239" url="?curid=491904" title="The Hellbound Heart">
<text>The Hellbound Heart is a horror novella by Clive Barker, first published in November 1986 by Dark Harvest in the third volume of its &quot;Night Visions&quot; anthology series. The story features a hedonist criminal acquiring a mystical puzzle box, the LeMarchand Configuration, which can be used to summon the Cenobites, demonic beings who do not distinguish between pain and pleasure. He escapes the Cenobites and, with help, resorts to murder to restore himself to full life. Later on, the puzzle box is found by another.

Along with introducing Barker&#x27;s Cenobites, the story was the basis for the 1987 film &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (written and directed by Barker) and its franchise. One Cenobite in particular, nameless in the original novella but nicknamed &quot;Pinhead&quot; by the production crew and fans, became a popular villain among horror movie fans. This character appeared in later Barker prose with the official names &quot;the Hell Priest&quot; and &quot;the Cold Man&quot;.

The original novella was re-released as a standalone title by HarperPaperbacks in 1991, after the success of the first film, along with an audiobook recorded by Clive Barker and published by Simon &amp; Schuster Audioworks in 1988. The story retains the gory, visceral style Barker introduced in his anthology series &quot;The Books of Blood&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Frank Cotton is a hedonistic criminal selfishly devoted to sensual experience even if it harms others. Believing he has indulged in every pleasure the world can offer, Frank pursues rumours of the LeMarchand Configuration, a puzzle box said to open a &quot;schism&quot; or portal to an extradimensional realm of unfathomable pleasure ruled by beings called the Cenobites. In Düsseldorf, Frank obtains the box and returns with it to his deceased grandmother&#x27;s home in England. Solving the box, he is confused and horrified when the Cenobites – horribly scarified creatures whose bodies have been modified to the point that they appear sexless and in constant pain – arrive. The Cenobites warn he cannot renege on their agreement once it is made, but Frank still eagerly accepts the offer of experiences he has never known before. With Frank as their newest &quot;experiment&quot;, the Cenobites subject him to total sensory overload and he realises their devotion to sadomasochism is so extreme and their personalities so removed from humanity that they no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure and have no care to ever stop even if their subject no longer wishes the experience. Frank is taken to the Cenobite realm, a hellish dimension where he will be subjected to an eternity of torture.

Sometime later, Frank&#x27;s brother, Rory, moves into the home in England with his wife Julia. Unknown to Rory, Julia had an affair with Frank a week before their wedding and has lusted after him since. While in the attic, Rory accidentally cuts his hand and bleeds on the spot where Frank was taken by the Cenobites. The blood, mixed with semen Frank had left on the floor before he was taken, opens a dimensional schism. Frank returns, his body now reduced to a desiccated corpse by the Cenobites&#x27; experiments. Julia later finds him and promises to restore his body so he can truly live and they can be together.

While Rory works, Julia seduces men at bars and brings them to the attic where she murders them. Frank feeds on their bodies, causing his own to slowly regenerate. Kirsty, a friend of Rory&#x27;s who has romantic feelings for him, suspects Julia is having an affair. Rory suspects the same and while attempting to catch Julia in the act at his request, Kirsty encounters Frank, who attempts to kill her. Kirsty grabs the puzzle box, using it as a weapon before fleeing. She collapses on the street from exhaustion and wakes up in a hospital later. While waiting, she solves the box and inadvertently summons a Cenobite. It explains the box is called the LeMarchand Configuration and realises Kirsty summoned it by accident, but then remarks this does not matter. The Cenobite intends to take Kirsty now that it is here, but she then reveals Frank is alive on Earth again. Though skeptical that one of their experiments could have escaped, the Cenobite is intrigued. It agrees that if Kirsty leads them to Frank and he confirms his identity, they will take him back and perhaps leave her alone. The Cenobite seems to vanish and Kirsty returns to the house.
Rory and Julia claim they killed Frank but Kirsty realises the man she is speaking to is Frank wearing Rory&#x27;s skin. Another altercation ensues, during which Frank inadvertently kills Julia. Kirsty then baits Frank into admitting his true name out loud. The Cenobites appear, ensnare Frank and return him to their realm, telling Kirsty to leave. Downstairs, Kirsty sees Julia&#x27;s disembodied head calling for help. The leader of the Cenobites, a being called the Engineer, then appears and seems to take away Julia as well before briefly bumping into Kirsty. After leaving the house, Kirsty realises the Engineer gave her the puzzle box to watch over until another seeks it out.

Looking at the box&#x27;s surface, Kirsty imagines she sees Julia and Frank&#x27;s faces but not Rory&#x27;s. She wonders if there are other puzzles that may unlock doors to a paradise where Rory resides, but laments that she may never find one and that broken hearts might be puzzles that cannot be solved.

==Background==
Barker worked as a hustler in the &#x27;70s, and his experiences made him want to tell a story about &quot;good and evil in which sexuality was the connective tissue&quot;. The look of the cenobites was inspired by S&amp;M clubs, such as an underground club called Cellblock 28 in New York, where people were getting pierced for fun. When he directed and wrote the film adaptation, Barker considered naming the film &quot;Sadomasochists from Hell&quot;.

He came up with the idea about LeMarchand&#x27;s box because he did not want to resort to &quot;drawing a circle on the floor with magical symbols around it&quot; to get access to Hell, as it seemed like an old cliché. Instead he was inspired by a puzzle box his grandfather, a ship&#x27;s cook, brought with him from the Far East, which he obsessed over as a kid.

==Film adaptations==
A film adaptation was released in 1987, written and directed by Barker, which subsequently spawned nine sequels, a remake, and a multimedia franchise. In the film, Rory is renamed Larry Cotton. Kirsty is named Kirsty Cotton and is Larry&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage rather than a friend and co-worker who has a romantic crush on him. The LeMarchand Configuration is also referred to in the film series as the &quot;Lament Configuration&quot;.

==Audio adaptation==
A full-cast audio adaptation of the novella was released in 2018, adapted by Paul Kane and produced by Bafflegab Productions. It starred Alice Lowe as Kirsty, Neve McIntosh as Julia, and Tom Meeten as both Frank and Rory. Other roles are played by Evie Dawnay, Chris Pavlo, Nicholas Vince, Scott Brooksbank, and Lisa Bowerman (famous for her portrayal of Bernice Summerfield and her work with Big Finish Productions).

The audio play is a faithful adaptation of the original novella. As in the novella, several Cenobites appear but are not named. In the audio play&#x27;s ending, there is no mention of the Engineer taking away Julia. Kirsty finds herself entrusted with the puzzle box and says she does not want it, but the voices of the Cenobites tell her she has no choice and now belongs to the box. She does not wonder about the existence of puzzle boxes that can lead to Heavens as well as Hells.

==Sequels==

The novella received two sequels, &quot;The Scarlet Gospels&quot; written by Clive Barker and published in 2015, and &quot;Hellraiser: The Toll&quot; published in 2018, written by Mark Alan Miller with the story by Clive Barker. The Cenobites are briefly mentioned in passing (as &quot;the Surgeons&quot;) in the book &quot;Weaveworld&quot;.

&quot;The Scarlet Gospels&quot; cements that the Cenobites live in the same reality as Clive Barker&#x27;s occult detective Harry D&#x27;Amour. The same novel involves the Cenobite Pinhead, identifying him as &quot;The Hell Priest&quot; and &quot;The Cold Man&quot;.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1988.

==Events==

=== March ===
* 4 — In South Africa, the Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 imposes an age of consent of 19 for lesbian sex, which had previously been unregulated by the law. This was higher than the age of 16 applying to heterosexual sex.

=== April ===
* In Hungary, Lambda becomes the first LGBT organisation to be registered, also becoming the first such official recognition of an LGBT organization in Central and Eastern Europe.

=== May ===
* May 24 — In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government passes Section 28, a clause that bans the &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot; by local government.

=== October ===
* 11 — In the United States, National Coming Out Day is founded.
* 15 — Alexandria, Virginia, bans discrimination in employment, housing and other practices based on sexual orientation.

===November===
* 8 — Voters in Oregon approve Measure 8, repealing Governor Neil Goldschmidt&#x27;s 1987 executive order banning sexual orientation discrimination in state employment. The repeal does not go into effect as it is immediately challenged in court, and is ruled unconstitutional in 1992.

=== December ===
* 21 — The Chicago City Council votes 28–17 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.
