<text>Touch typing (also called blind typing, or touch keyboarding) is a style of typing. Although the phrase refers to typing without using the sense of sight to find the keys—specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory—the term is often used to refer to a specific form of touch typing that involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard (the &quot;home row&quot;) and having them reach for specific other keys. (Under this usage, typists who do not look at the keyboard but do not use home row either are referred to as hybrid typists.) Both two-handed touch typing and one-handed touch typing are possible.

Frank Edward McGurrin, a court stenographer from Salt Lake City, Utah who taught typing classes, reportedly invented home row touch typing in 1888.
On a standard QWERTY keyboard for English speakers the home row keys are: &quot;ASDF&quot; for the left hand and &quot;JKL;&quot; for the right hand. Most modern computer keyboards have a raised dot or bar on the home keys for the index fingers to help touch typists maintain and rediscover the correct positioning of the fingers on the keyboard keys.

== History ==
Original layouts for the first few mechanical typewriters were in alphabetical order (ABCDE etc.) Changes were made, mostly responding to suggestions from telegraphists who were among the first users. Common letters were moved towards the center and into the upper row. Z and S are close to each other because the American Morse codes of Z and a common diagram SE (both ) are near the same, so the telegraphist often needs to wait for more signals before understanding the content. The view that the layout was intentionally redesigned to slow down the operator, to prevent jamming the mechanism, is widespread but not correct.

The calculations for keyboard layout were based on the language being typed and this meant different keyboard layouts would be needed for each language. In English-speaking countries, for example, the first row is QWERTY, but in French-speaking countries it is AZERTY. Though mechanical typewriters are now rarely used, moves to change the layout to increase speed have been largely ignored or resisted due to familiarity with the existing layout among touch typists.

On July 25, 1888, an American man, Frank Edward McGurrin, who was reportedly the only person using touch typing at the time, won a decisive victory over Louis Traub (operating Caligraph with eight-finger method) in a typing contest held in Cincinnati. The results were displayed on the front pages of many newspapers. McGurrin won US$500 (equivalent to $13,304 in 2019 USD) and popularized the new typing method.

Whether McGurrin was actually the first person to touch type or simply the first to be popularly noticed, is disputed. Speeds attained by other typists in other typing competitions at the time suggest that they must have been using similar systems.

In 1889, Bates Torrey coined the words &quot;writing by touch&quot; in his article. In 1890, Lovisa Ellen Bullard Barnes defined the words &quot;write by touch&quot; in her book as follows:
In 1985, Touch Typist Typing Tutor, developed and released by Sector Software is an early example of typing tutor software.

Touch typing is contrasted to &quot;search and peck&quot;, also known as &quot;hunt-and-peck&quot; or &quot;two-fingered typing&quot;. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist finds each key by sight and moves their finger over to press it, usually the index finger of their dominant hand. This method is considered inferior as not only is it slower than touch typing, the typist would have to have their fingers travel a greater distance.

Various other styles in between those two exist—for example, using a &quot;search-and-peck&quot; method, but with an increased number of fingers; typing without looking at the keyboard, but using fewer than the eight fingers that the home row method uses (commonly, the omission of the little finger as the weakest finger that many will find difficult to hit keys with due to either less strength, less dexterity, or both); moving their entire hand to reach for the desired key; or only moving when a key needs to be pressed instead of always returning to home row after every keystroke.


== Advantages ==

=== Speed ===
Touch type training can improve an individual&#x27;s typing speed and accuracy dramatically. Speeds average around 30–40 WPM (words per minute), while a speed of 60–80 WPM is the approximate speed to keep up with one&#x27;s thoughts. A Microsoft survey suggested that many managers expect employees to be able to type at a minimum of 50 WPM. Professional career typists can exceed 100 WPM repeatedly and continuously (secretarial, data entry, etc.). Routine practice is required to maintain a high typing speed and accuracy.

=== Reduced switching of attention ===
A touch typist does not need to move the sight between the keyboard (that is obscured with fingers and may be poorly lit) and other areas that require attention. This increases productivity and reduces the number of errors.

=== Reduced neck strain ===
Touch typing helps improve posture and reduce neck pain by keeping one&#x27;s eyes focused on the display and avoiding a constant need to glance at the keyboard.

=== Disputes over advantages ===
There are many other typing styles in between novice-style &quot;hunt and peck&quot; and touch typing. For example, many hunt-and-peck typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. One study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists. According to the study, &quot;The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.&quot; To quote doctoral candidate Anna Feit: &quot;We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course performed at similar average speed and accuracy as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average&quot;. However, the study has been criticised for only selecting subjects with average typing speeds up to 75 words per minute, thus lacking generalizability for faster typists.

== Training ==
A touch typist starts by placing their fingers on the &quot;start position&quot; in the middle row and knows which finger to move and how much to move it for reaching any required key. Learning typically includes first printing exercises containing only letters on or near the standard position and then gradually mastering other rows. It is important to learn placing fingers into the start position blindly as the hands are frequently raised from the keyboard to operate the line feed lever (in the past) or (more recently) the computer mouse. The keys F and J frequently contain some surface features that allow the typist to recognize them by touch alone, thus removing the need to look down at the keys to reset the fingers at the home row.

The typing speed can be increased gradually and speeds of 60 WPM or higher can be achieved. The increase in speed varies between individuals. Many websites and software products are available to learn touch typing and many of these are free. Learning touch typing can be stressful both to the fingers as well as the mind in the beginning, but once it is learned to a decent level, it exerts minimal stress on the fingers. For individuals with past typing experience, learning to touch type is particularly difficult due to motivational reasons: the initial performance level in touch typing is far lower than in visually guided typing; therefore it does not initially seem worthwhile to study touch typing.

Typing speed generally improves with practice. While practicing, it is important to ensure that there are no weak keys. Typing speed is typically determined by how slow these weak keys are typed rather than how fast the remaining keys are typed. If a stage is reached where irrespective of the amount of practice, typing speed is not increasing, it is advisable to let some time pass and continue serious practice thereafter as typing speeds typically tend to increase with time even when no serious practice is done.

=== Home row ===

The &quot;home row&quot; is the center row of keys on a typewriter or computer keyboard. On the most common type of English language keyboard, the QWERTY layout, &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; are the home keys on the home row.

The middle row of the keyboard is termed &quot;home row&quot; because typists are trained to keep their fingers on these keys and return to them after pressing any other key that is not on the home row. The home row is also called the middle row because it is located in the middle between the top row—further back from the typist—and bottom row – closer to the typist.

Some keyboards have a small bump on certain keys of the home row. This helps returning the fingers to the home row for touch typing.

For instance, to type the word &quot;poll&quot; on a QWERTY keyboard, one would place all of one&#x27;s fingers on the home row. (The right hand should be covering &quot; &quot; with the right thumb on the while the left hand covers &quot; &quot; with the left thumb on the .) The typist will then use their little finger to reach for the &quot; key located just above the semicolon and then return the little finger back to the semicolon key from which it originated. The ring finger, located on the &quot; key will be moved directly upwards to press the &quot; key and then back. Finally, the same ring finger will remain on the &quot; key and press it twice. Experienced typists can do this at speeds of over 100 words per minute.

== Other methods ==
A method taught since the 1960s (and perhaps earlier): The left little finger is used for the keys , the ring finger for , the middle — , the left index finger is responsible for and . On the right side of the keyboard: index — and , middle — , ring — and the little — all other keys on the right side of the upper row. These two methods likely reflect the layout of the typewriters from early days when some of them had no and/or keys.

A third method is a mix of both methods: The left hand works exactly the same as above, and the right hand as in the base method (the right index finger is used for digit only). Some people consider this more ergonomic since the fingers of both hands generally move to the inside.

There exist special ergonomic keyboards designed for each typing method. The keyboard is split between the keys and or and .

Some specialized high-end computer keyboards are designed for touch typists. For example, many manufacturers provide blank mechanical keyboards. A trained touch typist should not mind using a blank keyboard. This kind of keyboard may force hunt and peck users to type without looking, similar to Braille keyboards used by the visually impaired.

<text>Darkstalkers, known in Japan as , is a fighting game series and media franchise created by Capcom. The series is set in a pastiche gothic fiction universe with characters based on monsters from international folklore, and features a stylized 2D graphic style. Its first game, &quot;,&quot; was released in arcades in 1994 and its third and final main game is &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot;, released in 1997. &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; introduced gameplay concepts used in later Capcom fighting games, including the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series.

Besides video games, the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; media franchise also includes an anime miniseries, an American animated series, a Canadian comic book series, and many books of various kinds and other media released only in Japan. Some individual characters, such as Morrigan Aensland and Felicia, appeared in later Capcom games, as well as in a few crossover games released by other companies.

== Video games ==

=== Original arcade games ===
The &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; series is composed of five arcade games and the home ports and compilations of those games.
=== Ports, remasters, and compilations ===
=== Future ===
Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono said in 2007: &quot;Personally, I&#x27;d love to make a new &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, and I&#x27;d also like to see the triumphant return of &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; to a new generation of technology. It would be an interesting challenge with &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, because in the old games you&#x27;d see a lot of really interesting animations as characters would morph into different forms. That would be tricky to do with this 3D engine, but not impossible. In two or three years, if I got the chance to resurrect that series, I&#x27;d like to shock Hollywood with how good the graphics would look&quot;. In August 2010, Ono stated during an interview about &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; that a new installment to the series would be his &quot;ultimate dream&quot;, but only fan demand would cause it to happen. He went on to say that it would take one million requests before Keiji Inafune, then head of research and development at Capcom, would comply. At that point, Capcom had received 5,000 requests. By March 2011, Ono reported that Capcom had received over 100,000 requests. He later expressed during an interview at a Nintendo 3DS launch in London that &quot;one day, if it goes half a million, Capcom may raise its eyebrow a little bit and I could do what I did in London in 2007 when I announced the comeback of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. In the near future, with your help, it may become true. It&#x27;s on its way, because we&#x27;re pretty much where we were with &quot;Street Fighter&quot; a few years back. So keep it up&quot;.

At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Ono revealed during the &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; panel that while a new &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; title had not been approved, he reassured the series&#x27; fans that &quot;&quot;Darkstalkers&quot; is not dead&quot;. He then proceeded to take a photo of the attendees at the panel holding up their money to send to decision makers at Capcom to show support for the game. Later the following year in June, a message &quot;Darkstalkers are not dead&quot; appeared in a trailer for the PlayStation Vita version of &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;; when asked about it, Ono wrote on his Twitter: &quot;I can&#x27;t announce about &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; yet&quot;. Ono later teased the presence of &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; at a panel for &quot;Street Fighter&quot;&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Celebration at San Diego Comic-Con in July. Instead of taking a photo to send proof of demand to Capcom&#x27;s upper management like he had done in the past, he stated: &quot;This year, you don&#x27;t have to do that, and it&#x27;s not necessarily bad news!&quot;, but refrained himself from saying anything else.

Following the announcement of &quot;Darkstalkers Resurrection&quot; at 2012 New York Comic Con in October, a concept trailer was shown during Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; 25th Anniversary panel. &quot;Darkstalkers Resurrection&quot; producer Derek Neal and Yoshinori Ono told interviewers that the re-release bundle was the first step towards revitalizing the franchise. Neal also claimed that Capcom is using &quot;Darkstalkers Resurrection&quot; as a test to gauge audience interest in a new &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; installment. In April 2013, Capcom senior vice president Christian Svensson wrote: &quot;We&#x27;ve not given up. But I&#x27;m disappointed in the opening sales response relative to any other fighting title we&#x27;ve put out on the same platforms given the frequency and urgency of requests we&#x27;ve had here over the last several years and the quality of the execution. It is the most fully featured and probably best project of this type we&#x27;ve done. And before people jump to the wrong conclusions, I&#x27;m not blaming fans who did buy it and supported the brand. I&#x27;m very thankful for those guys (thank you, to all of you). I&#x27;m more disappointed by my misread of the information in this particular case&quot;. There was no &quot;Darkstalkers are not dead&quot; line at San Diego Comic-Con in 2013. Matt Dahlgren, Capcom&#x27;s new fighting game manager, said that because &quot;&quot;Darkstalkers Resurrection&quot; did not perform as well as we would have liked. You never know what the future may hold, but &quot;Street Fighter&quot; is definitely not dead. There is nothing &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; on the immediate horizon for sure&quot;.

==Plot==
The &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; games take place on the planet Earth that is in the process of merging with a realm known as Makai. The reason for this merger varies depending on the continuity, but a continuing theme is that the union of realms brings the arrival of the Darkstalkers to the human world, the term being a catch-all for the various creatures of legend. The greatest of these supernatural creatures, and the greatest among those who hunt them, meet in battle to determine who will rule the night.

In the original game and the sequel, &quot;Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge&quot;, an alien overlord named Pyron returns to Earth after being away for many years. His quest to conquer the world using an army of robots brings the Darkstalkers out of hiding to oppose his rule over humanity and the supernatural. A second sequel, &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot;, saw the debut of Jedah, previously one of the nobles of Makai, who decides that the only way to save the realm is to take control of it by force. Accordingly, he lures the Darkstalkers into a trap to use their collective souls to remake the realm and control both humanity and the supernatural.

&quot;Darkstalkers&quot; characters are either based on various iconic literary and cinematic monsters, or inspired by international mythology and fairy tales. The 1997 anime miniseries &quot;Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge&quot;, which was based on the first two titles, was faithful to the characters&#x27; in-game personalities. The 1995 American-produced cartoon series, simply titled &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, dropped the backstory of the games altogether in favor of a standard good-versus-evil plot, altering certain characters&#x27; storylines in the process.

=== Introduced in &quot;&quot; ===
=== Introduced in &quot;Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge&quot; ===
&quot;Night Warriors&quot; is an upgraded version of the previous game, with the same story and returning cast. In addition, several new characters were added to the game, and the boss characters Pyron and Huitzil were made playable.
=== Introduced in &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot; ===
&quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot; was the first actual sequel title, introducing several new characters and a new storyline. While originally Pyron, Donovan and Huitzil did not return, variations of the game were released that did, including &quot;Vampire Hunter 2&quot; and &quot;Vampire Savior 2&quot;. The PlayStation port included the cast as a whole, with new story mode endings provided for the originally cut trio. Years later &quot;&quot; included a special version of &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot; with one more additional character, Dee.

Multiple other books (guide books, art books, illustrated books, and novels) were published as well, mostly in Japan only. However, some of them were also published in North America:
* In 2008, UDON released the &quot;Darkstalkers Graphic File&quot;, a collection of screenshots, storyboards and concept art from the series.
* In 2009, UDON released a 15th anniversary art book &quot;Darkstalkers Tribute&quot;. It consists of submitted artwork from fans of the series, along with artwork from some of UDON and Capcom&#x27;s own artists and several famous manga artists such as Yasuhiro Nightow. The book was first available in August at several anime conventions before being widely released the following September.
* In 2014, UDON released a 20th anniversary art book &quot;Darkstalkers Official Complete Works&quot; that &quot;collects the artwork of every &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; game, including key visuals, character illustrations, promotional artwork, rough concepts, and creator commentary&quot;, as well as &quot;multiple new interviews with the creators behind the series, plus all-new tribute pin-ups&quot; from Capcom artists.

===Soundtracks===

The game was released by the Capcom subsidiary, Enterrise (エンターライズ, Entarāizu) featuring the cast of the original &quot;Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors&quot;, although the game&#x27;s website utilized artwork from &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot; along with new secondary characters exclusive to only this title.

==Reception==


Despite its limited commercial success, &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; was very well received by critics and acquired a sizable cult following. Destructoid&#x27;s Kyle Mac Gregor described it as &quot;beloved&quot;, and IGN&#x27;s Richard George described it as both &quot;obscure and beloved&quot;. According to MTV, although &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; &quot;has developed a loyal fanbase over the years, it was never enough for the developer/publisher to give the series much attention&quot;. Including &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; in their list of video game franchises &quot;founded on boobs&quot;, GamesRadar US called it &quot;second only to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; as an object of Japanophilic cosplay figurine collector worship. While the character design in immensely cool, some of the fan art is downright disturbing&quot;. Keith Stuart of &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the series fourth in his 2012 top list of vampiric video games, citing its &quot;beautiful visuals and superb animation&quot;.

The cast of characters for the franchise has been credited with making the games &quot;a standout among the fighting games of the era&quot;, as instead of &quot;conventional cast of martial artists with the occasional odd creature, Darkstalkers was a gallery of monsters&quot;. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; stated that the game&#x27;s colorful cast earned the game a cult following, despite its relative lack of recognition.

GamesRadar&#x27;s Lucas Sullivan ranked &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; first on his 2012 list of &quot;obscure&quot; fighting games deserving an HD remake, opining it &quot;offers just as much 2D fighting goodness as the venerable &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, but it&#x27;s never gotten the same kind of respect ... and that just ain&#x27;t right&quot;. UGO.com included &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; on their 2010 list of the games that need sequels. &quot;Complex&quot; writers put &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; at number 40 in their 2012 ranking of best video game franchises, adding that they would &quot;love to see a modern incarnation&quot;, and listed a hypothetical &quot;Darkstalkers 4&quot; among the 15 games they wished would be announced at E3 2011. The magazine&#x27;s Andrew Hayward ranked &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; first on his 2011 list of most missed fighting franchises, stating that &quot;every time Capcom announces a new fighting game, the hardcore community gets whipped up about &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;″ continual absence, and demands a modern iteration. The supernatural 2D franchise wasn&#x27;t a big hit, but fervent fans have kept its name alive and seem unwilling to let it fade away&quot;.

One attack from the game&#x27;s cast, &quot;Midnight Bliss&quot;, has also received significant praise on its own. A move where Demitri will charge forward and temporarily transform the opponent into a girl before draining their blood, it has been described by Chris Hoffman of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; as one of Capcom&#x27;s greatest contributions to gaming history. Writer Zoran Iovanovici in an article for &quot;Game Developer&quot; observed how fans took to the concept, citing it as a mini-genre of a &quot;gender swap&quot; genre among fan artists, crossplayers, and custom fighting game communities such as those built around M.U.G.E.N. The transformed state of &quot;King of Fighters&quot; character Goenitz, a priest serving the villain Orochi, proved extremely popular. Appearing as a nun, the fandom dubbed the character &quot;Goeniko&quot; and fleshed her out as a full character for M.U.G.E.N, albeit with a more sexualized design. This later resulted in her appearing in commercial mobile game title &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Ultimate Battle OL&quot;, as well as in &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; as &quot;Lady Goenitz&quot; and with a different appearance.

<text>The [[Nauru|Republic of Nauru]] originally consisted of 169 villages; by 1900 these were already partly abandoned, uninhabited or destroyed. With the increasing population growth the single villages merged into a single connected settlement, which today is spread out around the entire coastal strip.

The village names are from the book Nauru - Ergebnisse der Südseeexpedition by Paul Hambruch, who researched on the island during the Hamburger Südsee-Expedition 1908–1910. The village names were changed following the orthographic reform of the Nauruan language of 1939.

<doc id="504875" wikidata="Q603672" url="?curid=504875" title="Speakerboxxx/The Love Below">
<text>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is the fifth studio album by the American hip hop duo Outkast. It was released on September 23, 2003, by Arista Records. Issued as a double album, its length of over two hours is spread across solo records by Big Boi and André 3000.

Originally conceived as standalone albums, the members&#x27; solo efforts were integrated into a double album under Outkast&#x27;s name as Arista deemed the decision to release solo albums unsuitable at the time. Big Boi&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; is a Southern hip hop and progressive rap album influenced by Parliament-Funkadelic, while André 3000&#x27;s &quot;The Love Below&quot; largely departs from hip hop in favor of pop, funk, jazz, psychedelia, and progressive soul styles, drawing inspiration from Prince. While &quot;The Love Below&quot; was entirely produced by André 3000, &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; featured contributions from André 3000, Mr. DJ, Carl Mo, Cutmaster Swift, and Dojo5, in addition to production by Big Boi. Lyrically, &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; discusses socially conscious themes, such as single parenthood, philosophy, religion, and politics, whereas &quot;The Love Below&quot; is centered on complexities related to love and relationships. &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; features a multifaceted array of collaborators, including Sleepy Brown, Killer Mike, Ludacris, Jay-Z, Rosario Dawson, Kelis, and Norah Jones.

&quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised the consistency of Big Boi&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; and the eclectic musical style of André 3000&#x27;s &quot;The Love Below&quot;. Numerous publications proclaimed the album as one of the best records of 2003, placing it atop their year-end listings. A commercial success, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; became Outkast&#x27;s first number-one album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 509,000 units, and went on to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2004. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), the album won Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, becoming only the second hip hop album ever to win the former. It produced five singles, two of which—&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; and &quot;The Way You Move&quot;—topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and made Outkast the first duo in the chart&#x27;s history to replace themselves at the summit. Furthermore, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. &quot;Roses&quot; reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as well, peaking at number nine, while &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; and &quot;Prototype&quot; failed to achieve substantial success.

Outkast heavily promoted &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; via interviews and televised performances, often separately, as the album was marketed as a consolidation of Big Boi and André 3000&#x27;s solo records. The strategy elicited intense media speculation over the duo&#x27;s disbandment, which the members consistently denied. The musical film &quot;Idlewild&quot; was originally slated to accompany the album, but was postponed multiple times before being released in 2006, after which Outkast embarked on an extended hiatus. Consequently, a multitude of critics have recognized &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; as a signal of Outkast&#x27;s cessation, but nonetheless hailed the album as one of the best recordings of its era. The album has been further credited for reviving the double album concept in hip hop, as well as for popularizing conscious hip hop. Following its RIAA certification update to 13-times platinum in 2023, signifying double-disc units of 6.5 million in the US, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; became the highest-certified rap album of all time. As of September 2023, it has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.

==Recording and production==
Following Outkast&#x27;s first Grammy Award win at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), André 3000 felt urged to do something different from his previous projects and moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He was relatively unsuccessful, landing a minor role in &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; (2003) and a one-episode appearance in the drama series &quot;The Shield&quot;. He subsequently returned to music, and began developing a solo album different from Outkast&#x27;s work. The output was a blend of pop, jazz and funk infused with live instruments, and with a larger emphasis on singing than rapping. When writing songs, he used a microcassette recorder in order to &quot;record melodic ideas and lyrics, then build the melody around the lyrics&quot;. He began recording &quot;The Love Below&quot; at his Los Angeles residence, using Pro Tools software, in addition to a drum machine, keyboards and various synthesizers. He enjoyed the atmosphere of recording at home instead of a studio, telling &quot;XXL&quot;: &quot;It didn&#x27;t start in the studio because if you have a bunch of people around, they&#x27;re coming from the party and I&#x27;m in there singing falsetto... those vibes didn&#x27;t match.&quot; His initial sessions were hampered by his inexperience with Pro Tools and, unaware of how to edit his recordings, he opted to record songs such as &quot;Pink &amp; Blue&quot; entirely in one take. Other gear used included an Avalon VT737 SP, as well as AD2055 EQ and AD2044 compressors for his vocals.

After creating four to five songs, he informed Big Boi of the project. Big Boi had already recorded some songs before André 3000 contacted him, but after their conversation he decided his next project would be &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot;. Describing his approach in the studio, Big Boi later commented to &quot;XXL&quot;: &quot;I had a complete vision of what an album could be that was entirely me, and the idea was just to keep it funky, keep it jamming, it&#x27;s always bass-heavy. And lyricism, it&#x27;s all about lyrics, taking pride in your pen and your pad.&quot; His favorite song to record was &quot;Unhappy&quot;. He spent several days working on its hook before driving to his mother&#x27;s home and playing the song in her driveway, to which she responded enthusiastically. At some point in the recording, the project moved to Outkast&#x27;s own Stankonia Studios in downtown Atlanta, which had been used to record its namesake &quot;Stankonia&quot; (2000). Studio manager and an engineer John Frye would later recognize that much of the media scrutiny surrounding the album&#x27;s recording was concerned with André 3000 and Big Boi&#x27;s working relationship and their decision to record separately. He conceded that both enjoyed working solo and were doing so more frequently, but continued to share and critique each other&#x27;s works. 

&quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; and &quot;The Love Below&quot; were originally conceived as individual solo efforts. However, Outkast&#x27;s management deemed the decision unsuitable, as Arista Records sought to capitalize on the momentum caused by the duo&#x27;s then-recent Grammy Award victory. In a compromise, André 3000 and Big Boi integrated their solo records into a single double album, which they envisioned as their film&#x27;s accompanying soundtrack album. Production of the film was put on hold, and the album was reconstructed into their fifth studio effort. In order to accurately display the postponed film&#x27;s plot on audio recordings, background noise such as footsteps and car door slamming were interpolated into the album&#x27;s tracks. As he finished &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; earlier than André 3000 completed &quot;The Love Below&quot;, Big Boi grew impatient due to André 3000&#x27;s prolonged recording process, and once again considered releasing &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; as a standalone solo album. While the entirety of &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; was recorded at the Stankonia Studios, a substantial portion of &quot;The Love Below&quot; was also recorded at other locations, such as the Larrabee Sound Studios and Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles, and the Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta. Frye noted the end of the recording sessions for &quot;The Love Below&quot; as particularly stressful for André 3000, whom he described as drained from working at four studios simultaneously. In total, an estimated 120 songs were recorded for &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;. One of the songs which did not make the final track listing was &quot;Millionaire&quot;, André 3000&#x27;s second collaboration with Kelis, which was instead included on her third studio album &quot;Tasty&quot; (2003) and subsequently released as a single. Meanwhile, the original track listing for &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot;, published before &quot;The Love Below&quot; was completed, included &quot;Oh No&quot;, featuring Bubba Sparxxx and BackBone; &quot;Do Dirty&quot;, featuring Killer Mike; &quot;808&quot;, featuring Bun B; and &quot;Rats &amp; Roaches&quot;, a collaborative effort between Big Boi and André 3000.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; is a 135-minute double album comprising a total of 40 tracks, including 11 interludes. It is a concept album with the intention of each disc showcasing each member&#x27;s individual perspective and musical style. Big Boi&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; is an experimental Southern hip hop and progressive rap record with lyrical themes such as single parenthood, philosophy, religion, and politics. Brett Schewitz of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted musical influences from Parliament-Funkadelic, while independent critic Roni Sarig observed the emotional range in Big Boi&#x27;s lyricism as wider on &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; than on its predecessors. After a &quot;gunshot beat&quot;-paced intro, the disc opens with &quot;GhettoMusick&quot;. The track&#x27;s eclectic musical style, encompassing electroclash, electro-funk, hip hop, and techno, is juxtaposed with recurring excerpts from Patti LaBelle&#x27;s 1983 song &quot;Love, Need and Want You&quot;, which exhibit LaBelle&#x27;s vocals against a &quot;lascivious&quot; soul background. Lyrically, it displays Big Boi confronting lackluster contemporary rappers and criticizing the hip hop scene&#x27;s perceived descent. According to Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Unhappy&quot; musically conveys Big Boi effectively asserting himself as simultaneously traditional and perverse. The big band, horn-driven funk track &quot;Bowtie&quot; was described as reminiscent of George Clinton and Cotton Club. It lyrically details stylishly dressing for a night out, and features Sleepy Brown and Jazze Pha. Brown is also featured on &quot;The Way You Move&quot;, a Latin-influenced R&amp;B song pairing a &quot;Dirty South synth-drum bounce with a faux Phil Collins hook&quot;.

Mariachi-tinged hip hop track &quot;The Rooster&quot; discusses Big Boi&#x27;s struggles as a single parent, against an instrumentation based on &quot;slippery&quot; horns and loose wah-wah guitars. Killer Mike-assisted collaboration &quot;Bust&quot; blends hip hop with nu metal, and lyrically expresses a desire for superirority. On the psychedelic soul track &quot;War&quot;, Big Boi refers to the 2000 United States presidential election, War in Afghanistan, murder of Daniel Pearl, Iraq War, Black Panther Party, and Post-9/11. &quot;Church&quot; is a lyrical critique of organized religion. A techno-gospel song, it has received comparisons to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1970s recordings. The interlude &quot;Bamboo&quot;—titled after Big Boi&#x27;s son, who makes a guest appearance, covering &quot;The Whole World&quot;—precedes &quot;Tomb of the Boom&quot;. Both tracks use an identical &quot;bouncy&quot; beat, while the latter dismisses rumors about Outkast&#x27;s disbandment, and features Konkrete, Big Gipp, and Ludacris. &quot;Knowing&quot; discusses a prostitute&#x27;s plight, while &quot;Flip Flop Rock&quot; is an ode to flip-flops. Featuring Killer Mike and Jay-Z, &quot;Flip Flop Rock&quot; is a hip hop track built on a &quot;springy&quot; guitar loop and a &quot;beatific&quot; piano, while incorporating scratches and propulsive kickdrums. &quot;Interlude&quot;, a spoken word evaluation of Outkast&#x27;s history, precedes the percussion-infused &quot;Reset&quot;, which features Khujo and CeeLo Green. Comedian Henry Welch performs the brief interlude &quot;D-Boi&quot;, while Slimm Calhoun, Lil Jon &amp; The East Side Boyz, and Mello appear on &quot;Last Call&quot;, a track accentuated with aggressive horns and an eccentric theremin. &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; closes with a 35-second reprise of &quot;Bowtie&quot;, on which Big Boi&#x27;s vocals are altered with helium.
In contrast with &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot;, André 3000&#x27;s &quot;The Love Below&quot; was identified as a funk, jazz, pop, psychedelic, and progressive soul record comparable to the music of Prince in critical commentaries. The disc&#x27;s abounding theme is love, specifically falling in love and self-love. Sarig suggested that the end of André 3000&#x27;s relationship with Erykah Badu influenced much of the lyrical content, which he saw as concerned with the search for true love. André 3000&#x27;s vocal performance on the string-driven intro was compared to Frank Sinatra by Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot;, while on the noise rock-lounge opener &quot;Love Hater&quot;, it was described as &quot;mock crooning&quot; by Stephen Thomas Erlewine. The interlude &quot;God&quot; finds André 3000 embracing his &quot;horndog&quot; reputation in a prayer, accompanied by an acoustic guitar. &quot;Happy Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; introduces his alter ego Cupid Valentino, a reimagination of Cupid as a &quot;gun-toting thug&quot;. Anal sex-themed &quot;Spread&quot; displays trumpets and piano interspersed with a pliant bassline and scattering rimshots. Prelude &quot;Where Are My Panties?&quot;, featuring Toni Hunter, insinuates a one-night stand leading to a romantic relationship. The lyrical theme continues on &quot;Prototype&quot;, a funk-neo soul ballad sung similarly to Prince, Clinton, and Sly Stone. Alternative R&amp;B track &quot;She Lives in My Lap&quot;, featuring spoken-word vocals from actress Rosario Dawson, received further comparisons to Prince, as Erlewine compared the song to Prince and the Revolution&#x27;s 1985 B-side &quot;She&#x27;s Always in My Hair&quot;.

Acoustic guitar and synth-bass-driven &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; fuses power pop, traditional soul and electro-funk styles. Lyrically an &quot;ass-shaking jam session&quot;, it introduces André 3000&#x27;s second alter ego Ice Cold, who instructs the listeners to &quot;shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;. André 3000 described the song as being &quot;pretty much about the state of relationships in the 2000s. It&#x27;s about some people who stay together in relationships because of tradition, because somebody told them, &#x27;You guys are supposed to stay together.&#x27; But you pretty much end up being unhappy for the rest of your life.&quot; &quot;Roses&quot;, the sole song on &quot;The Love Below&quot; on which Big Boi appears, is a diss track directed towards a conceited ex-girlfriend referred to as &quot;Caroline&quot;. &quot;Pink &amp; Blue&quot; contains samples of Aaliyah&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot; and reverses its lyrical theme, being directed towards an older love interest rather than a younger one. A &quot;Goth-soul cha-cha&quot; track, &quot;Pink &amp; Blue&quot; ends with a brief orchestrated outro. While &quot;Love in War&quot; is André 3000&#x27;s lyrical response to Big Boi&#x27;s &quot;War&quot;, the frivolous, falsetto-sung minimalist electro track &quot;She&#x27;s Alive&quot; discusses single motherhood. &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Wedding&quot; follows André 3000 as a vampire infatuated with another vampire, portrayed by Kelis, but fearing commitment. &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; is a drum and bass rendition of the 1959 song of the same title from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Norah Jones is featured on &quot;Take Off Your Cool&quot;, a string-driven acoustic jazz-soul track. On &quot;Vibrate&quot;, André 3000 uses pro-environmental metaphors for masturbation. The dub-jazz track is built on muted trumpets and backward drumbeats. &quot;The Love Below&quot; closes with &quot;A Life in the Day of Benjamin André (Incomplete)&quot;, described as an &quot;autobiographical epistolary&quot;.

===Imagery===

For the album cover and accompanying imagery for &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;, Big Boi and André 3000 were photographed separately, due to rising creative differences between the two, following prior disagreements over their imagery. Big Boi was photographed by longtime collaborator Jonathan Mannion, while Torkil Gudnason photographed André 3000. After listening to the entirety of &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot;, Mannion devised ideas for imagery based on the record&#x27;s lyrical themes. Meanwhile, Gudnason had a more fashion-oriented approach towards his photo shoot. 

The selected cover for &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; saw Big Boi dressed in a fur coat and baggy jeans, depicting the fictional procurer named Rooster, who frequently appears on the album. He is shown sitting on a feather duster-decorated rattan chair, inspired by a photograph of Huey P. Newton published in &quot;The Black Panther&quot; dated November 23, 1967. On the cover of &quot;The Love Below&quot;, André 3000 is shown posing with a gun and portraying Cupid Valentino, one of his alter egos present on the album. Brandon Soderberg of &quot;Spin&quot; retrospectively credited André 3000&#x27;s flamboyant appearance on the artwork for inspiring rappers such as Kanye West, Lil B, and Cam&#x27;ron to embrace more feminine clothing styles, in contrast with rap&#x27;s &quot;normative masculinity&quot;.

On CD pressings of &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;, Big Boi&#x27;s image was used as the front cover, while André 3000&#x27;s cover was placed in the back. However, for digital editions and vinyl pressings, the images were juxtaposed into a single cover, with &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; on the left and &quot;The Love Below&quot; on the right. Furthermore, the liner notes were divided into two segments, one for each record, with separate imagery.

===Release and promotion===
Originally titled &quot;Outkast Present... Big Boi and Dre&quot;—in reference to Outkast&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Big Boi and Dre Present... Outkast&quot; (2001)—&quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; was scheduled for late May 2003, before being postponed to August 19. It was ultimately released on September 23, 2003, by Arista Records. As it was marketed as a double album comprising Big Boi and André 3000&#x27;s solo discs, Outkast also promoted the album individually, arriving separately to 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28 and staging separate performances and interviews. The strategy elicited intense media speculation over their disbandment, which the members consistently denied. In subsequent months, Outkast appeared on covers of &quot;The Source&quot;, &quot;The Fader&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot;. On October 31, 2003, they performed together on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, before performing on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the following day, at the 2003 American Music Awards on November 16, and at the VH1 Big in &#x27;03 Awards on November 20.

André 3000&#x27;s solo performance of &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004 ignited controversy, as its imagery was described as &quot;racist&quot; and disrespectful towards Native American culture. He subsequently performed the song at the 2004 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards on April 3. Outkast performed together at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards Japan on May 23; Big Boi held solo concerts at the Shinkiba Studio Coast in Tokyo the following day, and at the launch of Calvin Klein&#x27;s fragrance Eternity Moment in New York City on June 3. The duo performed &quot;Roses&quot; at the BET Awards 2004 on June 29, and a medley of &quot;The Way You Move&quot;, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; and &quot;Prototype&quot; at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards on August 29. André 3000 then performed at Fashion Rocks on September 8, while Big Boi performed &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; with Patti LaBelle at the 2004 World Music Awards on September 15. In September 2023, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; was reissued on two limited-edition vinyl pressings, in commemoration of its 20th anniversary.

==Singles==
In March 2003, MTV News reported &quot;Church&quot; and &quot;Prototype&quot; would be simultaneously released as the lead single from &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;, and would be accompanied by a Bryan Barber-directed 30-minute short film comprising both songs&#x27; music videos; however, those plans never came to fruition. Instead, &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; was released as the lead single on July 15, 2003, as a double A-side single with &quot;She Lives in My Lap&quot;. However, the promotion of the single was soon halted as Outkast focused on subsequent singles &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; and &quot;The Way You Move&quot;, hence &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; peaked only at number 93 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. In select countries, the song was released as the album&#x27;s double A-side fourth and final single alongside &quot;Prototype&quot; in November 2004. Upon its re-release, an accompanying music video for &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; was filmed; directed by Barber, it satirically depicts Big Boi as a &quot;Delivery Boi&quot; for FedUp, and features appearances from Patti LaBelle and Lil Jon.

&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; and &quot;The Way You Move&quot; were released as the second and third singles on August 25, 2003. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; was the first to reach the summit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it spent nine consecutive weeks, eight of which &quot;The Way You Move&quot; spent at number two, before reaching the top for one week. Thus, Outkast became the first duo in the chart&#x27;s history to replace itself at the summit. Internationally, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; reached the top 10 in numerous countries, as well as number one in Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Norway, and Sweden, while &quot;The Way You Move&quot; peaked within the top 10 in Australia, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, New Zealand, and the UK. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; won Best Urban/Alternative Performance, and was nominated for Record of the Year. Barber directed both songs&#x27; accompanying music videos, which were produced to appear in sequence as a long-form video. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; shows André 3000 portraying all eight members of the fictional band The Love Below performing to a rapturous crowd in London, to recreate The Beatles&#x27; first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, while &quot;The Way You Move&quot; depicts Big Boi and Sleepy Brown in a garage specializing in Speakerboxxx audio systems, before the setting is transformed into a lavish party. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; won four awards, including Video of the Year; it had also been nominated for Best Short Form Music Video at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards.

&quot;Roses&quot; was released as the fourth single from &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; on March 1, 2004. It became their third consecutive top-10 single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number nine. The song fared similarly internationally, reaching the top 10 in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Its accompanying music video, Outkast&#x27;s sixth consecutive to be directed by Barber, is a contemporary adaptation of the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and depicts the rivalry between two high school crews—The Love Below, led by André 3000, and Speakerboxxx, led by Big Boi—as they battle for fictional Caroline&#x27;s attention. The video was nominated for The Michael Jackson Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. &quot;Prototype&quot; was released as the fifth and final single from &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; on September 27, 2004, and was released as a double A-side single with &quot;GhettoMusick&quot; internationally. Like &quot;GhettoMusick&quot;, &quot;Prototype&quot; failed to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 63 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The music video for &quot;Prototype&quot; marked André 3000&#x27;s directorial debut, and depicts him as an extraterrestrial family member, who falls in love with a woman after descending to Earth.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 91, based on 26 reviews. Reviewing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called both discs &quot;visionary, imaginative listens, providing some of the best music of 2003, regardless of genre&quot;. He credited &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; with &quot;reclaiming the adventurous spirit of the golden age and pushing it into a new era&quot;, while referring to &quot;The Love Below&quot; &quot;the great lost Prince album.&quot; Will Hermes wrote in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that the album&#x27;s &quot;ambition flies so far beyond that of anyone doing rap right now (or pop, or rock, or R&amp;B)&quot;. Kris Ex wrote for &quot;Blender&quot; that the double album &quot;holds an explosion of creativity that couldn&#x27;t have been contained in just one LP&quot;, while writing for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not just that the collection stands so far above much of today&#x27;s contemporary hip-hop and R&amp;B; but that it surpasses the high level of genre-defying craftsmanship that the duo has cultivated for nearly a decade.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Dorian Lynskey described both discs as &quot;sublime ... hip-hop&#x27;s &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; or &quot;The White Album&quot;: a career-defining masterpiece of breathtaking ambition&quot;. According to Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; set &quot;a new benchmark not just for hip hop, but for pop in general&quot;, featuring &quot;so many musical tributaries coursing into both Big Boi&#x27;s progressive-rap pyrotechnics and Dre&#x27;s freaky jazz-funk love odyssey that even their old tag of &#x27;psychedelic hip-hop soul&#x27; starts to look restrictive&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Nick Southall called the album &quot;a series of spectacular moments and memorable events&quot;. John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; described its two discs as &quot;two Technicolor explosions of creativity that people will be exploring, analysing and partying to for years&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote that it is &quot;greater than the sum of its parts, and this kind of expertly crafted pop and deftly executed funk rarely happen at the same time—not since &quot;Stankonia&quot;, at least.&quot;

In his review of &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jon Caramanica was less enthusiastic, particularly about André 3000 expressing his &quot;right to be peculiar in a hip-hop context&quot;. Matt Dentler from &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; stated that Outkast performed stronger as a duo than individually, explaining: &quot;It&#x27;s like Lennon and McCartney solo albums: plenty of solid tunes, but the pen held together is mightier than a solo sword.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Brent DiCrescenzo wrote that &quot;The Love Below&quot; does not sustain &quot;consistent brilliance and emotional complexity throughout&quot; like &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot;. Ethan Brown from &quot;New York&quot; shared those sentiments, elaborating: &quot;Big Boi&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; is bolder—he wants to go where most hip-hoppers fear to tread and take the MTV audience along with him. It strikes at the essence of what has made OutKast so important to pop: the accessible, democratic nature of its strangeness.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said the record could have been &quot;the classic P-Funk rip it ain&#x27;t quite&quot; had &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; alone been issued with &quot;Roses&quot;, &quot;Spread&quot;, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, and &quot;an oddity of [André 3000&#x27;s] choosing&quot;. He nonetheless commended what he described as &quot;commercial ebullience, creative confidence, and wretched excess, blessed excess, impressive excess&quot;. On the contrary, Matt Harvey of BBC praised both counterparts, describing &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; as &quot;hilarious and thought provoking, goes on for hours (without ever getting boring) and is the most ambitious piece of pop [of 2003]&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Roni Sarig wrote that &quot;for sheer breadth, ambition, and musical vision, there&#x27;s little doubt &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; is a classic.&quot;

==Accolades==
===Listings===
===Awards and nominations===
Critically acclaimed, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; was nominated for a myriad of industry awards. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004, it won Album of the Year, the most prestigious Grammy Award, and Best Rap Album. Outkast thus became only the second rap artists to win Album of the Year, after Lauryn Hill in 1999. Geoff Boucher from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared the album &quot;the first pure hip-hop project&quot; to win the award. While accepting the Best Rap Album award, André 3000 said: &quot;Thank you&quot;, showed a peace sign, and left the stage. Carena Liptak of The Recording Academy retrospectively called the acceptance speech &quot;perhaps the shortest&quot; in the history of Grammy Awards. &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; also won Best Album of the Year at the 2004 Soul Train Music Awards, and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the American Music Awards of 2004. Internationally, &quot;Speakerboxx/The Love Below&quot; won Album of the Year at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards Japan, while being nominated for the Brit Award for International Album in both 2004 and 2005, and for Best Album at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards.

==Commercial performance==
In the US, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated October 11, 2003, with first-week sales of 509,600 copies. Following three consecutive number-two debuts, the album became Outkast&#x27;s first number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and registered their second-highest first-week sales, after &quot;Stankonia&quot;. Furthermore, it became their second number-one album on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. In its second week, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; sold 235,000 additional copies, remaining atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, before descending to number two the following week. During its first month, the album sold over one million units. It returned to the summit in its sixth week, having spent the prior three weeks within the top four. During the Christmas week of 2003, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; sold 374,000 copies, rising back to the summit, where it stayed for three additional weeks throughout January–February 2004. In total, the album spent seven non-consecutive weeks at number one, and 56 weeks charting. On December 3, 2004, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; diamond, denoting shipments of five million double-disc units in the US. By March 2012, the album had sold 5,702,000 copies in the country. Shortly after the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the RIAA certification was updated to 13-times platinum on September 29, 2023, signifying 13 million album-equivalent units; &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; thus became the highest-certified rap album of all time.

In Canada, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; debuted at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart dated October 11, 2003, and was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) in its first week. It subsequently peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart on February 14, 2004. In the UK, the album was a sleeper hit, debuting at number 44 on the UK Albums Chart before peaking at number eight in its 16th week, as well as peaking atop the UK R&amp;B Albums Chart in its 15th week. It was certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in July 2023, denoting album-equivalent units of 900,000. Across Europe, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; reached the top five in Ireland and Norway, and number six on the European Top 100 Albums, while reaching the top 20 in Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. In June 2004, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified the album platinum, for sales of one million units in Europe. The album was also a commercial success across Oceania, peaking at numbers nine and three in Australia and New Zealand, respectively, and being certified double platinum in both countries. According to IFPI, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; was the 11th best-selling album worldwide of 2003. As of September 2023, it has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.

==Legacy==

Despite initial scepticism from both the industry analysts and Arista Records over the performance of &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; due to its double album conceptualization, the album achieved immense commercial and critical success. Jon O&#x27;Brien from The Recording Academy declared it one of the most influential double albums in hip hop, crediting the album for reviving the concept pioneered by 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (1996), The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Life After Death&quot; (1997), and Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; (1997). O&#x27;Brien further emphasized the influence of &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; on subsequent hip hop double albums, such as &quot;Street&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (2004) by Nas, UGK&#x27;s &quot;Underground Kingz&quot; (2007), Drake&#x27;s &quot;Scorpion&quot; (2018), and Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers&quot; (2022). Thematically, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; has been credited with propelling conscious hip hop into the mainstream throughout the mid-2000s, alongside recordings by Kanye West and Jadakiss. Chris DeVille wrote for &quot;Stereogum&quot; that &quot;The Love Below&quot; was sonically &quot;an attempt at the kind of funkadelic genre mash Janelle Monáe successfully pulled off with &quot;The Electric Lady&quot; 10 years later.&quot; Gabriel Szatan of &quot;Dazed&quot; praised &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; for expanding the horizons of artistic expression within hip hop, elaborating: &quot;For a relatively young and exceedingly creative genre, big league hip hop was also pretty conservative in its accepted conventions in the 90s and early 00s. OutKast permanently stretched those boundaries, showing eccentricity should be cherished. Nowhere was that done more gleefully than on their flawed, frantic yet furiously fun final masterpiece.&quot; Erika Marie from &quot;HotNewHipHop&quot; commended Outkast&#x27;s choice of collaborators, which ensured the album to be &quot;a cohesive masterpiece rather than a disjointed collection&quot;, adding that the collaborators were vital in creating an &quot;epitome of excellence&quot; in hip hop&#x27;s history.

Upon its release, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; was frequently compared to The Beatles&#x27; 1968 eponymous double album in critical commentaries, with Outkast labeled the contemporary Lennon–McCartney. In an analysis of the comparisons for &quot;Consequence&quot;, Zach Schonfeld wrote that &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; captured the duo&#x27;s &quot;creative divorcing&quot;, drawing a parallel with the conflicts surrounding &quot;The Beatles&quot;, which arose from the members&#x27; pre-disbandment creative differences. Although both he and Big Boi were insistent on denying the intensified rumors of Outkast&#x27;s disbandment, André 3000 began increasingly expressing his desire to pursue a solo career throughout the promotional cycle for &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;. In an interview for &quot;Blender&quot;, he stated: &quot;In a perfect world, this would be the last OutKast record.&quot; DeVille called &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; the first indication of Big Boi&#x27;s ability to record without André 3000, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s fair to wonder if Big Boi could have ever crossed over to pop and indie audiences without Andr[é] to kick in the door for him. But in terms of producing classic music, it seems like Andr[é] needed Big Boi a lot more than Big Boi needed Andr[é].&quot; However, Outkast recorded another studio album together—&quot;Idlewild&quot; (2006), which also served as the soundtrack album for their musical film of the same title—before embarking on an extended hiatus in 2007. &quot;Idlewild&quot; was originally conceived as a visual counterpart to &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;, composed of music videos for the album&#x27;s tracks. However, it was reconstructed and postponed numerous times before its August 2006 release. Regardless, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; tracks &quot;Bowtie&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Take Off Your Cool&quot;, &quot;Church&quot;, &quot;She Lives in My Lap&quot;, and &quot;Vibrate&quot; were still used in &quot;Idlewild&quot; as musical numbers. Preezy Brown of Revolt described the &quot;Idlewild&quot; project as &quot;devoid of the air of excitement and fanfare that surrounded &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;&quot;, calling the latter &quot;the duo&#x27;s last true shining moment under the Outkast banner.

<text>Richard Charles Kyanka ( – November 9, 2021), known by his username Lowtax (a reference to Byron (Low Tax) Looper), was an American internet personality who created the website &quot;Something Awful&quot;.

==Other endeavors==
In 2001, Kyanka was entered into the &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (EW) Entertainer of the Year online poll, and went on to receive &quot;thousands of votes&quot;, but was disqualified because &quot;EW&quot; judged they were the result of an email campaign.

In 2006, Kyanka accepted Uwe Boll&#x27;s challenge to a boxing match, which Boll had issued to all his online critics. The match took place on September 23 in Vancouver; Boll knocked Kyanka out in less than two minutes.

On October 9, 2020, following a backlash from the community in response to allegations that Kyanka was a domestic abuser, Kyanka sold Something Awful to a fifteen-year member and moderator known under the pseudonym of Jeffrey of YOSPOS. Kyanka was subsequently banned from the site.

==Death==
Kyanka died by suicide on November 9, 2021.

<text>Eleanor Jessie Coppola ( Neil; May 4, 1936 – April 12, 2024) was an American documentary film director, screenwriter, and artist. She was married to director Francis Ford Coppola from 1963 until her death. She was best-known for her 1991 documentary film &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; as well as other documentaries chronicling the films of her husband and children.

==Early life==
Eleanor Coppola was born Eleanor Jessie Neil on May 4, 1936, in Los Angeles, California. Her father was a political cartoonist for the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; who died when she was 10 years old. She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Delphine Neil (&quot;née&quot; Lougheed) in Sunset Beach, California. Her brother Bill became a noted visual effects artist. She graduated from UCLA with a degree in applied design and was a member of the women&#x27;s fraternity Alpha Chi Omega (Alpha Psi chapter).

While working on the set of the 1963 horror film &quot;Dementia 13&quot;, she met her future husband Francis Ford Coppola. Her position was assistant art director, and he was making his directorial debut with the film. They had been dating for several months when Eleanor discovered in 1963 that she was pregnant. Initially, Eleanor considered giving the baby up for adoption, but he convinced her otherwise. The couple married in Las Vegas on February 2, 1963, and gave birth to their first son Gian-Carlo Coppola. Years later, Eleanor gave birth to Roman and Sofia Coppola.

==Film career==

Eleanor was a constant presence on films directed by her famous family members. Her contributions to cinema consists of mainly documentaries in which she acted as director, cinematographer, videographer, and writer.

Many of her documentaries consist of behind-the-scenes looks at such films as &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, which were directed by her daughter Sofia Coppola. In her documentaries, she captured the struggles that endangered her family&#x27;s films even before they made it onto the big screen. Through her film work, Eleanor Coppola was able to illustrate not only what goes into a film financially, but also capture the emotional toll filmmaking has on the individuals on and off the camera.

===&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;===
For her early film career, she spent much of her time accompanying her husband on his film shoots. In 1976, she began documenting the making of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Her recordings of the hectic film process were later released in her memoir &quot;Notes on the Making of Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). The book chronicles such events as the near destruction of the film&#x27;s production as well as the stress that both cast and crew were suffering from at the time. This would not be the only documentation of the making of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; as she decided to film a documentary based on the same movie.

The documentary film &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; was co-directed by Eleanor Coppola, Fax Bahr, and George Hickenlooper. In the film, Eleanor narrated the trials and difficulties surrounding the production of the award-winning film as not only problems arose with the studio but also the cast and crew working at the time. Such events caught on camera include the nervous breakdown of the film&#x27;s lead Martin Sheen as well as the trouble facing Francis Ford Coppola when an expensive set was destroyed.

The documentary film was released in 1991, which went on to win several awards such as the Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement – Informational Programming – Directing&quot;. The film was also nominated for a Directors Guild of America (DGA) Documentary Award in 1991.

===Feature filmmaking===
Coppola made her feature film directorial debut with the 2016 romantic comedy &quot;Paris Can Wait&quot; starring Diane Lane as a wealthy film producer&#x27;s wife and Arnaud Viard as a charming Frenchman who drives her from Cannes to Paris. The film premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2020, Coppola released her second feature film, &quot;Love Is Love Is Love&quot;, a set of intertwined love stories about three couples.

==Writer==
Coppola wrote two successful books. Her first book, &quot;Notes on the Making of Apocalypse Now&quot;, recorded the film&#x27;s journey from 1976 to 1979. Her detailed note-taking continued in other areas of her life as she collected and wrote about her life&#x27;s major events. With notes covering a 30 year time span, she went on to write the book &quot;Notes on a Life&quot;.

===&quot;Notes on a Life&quot;===
The memoir &quot;Notes on a Life&quot; follows thirty years of Eleanor Coppola&#x27;s life as she juggles raising children and being there for Francis as he directs films that move the family from place to place. The book consists of short passages from each day beginning with the death of her oldest son Gian-Carlo Coppola at the age of 22 and the birth of her granddaughter Gia just months later. The death of Gian-Carlo Coppola serves as a constant refrain throughout the entire book.

The book is told through her own point of view and although she mentions certain events concerning those around her, such as the controversy surrounding Francis&#x27; decision to cast Sofia in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, her memoir chronicles the inner struggles and problems the family faced at the time.

==Death==
Coppola died in Rutherford, California, on April 12, 2024, at the age of 87. According to her husband Francis Ford Coppola, when asked about her death in an August 2024 interview, Eleanor was diagnosed with thymoma in 2010. While her doctor told her they could remove it by shrinking it with three months of chemotherapy, she declined the treatment. &quot;Eleanor said, ‘I’m not doing chemo.’ She wanted to do what she wanted to do; she made several movies, and ultimately, it just got so big and so painful that she did not want to live anymore.&quot;

==Filmography==

==Other work==
The organization Circle of Memory was founded by Eleanor Coppola and other artists to commemorate missing and lost loved ones. Her artwork has been featured in museums and galleries around the world. Eleanor Coppola founded the project in memory of her late son Gian-Carlo Coppola. Eleanor Coppola also designed costumes for the Oberlin Dance Company. She also managed the Rubicon Estate Winery which her family owns.

<text>In marketing, a coupon is a ticket or document that can be redeemed for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product.

Customarily, coupons are issued by manufacturers of consumer packaged goods or by retailers, to be used in retail stores as a part of sales promotions. They are often widely distributed through mail, coupon envelopes, magazines, newspapers, the Internet (social media, email newsletter), directly from the retailer, and mobile devices such as cell phones.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;more than 900 manufacturers&#x27; coupons were distributed&quot; per household, and that &quot;the United States Department of Agriculture estimates that four families in five use coupons. &quot;Only about 4 percent&quot; of coupons received were redeemed. Coupons can be targeted selectively to regional markets in which price competition is great.

Most coupons have an expiration date, although American military commissaries overseas honor manufacturers&#x27; coupons for up to six months past the expiration date.

==Pronunciation==
The word is of French origin, pronounced . In Britain, the United States, and Canada it is pronounced . A common alternate American pronunciation is .

==History==

===Origin===
During the great famine of 18 AH (638 CE), Umar, the second ruler of the Islamic Caliphate, introduced several reforms such as the introduction of food rationing using coupons, which were given to those in need and could be exchanged for wheat and flour.

Coca-Cola&#x27;s 1888-issued &quot;free glass of&quot; is the earliest documented coupon. Coupons were mailed to potential customers and placed in magazines. It is estimated that between 1894 and 1913 one in nine Americans had received a free Coca-Cola, for a total of 8,500,000 free drinks. By 1895, Coke was served in every state in the United States.

In 1929, Betty Crocker began a loyalty points program and began issuing coupons that could be used to redeem for premiums like free flatware. In 1937 the coupons were printed on the outside of packages. The loyalty program ended in 2006, one of the longest loyalty programs.

In Australia consumers first came in contact with couponing when a company called Shopa Docket promoted offers and discounts on the back of shopping receipts in 1986.

==Types and uses==
Coupons offer different types of values, such as discounts, free shipping, buy-one get-one, trade-in for redemption, first-time customer coupons, free trial offer, launch offers, festival offers, and free giveaways. Similarly, there are varied uses of coupons which include: to incentivize a purchase, reduce a price, provide a free sample, or to aid marketers in understanding the demographics of their customer.

===Function===
Coupons can be used to research the price sensitivity of different groups of buyers (by sending out coupons with different dollar values to different groups). Time, location and sizes (e.g. five pound vs. 20 pound bag) affect prices; coupons are part of the marketing mix. So is knowing about the customer.

===Grocery coupons===
Grocery coupons come in two major types:
* store coupons: issued by the store itself. Some stores will also accept store coupons issued by competitors.
* Coupons issued by the manufacturer of a product may be used at any coupon-accepting store that carries that product. Part of their function is to advertise their offerings and attract new customers.

Some grocery stores regularly double or even triple the value of coupons to bring customers into their stores. Periodic special events double or triple coupon values on certain days or weeks.

==Conveyance==
Coupons exist in more than one form, and are acquired by customers in a variety of ways.

===Paper===
Historically, verifying the discount offered has been via presenting coupons clipped from newspapers or received in the mail. Some retailers and companies use verification methods such as unique barcodes, coupon ID numbers, holographic seals, and watermarked paper as protection from unauthorized copying or use. Other than newspapers, there are also coupon book publishers and retailers who compile vouchers and coupons into books, either for sale or free.

===Electronic===
By the mid-1990s, &quot;couponing had also moved to the internet.&quot; An early term was . Later on the term &quot;downloadable coupons&quot; came into use. Options include:
* Internet coupons: Online retailers often refer to these as &quot;coupon codes&quot;, &quot;promotional codes&quot;, &quot;promotion codes&quot;, &quot;discount codes&quot;, &quot;keycodes&quot;, &quot;promo codes&quot;, &quot;surplus codes&quot;, &quot;portable codes&quot;, &quot;shopping codes&quot;, &quot;voucher codes&quot;, &quot;reward codes&quot;, &quot;discount vouchers&quot;, &quot;referral codes&quot; or &quot;source codes&quot;. These are typed in before the sale is finalized. Marketers can use different codes for different channels or groups in order to differentiate response rates. Free shipping and cashback are additional inducements. 

* Mobile: Smartphone based, these are often distributed via WAP Push over SMS or MMS, and presented at the store or online. These also have advertising benefits even after their expiration date.
* Apps: Related to classic coupons are loyalty cards; these have increasingly been superseded by mobile apps.

Iranian government national rations have a mobile app.

==Taxation==

Depending on the jurisdiction, coupons may or may not reduce any sales tax to be paid by the consumer. The most consumer-friendly tax situation taxes the actual price paid, including when the store does double and triple coupon reductions.

The above applies when the retailer is the source of the coupon, since the product is offered at the post-coupon price. In jurisdictions seeking to tax more, if the coupon is issued by the manufacturer, the original price is still paid but some of the price is covered by the manufacturer instead of the consumer and the full price remains taxable.

==Trading==
Coupon manufacturers may or may not place restrictions on coupons limiting their transferability to ensure the coupons stay within the targeted market. Since such restrictions are not universal and are difficult and/or costly to enforce, limited coupon trading is tolerated in the industry. Organized coupon exchange clubs are commonly found in regions where coupons are distributed.
Often coupons are available for purchase at some online sites, but since most coupons are not allowed to be sold, the fee is considered to be for the time and effort put into cutting out the coupons.

Some types of coupons may be sold. &quot;The New York Times&quot; not only said &quot;the traffic is legal&quot; regarding selling airline discount coupons, but wrote &quot;check the commercial notices column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; or the classified advertising section under &#x27;Miscellaneous&#x27;) in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

During war time or economic hardships, trading or selling ration coupons is an economic crime.

<doc id="504902" wikidata="Q5357592" url="?curid=504902" title="Electric field gradient">
<text>In atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics, the electric field gradient (EFG) measures the rate of change of the electric field at an atomic nucleus generated by the electronic charge distribution and the other nuclei. The EFG couples with the nuclear electric quadrupole moment of quadrupolar nuclei (those with spin quantum number greater than one-half) to generate an effect which can be measured using several spectroscopic methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), microwave spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, ESR), nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), Mössbauer spectroscopy or perturbed angular correlation (PAC). The EFG is non-zero only if the charges surrounding the nucleus violate cubic symmetry and therefore generate an inhomogeneous electric field at the position of the nucleus.

EFGs are highly sensitive to the electronic density in the immediate vicinity of a nucleus. This is because the EFG operator scales as &quot;r&quot;−3, where &quot;r&quot; is the distance from a nucleus. This sensitivity has been used to study effects on charge distribution resulting from substitution, weak interactions, and charge transfer. Especially in crystals, the local structure can be investigated with above methods using the EFG&#x27;s sensitivity to local changes, like defects or phase changes. In crystals the EFG is in the order of 1021V/m2. Density functional theory has become an important tool for methods of nuclear spectroscopy to calculate EFGs and provide a deeper understanding of specific EFGs in crystals from measurements.

==Definition==

A given charge distribution of electrons and nuclei, &quot;ρ&quot;(r), generates an electrostatic potential &quot;V&quot;(r). The derivative of this potential is the negative of the electric field generated. The first derivatives of the field, or the second derivatives of the potential, is the electric field gradient. The nine components of the EFG are thus defined as the second partial derivatives of the electrostatic potential, evaluated at the position of a nucleus:

:formula_1

For each nucleus, the components &quot;Vij&quot; are combined as a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix. Under the assumption that the charge distribution generating the electrostatic potential is external to the nucleus, the matrix is traceless, for in that situation Laplace&#x27;s equation, ∇2&quot;V&quot;(r) = 0, holds. Relaxing this assumption, a more general form of the EFG tensor which retains the symmetry and traceless character is

:formula_2

where ∇2&quot;V&quot;(r) is evaluated at a given nucleus.

As &quot;V&quot; (and &quot;φ&quot;) is symmetric, it can be diagonalized. Different conventions exist for assigning the EFG tensor&#x27;s principal components from the eigenvalues. In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the Haeberlen convention is formula_3, in order to maintain consistency with the convention for the nuclear shielding tensor. In other fields, however, they are assigned formula_4, more usually denoted as formula_5, in order of decreasing modulus. Given the traceless character, formula_6, only two of the principal components are independent. Typically these are described by formula_7 or &quot;Vzz&quot; and the biaxially parameter or asymmetry parameter, &quot;η&quot;, defined as

:formula_8
where formula_9.

Electric field gradient, as well as the biaxially parameter, can be evaluated numerically for large electric systems as shown in.

<text>Jennifer Bond (born 19 August 1950) is an English journalist and television presenter. Bond worked for fourteen years as the BBC&#x27;s royal correspondent. She has also hosted &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot; and narrated the programme &quot;Great British Menu&quot;.

==Early career==
Born in Hitchin, Bond has two elder sisters, and from the age of five lived in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, where she was educated at St. Francis&#x27; College (a girls&#x27; independent school) and at the University of Warwick, from which she graduated with a degree in French and European Literature. Her career began in print, working for various local newspapers in London in journalism and sub-editing roles. Her first job in journalism was as a reporter for the &quot;Richmond Herald&quot; and then the &quot;Uxbridge Evening Mail&quot;.

In 1977, aged 27, Bond moved to BBC radio, producing and editing. She was also a producer on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, &quot;Tuesday Call&quot;, &quot;International Assignment&quot; and for various television documentaries.

==Royal correspondent==
In 1985, Bond became a radio news reporter and in 1988 she began to report for television, both for the BBC. She became a royal correspondent, which was to bring her to public attention, in 1989. During the 1990s she combined her reporting with several presentational roles – regularly fronting &quot;Breakfast News&quot;, the &quot;BBC One O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, including presenting the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on the day of the death of her close friend and fellow newsreader Jill Dando.

Bond held the position as royal correspondent until the summer of 2003. During that time she reported on many dramatic and notable events connected with the royal family, including the 1992 Windsor Castle fire; two royal weddings; the break-up of the Duke of York&#x27;s marriage to Sarah Ferguson; the divorce of the Prince and Princess of Wales; the deaths of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, and has reported on the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s celebrations of her Golden Jubilee. She also travelled extensively with the Royal Family. In January 1994, she was in Australia when an attempt was made to shoot the Prince of Wales.

Bond&#x27;s reporting style suggested that she was close personally to members of the Royal Family. She commented that she had become close to Diana, Princess of Wales, and that her death came as a great shock. Bond actually instigated her first extended meeting with Diana in June 1995. Bond sent the princess a note, suggesting that if she was to report on Diana properly then she should at least know what her character was actually like, not basing her thoughts on stories that had appeared in newspapers. She commented on that meeting at Kensington Palace, stating: &quot;Princess Diana was charming, articulate, fresh, interesting, but manipulative. She knew I was a journalist. This was no girlie-girlie meeting.&quot; In November 2020, Bond wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that the princess told her virtually all of the details she later said to Martin Bashir in the interview she gave for &quot;Panorama&quot; in November 1995.

She travelled with Diana, Princess of Wales on her trip to Angola, with the Queen on her first official visits to Russia in 1994 and when she met Nelson Mandela in South Africa a year later. However, her hardest and most challenging assignments were when she had to report on the death and funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.

==Life after the BBC==
Following her departure from the BBC in 2003, Bond&#x27;s career took a different turn. In 2003, she made an appearance in an episode of the comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot;. In February 2004, she proved popular with the public when she finished as runner-up in the third series of the reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; This episode, broadcast on 9 February, received viewing figures of 14.99 million, making it the most watched programme on ITV and BBC One that week.

Bond appeared on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot; to raise money for the Devon Air Ambulance and raised £260,989.85 which the charity used to buy a state-of-the-art navigation system and to extend its helicopter flying time throughout the summer. During her time on the reality television show, she was required to do various &#x27;bushtucker&#x27; trials, which involved her eating various creatures such as a stick insect and a witchety grub, as well as being placed in a dark, water-filled coffin with rats for ten minutes. She also fell out with fellow contestant Lord Brocket during the programme.

She subsequently presented American TV cable and satellite network E!&#x27;s coverage of the BAFTA film awards, &quot;Live from the Red Carpet&quot;. She also presented her own three-part documentary called &quot;Jennie Bond&#x27;s Royals&quot; on Channel 5 and in 2005, she presented the BBC&#x27;s daytime coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show, alongside Charlie Dimmock. In the same year, Bond appeared in &quot;Have I Been Here Before?&quot; More recently she appeared in &quot;Posh Swap&quot; on Five, where she was transformed into a Brummie woman. She had to convince two of her best friends she really was the Brummie.

Bond was also the host for the first series of &quot;Great British Menu&quot;, in which different chefs have to compete by cooking meals; the winner of the first series had the chance to cook for the Queen on her 80th birthday. Bond has presented the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot;. In 2006, she was a celebrity guest on &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; where she sang as Debbie Harry. She presented the second series of &quot;Great British Menu&quot; during April and May 2007.

On 28 July 2007, Bond appeared in a special celebrity version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; with Michael Buerk to raise money for National Children&#x27;s Home, the children&#x27;s charity now called Action for Children. In a combined effort, they raised £64,000. On 22 August 2007, she presented an episode of &quot;Driving Me Crazy&quot; which saw her investigating whether the authorities are giving motorists excessive penalties through speeding fines and parking tickets.

She has featured as the celebrity &#x27;hider&#x27; in a 2008 episode of the CBBC show &quot;Hider in the House&quot;. In the show, she managed to complete all her challenges without being &#x27;discovered&#x27;. She (also in 2008), hosted a show called &quot;Lost Royals&quot;. Bond took part in ITV&#x27;s entertainment show &quot;Born to Shine&quot; in aid of Save the Children.

She took part in a celebrity episode of &quot;The Chase&quot; in 2011, where she won £20,000 for the Devon Air Ambulance.

In September 2012, Bond appeared alongside Susie Dent on the Channel 4 programme &quot;Countdown&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1982 Bond married James W. Keltz. They have one daughter, born in 1990. The couple live in East Prawle, Devon.

<text>Baron Wakehurst, of Ardingly in the County of Sussex, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 29 June 1934 for the Conservative politician Gerald Loder, fifth son of Sir Robert Loder, 1st Baronet (see Loder Baronets for earlier history of the family). He had previously represented Brighton in the House of Commons and was the creator of Wakehurst Place Gardens in Ardingly, West Sussex. His only son, the second Baron, was also a Conservative politician and served as Governor of New South Wales and later as Governor of Northern Ireland. The third baron, who was known by his middle name Christopher, was a barrister and businessman. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s nephew Jan, the fifth Baron, who succeeded his cousin in that year.

<text>Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, commonly known as Barts or BL, is a medical and dental school in London, England. The school is part of Queen Mary University of London, a constituent college of the federal University of London, and the United Hospitals. It was formed in 1995 by the merger of the London Hospital Medical College (the first school to be granted an official charter for medical teaching in 1785) and the Medical College of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital (established in 1843, with medical teaching dating back to the founding of the hospital in 1123).

The school has multiple sites, having a presence at the site of both of the former colleges at and near their respective hospitals, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital (in Smithfield in the City of London and nearby in Charterhouse Square), and the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel with an additional site at Queen Mary&#x27;s main (Mile End) campus, and a satellite campus, commencing 2017, on the island of Gozo in Malta.

As of 2018, the school had 2,235 undergraduate and 1,175 postgraduate students, for a total of 3,410 students.

== History ==
=== London Hospital Medical College ===

The medical college at the London Hospital, now the Royal London Hospital, opened in 1785. It was England&#x27;s first purpose-built medical school, pioneering a new kind of medical education, with an emphasis on theoretical and clinical teaching. The teaching premises were expanded in 1854, when buildings in Turner Street were built and opened, which are still in use today. For many years it functioned as an unincorporated general medical school of the University of London, until it was incorporated as The London Hospital Medical College on 30 March 1949. A dental school also opened at the London Hospital in 1911, acquiring the new dental institute and expanding student numbers during the 1960s. Dental education developed during the 1970s, increasing collaboration between dentists and other professionals.

=== Medical College of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital ===
Records of students at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital date back to at least 1662, although a purpose-built lecture theatre at the hospital was not built until 1791, and it was not until that 1822 the governors formally approved the provision of medical education within the hospital. Later a residential college was established, which moved to premises at Charterhouse Square in the 1930s. The medical college was formally established in 1843, and was incorporated as the Medical College of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital on 26 July 1921.

=== Merger ===
Both colleges were admitted to the University of London in 1900, and a close association between the two was developed following the Royal Commission on Medical Education in 1968, with new links with the then Queen Mary College being established at the same time. In 1989 the pre-clinical teaching at the two colleges was merged and sited in the Basic Medical Sciences Building at Queen Mary (where it stayed until 2005, when it was moved to the Blizard Building at the Whitechapel campus). The two colleges officially merged in 1995, along with Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, now known as Queen Mary University of London, forming the combined entity known as Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

In 2016, the school reached an agreement with the government of Malta to open a satellite campus on the island of Gozo, with a purpose-built medical school and anatomy centre to be built on the Gozo General Hospital campus. The first students were admitted in 2017, and the buildings were due to be completed in 2019.

In recent years, Queen Mary University of London has attempted to remove aspects of the &#x27;Barts and The London&#x27; name and identity from the School of Medicine and Dentistry. In 2019, QMUL changed the logo of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, to much resistance from staff and students of the medical and dental school. A petition was sent to the principal of the university, Colin Bailey. This has become an ongoing issue, with Barts and The London Students&#x27; Association condemning the way the BL identity and community had been treated. Current students at Barts and The London, as well as alumni, are concerned that this line of change will lead to a complete eradication of the tradition and heritage of Barts and The London.

In 2022, students and alumni reacted with even more anger when University leadership attempted to drop the &#x27;Barts and The London&#x27; name entirely and rebrand the School to &#x27;Queen Mary University of London Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry&#x27;; QMUL responded by claiming that the change was necessary to ensure &#x27;no possible confusion&#x27; in its own brand identity.

== Campus ==


The school is split over a total of five campuses, with the main ones based around the location of the former medical colleges and their respective hospitals. Most medical teaching takes place at the Whitechapel campus, adjacent to The Royal London Hospital. The Blizard Building, a purpose-built building housing research facilities and a lecture theatre, was completed at the Whitechapel site in 2005, and is where most lectures take place. Most dental teaching takes place at the Royal London Dental Hospital, which opened in 2014, adjacent to the main hospital site.

Teaching, in particular clinical skills teaching, also takes place at the West Smithfield campus, adjacent to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, and the nearby Charterhouse Square campus. The Charterhouse Square campus is also the home of the William Harvey Research Institute, focusing on pharmacology, and houses student residences.

Some additional teaching, including anatomy and dissection, takes place at the main QMUL campus in Mile End.

=== Hospitals ===
Medical students undertake clinical placements in the following hospitals, the majority of which are located in the City of London and East London, with a few in neighbouring Essex:

==== London ====
* Goodmayes Hospital
* Homerton University Hospital
* King George Hospital
* Mile End Hospital
* Newham University Hospital
* Queen&#x27;s Hospital
* Royal London Hospital
* St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital
* Whipps Cross University Hospital
* Moorfields Eye Hospital

==== Essex ====
* Broomfield Hospital
* Colchester Hospital
* Princess Alexandra Hospital
* Southend University Hospital

== Academic profile ==
=== Teaching ===
A unique aspect of the Barts curriculum is the use of problem-based learning, which was first developed at McMaster University Medical School in the 1960s. Barts uses this method as part of an integrated curriculum as opposed to one that is solely or predominately based on problem based learning. Students work in groups with a tutor on a clinical case or problem, and use problem based learning to supplement the knowledge they acquire during their lectures.

The standard undergraduate Medicine course is a five-year course, which results in the award of an MBBS degree. Students also have the option of extending their studies by a further year in order to study for an intercalated BSc in a range of related subjects. This is usually done after the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year.

Students who already have a science or health-related degree and who wish to study Medicine can also choose to apply to the Graduate Entry Programme (GEP). This is a four-year course, with the first two years of the standard undergraduate course being condensed into one. The remaining years of the course are identical to the undergraduate course.

Several of the constituent institutes also offer undergraduate and postgraduate programmes such as Neuroscience by the Blizard Institute and Pharmacology by the William Harvey Research Institute. These programmes will result in the award of a BSc, MSc, or MRes, with undergraduate study options including optional years abroad or in industry.

=== Rankings ===
The medical school has scored highly in a number of independent rankings in recent years, placing it in the top 10 of medical schools in the United Kingdom:
* ranked 2nd by &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2017)
* ranked 3rd by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (2017)
* ranked 7th by &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot; (2017)
* ranked 9th (51st–100th in the world) by the QS World University Rankings (2016–17)
* ranked 10th (65th in the world) by the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (2016–17)
* ranked 7th (28th in the world) by CWTS Leiden Ranking (2016) based on the percentage of publications belonging to the top 10% of their field (PP top 10%)

The dental school has also been ranked highly:
* ranked 3rd by &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot; (2017)
* ranked 3rd by &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2017)
* ranked 4th by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (2017)
The William Harvey Research Institute is also widely considered to be the foremost centre for pharmacological research in Europe, and among the top in the world.

=== Admission ===
Admission to both the medical and dental schools is highly competitive. Over 2,500 applications to study medicine are received by the school each year. Of these, 800 candidates are interviewed and approximately 440 offers are made. For dentistry, over 700 applications are received, of which 250 candidates are interviewed and approximately 150 offers are made.

The school accepts A-levels, the International Baccalaureate Diploma, Irish Leaving Certificate, Scottish Highers, Cambridge Pre-U and the European Baccalaureate as entry qualifications. Both the medical and dental degrees are open to graduate students, with a minimum of a 2:1 required. Applicants must sit the UK Clinical Aptitude Test which is used alongside the UCAS application to determine selection for interview. The school also accepts medical students only from the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, and St Andrews aiming to complete a three-year direct clinical entry programme. Students applying to this scheme do not need to apply by 15 October deadline and are not required to take the UKCAT.

== Research ==
The school serves a diverse population in East London and the wider Thames Gateway, with the differing demographics of East London in contrast to other areas of the country providing the school with a unique teaching opportunity. Consequently, many of the school&#x27;s research efforts are focused on conditions that are prevalent or endemic to the local area, for example, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, tuberculosis and other chronic lung diseases, HIV, oral disease, and cancer.

The school has six research institutes:
* Barts Cancer Institute researches cancer and inflammation, experimental cancer medicine, haemato-oncology, cancer stem cells and ageing, cancer genomics, molecular oncology and imaging and tumour biology. The director is Nick Lemoine.
* Blizard Institute, which focuses on surgery, paediatrics, cutaneous, diabetes, gastroenterology, haematology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, pathology and health sciences.
* Institute of Dentistry does research and teaching in adult oral health, oral growth and development, and clinical and diagnostic oral sciences.
* Institute of Health Sciences Education is responsible for the teaching of pre-clinical medical sciences to medical students along with research in medical education and community based medical education.
* William Harvey Research Institute is a research facility focusing on biochemical pharmacology, orthopaedic diseases, endocrinology, genomics, clinical pharmacology and translational medicine and therapeutics. It was founded by Sir John Vane, with Professor Sir Mark Caulfield currently serving as its director.
* Wolfson Institute of Population Health researches public health and policy, preventive medicine, epidemiology, mathematics and statistics, psychology and psychiatry.
== Students&#x27; Association ==
Barts and The London Students&#x27; Association (BLSA) is the students&#x27; union for the medical and dental school, a largely independent arm of Queen Mary Students&#x27; Union (QMSU) formed when the student unions of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical School and the London Hospital Clubs Union merged with QMSU at the time their parent bodies merged in 1995. 

The BLSA Building, where the students&#x27; association is based, is set to be demolished at the end of 2024. This building is the original site of the London Hospital Clubs&#x27; Union, and the BLSA will move into the Garrod Building, the original site of teaching at the London Hospital Medical College. The BLSA is led by a sabbatical student president, with a board of part-time student officers who operationally run the association, and provide activities for students at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. 

The Students&#x27; Association has a distinct structure and culture from that of QMSU, with its own clubs and societies for most sports and activities, competing in the National Association of Medics&#x27; Sports and United Hospitals Competitions against other schools and universities.

The BLSA also exists at the Malta Campus of the Medical School, based in Gozo, to provide students&#x27; union services to the students studying there.

<doc id="504929" wikidata="Q4550097" url="?curid=504929" title="14th Street bridges">
<text>The 14th Street bridges refers to the three bridges near each other that cross the Potomac River, connecting Arlington, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Sometimes the two nearby rail bridges are included as part of the 14th Street bridge complex. A major gateway for automotive, bicycle and rail traffic, the bridge complex is named for 14th Street (U.S. Route 1), which feeds automotive traffic into it on the D.C. end.

The complex contains three four-lane automobile bridges — including, from west to east, one southbound, one bi-directional, and one northbound — that carry Interstate 395 (I-395) and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) traffic, as well as a bicycle and pedestrian lane on the southbound bridge. In addition, the complex contains two rail bridges, one of which carries the Yellow Line of the Washington Metro; the other of which, the only mainline rail crossing of the Potomac River to Virginia, carries a CSX Transportation rail line. The five bridges, from west to east are the George Mason Memorial Bridge, the Rochambeau Bridge, the Arland D. Williams, Jr. Memorial Bridge, the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge and the Long Bridge. In aerial photos, shadows caused by a large, concrete divider on the bi-directional Rochambeau Bridge create the illusion of two, two-lane bridges, but this is in fact, a single, four-lane structure.

At the north end of the bridges, in East Potomac Park, the three roadways connect to a pair of two-way bridges over the Washington Channel into downtown Washington, one six-lane connecting to traffic (including northbound US 1) north onto 14th Street, and the other, an eight-lane bridge connecting to I-395 traffic on the Southwest Freeway. The Metro line connects to a tunnel in the East Potomac Park, and the main line railroad from the Long Bridge passes over I-395 and runs over the Washington Channel just downstream of the 14th Street approach before turning northeast along the line of Maryland Avenue.

On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 clipped the 14th Street Bridge, the northbound I-395 span of the complex, during rush hour and crashed into the Potomac River; this killed four people on the bridge, along with 74 passengers and crew on the aircraft. The repaired span was renamed in honor of Arland D. Williams Jr., a passenger on the plane who survived the initial crash, but drowned after repeatedly passing a helicopter rescue line to other survivors.

==Bridges==
Each of the complex&#x27;s five bridge spans has its own name. From east to west, the bridges are:
* The 1904 (rebuilt ) Long Bridge carries CSX, Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express rail traffic over the river. The name was &quot;derived from its planned size and not as a memorial to any particular individual.&quot;
* The 1983 Charles R. Fenwick Bridge—named for the Virginia state senator who helped create the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority—carries the Yellow Line of the Washington Metro across the river.
* The northbound span was originally named the 14th Street Bridge when it opened in 1950, renamed the Rochambeau Bridge eight years later, and renamed the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge in 1985 for a passenger of Air Florida Flight 90, who died in 1982 saving others from the freezing water.
* In 1985, the Rochambeau Bridge name was moved to the previously unnamed center bridge, which opened in 1971 and carries traffic in both directions.
* The southbound span, opened in 1962, is named the George Mason Memorial Bridge. A side path is on the upstream side of the bridge for pedestrians and cyclists.


==History==

===Long Bridge===


The name &quot;Long Bridge&quot; was given to a series of bridges across the Potomac dating back to 1809. At times, some of the bridges were referred to as the Bridge at 14th Street, but more often by other names.

The first bridge opened as the Washington Bridge on May 20, 1809 and originally carried vehicle, pedestrian and horse traffic. By the 1830s it began to be called the &quot;long Bridge across the Potomac&quot; to distinguish it from the bridge near Little Falls, but over time, the colloquial name was shortened to just the &quot;Long Bridge&quot;. Rails had been built to the bridge from the Washington side in 1855 and from the Virginia side in 1857, but there weren&#x27;t placed on the bridge until the Civil War.

In 1864, a new bridge was built adjacent to the original bridge. When the U.S. Military railroad Charles Minot fell through one of the spans of the old bridge on February 18, 1865, the rails were moved to the new bridge and the old bridge became used for non-rail traffic only, as had been recommended in the prior year.
 To some the old bridge became the &quot;turnpike bridge&quot; and the new one the &quot;railroad bridge.&quot; For others the two bridges were referred to separately as the Long Bridge and the railroad bridge or as two parts of one &quot;Long Bridge&quot;.

An October 1, 1870 flood damaged the bridges beyond repair so a replacement bridge was built over the next two years and the old Washington Bridge was removed.

The new bridge opened on May 15, 1872. The day the new bridge opened, the old railroad bridge, which had been partially repaired, was closed. On July 2, the Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railway opened, providing the first direct all-rail connection between the north and Richmond, Virginia.

Despite the new design, the 1872 bridge continued to be damaged by freshets, it blocked river traffic and was not wide enough for two tracks; so two new bridges were built. A new railroad bridge was constructed in 1904 and a new Highway Bridge opened in December 1906. The 1872 bridge was closed on December 18, 1906 and demolished in 1907.


The current railroad bridge opened on August 28, 1904, about 150 feet (45 m) upriver from the old bridge. In the early years, the bridge was often referred to as the &quot;Railroad Bridge&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;Highway Bridge&quot;. It was also sometimes known as the &quot;14th Street Railroad Bridge&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1980s, during planning of the Virginia Railway Express (VRE) system, that the railroad bridge again began to be called by the old &quot;Long Bridge&quot; name. VRE began using the bridge in 1992.

The bridge was substantially reconstructed starting in mid-1942, with 11 new supplemental piers between the original truss spans and steel plate girders replacing the iron and steel truss spans. Work completed on November 9, 1943.

When the Mason Bridge was completed in 1962, it put an end to almost all use of the Long Bridge&#x27;s draw span. The last time it was opened was March 1969 to allow barges used in the removal of the old Highway Bridge to pass through. The tender&#x27;s control house, or shanty, on top of the draw remained - often used as a billboard for Georgetown crew races until it was removed in late 1982 or early 1983.

The bridge was rehabilitated in 2016 and CSX determined that it was sufficient to meet their freight needs, but in 2019 DDOT and FRA reported that a second bridge was needed to serve increased passenger rail needs. A third bridge was also proposed to create a new bicycle/pedestrian crossing. In 2019, Virginia announced that they would pay to build a new rail bridge over the Potomac River north of the Long Bridge.

===Highway Bridge===
A new swing-span through-truss bridge called the Highway Bridge or sometimes the 14th Street Bridge, 500 feet (150 m) upriver from the Long Bridge, opened December 15, 1906, to serve streetcars and other non-railroad traffic.

The yellow trolleys of the Mount Vernon Railway used the bridge until 1932 when the line was replaced by buses that eventually became part of the Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington (AB&amp;W) Transit Company.

After the George Mason Bridge was opened in 1962, the Highway Bridge was closed, but there was considerable discussion of reusing the Highway Bridge, perhaps for rush hour only automobile traffic. Nonetheless, the Highway Bridge was finally removed from the site in 1967–1968, and was taken to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, for bombing practice.

In order to remove the Highway Bridge piers, the Williams and Long Bridges were opened for the last time on March 3, 1969. They were opened to remove barge and crane equipment that had been floated upriver in 1967 to remove the old Highway Bridge piers and install new center bridge piers. A few years prior to 1967, the railroad bridge had been welded shut, and in order to open it for the crane, that had to be reversed.

===Pontoon Bridge===
On July 1, 1942, after two months of work, the War Department opened a pontoon bridge located between the Railroad and Highway bridges. It connected Ohio Drive, then Riverside Drive, to US Highway 1. The bridge was constructed of 30 plank covered pontoons with an asphalt coating for the 12 foot-wide floor. A fixed steel span on the Virginia side provided an opening 30 feet wide and 21 feet high for boats to pass under. Two more fixed spans carried it over the George Washington Parkway. The bridge was built for emergency movement of troops and though it was to allow for civilian use, it never did. Once World War II was over, the bridge was removed in the summer of 1945.

===Modern 14th Street bridges ===

Despite the different names of the Rochambeau, Mason and Williams bridges, and the fact that they were all built separately, the three are often called &quot;The 14th Street Bridge&quot; together.

====Arland D. Williams, Jr. Memorial Bridge====
Planning for a replacement of the Highway Bridge started in the 1940s to deal with expanded traffic in the automobile age. Work on a new single-span, northbound-only 14th Street Bridge began on August 21, 1947, and the new bridge opened on May 9, 1950, with the ribbon cut by Miss D.C., Mary Jane Hayes. The Highway Bridge then became southbound-only, but a 2nd bridge was planned to replace it. The new bridge span incorporated draw spans with a control houses that was designed to complement those on the Arlington Memorial Bridge upstream and on the railroad bridge&#x27;s swing span downstream.

In 1956, while planning the Jones Point Bridge Congress began to debate what to name it. While one of the first suggestions was to name it after Woodrow Wilson, which eventually it was, Rep. Joel Broyhill (R-VA) suggested naming it for George Mason, or failing that naming the new Highway Bridge for him. This prompted a letter to the editor of the Washington Post suggested it be named for revolutionary war hero Lafayette, since it was near where he led soldiers across the river on the way to Yorktown. A few days later, Charles Parmer a Rochambeau enthusiast and head of Virginia&#x27;s short-lived Rochambeau Commission, suggested the bridge instead be named for Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau. Another letter followed that suggested attaching the name Rochambeau instead to the 14th Street Bridge and that letter caught the attention of Congress member Harry F. Byrd of Virginia who submitted it to the Congressional Record. Broyhill submitted a bill naming the bridge for Mason and Byrd submitted one naming it for Rochambeau, and by the middle of summer a compromise had been worked out naming one span for each. Broyhill resubmitted the compromise bill in 1957 and it passed. The new bridge was dedicated in honor of Rochambeau on October 19, 1958, at 2pm, at time and date meant to correspond with the time and date that Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in 1781.

The last time Williams Bridge was opened was on March 3, 1969, to remove barge and crane equipment that had been floated upriver in 1967 to remove the old Highway Bridge piers and install new center bridge piers.

Williams Bridge underwent extensive repair in 1975-1976 which resulted in a closure of more than a year. Workers gave the bridge a new deck, removed the bascule draw span and replaced the sidewalks with shoulders. The control house remained.

On January 13, 1982, the Williams Bridge was damaged by the crash of Air Florida Flight 90. The Boeing 737-222, which had accumulated ice while idling on the runway at National Airport, stalled soon after takeoff, fell on the bridge, and slammed into the iced-over Potomac River. The crash killed 74 passengers and crew, plus four people in cars on the bridge. The repaired span was renamed the Arland D. Williams, Jr. Memorial Bridge on March 13, 1985 – following a December 4, 1984 vote – after one of the passengers, who passed a lifeline to five survivors before permitting himself to be rescued. He succumbed to hypothermia and drowned while rescuers worked to rescue the last of the survivors. The name Rochambeau Bridge was then shifted to the Center Highway Bridge.

After a series of inspections from 2005 to 2009, the District of Columbia&#x27;s District Department of Transportation (DDOT) began a $27 million rehabilitation of the northbound main span in 2010. Construction, scheduled to last only a few months, was finally completed in 2011. A 2014 inspection found more problems. Citing the expense and the need to replace or repair several deficient bridges elsewhere in the District, DDOT pushed the date for fixing these problems to 2020. On April 13, 2023, DDOT announced the US Department of Transportation had provided $72 million to help fund the rehabilitation project. The $90 million project, which will also be funded in part by the D.C. government, would start with preliminary engineering and the environmental review for the project later that spring, with the preliminary design expected to be completed that fall. Construction is estimated to take two years.
====George Mason Memorial Bridge====
The new George Mason Memorial Bridge opened upstream on January 26, 1962, replacing the old Highway Bridge (then southbound only). The Mason Bridge, unlike the bridges upstream and downstream, could not open for river traffic, thus Potomac River traffic by sea-going vessels traveling above the Long Bridge ceased in 1961.

During the late 1960s, new ramps were constructed between the westbound Shirley Highway and the southbound George Washington Parkway and these eliminated the path between the bridge and the Pentagon. In 1969, the path was connected to the Arlington Memorial Bridge via the Lady Bird Trail and on April 15, 1972 it was connected to Alexandria via the Mount Vernon Trail, of which the Lady Bird Trail became part.

In 1984, the Mason Bridge was closed for several months for a $5.9 million overhaul. The bridge was resurfaced and widened to provide shoulders. The sidewalk was widened and new safety railings were installed between the walkway and the roadway.

On July 25, 1989, the George Mason Bridge gained national notoriety as the scene of the 1989 DC Prostitute Expulsion.

In late 2018, the National Park Service rebuilt and improved the trail ramp between the George Mason Bridge path and East Basin Drive.

====Rochambeau Bridge====
On April 5, 1971, a third bridge opened immediately downstream of the Mason Bridge, carrying two express lanes in each direction. Work began in March 1967, but wasn&#x27;t entirely completed until 1972. The express lanes lead directly to the high-occupancy vehicle lanes on Virginia&#x27;s section of I-395, though these lanes are only HOV during rush hour.

At the time it opened it was only open for bus traffic, making it the longest exclusive busway in the Country, but over the years the express lane rules have gradually been reduced. In late 1973, carpoolers were allowed to use the bus lanes during rush hour if the car had at least four passengers. In 1975, cars with four passengers were allowed to use the express lanes at all hours. In 1983, Congress passed a law to open the express lanes to all vehicles except during rush hour, when they were restricted to buses, car pools and emergency vehicles and that went into effect in 1985. In 1987, due to increased congestion, the Virginia Department of Transportation extended the HOV end time from 6pm to 6:30pm, but later that year it was rolled back after Rep. Stan Parris passed a federal law that would deny Virginia $2.4 million if the rush hour extension remained. In the same year, the VDOT opened the northbound HOV lanes on the bridge to all users to alleviate congestion caused by reconstruction of the SE-SW Freeway. In early 1989, Virginia, in a deal with Rep. Parris, lowered the HOV restrictions from four people per vehicle to three in order to regain control over the management of the HOV lanes. In late 2019, the HOV lanes on 395 changed to High-Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes, and as a result the northbound lane on the Rochambeau Bridge became a HOT lane as well.

When it opened, the bridge was known as the Center Highway Bridge. On March 13, 1985, following the 1982 Air Florida Flight 90 crash, the downstream bridge was renamed the Arland D. Williams, Jr. Memorial Bridge to honor one of the passengers who died saving the lives of other survivors during the crash. The name Rochambeau was simultaneously transferred to the Center Highway Bridge. However, the bronze marker naming the bridge was not shifted with the name.

====Charles R. Fenwick Bridge====
The final bridge, the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge, carrying the Yellow Line, opened on April 30, 1983. Based on the recommendation of Washington Post reporter Jack Eisen, the bridge was named for Fenwick by the Metro Board on September 22, 1983. Fenwick was a Virginia state legislator from the Washington suburbs who sponsored legislation to create Metro. He died in 1968.

<doc id="504931" wikidata="Q549532" url="?curid=504931" title="Robert Smith (American cabinet member)">
<text>Robert Smith (November 3, 1757 – November 26, 1842) was an American politician, diplomat, and admiralty lawyer. He served as the second United States Secretary of the Navy from 1801 to 1809 and the sixth United States Secretary of State from 1809 to 1811. He was the younger brother of Senator Samuel Smith.

Smith was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and later graduated from Princeton University, then known as the College of New Jersey. As a respected lawyer, Smith became part of Baltimore&#x27;s political elite, launching his political career under Thomas Jefferson and later James Madison.

After a forced resignation from the Cabinet in 1811, Smith served as president of the American Bible Society and the Maryland Agriculture Society. Retired from public office, Smith died in 1842.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Lancaster, Province of Pennsylvania. During the American Revolutionary War, Smith enlisted as a private in the Continental Army, later participating in the Battle of Brandywine.

=== Legal practice ===
He graduated from Princeton in 1781 and was admitted to the Maryland Bar. In private practice, Smith specialized in admiralty law. Smith flourished as a maritime lawyer, establishing the &quot;largest admiralty practice of his time.&quot;

==Political career==
Smith was well-respected from his legal career. Due to his public profile, Smith was selected as an elector to the Electoral College representing Maryland during the 1788–89 United States presidential election.

=== Elected office ===
After Smith&#x27;s entry to partisan politics, he was elected to the Maryland State Senate from 1793 to 1795 and to the Maryland House of Delegates from 1796 to 1800. While serving in the Maryland House, Smith was also elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1798.

=== Cabinet Secretary ===
As a legal expert in admiralty law, Thomas Jefferson appointed him as Secretary of the Navy in July 1801, after William Jones declined the position. On March 2, 1805, the Senate confirmed the appointments of Smith as United States Attorney General and Jacob Crowninshield as Secretary of the Navy. However, Crowninshield declined his appointment, so Smith briefly served as both Attorney General and Secretary of the Navy.

Eventually, President Jefferson appointed John Breckinridge to replace Smith as Attorney General and Smith resumed his role as a full-time Secretary of the Navy.

Smith left the office of Secretary of the Navy at the end of President Jefferson&#x27;s administration on March 4, 1809. President James Madison appointed Smith to serve as Secretary of State on March 6, 1809, and he served in this position until his forced resignation on April 1, 1811.

=== Policies ===
During his time as Secretary of State, Smith pursued an assertive policy to claim the Spanish-controlled West Florida. In October 1810, Smith lied to General Louis Marie Turreau, claiming the United States would not support rebellion in the territory. Later the same month, Smith received word from David Holmes that West Florida declared its independence. American forces subsequently invaded West Florida.

In personal correspondence, Smith pushed for an amendment to ban persons with foreign titles from serving in the New Hampshire legislature, though the amendment failed.

Resignation

Smith was closely allied with his brother, Maryland Senator Samuel Smith, and bitterly opposed Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin. In March 1811, Gallantin threatened to resign if Madison didn&#x27;t dismiss Smith.

Madison thought that Smith could be his own Secretary of State, but Smith so often pursued opposite policies that Madison finally demanded his resignation. In Madison&#x27;s April 1811 &quot;Memorandum on Robert Smith,&quot; the president offered a laundry list of Smith&#x27;s shortcomings. Madison questioned Smith&#x27;s loyalty; found Smith&#x27;s diplomatic correspondence wanting, and noted that Smith had been indiscreet in conversations with the British and had opposed the administration&#x27;s efforts to secure concessions from Britain and France by limiting trade.

Apparently, Smith was bewildered by these and other charges leveled by Madison and published an exoneration of himself, &quot;Robert Smith&#x27;s Address to the People of the United States,&quot; which was an attack on Madison&#x27;s foreign policy. Madison offered Smith the post of Minister to Russia, which was currently held by John Quincy Adams. Smith considered the offer, but in the end, he refused the post.

==Personal life==
Smith became the president of the not-yet-fully-organized American Bible Society in 1813. In 1818, he became the founding president of the Maryland Agriculture Society and afterwards retired to a more private life where he enjoyed his wealth.

Robert Smith died in Baltimore, Maryland, on November 26, 1842, aged 85.

===Legacy===
The was named for him.

<text>In English, a , ; ) is a type of wide-brimmed Mexican men&#x27;s hat used to shield the face and eyes from the sun. It usually has a high, pointed crown; an extra-wide brim (broad enough to cast a shadow over the head, neck, and shoulders of the wearer) that is slightly upturned at the edge; and a chin strap to hold it in place.

In Mexico, this hat type is known as a (&quot;charro hat&quot;, referring to the traditional Mexican horsemen).
In Spanish, any hat is considered a sombrero.

== Design ==
Sombreros, like cowboy hats, were designed in response to the demands of the physical environment. The concept of a broad-brimmed hat worn by riders on horseback can be seen as far back as the Greek petasos of two millennia ago and in the Mongolian horsemen of the 13th century. Hats with tall crowns provide insulation, and wide brims provide shade. Hot and sunny climates inspire such tall-crowned, wide-brimmed designs, .

The mexican sombrero has its origins in Spain where similar hats were worn by rich landowners. During the spanish colonization of Mexico these spanish hats were adopted by mestizo cowboys. Although &quot;sombrero&quot; is usually taken to refer to the traditional Mexican headwear, the term &quot;sombrero&quot; predates this item of clothing, and has been applied to several differing styles of hat. Other types of hats known as &quot;sombrero&quot; can be found in South America and Spain, including the &quot;sombrero calañés&quot;, &quot;sombrero cordobés&quot; and &quot;sombrero de catite&quot; (Spain), and &quot;sombrero vueltiao&quot; (Colombia).

== Cultural influence ==
Many early Texan cowboys adopted the Spanish and Mexican sombrero with its flat crown and wide, flat brim. Also called the , these hats came from Spain.

The Mexican variation of the sombrero added an even wider brim and a high, conical crown. These are the hats worn by mariachi musicians and . Both types of sombreros usually include a or chin strap.

In the Western United States, the sombrero had a high conical or cylindrical crown with a saucer-shaped brim, highly embroidered and made of plush felt.

In the Philippines, due to the influence from Spain brought about by the Manila galleon trade, the term has been assimilated into the Tagalog language in the form of and now refers to any hat – from Mexican sombreros (as used in the English language) to baseball caps.

The galaxy Messier 104 is known as the Sombrero Galaxy due to its appearance. Similarly, Tampa Stadium was also known as &quot;The Big Sombrero&quot;. In mathematics, the Jinc function is sometimes called the sombrero function and in physics, the Sombrero potential is a prescription for the potential energy that leads to the Higgs mechanism.

<text>The Royal London Hospital is a large teaching hospital in Whitechapel in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is part of Barts Health NHS Trust. It provides district general hospital services for the City of London and Tower Hamlets and specialist tertiary care services for patients from across London and elsewhere. The current hospital building has 1248 beds and 34 wards. It opened in February 2012.

The hospital was founded in September 1740 and was originally named the London Infirmary. The name changed to the London Hospital in 1748, and in 1990 to the Royal London Hospital. The first patients were treated at a house in Featherstone Street, Moorfields. In May 1741, the hospital moved to Prescot Street, and remained there until 1757 when it moved to its current location on the south side of Whitechapel Road, Whitechapel, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

The hospital&#x27;s roof-top helipad is the London&#x27;s Air Ambulance operating base.

== History ==
===Origins===
By the middle of the 18th century there were five voluntary hospitals in London (St Bartholomew&#x27;s, Guy&#x27;s, St Thomas&#x27;, Westminster and St George&#x27;s) which provided free medical care to those who could not afford it. However, none was located to the east of the City, where it could have served the comparatively impoverished and rapidly growing population of Spitalfields and Whitechapel; this was the void that The London Hospital was to fill. The institution that was to become The Royal London Hospital was founded on 23 September 1740, when seven gentlemen met in the Feathers Tavern in Cheapside in the City of London to subscribe to the formation of an &quot;intended new infirmary&quot;.

On 3 November, The London Infirmary opened in a house on Featherstone Street, Moorfields. The staff consisted of one surgeon, physician and apothecary; and was operated as a voluntary hospital, in which patients were not charged for treatment and their care was funded charitably from annual subscription fees.

In May 1741, the hospital moved to larger premises in Prescot Street, at that time in an exceedingly bad district. The following year, 2nd Duke of Richmond was persuaded by the hospital&#x27;s surgeon, John Harrison, to become the first President of the new hospital. The name changed to The London Hospital around 1748. The houses at Prescot Street were in an unfit state for use by 1744. A subscription fund for a new building was opened, and the current site was acquired at Whitechapel Mount (then relatively sparsely built on); however, funds were acquired slowly and it was not until 1751 that work began on the new building. The purpose-built hospital, which was designed by Boulton Mainwaring and accommodated 300 beds was opened to staff and patients in September 1757. The next year, the trustees of the charity acquired a royal charter so that they could constitute themselves as a legal entity.
Medical students had been recorded as studying under the staff of The London Hospital as private pupils since the year it had begun, however it was not until 1785 that the London Hospital Medical College was founded; chiefly through the efforts of William Blizard, the hospital&#x27;s surgeon. Private medical schools had been long established, but the LHMC was the first purpose-built medical school in England and Wales organised in connection with a hospital. It amalgamated in 1995 with St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical College, under the aegis of Queen Mary and Westfield College to become St Bartholomew&#x27;s and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

=== 19th century ===
In the 1870s the medical staff determined to improve the quality of nursing care and in 1880 Eva Luckes was employed as Matron of the Hospital, a post which she held for nearly forty years. She was an influential nursing leader and instigated a new programme of nurse training, including the first Preliminary Training School for Nurses. She became known by her friend and mentor Florence Nightingale (also a Governor of The London Hospital) as &#x27;O Matron of Matrons&#x27;. Luckes produced over 470 matrons during her tenure including Military Matrons in Chief Ethel Becher, Maud McCarthy and Sarah Oram, and several matrons of large provincial voluntary hospitals and Poor Law infirmaries including Annie Sophia Jane McIntosh, Matron of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. In the late 1890s, Edith Cavell, who later helped some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium during the First World War, trained under Luckes and worked as a nurse at the hospital.

Joseph Merrick, known as the &quot;Elephant Man&quot;, was admitted to the hospital in 1886 and spent the last few years of life there. His mounted skeleton is currently housed at the medical school, but is not on public display.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century the hospital sent out nurses to work unsupervised in private houses through their Private Nurses Institution, established in 1886. This earned £4,000 a year, a profit of £1,700.
In 1990 Queen Elizabeth II visited the hospital and added &quot;Royal&quot; to the name, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of its founding. The present School of Nursing and Midwifery was formed in 1994 by the merger of the schools from St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and The Royal London Hospital to become the St Bartholomew School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery. Prior to this, the school of nursing was known as the Princess Alexandra College of Nursing and Midwifery. In 1995 the new Nursing School was incorporated into City University, London.

=== 21st century: the new hospital ===
In March 2005 planning permission was granted for the redevelopment and expansion of The Royal London Hospital. The scheme was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2006. Sited on the grounds of the existing hospital, the works involved the replacement of certain of the hospital&#x27;s old facilities, some of which dated back to when the hospital moved to its existing site in 1757. The works also involved the creation of a new trauma and emergency care centre and substantial new renal and paediatric facilities. These works, which were designed by HOK and undertaken by Skanska at a cost of £650 million, opened in part in 2012 and were completed in 2016. The old hospital buildings were converted into the new Tower Hamlets Town Hall for Tower Hamlets Council between 2019 and 2023.

In March 2020 it was reported that the 14th and 15th floors of the hospital, which were never fitted out because the trust had been unable to afford to do so, would be opened in order to provide more capacity to deal with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. These floors were opened in May 2020 at a cost of £24 million.

==Former museum==

The Royal London had a museum which was located in the crypt of a 19th-century church. It reopened in 2002 after extensive refurbishment. The museum covered the history of the hospital since its foundation in 1740 and the wider history of medicine in the East End. It was a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine. It included works of art, surgical instruments, medical and nursing equipment, uniforms, medals, documents and books. There was a forensic medicine section which included original material on Jack the Ripper, Dr Crippen and the Christie murders. There were also displays on Joseph Merrick (the &#x27;Elephant Man&#x27;) and former Hospital nurse Edith Cavell. There was the model of a church in the hospital that was built by Joseph Merrick who spent the last few years of his life at the hospital. The museum closed in 2020.

==Emergency Department and Major Trauma Centre==
The Royal London Hospital is the busiest trauma centre in the UK, with Barts and the London NHS Trust as a whole treating over 1,500 injury patients daily across its five hospitals.

The Queen Mary University of London Centre for Trauma Sciences, part of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, has a strong clinical partnership with the hospital&#x27;s Major Trauma Centre.

The Royal London Hospital is part of a citywide initiative to transform London&#x27;s emergency and trauma services. In 2010, the London Trauma System was implemented. The network is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. The System comprises four existing London hospitals, The Royal London Hospital (Whitechapel), King&#x27;s College Hospital (Denmark Hill), St George&#x27;s Hospital (Tooting) and St Mary&#x27;s Hospital (Paddington), supported by a number of trauma units located in various A&amp;E departments where patients with less serious injuries receive treatment.

==Air Ambulance==
London&#x27;s Air Ambulance is a charitable body funded by members of the public. Its helicopters are hangared at RAF Northolt, but their daytime base is on the 17th floor of the Royal London Hospital. At night doctors and paramedics travel in a Rapid Response Vehicle. The Air Ambulance treats 5 critically ill patients per day.

==In popular culture==
The TV series &quot;Casualty 1900s&quot; is set at The Royal London, and follows the everyday life of the hospital throughout these years. Some of the storylines are based on actual cases drawn from the hospital records. Amazon Prime has acquired the series for broadcast in the US, where it is called &quot;London Hospital&quot;.

The TV comedy drama series &quot;Crashing&quot; (2016), which follows the lives of six property guardians living in a disused London hospital, was filmed at The Royal London.

The TV series &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, which takes place during the 1950s and 1960s in East London, includes scenes at the then London Hospital. The series is a dramatization of the life of a nurse midwife who was trained at the hospital.

== Patient entertainment ==
Bedrock Radio (a registered charity established in 2002), which is based at Queens Hospital in Romford, provide a community health (hospital radio) service across East London, South Essex and immediate surrounding areas. Bedrock Radio began serving Barts Health Trust in November 2022 when Whipps Cross Hospital Radio (WXHR) closed down.

<text>Mile End is an area in London, England and is located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is in East London and part of the East End. It is east of Charing Cross. Situated on the part of the London-to-Colchester road called Mile End Road, it was one of the earliest suburbs of London. 

It was also known as Mile End Old Town; the name provides a geographical distinction from the unconnected former hamlet called Mile End New Town. In 2011, Mile End had a population of 28,544.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Mile End is recorded in 1288 as &quot;La Mile ende&quot;. It is formed from the Middle English &#x27;mile&#x27; and &#x27;ende&#x27; and means &#x27;the hamlet a mile away&#x27;. The mile distance was in relation to Aldgate in the City of London, reached by the London-to-Colchester road. In around 1691 Mile End became known as Mile End Old Town, because a new unconnected settlement to the west and adjacent to Spitalfields had become known as Mile End New Town.

===Beginnings===
Whilst there are many references to settlement in the area, excavations have suggested that this was a rural area with very few buildings before 1300.

The road from the Aldgate (on London&#x27;s defensive wall) to Colchester is known as Mile End Road when it passes through the district. In the medieval period it was known as &quot;Aldgatestrete&quot; to reflect the starting point of the road, it later became known as the &quot;Great Essex Road&quot; to reflect its destination. 

The River Lea, the historic western boundary of Essex, was once much wilder and formed a formidable obstacle. The road, which has existed since at least Roman times, once forded the river at Old Ford in northern Bow. It moved to its present-day alignment after the foundation of Bow Bridge in 1110. The new bridge was around south-east of the ford, requiring a new alignment to be established.

The area running alongside Mile End Road was known as Mile End Green, a large open common which became known as a place of assembly for Londoners, as reflected in the name of Assembly Passage, a short road west of the Stepney Green tube station.

===Peasants&#x27; Revolt===
In 1381 an uprising against the tax collectors of Brentwood quickly spread; firstly in the surrounding villages and then throughout the South-East of England. However it was the rebels of Essex led by a priest named Jack Straw, and the men of Kent led by Wat Tyler, who marched on London. On 12 June the Essex rebels (comprising 100,000 men) camped at Mile End. On the following day the men of Kent arrived at Blackheath. On 14 June, the teenaged King Richard II rode to Mile End where he met the rebels and signed their charter. The king subsequently had the leaders and many rebels executed.

===Expansion===
Speculative developments existed by the end of the 16th century and continued throughout the 18th century. It developed as an area of working and lower-class housing, often occupied by immigrants and migrants new to the city.

In 1811 Bancroft Road Cemetery at Globe Fields was opened for its first burial by the separatist &quot;Maiden Lane synagogue in Covent Garden&quot;. By 1884 it was in disrepair. The cemetery was full by 1895. The synagogue became bankrupt in 1907 and incorporated back into the larger Western Marble Arch Synagogue.

In 1820 the New Globe pub opened next to the new &quot;Globe Bridge&quot;, with its licence possibly transferring from a nearby pub called the Cherry Tree which closed at around this time.

Mile End Hospital was originally an infirmary for the local workhouse, established in 1859. In 1883 the facility was rebuilt as the &quot;Mile End Old Town Infirmary&quot;. A training school for nurses was added in 1892. During the First World War it served as a military hospital. In 1930 it was renamed &quot;Mile End Hospital&quot; and then joined the National Health Service when it commenced in 1948. It was renamed &quot;the Royal London Hospital (Mile End)&quot; in 1990 but reverted back to &quot;Mile End Hospital&quot; in 1994. Also in June 1990 the Bancroft Unit for the Care of the Elderly opened at Mile End Hospital having moved from Bethnal Green. In 2012 it was taken under the management of Barts Health NHS Trust.

In 1882 novelist and social commentator Sir Walter Besant proposed a &quot;Palace of Delight&quot; with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school, various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This coincided with a project by the philanthropist businessman Edmund Hay Currie to use money from the winding up of the &quot;Beaumont Trust&quot;, (together with subscriptions) to build a &quot;People&#x27;s Palace&quot; in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road and the Queen&#x27;s Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex had a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden by 1892 which provided an eclectic mix of populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8,000 tickets were sold for classes in 1892. By 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree was introduced, awarded by the University of London. The building was destroyed by fire in 1931 but the Draper&#x27;s Company (major donors to the original scheme) invested to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary College in December 1934. A new &quot;People&#x27;s Palace&quot; was constructed in 1937 by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney in St Helen&#x27;s Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.
In 1902 Mile End tube station was opened by the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway (W&amp;BR). Electrified services started in 1905. The first services were provided by the District Railway (now the District line). Then the Metropolitan line followed in 1936 (this part was renamed in 1988 as the Hammersmith &amp; City line.) In 1946 (as part of the Central line eastern extension) the station was expanded and rebuilt by Stanley Heaps (Chief Architect of London Underground) and his assistant Thomas Bilbow. Services started on 4 December 1946. Following nationalisation of the W&amp;BR, full ownership of the station passed to London Underground in 1950.

In 1903 The Guardian Angels Church (designed by Frederick Arthur Walters) opened. It was paid for by Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk as a memorial to his youngest sister Lady Margaret Howard, who had performed charitable work in the East End.

In 1933 a ring known as Mile End Arena (covered with a canopy, crumbling walls and rickety corrugated iron) was opened behind Mile End station. It was only used in summer and closed in 1953.

===Second World War===
As well as suffering heavily in earlier blitzes, Mile End was hit by the first V-1 flying bomb to strike London. On 13 June 1944, that &quot;doodlebug&quot; impacted next to the railway bridge on Grove Road, an event now commemorated by a blue plaque. Eight civilians were killed, 30 injured, and 200 made homeless by the blast.

After the Second World War, a part of Mile End remained mostly derelict for many years, until it was cleared to extend Mile End Park.

===Contemporary===
The Stepney Green Conservation Area was designated in January 1973, covering the area previously known as Mile End Old Town. It is a large Conservation Area with an irregular shape that encloses buildings around Mile End Road, Assembly Passage, Louisa Street and Stepney Green itself. It is an area of exceptional architectural and historic interest, with a character and appearance worthy of protection and enhancement. It is situated just north of the medieval village of Stepney, which was clustered around St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church.
In 1990 Ragged School Museum opened in the premises of the former site of the Copperfield Road Ragged School.

On 17 June 1995, the Mile End Stadium hosted a gig by Britpop band Blur where 27,000 fans saw them supported by the Boo Radleys, Sparks, John Shuttleworth, Dodgy and the Cardiacs.

A groundbreaking project funded by the Millennium Commission called the Green Bridge opened in 2000 (a pedestrian and cyclist separation structure over the A11 (Mile End Road) connecting the two halves of Mile End Park to form a linear park). It included new retail frontages.

The St Clement&#x27;s Hospital site was closed in 2005, with services transferred to a new Adult Mental Health Facility at Mile End Hospital in October 2005.

The Palm Tree pub building was Grade II listed in 2015 by Historic England.

The Night Tube service began at Mile End tube station (on the Central line) on 19 August 2016. Since 2016, northern Mile End has fallen under the remit of the Bow Roman Road Neighbourhood Forum. This includes the shops under The Green Bridge on the northern side of Mile End Road (A11), the Mile End Climbing Wall, and Palm Tree.

A 165 year old historically important pub which had been one of the few buildings locally to survive the blitz, &quot;The Carlton&quot; closed in May 2018. This was an important part of local community history. It was sold to Trustee Properties Ltd who obtained permission from Tower Hamlets Council in 2017 to develop five flats but not to demolish the ground floor of the pub. But they demolished the whole building without approval.

==Governance==
 

Mile End formed a hamlet within the large ancient parish of Stepney, in the Tower division of the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. Although formally part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets) under the leadership of the Lord-Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets.

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Mile End became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

For more local government, Mile End was grouped into the Stepney poor law union in 1836, becoming a single civil parish for poor law purposes in 1857. 

It formed part of the Metropolitan Police District from 1830. 

Upon the creation of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 the vestry of Mile End Old Town became an electing authority. The vestry hall was located on Bancroft Road. 

The parish became part of the County of London in 1889 and in 1900 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 

In 1965 Stepney was incorporated into the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. 

There was a Mile End Parliament constituency from 1885 to 1950, which was notable for being one of two constituencies in the UK to elect a Communist Party MP Phil Piratin to the House of Commons between 1945 and 1950. The area now is covered by the Bethnal Green and Bow and Poplar and Limehouse constituencies.

==Geography==
Mile End, which is in London&#x27;s East End has an unusual landmark, the &quot;Green Bridge&quot; (known affectionately as the banana bridge, due to its yellow underside). This structure (designed by CZWG Architects and opened in 2000) carries Mile End Park over the busy Mile End Road. The top of the bridge includes garden and water features and some shops and restaurant space built in below.

Ackroyd Drive Greenlink, Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park and Mile End Park form a large green corridor. The Greenlink is a linear site bisected by roads into five rectangular plots. From the south these are Cowslip Meadow, allotments, Blackberry Meadow, Peartree Meadow and Primrose Meadow.

==Sport and leisure==
Mile End has a Non-League football club, Sporting Bengal United F.C., which plays at Mile End Stadium. The Mile End Skate Park provides a protected recreational space for skate sports.
There are many green spaces in Mile End, including the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, one of the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; cemeteries.

==Media==

The neighbourhood was depicted unfavourably in the pop band Pulp&#x27;s 1995 song &quot;Mile End&quot;, which was featured on the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack. The song describes a group of squatters taking up residence in an abandoned 15th-floor apartment in a run-down apartment tower.

In 2009, the music video for &quot;Confusion Girl&quot; by electropop musician Frankmusik was filmed in Mile End Park and Clinton Road, Mile End.

In 2011, the music video for &quot;Heart Skips a Beat&quot; by Olly Murs and Rizzle Kicks was filmed in Mile End&#x27;s skate park.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
Mile End tube station is on the London Underground Central, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, all of which connect Mile End directly to the East End, City of London and Central London. The Central line also links the area directly to Stratford and Essex in the east and London&#x27;s West End. The station is in London fare zone 2.

=== Buses ===
There are bus stops on Mile End Road, Burdett Road and Grove Road.

London Bus routes 25, 205, 277, 309, 323, 339, 425, D6, D7 and night buses N25, N205 and N277 stop in the area.

Buses link Mile End directly to destinations across London, including Canary Wharf, the City of London, King&#x27;s Cross, Paddington and Stratford.

=== Road ===
The A11 (Mile End Road) passes east–west through Mile End, linking the locale to Aldgate in the west and Stratford in the east. At Stratford, the road meets the A12 where eastbound traffic can continue towards Ilford, the M11 (for Stansted Airport) and destinations in Essex.

The A1205 (Grove Road/Burdett Road) carries traffic northbound towards Victoria Park and Hackney. The road terminates to the south at the A13 near Limehouse and Canary Wharf.

==== Air pollution ====
The London Borough of Tower Hamlets monitors roadside air quality in Mile End. In 2017, average Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels in the locale failed to meet the UK National Air Quality Objective of 40μg/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre).

An automatic monitoring site in Mile End recorded a 2017 annual average of 48μg/m3. Alternative monitoring sites on Mile End Road also failed to meet air quality objectives. A site at the junction with Globe Road in nearby Stepney recorded 52μg/m3 as a 2017 average, whilst a site at the junction with Harford Street recorded 41μg/m3.

Exposure to higher concentrations of NO2 has been linked to lung disease and respiratory problems.

=== Cycling ===
Mile End is on London-wide, national and international cycle networks. Public cycling infrastructure in the locale is provided by both Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Routes include:

* National Cycle Route 1 (NCR 1) – a long-distance leisure cycle route between Dover, Kent and the Shetland Islands, Scotland and forms part of the National Cycle Network. The route passes through Mile End Park on traffic-free shared use paths. In North London, the route runs from Canary Wharf to Enfield Lock.
* Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) – a commuter cycling route from Aldgate in the City to Stratford in the east. The route runs signposted, unbroken and traffic-free on cycle track for the majority of the route. The route follows the A11 (Mile End Road) through Mile End, and the track is coloured blue. It was upgraded between Bow and Aldgate and was completed in April 2016, with separated cycle tracks replacing cycle lanes along the majority of the route.
* Cycleway between Hackney and the Isle of Dogs – a proposed commuter cycle route made in 2019. According to current proposals, the southern portion of the route will run unbroken, signposted and traffic-free on cycle track between Mile End and Canary Wharf.
* EuroVelo 2 (&quot;The Capitals Route&quot;) – EuroVelo 2 is an international leisure cycle route between Moscow, Russia and Galway, Ireland. Through Mile End, it follows the route of NCR 1.
* Regent&#x27;s Canal towpath – a shared use path from Limehouse to Angel. The route is unbroken and traffic-free for its entire length, and can be accessed at Mile End through Mile End Park. The route links Mile End directly to Hackney and Dalston &quot;en route&quot;.

<text>Spanish Town is the capital and the largest town in the parish of St. Catherine in the historic county of Middlesex, Jamaica. It was the Spanish and British capital of Jamaica from 1534 until 1872. The town is home to numerous memorials, the national archives, and one of the oldest Anglican churches outside England (the others are in Virginia, Maryland, and Bermuda).

==History==

The Spanish settlement of Villa de la Vega was founded by the Spanish in 1534 as the capital of the colony. Later, it was also called Santiago de la Vega or St. Jago de la Vega. Indigenous Taino had been living in the area for approximately a millennium before this, but this was the first European habitation on the south of the island.

When the English conquered Jamaica in 1655, they renamed the settlement as Spanish Town in honour to the original Spanish root of this town. Since the town was badly damaged during the conquest, Port Royal took on many administrative roles and functioned as an unofficial capital during the beginning of English rule. By the time Port Royal was devastated by an earthquake in 1692, Spanish Town had been rebuilt and was again functioning as the capital. Spanish Town remained the capital until 1872, when the seat of the colony was moved to Kingston.

Kingston had been founded in the aftermath of the 1692 earthquake. By 1755, serious rivalry from lobbyists caused increasing speculation about the continued suitability of Spanish Town as the capital. In 1836, Governor Lionel Smith observed that &quot;the capital was in ruins, with no commercial, manufacturing and agricultural concern in operation.&quot; To worsen the situation, following the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865, Sir John Peter Grant ordered the removal of the capital in 1872 to Kingston. As a larger port, it had come to be considered the natural capital of the island. After the seat of government was relocated, Spanish Town lost much of its economic and cultural vitality.

==Points of interest==
Built on the west bank of the Rio Cobre, the town lies 13 miles from Kingston on the main road. Its history was shaped by two significant colonial periods: Spanish rule from 1534 to 1655 and the English from 1655 to 1872. After that the capital was relocated to Kingston. The Anglican Church took over the 16th century cathedral.

The historic architecture and street names mark the colonial history, such as Red Church and White Church streets, symbolic of the Spanish chapels of the red and white cross, as well as Monk Street, in reference to the monastery that once stood nearby. Nugent and Manchester streets were named for the British Colonial Governors, George Nugent and William Montagu, 5th Duke of Manchester. King Street runs past the King&#x27;s House, the governor&#x27;s residence, and Constitution Street, near to the Square, refers to the island&#x27;s former administrative centre. Regency buildings in the town centre include the Rodney Memorial flanked by two guns from the French ship Ville de Paris (1764), and the façade of the Old King&#x27;s House, which was the residence of the governor until 1872.

===Old Iron Bridge===

Spanish Town is the site of an early cast-iron bridge, designed by Thomas Wilson and manufactured by Walker and Company of Rotherham, England. Spanning the Rio Cobre, the bridge was erected in 1801 at a cost of £4,000. Its four arched ribs are supported on massive masonry abutments. After the abutments deteriorated, endangering the structure, it was listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.

A restoration project began in 2004, with funding provided by American Express through World Monuments Fund. Progress was slow until 2008, when a renewed restoration effort was made. A first phase of restoration was completed in April 2010, when the repair of the abutments allowed the bridge to be reopened for the public. More recently, violence in the area has prevented the bridge from achieving the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Today==
In 2009, the population of Spanish Town was estimated to be about 160,000. The population of Spanish Town, like the rest of the St. Catherine, has been growing rapidly.

It is sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;Spain&quot; or &quot;Prison Oval&quot; within Jamaica. The latter nickname is a reference to the cricket pitch or oval located just outside the St. Catherine District Prison, where some inmates can get a limited view of the sport through their cell windows. Association football is also played at the Prison Oval; Rivoli United F.C. is the major team.

The town had one of the first Spanish cathedrals to be built in the New World, constructed around 1525. Many Christian denominations have churches or meeting halls in the town, including a Roman Catholic church and Wesleyan, Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist chapels. There is also a mosque.

Standing untouched in character is a historic alms-house, public hospital, and a penal institution built in the eighteenth century. The town contains a factory that manufactures dyes from logwood, a salt factory, and a rice processing plant. In the neighbourhood are five large sugar estates, a milk condensary, and a large textile mill.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Rio Cobre Juvenile Correctional Centre of the Department of Correctional Services, Jamaica is located in Spanish Town.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Spanish Town is on the main A1 (Kingston to Lucea) and A2 (Spanish Town to Savanna-la-Mar) roads. It is well served by buses, mini buses and taxis, which operate from the Spanish Town Transport Hub.

===Rail===
The now disused Spanish Town railway station formerly provided access to four lines:
*Kingston to Montego Bay
*Spanish Town to Ewarton
*Bog Walk to Port Antonio
*Linstead to New Works

The station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica&#x27;s railways abruptly ceased.

<text>The Kainai Nation ( or , : &quot;Káínawa&quot;, Blood Tribe) is a First Nations band government in southern Alberta, Canada, with a population of 12,965 members in 2024, up from 11,791 in December 2013.

 translates directly to &#x27;many chief&#x27; (from , &#x27;many&#x27; and , &#x27;chief&#x27;) while translates directly to &#x27;many chief people&#x27;. The enemy Plains Cree call the Kainai , &#x27;stained with blood&#x27;, thus &#x27;the bloodthirsty, cruel&#x27;, therefore, the common English name for the tribe is the &quot;Blood tribe&quot;.

The Kainai speak a language of the Blackfoot linguistic group; their dialect is closely related to those of the Siksika and Piikani. They are one of three nations comprising the Blackfoot Confederacy.

At the time treaties such as Treaty 7 were signed, the Kainai were situated on the Oldman, Belly, and St. Mary rivers west of Lethbridge, Alberta. The Kainai reserve Blood 148 is currently the largest in Canada with 4,570 inhabitants on and is located south of Calgary.

== Economy ==
The Kainai Nation is engaged in diverse enterprises and they trade with domestic and international partners. Ammolite mining for example provides a rare highly demanded gem mineral to Asia for Feng Shui. Ammolite is currently known only to be found in the Bearpaw Formation as unique conditions of prehistoric times were optimal for the fossilization of marine life into ammolite. Over the years, mining operations have uncovered several oceanic mosasaur fossils which have been stored for study at the Royal Tyrrell Museum; however, they belong to the Kainai Nation.(Lawrynuik)

== Specific claims ==
The Kainai Nation filed many specific claims with the federal government. In 2017, a federal court ruled that the Crown had underestimated the band&#x27;s population, which resulted in the band&#x27;s reserve being smaller than it should have been. As such, the Blood Tribe reserve could be expanded by , but the community could seek a cash-in-lieu-of-land settlement for this claim instead.

In July 2019, the Kainai Nation settled a claim over Crown mismanagement of the band&#x27;s ranching assets. The community received a $150 million cash settlement. Chief Roy Fox said that $123 million of this settlement will be used to develop &quot;housing, capital works, a new administration building and a new skating rink&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
In 1960, the Kainai and their Sun Dance were featured in the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) documentary &quot;Circle of the Sun&quot;. Tribal leaders had been concerned that the Sun Dance might be dying out, and had permitted filming as a visual record. This documentary was later referenced by electronic music duo Boards of Canada on their debut album &quot;Music Has The Right to Children&quot;, with song titles such as &quot;Kaini Industries&quot; and &quot;Pete Standing Alone&quot; paying homage to the tribe and its leader.

In 1973, the NFB released the documentary &quot;Kainai&quot;, which discusses the construction and consequences of a factory on their property.

In 2006, community leader Rick Tailfeathers contributed a small ammolite carving of a buffalo skull to the Six String Nation project. The object was permanently mounted on the interior of &quot;Voyageur&quot;, the guitar at the heart of the project. Following a presentation about the project in September 2014 at Tatsikiisaapo&#x27;p Middle School, project creator Jowi Taylor was presented with a braid of sweet grass by school principal Ramona Big Head. The braid resides in the headstock area in the bed of the guitar case.

On National Aboriginal Day in 2011, the NFB released the &quot;Pete Standing Alone&quot; trilogy, which includes &quot;Circle of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Standing Alone&quot; and a 2010 film, &quot;Round Up&quot;, documenting 50 years of the Kainai Nation as well as the life of elder Pete Standing Alone.

Of particular significance are editorial cartoons by Everett Soop which were a regular feature of the newspaper. Its first editor way Caen Bly, granddaughter of Senator James Gladstone.

<doc id="504974" wikidata="Q265939" url="?curid=504974" title="Patronage">
<text>Patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows on another. In the history of art, art patronage refers to the support that princes, popes, and other wealthy and influential people have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors. It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or church benefices, the business given to a store by a regular customer, and the guardianship of saints. The word &quot;patron&quot; derives from the Latin (&#x27;patron&#x27;), one who gives benefits to his clients (see patronage in ancient Rome).

In some countries, the term is used to describe political patronage or patronal politics, which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support. Some patronage systems are legal, as in the Canadian tradition of the prime minister appointing senators and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies; in many cases, these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the prime minister. As well, the term may refer to a type of corruption or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups, families, or ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts. The opposite of this structure, where all individuals advance based on their personal traits and abilities, is &quot;meritocracy&quot;.

In many Latin American countries, patronage developed as a means of maintaining control over the populace, concentrating economic and political power in a small minority which held privileges that the majority of the population did not. In this system, the holds authority and influence over a less powerful person, whom he protects by granting favors in exchange for loyalty and allegiance. With roots in feudalism, the system was designed to maintain an inexpensive, subservient labor force, which could be utilized to limit production costs and allow wealth and its privileges to be monopolized by a small elite. Long after slavery, and other forms of bondage like the and systems were abolished, patronage was used to maintain rigid class structures. With the rise of a labor class, traditional patronage changed in the 20th century to allow some participation in power structures, but many systems still favor a small powerful elite, who distribute economic and political favors in exchange for benefits to the lower classes.

==Arts==
From the ancient world onward, patronage of the arts was important in art history. It is known in greatest detail in reference to medieval and Renaissance Europe, though patronage can also be traced in feudal Japan, the traditional Southeast Asian kingdoms, and elsewhere—art patronage tended to arise wherever a royal or imperial system and an aristocracy dominated a society and controlled a significant share of resources. Samuel Johnson defined a patron as &quot;one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached the ground, encumbers him with help&quot;.

Rulers, nobles, and very wealthy people used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions, social positions, and prestige. That is, patrons operated as sponsors. Many languages have terms for patrons (such as the English &quot;mecenate&quot;) that are derived from the name of Gaius Maecenas, generous friend and adviser to the Roman Emperor Augustus. Some patrons, such as the Medici family of Florence, used artistic patronage to &quot;cleanse&quot; wealth that was perceived as ill-gotten through usury. Art patronage was especially important in the creation of religious art. The Roman Catholic Church and later Protestant groups sponsored art and architecture, as seen in churches, cathedrals, painting, sculpture and handicrafts.
While sponsorship of artists and the commissioning of artwork is the best-known aspect of the patronage system, other disciplines also benefited from patronage, including those who studied natural philosophy (pre-modern science), musicians, writers, philosophers, alchemists, astrologers, and other scholars. Artists as diverse and important as Chrétien de Troyes, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, William Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson all sought and enjoyed the support of noble or ecclesiastical patrons. Figures as late as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven also participated in the system to some degree; it was only with the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the middle 19th century that European culture moved away from its patronage system to the more publicly supported system of museums, theaters, mass audiences and mass consumption that is familiar in the contemporary world.

This kind of system continues across many fields of the arts. Though the nature of the sponsors has changed—from churches to charitable foundations, and from aristocrats to plutocrats—the term &quot;patronage&quot; has a more neutral connotation than in politics. It may simply refer to direct support (often financial) of an artist, for example by grants. In the latter part of the 20th century, the academic sub-discipline of patronage studies began to evolve, in recognition of the important and often neglected role that the phenomenon of patronage had played in the cultural life of previous centuries.

==Charity==
Charitable and other non-profit making organizations often seek one or more influential figureheads to act as patrons. The relationship often does not involve money. As well as conferring credibility, these people can use their contacts and charisma to assist the organization in raising funds or to affect government policy. The British royal family are especially prolific in this respect, devoting a large proportion of their time to a wide range of causes.

==Commercial==
Sometimes consumers support smaller or local businesses or corporations out of loyalty even if less expensive options exist. Their regular custom is referred to as &#x27;patronage&#x27;. Patronage may entitle members of a cooperative to a share of the surplus or profit generated by the co-op, called a &quot;patronage refund&quot;. This refund is a form of dividend.

==Ecclesiastical==
===Anglican===
:&quot;See main articles Advowson and Parish&quot;
In the Church of England, &quot;patronage&quot; is the commonly used term for the right to present a candidate to a benefice.

===Catholic===

====Patronage of Our Lady====
The liturgical feast of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of Spain, in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of Philip IV of Spain. Pope Benedict XIV ordered it to be kept in the Papal States on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the ordinary. In many places, the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the &quot;Salve sancta parens&quot;.

===Presbyterian===
The Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711, (in force until 1874) resulted in multiple secessions from the Church of Scotland, including the secession of 1733, which led to the formation of the Associate Presbytery, the secession of 1761, which led to the formation of the Relief Church, and the Disruption of 1843, which led to the formation of the Free Church of Scotland.

==Journalism==
While most news companies, particularly in North America are funded through advertising revenue, secondary funding sources include audience members and philanthropists who donate to for-profit and non-profit organizations. 

==Politics==

Political leaders have at their disposal a great deal of patronage, in the sense that they make decisions on the appointment of officials inside and outside government (for example on quangos in the UK). Patronage is therefore a recognized power of the executive branch. In most countries, the executive has the right to make many appointments, some of which may be lucrative (see also sinecures). In some democracies, high-level appointments are reviewed or approved by the legislature (as in the advice and consent of the United States Senate); in other countries, such as those using the Westminster system, this is not the case. Other types of political patronage may violate the laws or ethics codes, such as when political leaders engage in nepotism (hiring family members) and cronyism such as fraudulently awarding non-competitive government contracts to friends or relatives or pressuring the public service to hire an unqualified family member or friend.

===Philippines===
Political patronage, also known as &quot;padrino system&quot;, has been the source of many controversies and corruption. It has been an open secret that one cannot join the political arena of the Philippines without mastery of the padrino system. From the lowest barangay official to the President of the Republic, it is expected that one gains political debts and dispenses political favor to advance one&#x27;s career or gain influence if not wealth.

===Russia===
After Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin retired from politics in March 1923 following a stroke, a power struggle began between Soviet Premier Alexei Rykov, Pravda editor Nikolai Bukharin, Profintern leader Mikhail Tomsky, Red Army founder Leon Trotsky, former Premier Lev Kamenev, Comintern leader Grigory Zinoviev, and General Secretary Joseph Stalin. Stalin used patronage to appoint many Stalinist delegates (such as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Grigory Ordzhonikidze, and Mikhail Kalinin) to the Party Politburo and Sovnarkom in order to sway the votes in his favour, making Stalin the effective leader of the country by 1929.

===South Africa===
In 2012, the African National Congress (ANC) mayor of Beaufort West in the Western Cape Province wrote a letter that openly and illegally solicited funds from the Construction Education and Training Authority for the ANC&#x27;s 2016 election campaign. This episode, amongst many others including instances revolving around President Jacob Zuma, revealed how the African National Congress as ruling the political party utilized patronage to reward supporters and strengthen the leading faction of the party&#x27;s control over governmental institutions.

===United States===
In the United States during the Gilded Age, patronage became a controversial issue. Tammany boss William M. Tweed was an American politician who ran what is considered now to have been one of the most corrupt political machines in the country&#x27;s history. Tweed and his corrupt associates ruled for a brief time with absolute power over the city and state of New York. At the height of his influence, Tweed was the third-largest landowner in New York City, a director of the Erie Railway, the Tenth National Bank, and the New York Printing Company, as well as proprietor of the Metropolitan Hotel. At times he was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the New York City Board of Advisors, and the New York State Senate. In 1873, Tweed was convicted for diverting between $40 million and $200 million of public monies.

Six months after James Garfield became president in 1881, Charles J. Guiteau, a disappointed office-seeker, assassinated him. To prevent further political violence and to assuage public outrage, Congress passed the Pendleton Act in 1883, which set up the Civil Service Commission. Henceforth, applicants for most federal government jobs would have to pass an examination. Federal politicians&#x27; influence over bureaucratic appointments waned, and patronage declined as a national political issue.

Beginning in 1969, a Supreme Court case in Chicago, &quot;Michael L. Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County&quot;, occurred involving political patronage and its constitutionality. Shakman claimed that much of the patronage going on in Chicago politics was unlawful on the grounds of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Through a series of legal battles and negotiations, the two parties agreed upon The Shakman Decrees. Under these decrees, it was declared that the employment status of most public employees could not be affected positively or negatively based on political allegiance, with exceptions for politically inclined positions. The case is still in negotiation today, as there are points yet to be decided.

Political patronage is not always considered corrupt. In the United States, the U.S. Constitution provides the president with the power to appoint individuals to government positions. The president also may appoint personal advisers without congressional approval. Not surprisingly, these individuals tend to be supporters of the president. Similarly, at the state and local levels, governors and mayors retain appointment powers. Some scholars have argued that patronage may be used for laudable purposes, such as the &quot;recognition&quot; of minority communities through the appointment of their members to a high-profile position. Bearfield has argued that patronage be used for four general purposes: to create or strengthen a political organization; achieve democratic or egalitarian goals; bridge political divisions and create coalitions, and alter the existing patronage system.

===Venezuela===

Boliburguesía is a term that was coined by journalist Juan Carlos Zapata in order to &quot;define the oligarchy that has developed under the protection of the Chavez government&quot;. During Hugo Chávez&#x27;s tenure, he seized thousands of properties and businesses while also reducing the footprint of foreign companies. Venezuela&#x27;s economy was then largely state-run and was operated by military officers who had their business and government affairs connected. Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Harold Trinkunas, stated that involving the military in business was &quot;a danger&quot;, with Trinkunas explaining that the Venezuelan military &quot;has the greatest ability to coerce people, into business like they have&quot;. According to &quot;Bloomberg Business&quot;, &quot;[b]y showering contracts on former military officials and pro-government business executives, Chavez put a new face on the system of patronage&quot;.

==Science==
There are historical examples where the noble classes financed scientific pursuits.

Many Barmakids were patrons of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Indian science and scholarship from the neighboring Academy of Gundishapur into the Arabic world. They patronized scholars such as Jabir ibn Hayyan and Jabril ibn Bukhtishu. They are also credited with the establishment of the first paper mill in Baghdad. The power of the Barmakids in those times is reflected in &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;; the vizier Ja&#x27;far appears in several stories, as well as a tale that gave rise to the expression &quot;Barmecide feast&quot;.

==Sports==
In the same manner as commercial patronage, those who attend a sporting event may be referred to as patrons, though the usage in much of the world is now considered archaic—with some notable exceptions. Those who attend the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships of professional golf, are still traditionally referred to as &quot;patrons,&quot; largely at the insistence of the Augusta National Golf Club. This insistence is occasionally made fun of by sportswriters and other media. In polo, a &quot;patron&quot; is a person who puts together a team by hiring one or more professionals. The rest of the team may be amateurs, often including the patron themself.

Also, people who attend hurling or Gaelic football games organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association are referred to as patrons.

<text>Pipers Creek is a urban stream that is located in the Broadview and Blue Ridge neighborhoods of Seattle, Washington, in the United States.

==Course and features==
The entire length of the creek is within the boundaries of Carkeek Park, and its mouth is at Puget Sound.

Its tributaries are Venema Creek and Mohlendorph Creek. The creek was renamed &quot;Piper&#x27;s&quot; by white settler A. W. Piper, but now apostrophe is often left out. The Duwamish tribe call the creek &quot;Dropped Down&quot; (Lushootseed: qWátub).

Daylighted Mohlendorph Creek is mostly within the boundaries of Carkeek Park. It receives Venema Creek and empties into Pipers Creek near the mouth on Puget Sound.

Most of daylighted Venema Creek is within Carkeek Park. It empties into Mohlendorph Creek, just west of the Carkeek Park Environmental Education Center.

<doc id="504981" wikidata="Q846580" url="?curid=504981" title="Special Zone of Xaisomboun">
<text>Xaisomboun (also Saysomboun, ) was a special zone () of Laos, located in the north of the country, near the capital Vientiane. The special zone was created 1994 by the military, with area split off from the provinces Vientiane and Xiangkhoang, in order to control and suppress the postwar Hmong resistance. It was officially dissolved on January 13, 2006, although the term continues to be used.

== Geography ==
The special zone of Xaisomboun is in a mountainous region south of the Plain of Jars. It contains the tallest mountain in Laos, Phou Bia, and the protected area Phou Khao Khouay.

== Military control ==
The area of the special zone of Xaisomboun was once controlled by the Hmong &quot;Secret Army&quot; and included the military bases Long Tieng and Sam Thong; today it is controlled by the Lao People&#x27;s Army (LPA), which have put pressure on Hmong insurgents. Into 2016, the Laotian government continued to deny access to officials from the European Union and the United Nations, despite reports of killings by the military, including killings using chemical weapons. 
In 2017, Barbara Lochbihler MEP submitted a parliamentary question to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, addressing the humanitarian challenges faced by the Hmong in Xaisomboun. She highlighted issues such as restricted access for international officials, reports of violence, and the lack of European Union development assistance reaching the area, seeking clarity on the European Union&#x27;s actions to address the crisis and engage with the community directly.

In 2021, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) condemned the treatment and military violence against the ChoaFa people living in the special zone of Xaisomboun, as well as &quot;intimidation, harassment and persecution of human rights defenders, journalists, and members of minority communities through arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

The province was originally made up of the following districts:
# Hom (18-03)
# Longsane (18-04)
# Phun (18-05)
# Thathom (18-02)
# Anouvong (18-01)

==History==
* 23 September 2004 – The districts Hom and Longsane were merged. The new district, still named Hom, was reassigned to Vientiane Province.
* 27 June 2005 – The districts Phun and Xaisomboun were merged, with the new district still named Xaisomboun.
* 13 January 2006 – Xaisomboun District was reassigned to Vientiane Province, while Thathome District went to Xiangkhoang Province. Therefore, the special area of Xaisomboun was dissolved.

<doc id="504988" wikidata="Q2343504" url="?curid=504988" title="Ben Reilly">
<text>Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Reilly (), also known as the [[Scarlet Spider]], is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Grown in a lab by Miles Warren/Jackal, he is a clone of [[Ben Reilly|Peter Parker]]/Spider-Man tasked with fighting him but instead becoming an ally, later even regarded as a &quot;brother&quot;. Created by writer Gerry Conway, the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #149 (October 1975) and is seemingly killed in the same issue. The character returned and featured prominently in the 1994–96 &quot;Clone Saga&quot; storyline, adopting the &quot;Scarlet Spider&quot; alias with a costume similar to Spider-Man&#x27;s consisting of a red spandex bodysuit and mask complemented by a blue sleeveless hoodie sweatshirt adorned with a large spider symbol on both sides, along with a utility belt and bulkier web-shooters. This Scarlet Spider costume was designed by artist Tom Lyle. When Peter Parker temporarily left the Spider-Man role, Ben became the new Spider-Man while wearing a new costume variation designed by artist Mark Bagley. However, Reilly dies at the hands of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, sacrificing himself to save Parker who then resumes the Spider-Man role.

In 2017&#x27;s &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; story, the character is revealed to be alive, his mind forcibly transferred to new clone bodies by the Jackal repeatedly before his resurrection was successful. Driven mad by the experience of being reborn and dying repeatedly, he became the new Jackal and started his own criminal enterprise. After being defeated by Spider-Man and others, Reilly reclaims his Scarlet Spider identity in the series &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot;. Reimagined as an antihero, he first hopes to escape his past then embarks on a spiritual quest to redeem himself. This arc is completed in &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; (2018), during which he sacrifices himself to protect others when his life force is absorbed by an enemy who inadvertently absorbs his many death traumas as well. Ben is then resurrected in a new clone body, his mind and soul healed and restored. During the events of the 2021–2022 storyline &quot;Beyond&quot;, Ben temporarily became Spider-Man again, only for him to have his memories purged from him and becoming a new villain called Chasm. Due to his many resurrections in different clone bodies, the 2017–2018 comic series &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot; states he has died and returned more than anyone else in the Marvel Universe, leading to him becoming favored by Lady Death.

The character made his cinematic debut in the 2023 feature film &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; voiced by Andy Samberg.

==Publication history==
Ben Reilly was first featured as Spider-Man in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #149 as a nameless clone of Peter Parker who seemingly dies alongside his creator the Jackal, who had also created a clone of Parker&#x27;s lost love Gwen Stacy. The events of the issue were later revisited in several comics such as &quot;What If&quot; #30. Asked why he created the character, writer Gerry Conway explained:

Though Conway had no intention of using the character beyond this initial story in which he dies, Reilly returned to the comics during the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, which ran from October 1994 to December 1996 through all five of the concurrent Spider-Man titles — &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man Unlimited&quot;, and &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;. Editor Danny Fingeroth directed the Spider-Man artists to design a costume for the character which would stand out from conventional superhero costumes by emphasizing simple functionality rather than flash. The artists worked on costume ideas independently, and according to Mark Bagley, Tom Lyle&#x27;s &quot;hoodie&quot; design won unanimous approval among them. The original costume was later replaced by an updated Spider-Man costume designed by Bagley with minor alterations by Bob Budiansky.

Between November and December 1995, the Scarlet Spider replaced Spider-Man in all five of the comics&#x27; titles, which were renamed &quot;The Amazing Scarlet Spider&quot;, &quot;Web of Scarlet Spider&quot;, &quot;Scarlet Spider&quot;, &quot;Scarlet-Spider Unlimited&quot;, and &quot;The Spectacular Scarlet Spider&quot;. Reilly was also featured prominently in the supplemental material provided for the storyline, including &quot;Spider-Man: The Lost Years&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Clone Journals&quot;. The storyline was later revisited in &quot;What If&quot; (vol. 2) #86. Reilly was passed the mantle of Spider-Man and was featured throughout the Spider-Man titles &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man Unlimited&quot;, and &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot;, which replaced &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; as an ongoing monthly title. Reilly remained as the featured Spider-Man between January and December 1996. During this period, the character also featured in two intercompany crossovers &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; with DC Comics and &quot;Backlash/Spider-Man&quot; with Image Comics.

Though the character has not been used in mainstream continuity since his death in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #75, the character is often alluded to and provided the foundation to the backstory in the Spider-Girl mythology. In January 2009, Reilly returned to comics as Spider-Man in the third part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men/Spider-Man&quot; miniseries. Written by Christos Gage, the series explores episodes in the histories of both the X-Men and Spider-Man, sticking thoroughly to the source material of the time frames that the stories take place in. Issue #3 marked the first new adventure featuring Reilly in more than 12 years. Starting in 2009, and continuing into 2010, Marvel published a six-issue miniseries titled &quot;Spider-Man: The Clone Saga&quot; that was a retelling of the story as it had originally been envisioned. In 2010, Marvel began collecting the story in trade paperback and hardcover forms (). The epic spans five books and covers Reilly&#x27;s time on the road, through his encounters with Peter and Mary Jane Watson, up to his role as the Scarlet Spider, as the lone spider hero in New York.

===Mooted return===
On July 25, 2010, at San Diego Comic-Con, fans expressed their desire to see a return of Ben Reilly. To this, assistant editor Tom Brennan replied, &quot;It&#x27;s being worked on&quot;. During the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, a teaser image was posted on Marvel.com of Reilly&#x27;s shirt in flames, entitled &quot;The return of The Scarlet Spider?&quot; It is revealed in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #673 and the Marvel &quot;Point One&quot; one-shot that Kaine will be the new Scarlet Spider in his own ongoing series, which was confirmed by editor Steve Wacker in the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; page of #673. Later, Ben Reilly in his Scarlet Spider uniform appears to be fighting Kaine on the cover of &quot;Scarlet Spider&quot; #21. At the climax of the issue it is revealed that this is Kraven the Hunter impersonating Reilly.

===Resurrection===
Ben Reilly returns in the storyline &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;, it revealed he was repeatedly resurrected, killed and resurrected again by the Jackal as the villain tried to perfect a new cloning process. Broken by the memory and experience of over two dozen deaths, Ben took control of the Jackal&#x27;s scheme, even adopting the villain&#x27;s name for himself, and created a new cloning process that included a better memory transfer but required the clone to ingest a pill on a daily basis to maintain their cellular composition, lest their flesh, muscles, organs, and bones deteriorate until only the nervous system, eyes, and brain remain. He eventually planned to save the human race from death and disease by killing everyone and transferring their memories to super-clones who could then continually have their mind transferred to new bodies if they ever suffered fatal injury, continuations of the original person rather than copies and calling them &quot;reanimates.&quot; After a final confrontation with Peter forces him to abandon his plans and resources, Ben relocates to Las Vegas. He initially tries to escape his past and punishment for his actions while being haunted by hallucinations, adopting the Scarlet Spider identity again. His experiences eventually help restore some of his sanity and set him back on the path to be a hero, before learning he has been favoured by Lady Death as her new favourite person from how many times he had died and returned, and how many people he had revived via his reanimations, to whose bodies their souls returned. Death warns Ben that since his soul has degraded with each death and revival, in spite of his wish to return to heroism, his next death and return will lead him to a path of villainy, a plotline followed up on in &quot;Spider-Man Beyond&quot;, at the end of which Ben is rendered a bitter partial amnesiac, as the villain Chasm.

==Fictional character biography==
===Creation===
Professor Miles Warren, unhealthily obsessed with his late student Gwen Stacy who died at the Green Goblin&#x27;s hands, attempts various experiments, learning Peter Parker was Spider-Man. Blaming the web-slinger for marking Gwen as a target, Warren (taking on the villain alter ego the Jackal) attempts to clone the hero. Parker&#x27;s first clone suffers from clone degeneration and is dismissed, but successful clones of both Parker and Stacy with stable cell structures are later created. After multiple attacks on Spider-Man, the Jackal forces the hero and his clone to fight, each believing the other is the clone. The two team up to save Parker&#x27;s colleague Ned Leeds and Gwen&#x27;s clone. In the process, Warren and Spider-Man&#x27;s clone appear to be killed in an explosion. Spider-Man&#x27;s clone survives and realizes he is not the real Peter Parker. Rather than attempt to replace Parker, he leaves New York to embark on a nomadic life, dubbing himself &quot;Ben Reilly&quot; as a nod to his original self&#x27;s uncle Ben Parker and May Parker&#x27;s maiden surname.

===Exile===
During his travels, Ben Reilly befriends geneticist Seward Trainer, becoming the man&#x27;s lab assistant and honing his scientific prowess to university graduate level under his mentorship. Ben trusts Trainer with his secrets and the man becomes a father figure. During his travels, Reilly is hunted by Kaine, the scarred and resentful failed clone of Peter Parker. Later, Reilly works with scientist Damon Ryder, who mutates himself into a man/dinosaur hybrid. An attack by Kaine causes a fire that kills Ryder&#x27;s family, though the scientist blames Reilly for this tragedy. At one point, Reilly finds love with college student Janine Godbe who then reveals her true identity is Elizabeth Tyne, a fugitive who killed her father after enduring incestuous rape. After Janine apparently commits suicide out of guilt for her crime, Reilly continues his travels.

===Scarlet Spider===
Five years after leaving New York City, Ben Reilly discovers May Parker suffered a stroke and may not recover. He returns to New York City, leading to a confrontation with the original Peter Parker who at this time is bitter, angry, and prone to violent rages following recent traumatic events. After the two handle a hostage situation at the mental hospital Ravencroft Institute, Peter attempts to reclaim his humanity and Ben decides to remain in the city for a while.

When Venom (Eddie Brock) goes on a rampage, Reilly decides to stop Venom, donning a red bodysuit along with a blue spider hoodie he buys at a museum. Armed with improved web-shooters he developed, he defeats Venom and is dubbed the &quot;Scarlet Spider&quot; by &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; reporter Ken Ellis (a name Ben dislikes at first). Ben and Peter later reunite and discover the Jackal is alive. After Seward Trainer finds indicators that Peter is actually the clone and Ben the original, Peter and Ben use his equipment and come to the same results. This leads into &quot;Maximum Clonage&quot; where the Jackal hopes to eliminate the human race with a new version of the Carrion virus and replace people with genetically improved clones. Initially feeling lost, Peter works with the Jackal and his new henchman, an evil clone called Spidercide. Eventually, Peter joins Ben in stopping the Jackal who seemingly falls to his death. Ben concedes he has no desire to be Spider-Man again since he has evolved into a different person.

After working with them to stop the Carrion virus, Scarlet Spider joins the New Warriors for a brief time and develops an attraction to teammate Firestar. After a few more adventures, Peter is nearly killed in action and decides to retire as Spider-Man to be a better husband and father. He and Mary Jane leave New York City. During gang warfare between the second Doctor Octopus and Alistair Smythe, a holographic duplicate of the Scarlet Spider ruins Reilly&#x27;s costumed reputation with a vicious rampage. Reilly decides to drop the Scarlet Spider identity.

===Ben Reilly as Spider-Man===

Ben Reilly adopts the Spider-Man identity with a new costume. Only a few heroes and villains realize this equivalent of Spider-Man is a different person than before. In his civilian life, Ben dyes his hair blonde and starts working at a café called the Daily Grind. He bonded with the Carnage symbiote as Spider-Carnage which John Jameson helped in removing. He starts a relationship with Jessica Carradine, a student at Centennial University with a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, convinced the hero is a murderer. Ben later discovers her late father was the burglar who killed Ben Parker and went into foster care after the man&#x27;s arrest. Jessica then reveals her father told her he had been framed by the web-slinger for Ben Parker&#x27;s murder. She blames the wall-crawling vigilante not only for taking away her parent, but for his death during another encounter with Spider-Man, unwilling to believe it was simply a heart-attack brought on by stress. After Jessica discovers Ben is Spider-Man, she confronts the truth of her father. Ultimately accepting that Spider-Man is a hero when she sees him risk his life to save people from a burning building, she decides to start a new life on her own rather than remain with Reilly.

Ben&#x27;s life and work are targeted by the Hobgoblin on orders of Spider-Man&#x27;s old enemy Mendel Stromm, now called Gaunt. After Peter and Mary Jane return to New York, Ben realizes Seward Trainer has been working with Gaunt for years. Peter and Ben cement their relationship, now regarding each other as brothers and enjoying that they share the same childhood memories. Ben introduces Peter to the Daily Grind staff as his &quot;cousin&quot;. Reilly&#x27;s former lover Janine Godbe is revealed to be alive, forced to fake her death years ago by Kaine as a means of hurting Ben. After multiple confrontations, Kaine accepts he has been avoiding responsibility for his actions and turns himself over to the authorities. Inspired, Janine does the same.

Ben befriends Giachomo &quot;Jimmy-6&quot; Fortunato, who does not wish to follow the legacy of his crime lord-father Vincente. Temporarily hiding from the mob, Jimmy-6 becomes Ben&#x27;s roommate for a time.

====DC vs. Marvel====
During the 1996 &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; inter-company crossover, Ben Reilly winds up in the parallel reality of DC Comics. Not sure how to return home, he temporarily gets a photographer-job at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; under the name Peter Parker and meets top reporters Lois Lane and Clark Kent. Eventually, two cosmic entities force fighters from both the DC and Marvel realities to engage in a series of duels. Reilly is chosen to fight Superboy, the binary clone of Superman and Lex Luthor, and wins. Soon afterward, he and Superboy are temporarily merged into Spider-Boy, a hero of the Amalgam-Comics-universe created by a fusion of DC- and Marvel-realities. At the end of the crossover, the universes are restored and Ben is returned home.

====Death====
During the &quot;&quot;-crossover, the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and others seemingly die. This leads Ben and Peter to later discuss the possibility of both operating as Spider-Men since New York is without many of its defenders now. Soon afterward, Trainer learns that Gaunt&#x27;s secret boss is the long-thought-to-be-dead Norman Osborn. He attempts to warn Ben but is killed. After having both Ben and Peter captured, Osborn reveals himself to be the architect behind Parker&#x27;s last few years of trauma, all part of a plan to drive the hero insane, including having Trainer create false lab results so he would mistakenly believe he was the clone and Reilly the original. Since Peter has withstood his many trials, Osborn has lost patience and decided to act directly. While Mary Jane is poisoned and loses her child in stillbirth, the original Goblin fights Parker. The battle ends when Reilly takes a fatal wound intended for Peter. Dying, he asks Peter to resume the role of Spider-Man and hopes that his and Mary Jane&#x27;s child will be told about their &quot;Uncle Ben&quot;. Reilly dies and his body decomposes rapidly, confirming he was actually a clone. Peter reclaims the Spider-Man identity. Not long afterward, Peter is accidentally transported to Counter-Earth where he finds the believed-to-be-dead Avengers and Fantastic Four still alive, joining them on their return home.

===Post-mortem===
During the 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Peter Parker&#x27;s identity is public and is wanted by authorities for being an unregistered superhero. Forced to go undercover, Peter briefly uses the pseudonym Ben Reilly and a holographic-disguise device given by the Beast.

The Avengers Initiative program later assigns three clones of the hero MVP to aid in the capture of the Sinister Syndicate. These clones adopt the identities of the Scarlet Spiders, each wearing a copy of the high-tech Iron Spider suit. Later on, the villain Mister Hyde gives Spider-Man&#x27;s powers to a person who wears Ben&#x27;s Scarlet Spider suit.

Ben&#x27;s old associate turned enemy Damon Ryder, using the alias &quot;Raptor&quot;, attacks Parker who is mistaken for Reilly and goaded by Kaine. Spider-Man defeats him.

===&quot;Dead no more: The Clone-Conspiracy&quot;===

Ben Reilly appears as part of the 2015 All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, in the form of the mysterious man in a brilliant red suit with a mask of Anubis, the jackal-headed Egyptian god of death. It is eventually revealed that Miles Warren survived &quot;Maximum Clonage&quot; and collected Ben&#x27;s remains after the hero died at the hands of Norman Osborn. Warren clones Ben again, transferring all his memories including his death. When the new body has problems with cellular degradation, Warren kills Ben and tries again. He does this many times, with Ben&#x27;s memory transfer ensuring he recalls each death leading up to his stable 27th body. Traumatized by the memory of 26 deaths, Ben breaks free, defeats Warren, and decides to use his technology and operation to prevent anyone else from suffering the tragedy of death. He adopts a mask of Anubis and as the new Jackal he improves the cloning process, now seeing his new clone creations as &quot;reanimates,&quot; continuations of the original person rather than simply copies. His reanimates seem improved in many ways but carry a latent form of a new Carrion virus in their cells.

Publicly, Reilly uses the company New U Technologies to offer cutting edge healing and organ replacement for people, even those with terminal conditions. Peter Parker, head of Parker Industries at the time, becomes suspicious and investigates. Reilly later reveals himself and shows he has resurrected people whose deaths have caused Spider-Man guilt, all of whom now live in a neighborhood-like facility called &quot;Haven.&quot; Reilly asks Peter to join him and but the latter concludes the new Jackal is using power without considering the responsibility of his actions. A signal is activated that destabilizes the bodies of the reanimates, meaning the new airborne Carrion virus will now activate in most if not all of them. Reilly decides to let this plague spread across Earth so he can replace everyone with genetically improved reanimates, but his plan is stopped. With his own clone body breaking down, Reilly saves himself using New U Pills and Webware Technology, but now bears scars all over his face and body. After a brief confrontation with the original Jackal, Ben leaves to start a new life, still believing his work was for the good of humanity.

===&quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot;===
Relocating to Las Vegas, the disfigured Ben is tracked down by former New U Technologies client Cassandra Mercury, owner of the Mercury Rising casino, who wants revenge for his failure to cure her daughter Abigail&#x27;s terminal disease. Ben buys time by telling Cassandra he can develop a cure in exchange for a lab and resources. He lives and works in the Mercury Rising casino, identifying himself as &quot;Peter.&quot; During this time, Ben is haunted by hallucinations of his old self telling him to be more heroic and his Jackal self defending their actions. He steals a Spider-Man cosplayer&#x27;s hooded costume, then later takes a copy of his original Scarlet Spider outfit from a Spider-Man fan. Operating at times as a vigilante, he uses harsher methods than before, sometimes using a gun to deliver nonlethal injuries.

Kaine Parker arrives in Las Vegas, desiring Ben&#x27;s death for his actions as the Jackal. Reilly argues he is trying to cure Abigail Mercury&#x27;s condition, but his untested serum backfires and kills the girl. Kaine attacks only to be seemingly killed by the embodiment of Death. Death explains no other person has been brought back to life as often as Ben and this has corrupted his soul; one more resurrection will likely shatter his soul and sanity. She offers to restore Abigail or Kaine to life, but Ben asks her to save both and take him instead. Impressed, Death heals Kaine and Abigail and removes Ben&#x27;s scars. During a later battle, Ben uses excessive force and regains scarring around an eye. Death explains he is still being tested and will manifest more scars again if he engages in corrupt behavior.

Some time later, Ben injects Abigail with what seems to be a blood sample from the angel Gabriel, though Abigail succumbs to her fatal disease. The demon lord Mephisto then tricks Kaine into killing Reilly. However, the blood had indeed saved Abigail, but not in the form everyone thought. Abigail ascended to an angelic level of existence and decides to resurrect Ben since Mephisto overstepped his bounds by arranging the man to die earlier than he should. Ben refuses, remembering Death&#x27;s warning that his soul will be shattered and he might become evil. Abigail assures him he&#x27;s still a hero at heart and soon afterwards Ben awakes in a body bag in an ambulance. After escaping from the ambulance, he is confronted by Misty Beck, only for him to punch her through the stomach and exposes her true nature as an android. Ben quickly discovered that he had been driven sociopathic and he enjoyed it. He assaults Kaine and injures him, threatening him to leave Las Vegas if he survived. However, after he leaves, he breaks down in an alleyway, crying.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;===
During &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;, Otto Octavius recruits Kaine to help fight the Inheritors, vampiric beings who feed on the life force of animal totems, particularly Spider heroes across reality. Overhearing that the Inheritors plan to use New U Technologies to rebuild their cloning machine to ensure they can&#x27;t die, Ben, still suffering from his evil soul, volunteers his services, wishing to prevent his technology from causing more harm. Octavius begrudgingly agrees only to apparently betray Ben later, by offering him to the Inheritors in exchange for leaving other Spiders alone. The Inheritor called Jennix takes Ben&#x27;s life force, but also absorbs the experience of Ben&#x27;s 27 deaths which drives the Inheritor insane, just as planned. Following his sacrifice and Jennix absorbing his death traumas, Octavius resurrects Ben a 28th time with his mindset and stability restored.

===&quot;Conan: Battle for the Serpent Crown&quot;===
Returning to Las Vegas, Ben Reilly continues to operate as the Scarlet Spider and tries to restore his tarnished reputation by capturing thieves in the city of sin. Conan the Barbarian was also in the city on his quest for the powerful Serpent Crown when he was mistaken by Scarlet Spider for a criminal. He was caught off guard by Conan&#x27;s ally Nyla Skin, which allowed Conan to easily take him out by throwing him into an electrical sign and knocking him out. While Reilly learned he had been making his rep among Las Vegas&#x27; criminal community, he didn&#x27;t hold out long against Conan the Barbarian.

===&quot;Book of Korvac&quot;===
Ben Reilly returned to New York City and started working at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where he was first inspired to create the Scarlet Spider identity. He was recruited by Tony Stark/Iron Man alongside a quickly assembled team of heroes that included Misty Knight, Gargoyle, Frog-Man, Halcyon, and Hellcat. They were brought on board to help Iron Man save a captured James Rhodes from the reborn android from the future known as Korvac as he attempted to attain cosmic godhood once again by stealing power from Galactus&#x27; worldship.

===&quot;Spider-Man Beyond&quot;===
At some as-yet unspecified point, Ben returns to Earth and is recruited by the Beyond Corporation, taking on the mantle of Spider-Man for a second time. He takes a newly modified costume designed by Beyond into the field when Bushwacker seizes control of a building in Dallas, Texas. Ben arrives to stop him, Bushwacker takes note of the new costume and asks when heroes like Ben ever have time to sew, before training his weapon on his hostages. Ben shields them from a blast with his own body, his costume is made of impact-thickening foam polymers that absorb the energy burst. Bushwacker&#x27;s arms morph into larger cannons but Ben plugs them with a fist, and the blasts backfire on Bushwacker, severely crippling his arms and causing damage to the building. Ben is horrified and calls in the Beyond corporation, who assure him they will take care of the clean up operation, providing counselling for the hostages as well as a contractor to repair the building.

Ben is impressed with the Beyond Corporation&#x27;s services as well as the effectiveness of the new Spider-Man suit and agrees to join them. Beyond corp tell him to get rid of his Scarlet Spider outfit, comparing it to something a fourteen year old would wear at a birthday party. Ben is concerned he&#x27;ll be mistaken for the real Spider-Man, Beyond corp tell him that, to them, he is the real deal.

To assure Ben&#x27;s unwavering loyalty, the Beyond corporation arrange for the prison release of Elizabeth Tyne, Ben&#x27;s true love.

While taking the new Spider-Man suit out for another of Beyond&#x27;s &#x27;test drives&#x27;, Ben encounters Peter Parker, who pursues him, demanding to know who he is. Ben eventually gives Parker the slip using one of his costume&#x27;s devices to trap him. Ben eventually arranges a meeting with Peter where he confesses to being the Spider-Man he encountered earlier. He informs Peter of his recent recruitment by Beyond and that they have acquired, through the remains of Parker Industries, the rights and license to the Spider-Man name. Peter tells Ben he can&#x27;t just ask for a piece of his life in this manner, but Ben makes it clear he is not simply &#x27;asking&#x27;.

When the U-Foes attack Empire State University, both Peter and Ben team up to stop them. The confrontation leads to one of the U-Foes unleashing a radio-volatile gas explosion. Ben&#x27;s new Spider-Man suit is able to protect him, but this leaves Peter exposed and he is poisoned.

Mary Jane and Peter&#x27;s Aunt May are summoned by Ben to the hospital, with Ben posing as Peter over the phone. Aunt May is less convinced than MJ that Ben is Peter, but goes anyway. Ben arrives, much to MJ&#x27;s annoyance, and tells Peter he&#x27;s not good with asking for things, so says his &#x27;therapist&#x27; Ashley Kafka&#x27;s clone, but now he feels compelled to try. Peter gives Ben his blessing to be Spider-Man. When Ben departs, Peter tells MJ he wanted to wait until he was out of earshot and sight before confessing that he can&#x27;t feel anything in his body. He goes into convulsions and doctors scramble to stabilize him, but they appear to be losing him. Ben in the meantime suits up and confronts the U-Foes as Spider-Man

Having triumphed over the U-Foes, Ben resumes training at Beyond with Colleen Wing and Misty Knight and meets with the head of superhero development at the company Maxine Danger, Maxine, annoyed that Ben had turned off his comms twice over the course of a few days, asks Ben if she can still rely upon his skills and service. Ben assures her he can and then visits Doctor Kafka for a therapy session. Ben makes an attempt to discuss his connection to Peter&#x27;s Uncle Ben, but finds it hard even with his cloned memories to recollect something specific Ben had said to Peter long ago. Ben returns to his room, where his and Elizabeth/Janine&#x27;s dinner plans are spoiled by yet another call to action. Ben is transported downtown where he stumbles upon Morbius, the Living Vampire in the midst of a feeding frenzy.

Morbius attacks Ben, sinking his fangs into him. Ben&#x27;s costume is damaged but proves capable of self-repair. Ben lures Morbius back to his apartment at Beyond headquarters, where the automated defence systems are able to fend him off, slicing off one of his arms. As Coleen and Misty take care of Morbius, Ben collapses from the bite he received earlier and is rushed into surgery by the Beyond personnel. Maxine Danger is at first hesitant to give Ben any anti-toxins in the event he develops a mutation from the bite that could enhance his powers, which would benefit Beyond greatly, but eventually is convinced to approve treatment. Afterwards, Ben and Elizabeth spend an evening together. As they share a kiss in the park, they are observed by the latest version of Kraven The Hunter.

Ben is attacked by Kraven, Ben sees shapeless faces as part of his hallucinations, very much as Peter Parker has in recent times. He is taken by Kraven to an off shore ocean platform where the Hunter has captured other Beyond staff. Ben eventually recovers and beats Kraven, who escapes. Ben returns home to Elizabeth, while Maxine prepares to make a move against Miles Morales, who has turned down several legal requests to cease using the Spider-Man trademark now that it is licensed by the Beyond corporation

Ben checks in on Peter, only to find Felicia Hardy holding vigil by his bedside. Felicia makes it clear to Ben she does not approve of him using her ex-lover&#x27;s costumed identity. Before they can argue further, they are summoned to the sanctum of the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, where they are tasked by Classic Doctor Strange with several feats that the good doctor cannot deal with on account of their Doctor Strange having been very recently murdered. Over the course of this arduous evening fulfilling Strange&#x27;s requests, Ben and Felicia come to an understanding, and Felicia begrudgingly accepts that, for now, Ben has earned the title of Spider-Man, but she is determined to get Peter out of bed and back on his feet.

Ben attends therapy with Ashley Kafka, and talks about recent dreams he has had concerning Peter&#x27;s Uncle Ben. The therapy pays off and a joyous Ben scoops up Kafka in his arms to thank her, but she tells him this is not appropriate. Later that evening Ben and Janine make preparations for a night on the town but Ben is called away to deal with a break-in at Beyond Branch C-47. Discovering Doctor Octopus, Ben battles the sinister six-armed scientist, managing to temporarily disable his tentacles with a spot of Beyond tech, but Doctor Octopus is still able to outwit and injure Ben through other means and successfully makes off with a computer drive containing classified information that Maxine Danger requests that Ben retrieve at all costs. Maxine also informs Ben he is becoming more of a liability and there were other options before him that Beyond were considering for the role of Spider-Man

When Doctor Octopus attacks Maxine at Beyond headquarters, Ben comes to her rescue and is able to get the better of Doctor Octopus this time. Soundly beaten, Doctor Octopus offers Ben information on why Beyond selected him. Ben discovers to his horror Beyond considers him emotionally compromised and easy to manipulate. Taking the drive with him and hiding it within his mask, Ben returns home to Janine. Secluded in the bathroom, he shatters a mirror in frustration.

Ben talks with Kafka. Over the course of their conversation, Ben reveals he no longer believes he is a clone. This is in part to Beyond, per Maxine&#x27;s instructions, significantly altering his memories so he is more easily controllable. Realizing Ben is on to them, Beyond betrays both him and Kafka. Ben&#x27;s mind is further tampered with, and he loses all sense of Uncle Ben&#x27;s teachings about great responsibility, which later puts Janine and Mary Jane in great danger when they are confronted by Doctor Kafka, who has been transformed by Beyond into a new and dangerous enemy they christen the Queen Goblin. Unable to remember Ben Parker&#x27;s greatest lesson, Ben flees with Janine and leaves Mary Jane to the Goblin, but Janine and Ben talk things through, he lets her go to Peter&#x27;s hospital bed and fetch him so he can rescue MJ. Peter eventually finds Ben, though Reilly struggles to recollect Peter The two team up and head to Beyond&#x27;s villain depot, where they are joined by Colleen and Misty. Maxine Danger appears before Ben as a hologram and threatens to open the facility&#x27;s mysterious Door Z, but Ben decides to open it himself and use whatever is inside to keep Peter and the daughters of the dragon preoccupied while he deals with Maxine and Beyond himself. He abandons his allies to face what lies behind Door Z...Creature Z (a binary clone of Lizard and Morbius the Living Vampire).

It all comes to a head as Ben begins to lose his artificially implanted memories of Peter Parker&#x27;s life. The Beyond Corporation attempts to pit the increasingly unstable Ben against Peter, telling him they&#x27;ve built a device that can repair and restore the pieces of his memories and personality that Ben believes are fading away. But sensing a trap, Peter refuses to submit to the device, leading Ben to try and force him to use it. In the ensuing conflict, Ben is swept up under strange chemicals called &quot;quantum-shifting polymers in a psycho-reactive medium&quot; which are unleashed to rewrite and remake the actual physical matter of their headquarters to hide the evidence of their misdeeds. Despite suffering serious injuries, Peter survives, but Ben seems to be lost in the wreckage of the former Beyond Corporation headquarters. However, months later, Ben resurfaces - and he&#x27;s undergone some changes due to his exposure to the &quot;quantum-shifting polymers.&quot; The issues with Ben&#x27;s memory have become worse, with the literal holes in his visual memories where the faces of his loved ones used to be creeping into his actual perceptions, leaving Ben unable to even perceive his own face in the mirror. Perhaps even worse, he&#x27;s now bathed in some kind of green and black energy that seems related to the shifting properties of the chemicals. Donning a twisted green and purple version of his Spider-Man suit, Ben declares his old self &quot;dead,&quot; implying that the memories and larger personality that once resided in his physical form have been erased, which seems to be confirmed by his inability to even perceive his own face, along with his previously established amnesia. Instead, all that&#x27;s left within him is a chasm, giving his new villainous persona that name.

As Chasm, Ben soon finds allies that assist him in his campaign against Peter such as Madelyne Pryor.

===&quot;Dark Web&quot;===
Allied with Madelyne, Ben is able to trap Peter and most of his allies, including J. Jonah Jameson and other &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; staff, in a Limbo replica of New York. His goal is to torment Peter until his template gives up and eats a piece of fruit that will absorb his soul, allowing Ben to claim the memories that he feels Peter &quot;stole&quot; from him (his memory now warped so that he believes Peter smashed the memory transfer helmet out of deliberate malice rather than resisting because he didn&#x27;t know what it would do to him), but Peter continually refuses to go through with this. Despite facing demonic versions of his usual enemies, Peter is able to resist Ben&#x27;s Limbo and even inspire one of the demons to become a twisted version of Spider-Man dubbed &quot;Rek-Rap&quot;. When Madelyne is convinced by the X-Men to put a stop to this, Ben steals Madelyne&#x27;s staff, becoming the new king of Limbo. Peter and Rek-Rap then join forces with the mutants in defeating Ben&#x27;s forces. Ben eventually falls, with Madelyne reclaiming her staff and becoming the ruler of Limbo once again. Ben is then seen having been sent to prison in Limbo as part of a new treaty with New York, Madelyne and Peter expressing hope that Ben will be able to return to himself.

===Release and &quot;Curse of Kaine&quot;===
The Orchis organization attempts to break Ben out from Limbo imprisonment to recruit him into their anti-mutant cause. Ben absolutely refuses to be any part of such and chooses to remain imprisoned. Afterwards, Pryor regards Ben&#x27;s sentence fulfilled and permits him to escape on his own. Ben reunites with Janine, who is herself now super-powered with the costumed alias &quot;Hallows&#x27; Eve&quot;, but turns to Dr. Ashley Kafka again for help with his damaged memories. As Kafka intends and tries to harm instead of help Ben, both Peter and Janine save him from Kafka, and Ben seems to come out of it deciding to end any further issues and involvement with Peter and to make a future with Janine.

Chasm and Hallows&#x27; Eve are surviving by committing robberies, though both also occasionally act as heroes despite themselves. Kaine Parker takes it upon himself to find his &quot;clone brother&quot; and try to set him right, but someone else is taking advantage of Ben&#x27;s still-fractured mind to control him against his will.

==Powers and equipment==
As Spider-Man&#x27;s clone, Ben Reilly possesses proportionate spider-like abilities and traits identical to Peter Parker&#x27;s, including superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, stamina, resiliency, and agility, along with the ability to cling to almost any surface granted by consciously commanding his body to do so (the process seems similar to the van der Waals force and has been described as &quot;the ability to mentally control the flux of the inner-atomic attraction between molecular boundary layers). Reilly&#x27;s reflexes and stamina operate up to 40 times faster than an average person&#x27;s, while his strength allows him to lift 150 times his own weight (approximate limit of 10 tons). He can leap thirty feet into the air from a standing position. Ben&#x27;s superhumanly enhanced muscles, bones, and body are more resistant to injury than the average human. Like Peter, Ben has a precognitive &quot;spider-sense&quot; warning him of incoming danger and threats, manifesting as a buzzing in the base of his skull. In battle, Ben can allow this sense to guide his reflexes to help dodge attacks.

Ben possesses Peter Parker&#x27;s genius-level scientific intellect with particular talents towards applied science, chemistry, biology, engineering, physics, mathematics, and mechanics. During his travels, Ben was able to spend more time improving his scientific knowledge and experience and came to surpass Peter&#x27;s skill in some fields. Because Reilly was not in the role of Spider-Man for five years while traveling, and didn&#x27;t engage in regular combat during his time as the Jackal, his fighting style is less polished than Parker&#x27;s. Kaine notes that Reilly is more reliant on tactics rather than his physical skill and is a calculating and cunning combatant.

Like Peter Parker, Ben is armed with wrist-worn web-shooters that each holds several cartridges of &quot;web-fluid&quot;, a chemical mixture that solidifies on exposure to air. Released from a pressurized valve, the web-fluid can (depending on the valve&#x27;s adjustment) become an expanding net, a thin web-line, or an adhesive, malleable goo. Reilly&#x27;s web-shooters use more advanced triggers than Parker&#x27;s and include features such as &quot;impact webbing&quot;, temporary paralysis-inducing &quot;stingers&quot;, and &quot;mini-dot&quot; tracers (a smaller version of Parker&#x27;s spider-tracers). Due to these advances, Reilly&#x27;s web-shooters are bulkier than Parker&#x27;s, so he wears them on the outside of his costumes. Like Parker, Reilly wears a belt that carries spare web-fluid cartridges.

Following &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;, Ben had scarring on his face and body. After his encounter with the cosmic entity Death, the scars were removed but would return if he behaved in corrupt ways. Following his resurrection in &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;, these scars are completely gone.

==Reanimations created by Ben Reilly==
When operating as the new Jackal, Ben Reilly begun harvesting the DNA from the remains of those he planned to clone, rather than using the blood sample that Miles Warren had gathered to grow &quot;Reanimations&quot; with all the memories retained up to moments of their deaths, those grown of the deceased having their souls drawn back into them, and those grown of still-living people like Ben having their own unique souls. The following are reanimations created by Jackal:

* Gwen Stacy: Peter&#x27;s deceased girlfriend, reanimated by Ben to serve as his business partner.
* Oksana: The Rhino&#x27;s wife, reanimated to convince Rhino to join Ben&#x27;s side.
* Martha and Billy Connors: The Lizard&#x27;s ex-wife and son who he ate, reanimated to convince Lizard to join Ben&#x27;s side.
* Francine Frye: reanimated to manipulate Electro to restore his powers, only due to Francine&#x27;s DNA being mixed in with Electro&#x27;s DNA, she absorbs his electricity, killing him and becoming the new Electro instead.
* Prowler: reanimated that replaced the real Prowler after he was apparently killed by the female Electro; on learning the real Prowler is still alive, he sacrifices himself to save some of those reanimated from succumbing to the Carrion Virus.
* Vanessa Fisk: reanimated by Ben in an attempt to manipulate the Kingpin into joining his side; however, Fisk instead kills her after she pushes for their son to also be revived, dismissing her as an abomination.
* George Stacy: reanimated to convince the Gwen Stacy reanimation to join Ben&#x27;s side.
* Doctor Octopus&#x27;s consciousness in an Octobot arranged for his body to reanimated and then took control of the body from the copy of Peter&#x27;s mind operating it, where he allied with Ben.
* Ben also reanimated Jack O&#x27;Lantern, Kangaroo, Madame Web, Massacre, Mirage, Montana, and Tarantula.
* To strengthen the &quot;Underworld&quot; with the villain reanimations, Jackal reanimated Alistair Smythe, Barton Hamilton&#x27;s Green Goblin form, Big Man, Eduardo Lobo, Hitman, a Hobgoblin, a Mysterio, Ox, a Rose, Spencer Smythe, and Stilt-Man. Also, Jackal reanimated Ashley Kafka, Jean DeWolff, and Mattie Franklin.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===

Ben Reilly is one of the heroes on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier who survived the zombie plague. He is seen battling the zombies; however, this plan falls apart. Reilly&#x27;s fate is unknown.

===MC2===

* In the alternate reality known as MC2, Peter and Mary Jane Parker&#x27;s daughter May Parker survives birth and grows up hearing stories of her late &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; who died a hero. After realizing she has powers of her own, the teenage May (nicknamed &quot;Mayday&quot;) confronts her mother, learning her father was Spider-Man and that Ben Reilly also assumed the identity for a time. Inspired, she adopts Ben Reilly&#x27;s web-shooters and Spider-Man costume, becoming Spider-Girl.
* In the MC2 reality, Ben Reilly had a son by Janine Godbe (Elizabeth Tyne), named Reilly Tyne. Kaine regards Reilly Tyne as his &quot;nephew&quot; and tries to save him from cellular degeneration. Kaine&#x27;s experiment results in the young man becoming older and infused by a portion of the demon Zarathos and a portion of the spirit of the deceased Matt Murdock, turning Reilly Tyne into Darkdevil.
* Felicity Hardy, the daughter of Felicia Hardy (Black Cat), assumes the Scarlet Spider identity in an attempt to become partners with Spider-Girl. Peter Parker is angry at this, considering it an inappropriate use of Ben Reilly&#x27;s former costumed identity.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===

&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. Miles Warren was ordered by Norman Osborn to create clones of Norman and Peter. In 1977, Norman convinced Harry to attack Miles after discovering that Warren had created a clone of Gwen as well. Harry deduces that Norman had Miles clone Peter because Norman still viewed Peter as a more worthy successor over him and blows up the containment tubes with the clones. Peter&#x27;s clone was the only survivor thanks to inheriting Spider-Man&#x27;s powers. However, Miles reveals that the &quot;Gwen&quot; Peter was with was actually her clone while the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen&#x27;s clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker (later Reilly) and move out of New York for a second chance at life.

Ben eventually becomes a photojournalist in Chicago, where he also operates as the hero known as &quot;the Red Mask&quot;. In 1995, he and Peter are kidnapped by Doctor Octopus and taken to Oscorp so Otto could learn how to extend his life by cloning. In the process, Otto discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone, while Ben was the original. Ben lashes out at Otto for the revelation before Otto attempts to kill them both and ends up murdering Harry instead. As Ben begins to have an identity crisis, Peter gives him a folder detailing his own life from the last 20 years and allows Ben the opportunity to retake his life as &quot;Peter Parker&quot; once more. It is later revealed that Peter found out that Norman had manipulated Otto into kidnapping them and rigged the results, meaning that Ben is still the clone. However, Peter allowed Ben to take over his life so he could live quietly with Mary Jane and his children.

In 2006, Ben is murdered by Morlun, as Peter ignored Ezekiel&#x27;s warnings about him in this timeline, prompting Peter to return to New York to reveal that he is the true Peter Parker so he could prevent Morlun from coming after his family and stop Tony Stark from taking over Parker Industries.

===&quot;Spider-Man: The Clone Saga&quot;===

In September 2009, a six-issue miniseries based on the Clone Saga comics of the 1990s, titled &quot;Spider-Man: The Clone Saga&quot;, was issued. The purpose of the miniseries was to tell the story as it was initially conceived. It is a condensed version of the Clone Saga without the plot points involving Traveler, Scrier, and covers several months of a fictional time period. The first issue introduces readers to the characters Ben Reilly and Kaine, and addresses Mary Jane&#x27;s pregnancy and Aunt May&#x27;s hospitalization. Reilly and Parker bond after Kaine attacks them, and Reilly decides to stay in New York, pretending to be Peter&#x27;s blonde-haired cousin so that he can build his own life. Reilly adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and begins working at the Daily Grind.

Reilly and Parker later work with Kaine to reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Mary Jane and Aunt May with a deadly genetic virus. The mysterious villain is revealed to be the Jackal, who captures all three and reveals his plans to make an army of Spider-Man clones to take over the world. Since Reilly is the only stable clone, the Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique. When the Jackal reveals another stage of his plan, to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure, Kaine goes berserk and breaks himself, Parker and Reilly free. During the subsequent fight, the clones dissolve and the Jackal plants the first seed of doubt over who is the original Peter Parker. After Kaine kills the Jackal, Reilly and Parker escape with the cure for Aunt May&#x27;s and Mary Jane&#x27;s virus. Parker retires and hands the Spider-Man identity to Reilly. Reilly spends several months in the role, while Parker gets ready to become a father. Reilly is shown as a less-polished Spider-Man and is somewhat insecure due to his relative inexperience because of his exile. Eventually, Mary Jane gives birth, Allison Mongrain kidnaps the baby, and later gives it to Kaine.

When Reilly goes searching for the baby, he is attacked by the Green Goblin, who is revealed to be Harry Osborn and working with Kaine. Though Reilly appears to gain the upper hand in the ensuing fight, the Goblin impales him in the back with his Goblin Glider. Miraculously, Reilly survives the attack. Osborn had been plotting his revenge against Parker since his apparent heart attack. Osborn creates a clone of his father, Norman, to help him defeat Parker and Reilly; however, Norman jumps in front of Harry&#x27;s Goblin Glider as it is about to hit Parker and is impaled in the back. Afterwards, Kaine returns baby May to Parker and Mary Jane, Aunt May survives and wants to help raise the child, and Ben Reilly leaves once again to travel the world and find a life for himself.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===

During the 2014 &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, Ben Reilly of Earth-94 was recruited into a team of multiverse Spider-Totems who were teaming up to fend off the Inheritors, who were trying to devour each and every Spider-Totem. In this particular universe, Peter Parker&#x27;s powers did not return, with Peter remaining in Oregon while Ben has developed into a far lighter character without the burden of Peter&#x27;s past, particularly aided by the string of successes that he had as Spider-Man, including saving Marla Jameson from Alistair Smythe and preventing Doctor Octopus from taking his body.

This version of Ben Reilly lead a team featuring fellow clones Kaine of Earth-616 and the Jessica Drew of Earth-1610 who are sent on a mission that requires their &#x27;expertise&#x27; as clones of Spider-Man. Their mission sends them to Earth-802, a world conquered by the Inheritors and ruled over by the Inheritor Jennix, whose efforts to clone Spider-Totems failed to clone the Spider-Essence itself. Despite their best efforts to infiltrate said world, the Spider-Clones would end up doing battle with the dimension&#x27;s versions of Iron Man and the Human Torch, as well as Jennix himself, before Reilly later sacrificed himself to destroy the Inheritors&#x27; cloning facility; which they used to resurrect themselves if they fell during their trips to other worlds.

===Ultimate Marvel===

In Ultimate Marvel (Earth-1610), &quot;Ben Reilly&quot; is introduced as an African-American scientist who worked with Dr. Curt Connors at Empire State University. He combines a sample of Spider-Man&#x27;s DNA with Lizard&#x27;s DNA and the Venom symbiote to create the Carnage organism, which he nicknames &quot;Little Ben&quot; Reilly after himself, and steals a second sample of Spider-Man&#x27;s DNA from the lab. Reilly later works with Doctor Octopus, creating five clones of Spider-Man while employed by the CIA, with the female clone, the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Woman&quot;, adapting the role of Ben Reilly from the original &quot;Clone Saga&quot; of Earth-616, with all being clones of Peter Parker with all of his memories up to the moment of their creation.

One clone has Kaine&#x27;s insane personality and facial scars and wears a makeshift version of Ben Reilly&#x27;s costume.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Ben Reilly is the alias used by Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson when publishing their story at &quot;The Paper&quot; using the information on the USB Drive given to them by Harry Osborn. The alias was a way for them to keep Wilson Fisk and his allies from finding out that they wrote the story containing the information they received. Peter&#x27;s Picotech suit, a Peter Parker A.I., also adapts elements of the Earth-616 Ben Reilly, standing in for Peter in public when he is kidnapped.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
* &quot;What If?&quot; #30, &quot;What If Spider-Man&#x27;s Clone Had Lived?&quot;, depicts a world where, after the Jackal&#x27;s bomb explodes at Shea Stadium, both Spider-Men are knocked unconscious and the clone awakens before the original. The clone, believing that he is the original Peter Parker, puts the still unconscious Parker into stasis in one of the Jackal&#x27;s clone-growing devices for safety and attempts to continue with life as normal. However, the clone has no memories from the time before the cell samples he had been grown from were taken, and is confused and lost in the world of the real Peter Parker. This memory gap and the discovery of the Jackal&#x27;s notes on his cloning process, leads the clone to realize what he truly is. After some hesitation (considering leaving the original safely asleep in stasis), he frees the real Parker just in time for both of them to confront a threat from the Kingpin. Afterwards, the clone prepares to leave to seek his own fortune, but accepts an offer from Parker to co-operate in &quot;shifts&quot;, switching between being Parker and Spider-Man. In this story, the clone never establishes a separate name for himself, and is referred to as &quot;Spider-Clone&quot;, &quot;brother&quot;, or &quot;bro&quot; by the original Parker.
* &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #86, &quot;What If Scarlet Spider Killed Spider-Man?&quot;, gives an alternate ending of the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;. During the time Spider-Man is under the Jackal&#x27;s control, the Scarlet Spider and Spider-Man fight until there is an explosion. Reilly&#x27;s body is later found washed ashore and Peter Parker is believed to be dead. Reilly awakens in hospital and finds Parker&#x27;s friends and family, who believe he is Parker, around his bed. The following year, Reilly and Mary Jane discover that their baby, May, is dying of blood poisoning. One night, Reilly wakes to find that May has been kidnapped. Ben searches for her and meets the Green Goblin, who reveals that he is behind the &quot;Clone Saga&quot; and needs May&#x27;s blood for a serum. The two fight atop the George Washington Bridge, where Gwen Stacy was killed. During the struggle, they both fall into the river below. Reilly resurfaces with the Goblin&#x27;s mask and the serum and is met by Mary Jane. Reilly discovers that she knows that his true identity is Ben Reilly. Mary Jane thanks Reilly and tells him to find his own identity.

* Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; episode &quot;Nightmare in Green&quot;.
* Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider appears in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994) two-part series finale &quot;Spider-Wars&quot;, voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes. This version is from an alternate reality where Miles Warren created a clone of Peter Parker and altered both his and the original&#x27;s memories. Unsure of whether he was the clone or not, the original changed his name to &quot;Ben Reilly&quot; (even trimming his hair into an easily maintained buzzcut and altering it to blonde) and went by the Scarlet Spider in an attempt to escape the confusion. Despite eventually discovering he was the original from the start and recovering all of his memories, he ultimately chose to remain Ben Reilly and continue his life as the Scarlet Spider. When the clone becomes Spider-Carnage, plots to destroy the multiverse, and nearly succeeds, the Beyonder and Madame Web recruit the Scarlet Spider, the &quot;prime&quot; Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and several of their multiversal doppelgangers to stop Spider-Carnage.
** Additionally, Spider-Carnage appears in &quot;Spider-Wars&quot;, also voiced by Barnes. Hailing from the same alternate reality as the Scarlet Spider, the aforementioned clone went mad with jealousy upon learning of his true status and attempted to kill the Scarlet Spider before the Carnage symbiote emerged from an interdimensional portal, bonded to the clone, and turned him into Spider-Carnage. He plots to destroy the multiverse and nearly succeeds, but the Beyonder and Madame Web work to stop him, as stated above. Eventually, the &quot;prime&quot; Parker finds a living version of Ben Parker who convinces Spider-Carnage to stop, though the clone sacrifices himself to stop Carnage after failing to regain control from the symbiote.
* Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider appears in the fourth season of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Scott Porter. This version sports Kaine Parker&#x27;s facial scar, modern Scarlet Spider costume, and aggressive personality, and is a synthezoid created by Doctor Octopus using Peter Parker&#x27;s DNA who possesses stingers under his arms. Throughout the season, he reluctantly works with the Web Warriors to stop Hydra and Doc Ock while hiding his allegiance with the latter. Additionally, Reilly receives his name from May Parker. Eventually, Reilly is revealed to be a mole within S.H.I.E.L.D. during the Sinister Six&#x27;s attack on the Triskelion, but the Parkers appeal to his better nature, inspiring Reilly to betray his creator and fake his death while defeating the Sinister Six to work alone from the shadows. While investigating his origins however, he resurfaces and joins forces with Spider-Man to battle the imperfect synthezoid Kaine, during which Reilly learns the truth of his synthezoid origins and that he was intended to lead a team of synthezoid Spider-Slayers, which the Web Warriors eventually defeat. Sometime later, he becomes a teacher at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

===Film===
Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider appears in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, voiced by Andy Samberg. This version is a member of Miguel O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Spider-Society who serves as a parody of 1990s comic tropes and makes internal monologues. Director Joaquim Dos Santos confirmed their version of Reilly was &quot;representing an era in comics. That&#x27;s one of the key things with the character is that Ben Reilly was an era when super duper ripped characters were like the norm. Muscles on top of the muscles on top of muscles and being in positions that were not physically possible. And we were just like we really wanted to capture that.&quot;

<text>Ravenna Creek is a stream in the Ravenna and Roosevelt neighborhoods of Seattle, Washington, whose present daylighted length of nearly is entirely within the Ravenna &amp; Cowen Parks.

Ravenna Creek used to drain Green Lake into Lake Washington&#x27;s Union Bay, but urban development and the lowering of the two lakes in 1911 and 1916 resulted in the disappearance of the creekbed between Green Lake and Cowen Park and between Ravenna Park and Union Bay. Ravenna Creek&#x27;s current source is a wetland in the northwest corner of Cowen Park, at NE 62nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue NE. It is also fed by springs throughout Ravenna Park, and is joined there by a second branch which begins near the intersection of NE 65th Street and 23rd Avenue NE. Until 2006, the creek ended at a sewer grate where the park&#x27;s trail system opened into a soccer field.

A daylighting project completed in May 2006 disconnected the creek from the sewer system and extended its bed towards the southeast corner of Ravenna Park, at which point it enters a pipeline. This pipeline, which runs southward along 25th Avenue NE to the NE 45th Street viaduct, empties into University Slough, thereby reconnecting Ravenna Creek to Lake Washington.

In 2008, a major sewage spill of of raw sewage flooded the creek in an accident caused by King County utility crews working nearby.

<text>The following is an overview of the grammar of the [[Slovene language]].

==Common phonological changes==

As in most other Slavic languages, changes to consonants and vowels often occur between related forms of words. Most of these can be traced back to changes that occurred in the ancestral Proto-Slavic language. Over time, many of the original changes have been reversed or levelled out.

===Consonant alternations===

* The Slavic first palatalization causes alternations in the velar consonants k, g and h. It occurs in the present tense of consonant stem verbs, and when certain suffixes (often beginning with &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;) are attached to words.
* The Slavic second palatalization affects the same consonants, but has different results, and occurs most notably in the imperative form of consonant stem verbs.
* Iotation is the effect that the consonant j has on a preceding consonant. It may merge with the preceding consonant, causing effects similar to the first palatalization, or it may cause other changes. However, not all instances of &quot;j&quot; have this effect. This change happens in the present forms of certain verbs in &quot;-ati&quot;.

The following table gives an overview of the above changes:

These changes are very similar to those found in the related Serbo-Croatian language, but Serbo-Croatian &quot;ć&quot; and &quot;đ&quot; correspond to Slovene &quot;č&quot; and &quot;j&quot;.

===Hard and soft stems===

Word stems that end in c, č, š, ž or j are called &quot;soft&quot; stems, while the remainder are &quot;hard&quot;. When endings begin with -o-, this vowel usually becomes -e- after a soft stem; this is called &quot;preglas&quot; in Slovene. This happens in many noun and adjective declensions, and also in some verbs. For example, the instrumental singular form of &quot;korak&quot; &quot;step&quot; is &quot;korakom&quot;, while for &quot;stric&quot; &quot;uncle&quot; it is &quot;stricem&quot;.

There are also some instances where the vowel stays as &quot;o&quot;, such as the accusative singular of feminine nouns. These instances can be traced back to an earlier nasal vowel &quot;ǫ&quot; in Proto-Slavic, which did not undergo this change.

===Fill vowel===

When certain hard-to-pronounce consonant clusters occur word-finally, an additional fill vowel is inserted before the last consonant(s) of the word to break up the cluster. This typically happens where there is no ending, like in the nominative singular, or the genitive dual and plural. The fill vowel is usually a schwa (, spelled &quot;e&quot;). For example, the noun &quot;igra&quot; &quot;game&quot; has the genitive plural form &quot;iger&quot;, not &quot;igr&quot;.

If the last consonant is &quot;j&quot;, then &quot;i&quot; is used as the fill vowel instead. For example, &quot;ladja&quot; &quot;boat&quot; has the genitive plural &quot;ladij&quot;. However, if the stem ends in &quot;lj&quot;, &quot;nj&quot; or &quot;rj&quot;, then the fill vowel is the normal &quot;e&quot; and is inserted before &quot;both&quot; consonants. The noun &quot;ogenj&quot; &quot;fire&quot;, for example, loses the fill vowel in the genitive singular form &quot;ognja&quot;.

There are a few cases where the fill vowel is instead a stressed &quot;a&quot;. These are irregular and must simply be memorized. An example is &quot;ovca&quot; &quot;sheep&quot;, which is &quot;ovac&quot; in the genitive plural, not &quot;ovec&quot;.

==Noun==
Nouns are marked for case and number. There are 6 cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and instrumental) and 3 numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Slovenian nouns are divided into 3 genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Each gender has different declension patterns, for a total of 10 declension forms.

==Adjective==
The adjective expresses three main ideas: quality (qualitative adjectives, &quot;kakovostni pridevniki&quot;), relation (relational adjectives, &quot;vrstni pridevniki&quot;) and possession (possessive adjectives, &quot;svojilni pridevniki&quot;).

Adjectives in Slovenian can serve in three syntactic functions: premodifier (&quot;levi prilastek&quot;), subject complement (&quot;povedkovo določilo&quot;), and predicate modifier (&quot;povedkov prilastek&quot;).
* Premodifier: Kakšno &quot;pričesko&quot; želiš? (What kind of &quot;haircut&quot; would you like?)
: – Želim modno &quot;pričesko&quot;. (I would like a fashionable &quot;haircut&quot;.)
* Subject complement: Kakšna &quot;je&quot; pričeska? (What &quot;is&quot; the haircut like?)
: – Pričeska &quot;je&quot; modna. (The haircut &quot;is&quot; fashionable.)
* Predicate modifier: Kakšna &quot;se je naredila&quot; pričeska? (What kind of haircut &quot;has been made&quot;?)
: – Pričeska &quot;je bila narejena&quot; lepa. (The haircut &quot;has been made&quot; beautiful.)

The majority of adjectives are of the first kind. These express any qualities and properties of personal and impersonal nouns. Such adjectives are gradable either in the two- or three-step comparison, depending if they are relative to another, opposite adjective (three-step) or not (two-step or three-step). (&quot;lep – grd&quot; (beautiful – ugly) vs &quot;bolan&quot; (ill)).

Relational adjectives express type, class or numerical sequence of a noun. For instance: &quot;kemijska in fizikalna sprememba&quot; (chemical and physical change), &quot;fotografski aparat&quot; (photographic device (=camera)).

Possessive pronouns define possession, ownership or belonging. For example: &quot;barvin sijaj&quot; (the colour&#x27;s shine), &quot;Karmenina torbica&quot; (Karmen&#x27;s handbag), &quot;delavska halja&quot; (workers&#x27; overall).

Some adjectives expressing &quot;properties&quot; next to masculine nouns imply definiteness (&#x27;relation&#x27;) or indefiniteness (&#x27;quality&#x27;) of nouns.
For an exactly defined noun or a specific type thereof:
* the adjective in nominative singular has the ending -ni or -i
* the question word is Kateri? (&quot;Which?&quot; (in German &quot;Welcher?&quot;))
For nouns not exactly defined, being mentioned for the first time or generic:
* the adjective in nominative singular has the ending -en or - (no ending)
* the question word is Kakšen? (&quot;What sort of?&quot; (in German &quot;Was für ein?&quot;))
Adjectives ending in &quot;-i&quot; and all possessive pronouns do not have special indefinite forms. There are two special adjectives which have special definite and indefinite forms for all genders and all cases, namely &quot;majhen&quot; (small) and &quot;velik&quot; (big) (the definite forms are &quot;mali&quot; and &quot;veliki&quot; respectively):

* Stari učitelj je to dejal. (The old teacher said this.) – the implication here is that there is at least one other teacher who is not old
* Star učitelj je to dejal. (An old teacher said this.)

The adjective matches the subject or the predicate article to which it is ascribed. If it describes two singular nouns or one dual noun, the adjective should be in the dual. If it describes a plural or one singular and one non-singular noun, the adjective should be in the plural. Although gender should match the group, sometimes the gender of the adjacent noun is used with the appropriate grammatical number. For declension patterns of adjectives, see the section on nouns (the fourth declension is always adjectival). Some adjectives, however, are never declined, for example &quot;bež&quot; (beige), &quot;poceni&quot; (cheap), &quot;roza&quot; (pink), &quot;super&quot; (super), &quot;seksi&quot; (sexy), and some other loanwords.
* Mesto in vas sta &quot;bila&quot; proti predlogu občine. (The city and the village were against the suggestion of the municipality.)
* Mesto in vas sta &quot;bili&quot; proti predlogu občine (the same, but somewhat unusual and seldom heard)
* Ti in tvoji sestri boste precej odšli! (You [masculine since the verb is in masculine] and your two sisters shall leave forthwith.)

Possessive adjectives for masculine and neuter possessed nouns add &quot;-ov&quot; (or &quot;-ev&quot; if the possessive noun ends in &quot;c&quot;, &quot;č&quot;, &quot;ž&quot;, &quot;š&quot; and &quot;j&quot; (&quot;preglas&quot;)) to the possessive noun. Feminine possessed nouns always take &quot;-in&quot;. Possessive nouns can include proper names, in which case they are written capitalized.

Negative adjectives are formed by prefixing the negative &quot;ne-&quot;, which is &quot;almost&quot; always a proper form even though sometimes, a Latin prefix is an alternative.
* lep -&gt; nelep (beautiful, not beautiful (but not ugly (grd))
* reverzibilen -&gt; nereverzibilen (reversible, irreversible)
* moralen -&gt; nemoralen (moral, immoral) (note that &#x27;amoral&#x27; in English has a different meaning)
* legitimen -&gt; nelegitimen (legitimate, illegitimate)

===Comparative===
The &quot;comparative&quot; is formed by adding the ending &quot;-ši&quot; (&quot;-ša&quot;, &quot;-še&quot;), &quot;-ejši&quot; (&quot;-ejša&quot;, &quot;-ejše&quot;) or &quot;-ji&quot; (&quot;-ja&quot;, &quot;-je&quot;) to an adjective, or using the word &quot;bolj&quot; (more) in front of an adjective in case of stressing and also when the adjective in question cannot be formed by adding an ending, such as when dealing with colours, or when the adjective ends in such a sound that it would be difficult to add the appropriate ending:

* lep – lepši (beautiful – more beautiful)
* trd – trši (hard – harder) (-d- falls out)
* zelen – bolj zelen (green – greener)
* zanimiv – zanimivejši (interesting – more interesting)
* transparenten – transparentnejši (transparent – more transparent) (-e- falls out)
* globok – globlji (deep – deeper) (notice the added -l-, -o- and -k- fall out)
* otročji – bolj otročji (childish – more childish)

===Superlative===
The &quot;superlative&quot; is formed by prepending the word &quot;naj&quot; directly in front of the comparative, whether it comprises one or two words.

* lep – lepši – najlepši
* trd – trši – najtrši
* zelen – bolj zelen – najbolj zelen
* zanimiv – zanimivejši – najzanimivejši (but najbolj zanimiv is more common)
* transparenten – transparentnejši – najtransparentnejši
* globok – globlji – najgloblji
* otročji – bolj otročji – najbolj otročji&#x27;

==Verbs==
In Slovenian, verbs are conjugated for 3 persons and 3 numbers (singular, dual, and plural). There are 4 tenses (present, past, pluperfect, and future), 3 moods (indicative, imperative, and conditional) and 2 voices (active and passive). Verbs also have 4 participles and 2 verbal nouns (infinitive and supine). Not all combinations of the above are possible for every case.

==Gerund==
A gerund is a noun formed from a verb, designating an action or a state. The standard substantive in Slovenian ends in &quot;-anje&quot; or &quot;-enje&quot;:

* usklajevati -&gt; usklajevanje (to harmonize -&gt; harmonizing)
* pisati -&gt; pisanje (to write -&gt; writing)
* goreti -&gt; gorenje (to burn -&gt; burning)
* saditi -&gt; sajenje (to plant (into soil, as in potatoes (krompir), maize (koruza) or flowers (rože)) -&gt; planting)
* sejati -&gt; sejanje (to plant (by throwing seeds into the air, as in most any cereal (žito), such as buckwheat (ajda), wheat (pšenica), rice (riž) (but also &#x27;saditi riž&#x27;), millet (proso), etc.) -&gt; planting)

For example:
* Pisanje ni naravno: potrebno se ga je priučiti. (Writing is not natural: it must be learnt.)
* Ob visokih temperaturah gašenje ognja ni enostavno. (At high temperatures, putting out a fire is not trivial.)
* Brenčanje mrčesa me spravlja ob živce! (The buzzing of insects is driving me crazy!)

==Numerals==
==Adverb==
The adverb in Slovene is always the same as the singular neuter form of any given adjective if derived from an adjective.
# &quot;Dan je bil lep.&quot; (The day was nice.) – masculine adjective
# &quot;Bilo je lepo.&quot; (It was nice.) – neuter adjective

—&gt; &quot;Imeli smo se &quot;lepo&quot;.&quot; (literally, &quot;We had ourselves nicely.&quot;, the meaning is &#x27;We had a nice time.&#x27;)

—&gt; &quot;Govorili so &quot;lepo&quot;.&quot; (They spoke nicely.)

Other types of adverb are derived from nouns (doma (at home), jeseni (in autumn)), prepositional constructions (naglas (aloud), pozimi (in winter), potem (then)), verbs (nevede (unknowingly), skrivoma (secretly), mimogrede (by the way)) or numerals (see adverbial numeral).

In essence, there are four main types of adverb: &quot;adverbs of time&quot; (danes (today), večno (perpetually)), &quot;adverbs of place&quot; (domov (towards home, homewards)), &quot;adverbs of manner&quot; (grdo (uglily), povsem (entirely)) and &quot;adverbs of cause and reason&quot; (nalašč (on purpose)).

Adverbs are, much like adjectives, normally gradable.

* To je storil natančno. (This he did carefully.)
** Naslednjič pa še natančneje. (The next time, however, more carefully still.)

==Pronouns==
Pronouns can replace a noun in a sentence; this is, as opposed to, say, an adjective or an adverb.

===Personal pronouns===
A personal pronoun denotes the speaker (&quot;I&quot;), the addressee (&quot;you&quot;) or a third person (&quot;it&quot;). Personal pronouns in Slovene are inflected in a somewhat unusual way, for there are many different forms for each of the pronouns.

Several of the pronouns have unstressed and clitic forms that are unstressed, and may attach to another word. For example:
* &quot;Zanj mi je dal denar.&quot; &quot;He gave me the money for him.&quot; (Note: if the &#x27;he&#x27; was referring to the same person, the reflexive personal pronoun would be used.)
* &quot;Za njega mi je dal denar.&quot; &quot;He gave me the money for him (in particular).&quot;
* &quot;Sledili smo jim.&quot; &quot;We followed them.&quot;
* &quot;Spodbudili smo jih, da naj se pokažejo vredne našega zaupanja, a so nas nesramno zavrnili.&quot; &quot;We encouraged them to prove themselves worthy of our trust, but they rejected us rudely.&quot;
* &quot;Nanjo se je zgrnila ena nesreča za drugo.&quot; &quot;She was struck by one misfortune after another.&quot;
* &quot;Da bi le njim to lahko dopovedali!&quot; &quot;If only we could make them understand this!&quot;
* &quot;Zame ni več rešitve: pugubljena sem.&quot; &quot;For me there is no solution any more: I am doomed.&quot;
* &quot;Pogledal ga je s kancem ironije v očeh.&quot; &quot;He looked at him with a drop of irony in the eyes.&quot;
* &quot;Pogledal je njega.&quot; &quot;He looked at him (in particular).&quot;

The nominative forms of personal pronouns are not used in neutral sentences, only when emphasizing the subject, especially so for the first person singular &quot;jaz&quot; &quot;I&quot;. This is because unlike in English, the form of the verb gives all applicable information such as the gender, grammatical number and person by itself.

* &quot;Jaz mislim drugače.&quot; &quot;I (in particular, or contrasting) think otherwise.&quot;

The reflexive pronoun begins with &quot;s-&quot; and is used to refer back to the subject, or to some other word.

For example:
* &quot;Umivam si roke.&quot; &quot;I am washing my hands.&quot;
* &quot;Umivate si roke.&quot; &quot;You are washing your hands.&quot;
* &quot;Umivam se.&quot; &quot;I am washing myself.&quot;
* &quot;Umivate se.&quot; &quot;You are washing yourselves.&quot;

Similarly as in English, the reflexive pronoun can sometimes be replaced by the reciprocal phrase &quot;drug drugega&quot; &quot;each other, one another&quot;. Thus:
* &quot;Drug drugemu umivata roke.&quot; &quot;The two of them are washing each other&#x27;s hands.&quot;
* &quot;Umivata drug drugega.&quot; &quot;The two of them are washing each other.&quot;

The accusative &quot;se&quot; can bind with prepositional words just like other personal pronouns:
* &quot;Nase je nanesla lepotilno kremo.&quot; &quot;She put beautifying cream on herself.&quot;
* &quot;Ampak ko dela zase, dela učinkovito.&quot; &quot;But when he/she works for him-/herself, he/she works efficiently.&quot;

Other cases and examples:
* &quot;Sebi gradi grobnico.&quot; &quot;He/She is building a tomb for him-/herself.&quot;
* &quot;Gradi si grobnico.&quot; &quot;He/She is building a tomb for him-/herself.&quot; (The emphasis here is not so much on for whom the tomb is, but rather the tomb or the building itself.)
* &quot;S sabo/seboj ni zadovoljna.&quot; &quot;She is not happy with herself.&quot;
* &quot;Najprej počisti pri sebi, potlej šele kritiziraj druge!&quot; &quot;First clean up at yourself, only then criticize others!&quot;
* &quot;Ko je videl odsev sebe v ogledalu, mu je ta pogled povsem pokvaril dan.&quot; &quot;When he saw the reflection of himself in the mirror, this sight completely ruined the day for him.&quot; (Not a widely used construction, this would be more usually expressed with the possessive adjective: &quot;Ko je videl svoj odsev v ogledalu ...&quot;)

===Interrogative pronouns===

The interrogative pronouns introduce direct and indirect questions. There are two nominative forms: &quot;kdo&quot; &quot;who&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot; &quot;what&quot;.

* &quot;Kaj je ta stvar, ki se premika?&quot; &quot;What is this thing that is moving?&quot;
* &quot;Vprašal sem ga, o kom je bil govoril.&quot; &quot;I asked him about whom he had been talking.&quot;
* &quot;Komu naj dam to?&quot; &quot;To whom ought I to give this?&quot;
* &quot;Česa ne smem storiti?&quot; &quot;What may I not do?&quot;

===Relative pronouns===

The substantival relative pronoun is derived from the interrogative by adding &quot;-r&quot;: &quot;kdor&quot; &quot;who, that&quot;, &quot;kar&quot; &quot;which, that&quot;.

* &quot;Kdor krade, ni pošten.&quot; &quot;Someone who steals is not honest.&quot;
* &quot;Kar poveš, tega ne moreš več obvladovati.&quot; &quot;Something that you say, that you cannot control any more.&quot;
* &quot;Odrekli so ji možnost do izbire odvetnika, s čimer je bila kršena njena ustavna pravica.&quot; &quot;They refused her the option of choosing a solicitor, with which her constitutional right was violated.&quot;

===Negative pronouns===

The negative pronoun is derived from the interrogative as well, and starts with &quot;ni-&quot;: &quot;nihče&quot; &quot;nobody, anybody&quot;, &quot;nič&quot; &quot;nothing, anything&quot;.

A negative pronoun demands a negative predicate, resulting in the so-called double negation:

* &quot;Nihče me nikoli ni maral.&quot; &quot;Nobody ever liked me.&quot;
* &quot;Nikjer ni nikogar.&quot; &quot;There is no one anywhere.&quot;
* &quot;Nič ni resnično.&quot; &quot;Nothing is real.&quot;
* &quot;Od nikogar ne želim ničesar.&quot; &quot;I want nothing from no one.&quot; or more freely &quot;I don&#x27;t want anything from anyone.&quot;
* &quot;Nikogaršnja neolikanost ni nikdar in nikjer in na nikakršen način nikomur pridobila nič drugega kot neodobravanje.&quot; &quot;No one&#x27;s impropriety gained ever anyone anywhere and in whatever way anything else than disapproval.&quot;

===Universal pronouns===

The universal pronouns are &quot;vsakdo&quot; &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;vse&quot; &quot;everything, all&quot;.

* &quot;Vsemu so namenjali pozornost.&quot; &quot;They dedicated attention to everything.&quot;
* &quot;Vsakogar bodo vrgli iz službe, če ne bo izpolnjeval zahtev.&quot; &quot;They will sack everyone who will not fulfil requirements.&quot;

&quot;Vsak&quot; &quot;each, every&quot; is an adjective that can function as a pronoun. Also in this category are &quot;vsakateri&quot; and &quot;vsakteri&quot;, both meaning &quot;everyone&quot;, which are old-fashioned and not used in modern language.

===Indefinite pronouns===

The indefinite pronoun is derived from the interrogative, and starts with &quot;ne-&quot;: &quot;nekdo&quot; &quot;someone, anyone&quot;, &quot;nekaj&quot; &quot;something, anything&quot;. It refers to an unknown or deliberately untold person or object. The inflection follows the pattern of &quot;kdo&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot;.

* &quot;Nekoga so videli stati ob oknu, a niso mogli ugotoviti, kdo bi to lahko bil.&quot; &quot;They saw someone standing near the window, but they could not figure out who could have been that.&quot;
* &quot;Zgodilo se je nekaj strašnega!&quot; &quot;Something horrible has happened!&quot;
* &quot;Zataknilo se jima je pri nečem, a nikakor se ne morem spomniti, pri čem.&quot; &quot;They faltered at something, but I cannot in any way remember at what.&quot;
* &quot;Nekdo prihaja. Skrijmo se.&quot; &quot;Someone is coming. Let us hide.&quot;

The interrogatives &quot;kdo&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot;, can also refer to any unspecified person or object, or one that can be chosen at will.

* &quot;Sporoči mi, prosim, če se bo kaj spremenilo.&quot; &quot;Please let me know if anything changes.&quot;
* &quot;Seveda dvomim o čem: kaj to ni normalno?&quot; &quot;Naturally I doubt about something: is this not normal?&quot;
* &quot;Česa podobnega še nisem videl!&quot; &quot;I have never seen anything like that!&quot;
* &quot;Uporabi klorovodikovo kislino ali kaj drugega, da nevtraliziraš to bazo.&quot; &quot;Use hydrochloric acid or something else to neutralize this base.&quot;
* &quot;Denar, ki si ga kdo sposodi, seveda ni njegov, pač pa z njim le upravlja.&quot; &quot;Money that someone borrows is obviously not his; he merely manages it.&quot;
* &quot;Naj stopi kdo vendar do tega DJ-ja in ga nekajkrat lopne po glavi.&quot; &quot;May someone go to this DJ and smack him on the head a few times.&quot;
* &quot;Ojej, kakšne lepe govorice! O tem se res moram s kom pogovoriti.&quot; &quot;Oh dear, what beautiful gossip! I really must talk to someone about this.&quot;

===Relative indefinite pronouns===

The relative indefinite pronouns are &quot;kdorkoli&quot; or &quot;kdor koli&quot; (whoever) and &quot;karkoli&quot; or &quot;kar koli&quot; (whatever). The meaning conveyed is very similar to the unspecified pronoun. The inflexion follows the pattern of the relative pronoun with &quot;-koli&quot; or &quot; koli&quot; appended. The space, as shown, is optional, but for sake of consistency, once one method has been adopted, one should not use the other.

* &quot;Kdorkoli pokliče 112, mora znati povedati, kaj je narobe.&quot; &quot;Whoever rings 112 must know how to say what is wrong.&quot;
* &quot;Kogarkoli poslušam od politikov, vsi govorijo iste neumnosti.&quot; &quot;To whichever of these politicians I listen, they all speak the same stupidities.&quot;
* &quot;Karkoli stori, stori to dobro.&quot; &quot;Whatever he/she does, he/she does it well.&quot;

===Manifold pronouns===

The manifold pronouns are &quot;marsikdo&quot; &quot;many (people)&quot; and &quot;marsikaj&quot; &quot;many (things)&quot;. The inflexion follows the basic pattern of &quot;kdo&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot;. Although these pronouns refer to multiple people or things, they are grammatically singular. In addition to &quot;marsi-&quot;, other prefixes are possible, such as &quot;redko-&quot; (&quot;redkokdo&quot; &quot;rarely anyone&quot;), &quot;mnogo-&quot; (&quot;mnogokdo&quot;, same as &quot;marsikdo&quot;, although perhaps somewhat less usual) and &quot;malo-&quot; (&quot;malokdo&quot; &quot;few (people)&quot;).

* &quot;Marsikdo pravi, da je lepše živeti na deželi, a jaz jim seveda ne verjamem.&quot; &quot;Many people say that it is nicer to live in the countryside, but I of course do not believe them.&quot;
* &quot;Res je, da marsičesa ne vem, pa vendar veš ti še mnogo manj.&quot; &quot;It is true that I do not know many things, but you know far less still.&quot;
* &quot;Z marsičim je že bila obdarjena, a česa takšnega, kar ji je prinesel egiptovski odposlanec, ni bila nikdar poprej še videla.&quot; &quot;Many things she had been gifted, but something like that which the Egyptian emissary brought she had never before seen.&quot;
* &quot;Redkokdo bi priznal, da je storil takšno napako.&quot; &quot;Rarely anyone would admit that he has made such a mistake.&quot;
* &quot;Mnogokaj mi je šlo po glavi, a bolje je, da ne povem, kaj.&quot; &quot;Many things went through my mind, but it is better that I do not say which.&quot;
* &quot;Maločesa se loti, če ve, da se popolnosti pri stvari ne da doseči.&quot; &quot;He attempts to do few things if he knows that perfection cannot be achieved at them.&quot;

==Determiners==
===Possessive determiners===

These all inflect as regular adjectives.

Example sentences:
* &quot;Moj bog pravi drugače!&quot; &quot;My god says otherwise!&quot;
* &quot;Njegove oči so kot kupi koruze na polju.&quot; &quot;His eyes are like heaps of maize on a field.&quot;
* &quot;Letalo je bilo last vojske in njene države.&quot; &quot;The aeroplane was the property of the military and her (the military&#x27;s or another person&#x27;s, depending on the context) country.
* &quot;Vaše kraljevo veličanstvo, klanjam se pred Vami.&quot; &quot;Your royal highness, I bow before You.&quot;
* &quot;Cerkev je njen grob na pokopališču prodala, kajti njeni potomci niso imeli dovolj denarja, da bi plačali pristojbino.&quot; &quot;The church has sold her grave at the graveyard, since her descendants did not have enough money to pay the fee.&quot;
* &quot;S tvojim avtom smo šli: saj ne zameriš, kajne?&quot; &quot;We went with your car: you do not resent (us), do you?&quot;

The reflexive determiner &quot;svoj&quot; is used much as the reflexive pronoun is used, to point back to the subject or another word.

* &quot;Stopam v svojo sobo.&quot; &quot;I am walking into my room.&quot;
* &quot;Kupili so jim lepo darilo; vso svojo domiselnost so vložili v njegovo izbiranje.&quot; &quot;They bought them a beautiful gift; all their ingenuity they have invested into its choosing.&quot;
* &quot;Svojega leva je pustila na dežju.&quot; &quot;She left her lion in the rain.&quot;

The reflexive possessive and &#x27;normal&#x27; possessive pronouns make some ambiguous English sentences perfectly clear in Slovene. The sentence &quot;She has taken her towel into the bathroom&quot; can be translated into the following two ways:

* &quot;Njeno brisačo je vzela v kopalnico.&quot; (the towel she has taken belongs to another person)
* &quot;Svojo brisačo je vzela v kopalnico.&quot; (the towel she has taken is her own)

===Other determiners===
Quantitative adverbial pronouns are non-inflected at all times. All other pronouns are normally inflected.

Examples:
* &quot;Čeprav mi je tisti avtobus bolj všeč, moram na tega, kajti tisti drugi vozi v drugo smer.&quot; &quot;Even though I like that bus more, I have to board this one, for that other one is driving in another direction.&quot;
* &quot;Mnogokakšna želja se mi je že uresničila, vendar mi je marsikatera prinesla tudi kakšne stranske neprijetnosti.&quot; &quot;Many a wish has come true for me, however many (a wish) has brought me some side inconveniences.&quot;
* &quot;Vlak, ki smo ga videli, je pravzaprav tisti, na katerega bi se bili morali usesti.&quot; &quot;The train that we have seen is actually the one onto which we should have boarded.&quot; (literally: sat on)
* &quot;čigav svinčnik je to?&quot; &quot;Whose pencil is this?&quot;
* &quot;Nekakšna radirka je bila nameščena na drugem koncu.&quot; &quot;Some type of rubber was mounted on the other end.&quot;
* &quot;Enak kalkulator imam kot ti.&quot; &quot;I have the same type of calculator as you.&quot;
* &quot;Vzemi mnenje, katerega ne odobravaš, in ga poskusi spremeniti.&quot; &quot;Take an opinion that you do not approve of and try to change it.&quot;
* &quot;Nekoliko pozni ste, a nič ne de.&quot; &quot;You are somewhat late, but that is all right.&quot;
* &quot;Zaradi nekega bedaka mi je vsako letalo ušlo.&quot; &quot;Because of some fool, every aeroplane got away from me. (I missed every plane because of some fool; in the sense that this person has taught me to get to an airport too late or similar, not that all planes have left without me.)
* &quot;Toliko truda za nič učinka.&quot; &quot;So much effort to no avail.&quot;

==Interjection==
An interjection is ordinarily an uninflected word expressing mental states, encouragement towards actions, greetings or mocking of sounds and voices.

* Uf, končno smo na vrhu. (Phew, we&#x27;re finally at the top.)
* Uf, povsem mi je ušlo iz spomina. (Gosh, that has slipped my mind completely.)
* Petelin zapoje &quot;kikiriki&quot;. (A cock sings &quot;cock-a-doodle-doo&quot;.)
* Mojbog, kaj še vedno klamfaš neumnosti? (My god, are you still talking nonsense?)
* Čira čara, in zajec bo izginil. (Hocus-pocus, and the rabbit will disappear.)
* Torej, kaj porečeš na to? (So, what do you say to this?)
* Brr, kako mraz je. (Brr, it&#x27;s so cold.)
* Oj (or Hej), ti človek tam zadaj: kako ti je ime? (Hey, you person back there: What&#x27;s your name?)
* O ne, tako pa se ne govori z menoj. (Oh no, this is not how one speaks to me.)
* &quot;No&quot;, pa &quot;adijo&quot;! (&quot;Well&quot;, then &quot;goodbye&quot;!)
* Ne bev ne mev niso rekli. (They didn&#x27;t say anything.)
* Šššš: bo že bolje. (Shhh, it will get better.)

Interjections may be inflected; however, in spite of the words&#x27; being the same, such use calls for a different word class (part of speech), this most frequently being nouns. 
* &quot;Ufov in ojojev se izogibajte, kajti bolnik je zelo ubog revež s to obrazno hibo.&quot; (Steer clear of &#x27;uf&#x27;s and &#x27;ojoj&#x27;s, because the patient suffers a lot with this facial deformity.)

==Syntax==
===Case use===
The nominative case defines a subject of a sentence; all other cases define an object as either direct or indirect.

===Use of number===
There are four types of inflexion related to the grammatical number in Slovene. The future tense is here used to demonstrate its usage. The future tense is formed with the verb to be in the future tense plus the l-participle of the full lexical verb. For example, a table of the English expression &quot;I will see&quot; (&quot;Jaz bom videl&quot;) with gender for he (&quot;on&quot;) and she (&quot;ona&quot;) without it (&quot;ono&quot;) can be written as:

can be translated into Slovene as:

Slovene has singular and plural but also has the rare dual grammatical number, a separate form of every noun used when there are only two such items (except for natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, for which the plural is used). Dual grammatical number, when an ambiguity between dual and plural forms exists, can be rendered into other languages in various ways; comparatively often, there is no ambiguity, and the dual is extraneous. (This explains the relatively early disappearance of the dual in most languages). Dual grammatical number was a feature of the Proto-Slavic language which has been retained by Slovene. An example of dual grammatical number would be &quot;onadva sta&quot; (&quot;The two are&quot;), which refers to two objects or subjects in the masculine gender or &quot;onidve sta&quot; (&quot;The two are&quot;), which refers to the same concept but in the feminine gender. However &quot;oni so&quot; (&quot;They are &quot;) refers to more than two objects or subjects in the masculine gender while &quot;one so&quot; (&quot;They are&quot;) does the same the feminine gender. Dual grammatical number is also preserved in gender. The dual is used consistently in Slovene.
:Bil je lep jesenski dan. Odšla sva v park. Usedla sva se na klopco in se pogovarjala. Lepo nama je bilo.
::It was a nice autumn day. We (the two of us) went to the park. We (the two of us still) sat down on a bench and talked. We had a nice time.

:Bil je lep jesenski dan. Odšli smo v park. Usedli smo se na klopco in se pogovarjali. Lepo nam je bilo.
::It was a nice autumn day. We went to the park. We sat down on a bench and talked. We had a nice time.

The first phrase sounds much more romantic and intimate to a Slovene, a style that is impossible to translate into English, which lacks the dual grammatical number.

===Sentence===
====Constituents====
In a sentence, there can be only four types of constituent, the order of which is seldom crucial:
: subject (osebek) + predicate (povedek) + object (predmet) + adverbial phrase (prislovno določilo).

By changing the order, the stressed part changes. It may also serve to create poetic sentiment, common in poetry.

====Free sentence====
: &quot;Včeraj sem šel domov.&quot; (&quot;I went home yesterday.&quot;) (or: &quot;Yesterday I went home.&quot;)
: &quot;Danes prihajam domov.&quot; (&quot;I am coming home today.&quot;)
: &quot;Jutri bom šel od doma.&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll leave home tomorrow.&quot;)

====Compound sentence====
: &quot;Res me veseli, da si prišel.&quot; (&quot;I am really glad you came.&quot;)
: &quot;Da – tako je bilo, kakor praviš!&quot; (&quot;Yes – it was as you say!&quot;)

====Incomplete sentence====
This is a sentence with no predicate.

: &quot;Rana ura, zlata ura.&quot; (&quot;Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise&quot;; &quot;The early bird catches the worm&quot; (literally &quot;Early hour, golden hour&quot;))

====Inserted sentence====
: &quot;V tistih časih – bil sem še mlad in sem od sveta veliko pričakoval – sem lepega večera srečal starega berača in ...&quot; (&quot;In those times – I was still young and I expected a lot from the world – I met an old beggar one fair evening and ...&quot;)

====Accompanying sentence and direct speech====
: &quot;Dobro jutro,&quot; je rekla Lojza. (&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Aloysine.)
: Lojza je rekla: &quot;Dobro jutro.&quot; (Aloysine said, &quot;Good morning.&quot;)
: – Dobro jutro. (&quot;Good morning.&quot;)

See also the section on inverted commas.

==Punctuation==
Punctuation marks are one or two part graphical marks used in writing, denoting tonal progress, pauses, sentence type (syntactic use), abbreviations, et cetera.

Marks used in Slovene include full stops (.), question marks (?), exclamation marks (!), commas (,), semicolons (;), colons (:), dashes (–), hyphens (-), ellipses (...), different types of inverted commas and quotation marks (&quot;&quot;, &quot;, ‚‘, „“, »«), brackets ((), [], {}) (which are in syntactical use), as well as apostrophes (&#x27;,’), solidi (/), equal signs (=), and so forth.

<text>Baron Wynford, of Wynford Eagle in the County of Dorset, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1829 for the politician and lawyer Sir William Best. He served as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1824 to 1829. His eldest son, the second Baron, represented Mitchell (also known as St Michael&#x27;s) in the House of Commons from 1831 to 1832, when the constituency was abolished. On the death of his younger son, the fourth Baron, this line of the family failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the son of Reverend the Hon. Samuel Best, third son of the first Baron. the title is held by his great-grandson, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2002.

<text>Longfellow Creek is a stream in the Delridge district of West Seattle, in Seattle, Washington. It runs about 3.38 miles (5.4 km) from Roxhill Park north to the Duwamish West Waterway at Elliott Bay. The Duwamish called the creek &quot;Smelt&quot; (Lushootseed: tuʔawi), denoting smelt fish (&quot;Hypomesus pretiosus&quot;). The creek was a traditional fishery dating back to the 14th century.

Longfellow Creek&#x27;s watershed is one of the four largest in urban Seattle, 2,685 acres (1,087 ha). It flows north from the Roxhill Park neighborhood for several miles along the valley of the Delridge neighborhoods of West Seattle, turning east to reach the Duwamish Waterway via a 3,300 ft (1006 m) pipe beneath the Nucor plant (formerly Bethlehem Steel).

Salmon, absent for 60 years, began returning without intervention as soon as toxic input was ended and barriers were removed. Construction of a fish ladder at the north end of the West Seattle Golf Course will allow spawning salmon up along the fairways. Farther upstream the city has been enlarging and building more storm-detention ponds, recreation areas, and an outdoor-education center at Camp Long.

The creek emerges at the 10,000-year-old Roxhill Bog, south of the Westwood Village shopping center. Three acres of open upland, wetland and wooded space just east of Chief Sealth High School in Westwood is the first daylight of Longfellow Creek.

It has seen some plant and tree restoration since 1997. After more than a decade of preparation by hundreds of neighborhood volunteers, a restoration and 4.2-mile (6.7-km) trail was completed in 2004. Invasive vegetation is decreasing as native species retake hold. Blue herons and coyotes can be seen.

<doc id="505013" wikidata="Q45310" url="?curid=505013" title="Saffarid dynasty">
<text>The Saffarid dynasty () was a Persianate dynasty of eastern Iranian origin that ruled over parts of Persia, Greater Khorasan, and eastern Makran from 861 to 1002. One of the first indigenous Persian dynasties to emerge after the Islamic conquest, the Saffarid dynasty was part of the Iranian Intermezzo. The dynasty&#x27;s founder was Ya&#x27;qub bin Laith as-Saffar, who was born in 840 in a small town called Karnin (Qarnin), which was located east of Zaranj and west of Bost, in what is now Afghanistan. A native of Sistan and a local &quot;ayyār&quot;, Ya&#x27;qub worked as a coppersmith (&quot;ṣaffār&quot;) before becoming a warlord. He seized control of the Sistan region and began conquering most of Iran and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

The Saffarids used their capital Zaranj as a base for an aggressive expansion eastward and westward. They first invaded the areas south of the Hindu Kush, and then overthrew the Tahirid dynasty, annexing Khorasan in 873. By the time of Ya&#x27;qub&#x27;s death, he had conquered the Kabul Valley, Sindh, Tocharistan, Makran (Balochistan), Kerman, Fars, Khorasan, and nearly reached Baghdad but then suffered a defeat by the Abbasids.

The Saffarid dynasty did not last long after Ya&#x27;qub&#x27;s death. His brother and successor, Amr bin Laith, was defeated at the Battle of Balkh against Ismail Samani in 900. Amr bin Laith was forced to surrender most of his territories to the new rulers. The Saffarids were confined to their heartland of Sistan, and with time, their role was reduced to that of vassals of the Samanids and their successors.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The dynasty began with Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar (Ya&#x27;qub, son of Layth, the Coppersmith), a coppersmith of eastern Iranian origins, who moved to the city of Zaranj. He left work to become an Ayyar and eventually got the power to act as an independent ruler. From his capital Zaranj he moved east into al-Rukhkhadj (Arachosia), Zamindawar and ultimately Kabul, vanquishing the Zunbils and the Hindu Shahis by 865. He then invaded Bamyan, Balkh, Badghis, and Ghor. In the name of Islam, he conquered these territories which were predominantly ruled by Buddhist tribal chiefs. He took vast amounts of plunder and slaves from this campaign.

=== Expansion ===

The Tahirid city of Herat was captured in 870, and Ya&#x27;qub&#x27;s campaign in the Badghis region led to the capture of Kharidjites which later formed the &quot;Djash al-Shurat&quot; contingent in his army. Ya&#x27;qub then turned his focus to the west and began attacks on Khorasan, Khuzestan, Kerman (Southeastern Iran) and Fars (southwestern Iran). The Saffarids then seized Khuzestan (southwestern Iran) and parts of southern Iraq, and in 876 came close to overthrowing the Abbasids, whose army was able to turn them back only within a few days&#x27; march from Baghdad. From silver mines in the Panjshir Valley, the Saffarids were able to mint silver coins.

These incursions, however, forced the Abbasid caliphate to recognize Ya&#x27;qub as governor of Sistan, Fars and Kerman, and Saffarids were even offered key posts in Baghdad. Despite Ya&#x27;qub&#x27;s military successes, he was not an empire builder since he had no concept of a centralized government.

=== Decline ===
In 901, Amr Saffari was defeated at the battle of Balkh by the Samanids, and they lost Khorasan to them. The Saffarids were reduced to the provinces of Fars, Kerman and Sistan. Under Tahir ibn Muhammad ibn Amr (901–908), the dynasty fought the Abbasids for the possession of Fars to maintain its control over the province. However, in 908, a civil war erupted between Tahir and the pretender al-Laith b. &#x27;Ali in Sistan. In the next years, the governor of Fars, Sebük-eri defected to the Abbasids. In 912, the Samanids finally expelled the Saffarids from Sistan. Sistan passed briefly to Abbasid control, but became independent again under the Saffarid Abu Ja&#x27;far Ahmad ibn Muhammad; but now the dynasty was a minor power isolated in Sistan.

In 1002, Mahmud of Ghazni invaded Sistan, dethroned Khalaf I and finally ended the Saffarid dynasty.

==Culture==
The Saffarids patronized the Persian language in the form of court poetry and established Persianate culture. Under their rule, the eastern Islamic world witnessed the emergence of prominent Persian poets such as Fayrouz Mashriqi, Abu Salik al-Jirjani, and Muhammad ibn Wasif, who was a court poet.

In the later 9th century, the Saffarids gave impetus to a renaissance of New Persian literature and culture. Following Ya&#x27;qub&#x27;s conquest of Herat, some poets chose to celebrate his victory in Arabic, whereupon Ya&#x27;qub requested his secretary, Muhammad bin Wasif al-Sistani, to compose those verses in Persian.

==Religion==
The religion of the Saffarid&#x27;s founder, Ya&#x27;qub, has been a topic of debate. Most of the primary sources were written during or after the fall of the Samanid dynasty and view the Saffarids through Samanid eyes. These primary sources depict Ya&#x27;qub either as a religious rascal or a volunteer Sunni warrior – a &quot;mutatawwi&quot;. The Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk, obsessed with the integrity of the Seljuk Empire, depicts Ya&#x27;qub as an Ismaili convert.

According to C.E. Bosworth, early Saffarid emirs did not appear to have significant religious beliefs. Since Kharijism prospered in Sistan longer than anywhere else in eastern Iran, it was believed the Saffarids held Kharijite sympathies. Archeologist Barry Cunliffe, states the Saffarids were Shia Muslim.

<text>Penn State Dickinson Law, formerly Dickinson School of Law, is a public law school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. It is one of two separately accredited law schools of Pennsylvania State University.

==History==
The Law School offers J.D. and LL.M. degrees in law and hosts visiting scholars. The Law School was opened by Judge John Reed in 1834 as the law department of Dickinson College, named for Founding Father John Dickinson. It received an independent charter in 1890 and ended all affiliation with the college in 1917.

In 2000, Penn State and The Dickinson School of Law completed a merger that began in 1997. From 2006 until 2014, Penn State&#x27;s Dickinson School of Law operated as a single law school with two campuses – one in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and one in University Park, Pennsylvania. In the summer of 2014, Penn State received approval from the ABA to operate the two campuses as two distinct law schools (now known as Penn State Law and Dickinson Law), both of which share the history and achievement of The Dickinson School of Law.

In November 2022, Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi announced a task force to implement the recommendation that the two schools be merged into a single entity, with the primary location to be at the Carlisle campus.

==Lewis Katz Hall==
Lewis Katz Hall is named in honor of philanthropist and businessman Lewis Katz for his $15 million gift to the Law School as the principal donor to the construction and renovation project that began in January 2008. Completed in January 2010, the transition marked the end of a two-year, $52 million construction project which included the addition of the elegant, new Lewis Katz Hall which leverages advanced high-definition, digital audiovisual telecommunications systems to connect Dickinson Law to not only Penn State&#x27;s University Park campus but to locations around the world.

The project included an extensive renovation of historic Trickett Hall, the Law School&#x27;s home since 1918, which houses the Law School&#x27;s library, named in honor of H. Laddie Montague, Jr., a prominent Philadelphia lawyer and trial attorney who has committed $4 million to the school. As a design companion to Penn State Law&#x27;s Lewis Katz Building, Dickinson Law&#x27;s Lewis Katz Hall was renovated and rebuilt to comply with LEED Silver standards. The facilities feature classrooms, a courtroom/auditorium, an exterior courtyard, and a vegetated green roof.

==Curriculum==
Dickinson Law&#x27;s required 1L curriculum begins with the fundamentals of national and transnational law. During their first year, students must complete courses including Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, Contracts, Criminal Law, Property, legal writing, and Torts.

At Dickinson Law, students must earn at least six of 12 required experiential learning credits in a real-world practice setting, such as a certified legal internship within one of the Law School&#x27;s in-house legal clinics; an internship with a government, nonprofit or private office; or full immersion in the Semester-in-Practice program; or an international venue. The second and third years at Dickinson Law are distinguished by &quot;The Lawyer As...&quot;: electives and experiential learning opportunities organized by the way lawyers use their training. Required courses after completion of the first year include Problem Solving III: The Lawyer as Persuader and Practicing Law in a Global World: Context and Competencies II.

Students may earn up to six credits towards the J.D. degree from approved graduate-level courses offered by other Penn State departments. Students also may enroll in one of an array of joint degree programs, graduating with both a J.D. from Dickinson Law and a master&#x27;s degree from a coordinate department of Penn State. Current joint degree offerings include a J.D./M.B.A., J.D./M.P.A., J.D./M.P.H., J.D./DRPH. Dickinson Law also offers certificate programs in which students may hone their expertise in a specific area by taking a prescribed combination of core and elective courses. Current certificate offerings include Corporate Compliance Certificate, Cyber, Privacy, and Data Security Certificate, Government Affairs, Health Law and Policy, and Litigation and Dispute Resolution.

<text>Baron Wrottesley, of Wrottesley in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 11 July 1838 for Sir John Wrottesley, 9th Baronet. He was a Major-General in the Army and also represented Lichfield, Staffordshire and Staffordshire South in House of Commons. The Wrottesley family&#x27;s original patronymic was &#x27;de Verdun&#x27; (otherwise &#x27;de Verdon&#x27;), which meant that the creation of the title Baron Wrottesley represented the third barony created by a branch of the de Verdun family in England. The other two were established by Theobald de Verdun, 1st Baron Verdun of Alton Castle and Sir John de Verdon, 1st Baron Verdon, lord of Brixworth in Northamptonshire and Bressingham in Norfolk.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was President of the Royal Astronomical Society as well as of the Royal Society. His son, the third Baron, held junior positions in the first two Liberal administrations of William Ewart Gladstone. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron. On his death in 1962 the titles passed to his nephew, the fifth Baron who was the only son of the Hon. Walter Bennet Wrottesley, youngest son of the third Baron. In 1941 he married into the Noble House of Stratford, from which all subsequent Barons Wrottesley descend, and in 1963 he sold the Staffordshire estate. the titles are held by the fifth Baron&#x27;s grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded in 1977. He is the only son of the Hon. Richard Francis Gerard Wrottesley, second son of the fifth Baron.

The Wrottesley Baronetcy, of Wrottesley in the County of Stafford, was created in the Baronetage of England on 30 August 1642 for Walter Wrottesley. He fought on the Royalist side in the Civil War. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, briefly represented Staffordshire in the House of Commons. His younger son, the seventh Baronet (who had succeeded his elder brother, who in his turn had succeeded his elder brother), sat as a Member of Parliament for Tavistock but later took Holy Orders and served as Dean of Worcester. His son, the eighth Baronet, represented Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Baronet, who was raised to the peerage in 1838.

The family seat was Wrottesley Hall near Wolverhampton, Staffordshire. Several of the Baronets served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire.

<doc id="505029" wikidata="Q3085210" url="?curid=505029" title="Hypermodernity">
<text>Hypermodernity (or supermodernity) is a type, mode, or stage of society that reflects an inversion of modernity. Hypermodernism stipulates a world in which the object has been replaced by its own attributes. The new attribute-driven world is driven by the rise of technology and aspires to a convergence between technology and biology and more importantly information and matter. Hypermodernism finds its validation in emphasis on the value of new technology to overcome natural limitations. It rejects essentialism and instead favours postmodernism. In hypermodernism the function of an object has its reference point in the form of an object rather than function being the reference point for form. In other words, it describes an epoch in which teleological meaning is reversed from the standpoint of functionalism in favor of constructivism.

==Hypermodernity==
Hypermodernity emphasizes a hyperbolic separation between past and present because:
* The past oriented attributes and their functions around objects. 
* Objects that do exist in the present are only extant due to some useful attribute in the hypermodern era.

Hypermodernity inverts modernity to allow the attributes of an object to provide even more individuality than modernism. Modernity trapped form within the bounds of limited function; hypermodernity posits that function is now evolving so rapidly, it must take its reference point from form itself. Both positive and negative societal changes occur due to hyper-individualism and increased personal choice.

Postmodernity rejected the idea of the past as a reference point and curated objects from the past for the sole purpose of freeing form from function. In postmodernism, truth was ephemeral as the focus was to avoid non-falsifiable tenets. Postmodernity described a total collapse of modernity and its faith in progress and improvement in empowering the individual.

==Supermodernity==
If distinguished from hypermodernity, &quot;supermodernity&quot; is a step beyond the ontological emptiness of postmodernism and relies upon plausible heuristic truths. Whereas modernism focused upon the creation of great truths (or what Lyotard called &quot;master narratives&quot; or &quot;metanarratives&quot;), and postmodernity was intent upon their destruction (deconstruction); supermodernity operates extraneously of meta-truth. Instead, attributes are extracted from objects of the past based on their present relevance. Since attributes are both true and false, a truth value is not necessary including falsifiability. Supermodernity curates useful attributes from modern and postmodern objects in order to escape nihilistic postmodern tautology. Related authors are Terry Eagleton &quot;After Theory&quot;, and Marc Augé &quot;Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity&quot;.

<text>Robert Hyland, Jr. (1920–1992) was CBS regional vice president and general manager of radio station KMOX in St. Louis, Missouri for four decades.

==Personal life==
He was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1920. He attended both St. Louis University High School and Saint Louis University. Before going into radio he embraced the idea of becoming a professional baseball player and even an actor, but these ideas were shot down by his father or other reasons. Hyland was the son of the longtime Cardinals team physician, Robert F. Hyland.

==Contributions/Career==
Hyland emphasized and leveraged KMOX&#x27;s relationship with the St. Louis Cardinals; he also made the decision in 1960 to eliminate the station&#x27;s afternoon music programming in favor of talk radio, a critical change which led to the station&#x27;s subsequent dominance of the St. Louis radio market. He also introduced the first listener call-in programs at KMOX in 1960.

Hyland was very much involved in civic ventures. He founded the drug and alcohol treatment center at St. Anthony&#x27;s Hospital (St. Anthony&#x27;s Medical Center), which was named after his father. He served on the boards of the St. Louis Zoo, the St. Louis Symphony, and the Municipal Opera, and received many honorary degrees and awards. In 1988 he was chosen as the St. Louis Man of the Year. [Final Resting Place, p. 145]

Hyland was the man who brought the Big Red Line Cheerleaders to the St Louis Football Cardinals Organization.

==Death==
Hyland died in 1992 due to cancer.

In Marvel comics, he is proficient in weaponry ranging from firearms to swords, and a master of martial arts. While originally depicted as a human immune to vampire bites, Blade was retroactively established to be a dhampir following his adaptation as such in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; film series. He is the father of Brielle &quot;Bri&quot; Brooks (Bloodline).

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including films, television series, video games, and his own animated series. Blade was portrayed by Wesley Snipes in the films &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;Blade II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, and by Sticky Fingaz in the television series &quot;&quot;. Mahershala Ali has been cast as the character in the MCU media franchise, debuting with an uncredited vocal cameo in the film &quot;Eternals&quot; (2021) ahead of the character&#x27;s upcoming standalone film.

==Publication history==
Blade was introduced as a supporting character in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #10 (July 1973), written by Marv Wolfman and penciled by Gene Colan. The artist recalled in 2003, &quot;Marv told me Blade was a black man, and we talked about how he should dress, and how he should look – very heroic looking. That was my input. [...] The bandolier of blades – that was Marv&#x27;s idea. But, I dressed him up. I put the leather jacket on him and so on&quot;. Colan based the character&#x27;s features on &quot;a composite of black actors&quot; including NFL football star-turned-actor Jim Brown. He initially sported 1970s-style Afro hair and wielded teak-bladed knives. Blade appeared in issues #10–21, with frequent appearances until #61 in 1977.

Wolfman spoke on the character&#x27;s inception during an interview:

Wolfman recalled in 2009,
Outside &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, he fought the scientifically-created vampire Morbius the Living Vampire in the latter&#x27;s series in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #24 (Oct. 1974), in a story written by Steve Gerber and penciled by P. Craig Russell.

Blade&#x27;s first solo story came in Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazine &quot;Vampire Tales&quot; #8 (Dec. 1974), in an 11-page story by Wolfman and penciller-inker Tony DeZuniga. This feature continued in issue #9 (Feb. 1975), with Wolfman and Chris Claremont co-scripting. This story was concluded in a 56-page solo story in the black-and-white showcase magazine &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #3 (Sept. 1975), written by Claremont, with two chapters each drawn by DeZuniga and by Rico Rival (this story was announced for &quot;Vampire Tales&quot; #12, but was published here after that magazine was cancelled). A six-page backup story by Wolfman and Colan followed in &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #8 (Fall 1976).

Blade next came into prominence in the 1990s, beginning with &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; #28 (Aug. 1992), in the Midnight Sons imprint that included issues of &quot;Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider/Blaze: Spirits of Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Midnight Sons Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Morbius&quot;, and &quot;Nightstalkers&quot;. Blade co-starred in the 18-issue series &quot;Nightstalkers&quot;, and appeared with that team in a story in the anthology issue &quot;Midnight Sons Unlimited&quot; #1 (April 1993). He appeared in two solo stories, in &quot;Midnight Sons Unlimited&quot; #2 and 7 (July 1993 and Oct. 1994).

Following the cancellation of &quot;Nightstalkers&quot;, Blade debuted in his first color-comics series, &quot;Blade the Vampire Hunter&quot; #1–10 (July 1994 – April 1995), written by Ian Edginton (with the last two issues by Terry Kavanagh) and penciled by Doug Wheatley. Blade next appeared in a 12-page inventory story in issue #1 (Feb. 1997) of the short-lived black-and-white anthology series &quot;Marvel: Shadows and Light&quot;. He then starred again in two solo one-shots: &quot;Blade: Crescent City Blues&quot; #1 (March 1998), by writer Christopher Golden and penciller and co-creator Colan; and &quot;Blade: Sins of the Father&quot; #1 (Oct. 1998), by writer Marc Andreyko and penciller Bart Sears.

Marvel next announced a six-issue miniseries, &quot;Blade&quot; (storyline: &quot;Blade: Blood Allies&quot;) by the writer Don McGregor and penciller Brian Hagen, but only issues #1–3 (Nov. 1998–Jan. 1999) were published. Marvel published a different six-issue miniseries later that year, &quot;Blade: Vampire Hunter&quot; (storyline: &quot;Chaos (A)&quot;; Dec. 1999 – May 2000), written and, except the last two issues, pencilled by Bart Sears.
The next ongoing series, &quot;Blade&quot; vol. 2 by writer Christopher Hinz and artist Steve Pugh, ran six issues, published by Marvel MAX in 2002. &quot;Blade&quot; vol. 3 by the writer Marc Guggenheim and penciller-inker Howard Chaykin, ran 12 issues (Sept. 2006–Aug. 2007). The final two pages of the last issue were drawn by co-creator Colan.

Blade also starred in two promotional comic books: &quot;Blade&quot; # (1999) by writer-artist Sears and inker Bill Sienkiewicz, bundled with issues of &quot;Wizard: The Comic Magazine&quot; #2000; and &quot;Blade: Nightstalking&quot; (2005), a 22-page story by writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray and penciller Amanda Conner, based on New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;Blade&quot; films, and bundled with the &quot;Blade: Trinity Deluxe Edition&quot; DVD. Additionally, the second &quot;Blade&quot; movie was adapted as the Marvel comic &quot;Blade 2: Bloodhunt — The Official Comic Adaptation&quot; (April 2002) by writers Steve Gerber and David S. Goyer and penciller-inker Alberto Ponticelli.

Blade joined the cast of &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13&quot; beginning with issue #5 (Nov. 2008).

In 2015, it was announced that Tim Seeley and Logan Faerber would be launching a new &quot;Blade&quot; series, starting in October 2015, as part of Marvel&#x27;s post-&quot;Secret Wars&quot; relaunch, focusing on his and daughter Fallon Grey. However, this title has since been abandoned, in favor of &quot;Bloodline: Daughter of Blade&quot;, following his and Safron Caulder&#x27;s daughter Brielle &quot;Bri&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and career===

Eric Cross Brooks was born in a brothel in the Soho neighborhood of London, England, on October 24, 1929. His mother was Tara Vanessa Cross-Brooks, an heiress seeking sanctuary with Madame Vanity, an agent of the Order of Tyrana. When Tara experienced severe labor complications, a doctor was called; in actuality, the doctor was the vampire Deacon Frost, who killed Tara by drinking all of her blood. However, this inadvertently passed along certain vampire enzymes to her baby son as he was born. Eric thus became part-vampire, preventing him from being turned by a vampire&#x27;s bite. Blade has also speculated that it gave him a hatred of vampires, though this may simply be hyperbole on his part. The brothel&#x27;s sex workers drove off Frost once they realized what he had done.

Due to his father Lucas Cross being falsely imprisoned in his native Latveria, Eric was raised in the brothel, believing his mother to have been an employee there, and at age 9, returning home from school one day, he saw an old man being attacked by three vampires. Eric helped the man, Jamal Afari, distract his attackers so that he could kill them with a silver sword. Afari, posing as a jazz musician, soon became a father figure to Eric, teaching him music and training him in the ways of fighting vampires. Eric was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance. Over time, the young man became an Olympic-level athlete and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant; his skill with knives and daggers was such that it earned him the nickname &quot;Blade&quot; among both his fellow hunters and the vampires they opposed, who began to fear him. After the death of Hannibal King and Frank Drake, he once used the alias &quot;Frank Blade&quot; with his landlady, which he claimed was short for &quot;Hannibal Francis Blade&quot;. In Earth-1610, Blade also received additional training from the legendary Stick.

Blade&#x27;s easy victories made him cocky. He joined a gang of young hunters, the Bloodshadows, headed by Cyrus Cutter, later killed by Blade in a knife fight caused by Blade&#x27;s disapproval of Cutter&#x27;s actions as leader. Glory Anah, Cutter&#x27;s girlfriend, became Blade&#x27;s first lover. Having gone to London, where for months the group hunted vampires, demons, and warlocks under Blade&#x27;s leadership, the group encountered a much older and more powerful vampire than any Blade had met before, named Lamia. Blade barely defeated Lamia, who slaughtered the other Bloodshadows and bit Glory, turning her into a vampire. Although Glory subsequently refused to kill Blade, she warned him never to look for her or she would kill him. The tragedy of the experience changed Blade considerably, as he became much more focused and determined in his hunting.

Afari himself later fell prey to Dracula, the first occurrence in an ongoing feud between the vampire lord and Blade. Blade mercy-killed his mentor after Afari rose as a vampire, and tracked Dracula back to Europe, Asia, and Asia Minor, staking him many times, but never completely destroying him. While in China, Blade joined Ogun Strong&#x27;s vampire hunters, which included Azu, Orji, and Musenda. Together, they staked Dracula again. Dracula survived, and killed all of the hunters except Blade and Musenda, who eventually retired from vampire hunting. Orji had created a lasting impression on Blade with his use of wooden daggers to combat vampires, leading to Blade adopting that weapon as his preferred arms. Consumed by grief for his fallen comrades, Blade resumed his quest alone.

===Quincy Harker&#x27;s vampire hunters===
Blade eventually located Dracula in Paris, where he first encountered the vampire hunter Quincy Harker, son of Jonathan Harker, who he knew by reputation, and Harker&#x27;s fellow vampire hunters: Rachel van Helsing, great-granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing; Taj Nital; and Frank Drake, last mortal descendant of Dracula. Because of his mercurial temperament, Blade had a strained but steady relationship with the group, allying himself with them on several occasions but always parting ways with them in the end.

Later, after an unsuccessful battle with Dracula, Blade realized he was immune to the vampire&#x27;s curse that had felled many other hunters. Armed with this knowledge, he parted company with Harker and went after Deacon Frost alone. Blade later battled Dracula in London, as well as Morbius the Living Vampire, and the Legion of the Damned, who unsuccessfully framed him for murder. Blade also destroyed a band of vampire children without hesitation.

Blade&#x27;s hunt for his mother&#x27;s killer led him to Boston, Massachusetts, where he allied with Dracula against Doctor Sun. Following this battle, Dracula vanished and Blade again set out on his own.

He eventually encountered Hannibal King, a private detective whom Deacon Frost had turned into a vampire. While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to hunt Frost. Blade and King fought together against Blade&#x27;s evil doppelgänger who absorbed the real Blade into his form. King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the Son of Satan, who exorcised Blade from the doppelgänger and killed it with King&#x27;s help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost, who had created an army of vampiric doppelgängers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, destroying the vampire, and forging a lasting friendship.

Blade, Rachel van Helsing, and Harold H. Harold later confronted Dracula. Later, Blade returned to China and honored the memory of his former allies by saving Musenda&#x27;s wife from being turned into a vampire.

===The Nightstalkers===

In later years, Blade, along with King and Drake, became a frequent ally of the Doctor Strange, and the three assisted Strange in battles with Dracula and the Darkholders and assisted in the casting of the Montesi Formula which, for a time, destroyed all vampires on Earth. Blade, King, and Drake then formed the private detective agency Borderline Investigations, Inc. to combat supernatural threats. Alongside Doctor Strange, the three detectives battled the Darkholders again. Blade also rescued his close friend Safron Caulder from the Darkholders.

The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected Dracula. Doctor Strange later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline Investigations, Inc. as the Nightstalkers. Blade, King, and Drake were hired by Lilith the Mother of All Demons to kill the second Ghost Rider and the non-infernally powered John Blaze. The three Nightstalkers battled Meatmarket. The Nightstalkers then teamed with the Ghost Rider, Blaze, Morbius, Doctor Strange, and the Darkhold Redeemers to battle Lilith and her Lilin. The Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as HYDRA&#x27;s DOA.

Upon the eventual weakening of the Montesi Formula and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former ally, the now-vampiric Taj Nital, and survived a battle with the first Lord of Vampires, Varnae, in which Drake and King appeared to have been killed.

===The Daywalker===
A solo vampire-hunter once again, Blade briefly joined forces with the mystic Bible John Carik, and encountered a vampire impersonating Deacon Frost and a once-again resurrected Dracula. Later, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Blade discovered that Hannibal King had survived, and the two joined forces to defeat a genuinely resurrected Frost. Blade remained active in New Orleans, defeating the vampire Ulysses Sojourner and his own former ally, Morbius, who was under Sojourner&#x27;s mental thrall. Blade followed Morbius to New York, where, while teamed with Spider-Man, Blade was bitten by Morbius. Blade&#x27;s blood enzymes reacted unexpectedly with Morbius&#x27;s unique form of vampirism to grant Blade many vampire strengths, while eliminating weaknesses inherent to a true vampire, most notably the vulnerability to sunlight. It was at this time that Blade assumed the unofficial title of &quot;the Daywalker&quot; among his prey.

The United Nations-sanctioned espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. sought to use Blade&#x27;s blood for Project: Silvereye, an attempt at cloning vampire operatives. Blade and the vampire-hunting twins Mosha and Mikado shut down the project. Blade later joined Noah van Helsing, actually Noah Tremayne, Rachel van Helsing&#x27;s adopted cousin, and several vampire hunters worldwide to stop Dracula from becoming a genuinely god-like vampire lord. Blade then returned to New Orleans.

Blade re-encountered Dracula, and appeared to fully destroy the vampire lord once again aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier &quot;Pericles V&quot;. Unbeknownst to Blade, his wealthy father, Lucas Cross, had been responsible for Dracula&#x27;s most recent resurrection. Cross later kidnapped Blade and attempted to force Blade to feed on a virgin girl in an attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Blade escaped after biting through his own hand. Later, Blade would feed on a virgin after biting an evil vampire priest, Draconis.

In exchange for undertaking a time travel adventure for the supervillain Doctor Doom, Blade received from Doom an that would purportedly cure a vampire of thirst for human blood, but would also remove the bloodlust vampire hunters get for killing the undead. At the end of the series, Blade gave Hannibal King the elixir. During this time travel mission, Blade fulfilled another part of the prophecy by freeing his imprisoned father.

===&quot;Civil War&quot; and beyond===
During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, in which the superheroes of the Marvel Universe were split over the Superhuman Registration Act, Blade registers and begins cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D. This alliance allowed Blade access to S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, gaining himself a &quot;gun hand&quot; to replace his missing one. Blade completes a prophecy he believes would give all extant vampires back their souls, but which instead returns to existence every vampire that had ever been killed.

Blade next leads a group of superhuman black-ops agents funded secretly by the U.S. government, called the Vanguard, of which even the President is unaware. During his time with this squad, Blade receives a cybernetic replacement hand. The squad disbands after their cover is compromised, and Blade returns home to the United Kingdom to join MI-13 in its fight against supernatural evil. He soon afterwards stakes his new teammate, the vampire hero Spitfire. Blade and Spitfire clashed again with each other in a fierce battle, but the two were forced to work together and seemed to have formed an unlikely friendship. Upon completing their first mission together, Blade attempts to apologize to Spitfire for trying to kill her, but before he could finish, she kisses him.

During the &quot;Curse of the Mutants&quot; storyline, Blade appears in San Francisco to assist the X-Men in capturing a vampire specimen for the X-Club. He confirms Dracula&#x27;s death and reveals that his son Xarus is the new Lord of Vampires, having united all of the vampire sects under a single flag. He immediately objects to Cyclops&#x27; plan to resurrect Dracula, stating &quot;You don&#x27;t dig up Hitler to get rid of Saddam Hussein&quot;. The conflict concluded with Dracula being resurrected anyway, despite Blade&#x27;s objections. Blade attempts to kill the now-vampire Jubilee, but is forced to withdraw after a stand-off with Wolverine, who refuses to allow her to be staked, even as Blade warns the X-Men that they will eventually have to kill her.

Blade was later revealed to have been the character (whose identity is kept from the reader) on the Mighty Avengers team who dons the Halloween-type Spider Hero alias during the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, and the Ronin identity from a &quot;big box of Clint Barton&#x27;s old stuff&quot; during the &quot;Inhumanity&quot; storyline; his true identity was eventually revealed.

To prepare for his next TV program, Mojo paired Blade up with Doctor Strange, the Ghost Rider, the Manphibian, the Man-Thing, and Satana the Devil&#x27;s Daughter, where he formed the Avengers of the Supernatural. He mind-controlled them and had them fight the Avengers Unity Division. Both groups managed to break free from the mind-control and returned to their world after preventing the Ghost Rider from using his Penance Stare on the inhabitants of Mojoworld.

Blade later appears in a small town hunting down a necromancer and ends up confronting Gwenpool, who was unknowingly hired to kill him. After Gwenpool explains that the dead residents are living peacefully, Blade leaves after he gives her his cellphone number, dubbing her &quot;Pink Slayer&quot;, but is called back when Gwenpool discovers that the mayor/necromancer is actually draining the life-force from children to keep his undead citizens alive.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Blade was shown to have been trapped in Manhattan when it was isolated by a Darkforce dome. Due to the vampire attacks at the time, Blade takes advantage of this by killing every attacking vampire to protect the humans.

Blade was later captured by an army of vampires and imprisoned until he was freed by Wasp. He took up the Black Panther&#x27;s offer to join the Avengers. Blade, along with the Avengers, faces a civil war among the vampire community orchestrated by the Shadow Coronel and the Legion of the Unliving.

During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Blade appears with the Avengers and the other heroes fighting Malekith the Accursed and his army. He also joins the group sent to destroy the Black Bifrost. He also appears attacking Roxxon&#x27;s secret base in Antarctica, fighting the Berserkers along with the Gorilla-Man and Ka-Zar. Later in the series, Blade becomes the sheriff of &quot;Vampire Nation&quot;, a safe haven for vampires overseen by Dracula.

During the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, Blade visits Miles Morales in Brooklyn stating that he has a plan to deal with the vampire invasion. While stating to the Avengers that he has a plan while driving in his truck, he wants them to bring his truck to Impossible City. When it arrives, out comes the Bloodcoven who states that Blade can&#x27;t be here as the Avengers are defeated by them as they also compromise Impossible City. Blade later visits Doctor Strange and Clea at the Sanctum Sanctorum to mention that the Structure is behind this and the Avengers have been defeated by the Bloodcoven who he describes as ultra-vampires who drink superhuman blood. When Doctor Strange asks if Dracula is leading the Structure since Moon Knight killed its original leader Tutor, Blade states that he is the leader of the Structure as he prepares to bite Doctor Strange. It is later revealed that Blade is actually possessed by Varnae.

==Powers and abilities==
===Comics===
Due to an enzyme in his bloodstream resultant from his mother&#x27;s being bitten by a vampire while giving birth to him, Blade is immune to the bites of typical, supernatural vampires. In certain instances, he also appeared immune to vampire hypnosis as well. He lacked superhuman physical attributes, however, and relied solely on his considerable skill and determination until Morbius, the Living Vampire, an atypical, scientifically created vampire, bit him and Blade was turned into something resembling a dhampir. Blade possesses superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility, heightened senses, and a rapid healing factor that attacks any alien substances (chemicals/viruses) in his body. The healing factor also eliminates any chance of him being rendered helpless or maimed from the inside. Blade is unaffected by daylight and most other traditional vampire weaknesses. He also ages very slowly (although he is not immortal) and can preternaturally sense supernatural activity.

When he was raised and trained by Jamal Afari, Blade learned everything about vampire lore, from their strengths to their weaknesses, and how he could use his powers and skills to hunt down vampires so he could fight and kill them.

Blade is a master martial artist, mastering styles like boxing, capoeira, escrima, jeet kune do, hapkido, jujutsu, Shotokan karate, kung fu, and ninjutsu. He is also a skilled swordsman, marksman, and street-fighter. He is adept in the usage of throwing knives. He is highly knowledgeable about vampire lore as well as the supernatural.

In &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Gauntlet&quot;, Blade and Deadpool are surrounded by monsters and Blade threatens to turn into a bat and leave Deadpool there to die. He may have all vampire powers, but feels conflicted about using the ones that make him seem less human.

===Films and television series===

In the films and television series, Blade originated from Detroit, Michigan. Blade is depicted as having all of a vampire&#x27;s strengths and none of the weaknesses, except for the bloodlust. Blade attempts to suppress the thirst with a serum, but during the first film, his body develops a resistance to it. At the beginning of the second film, it is stated that Dr. Karen Jenson, from the first film, improved the serum, presumably in the time between the two films. Although he does not want to drink blood, he has been shown to be capable of it; prior to the development of the serum, Abraham Whistler noted that he found Blade as a teenager when Blade was feeding on the homeless, with Blade ingesting blood during the first and second films when in a position where he was badly injured and needed to be back at full strength as soon as possible.

Blade&#x27;s half-vampire physiology results in him being completely immune to silver, garlic, and sunlight. Blade has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses. He also has a healing factor that allows him to heal completely from wounds overnight, although in the first and second films he was forced to drink blood to accelerate his usual healing abilities when faced with an immediate threat and too badly injured to confront it on his own. It is also mentioned in the first film that he ages like a human, while vampires age much slower. He is a master of martial arts, practices meditation, and can speak Czech, Russian, and to a degree the vampire language, and he has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires. It is seen in the television series that, while he is only half-vampire, Blade&#x27;s saliva still produces the enzyme that turns humans into vampires.

==Equipment==
===Comics===
According to his earliest appearances in the original &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; comics, Blade relied on teakwood daggers which he used to impale opponents, and a variety of mahogany s. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and knife-fighter. Later comics upgraded his arsenal significantly over the years, including a variety of different bladed weapons ranging from long swords to katanas, as well as guns, flamethrowers, and UV and silver-based weapons. He relies mainly on a double-edged sword he carries on his back. He has also had some success with improvised weapons, such as stakes made from snapped brooms and, after losing his hand, a replacement appendage made from duct tape and a pointed stick. He would replace this with a new machine gun-esque firearm used in place of his missing hand, which responds to different muscle twitches as an indication of reloading and firing, among other functions (including a grappling hook, which Blade describes as his &quot;favorite feature&quot;). It also uses three different kinds of ammo. This weapon was created by S.H.I.E.L.D. Blade also had an arsenal of EMP grenades.

===Films and television series===
Much in the same way as in the comics, in the movie series, Blade employs a stylized double-edged sword as one of his main offense and defense tools. Although not much detail is specified in the comics about the composition of the sword, in the films, it is equipped with an acid-etched titanium blade that has a security feature that will release blades into the wielder&#x27;s hand after a set time. This is aborted by Blade or others who know of the system by pushing a hidden switch in the sword&#x27;s hilt. The movies also depict him wielding varieties of throwable &quot;glaives&quot; (boomerang- or chakram-like weapons which return when thrown), different knives, silver stakes, and firearms. He also uses specialized weapons, such as throwable injector canisters filled with an anticoagulant which is explosively lethal to vampires, and extendable injector spikes worn on the back of the hand.

===Anime===
In addition to all his above skills and powers, Blade&#x27;s swordsmanship in particular is shown in &quot;Marvel Anime&quot; to be especially advanced. Blade&#x27;s sword-style revolves mainly around his mastery of Yagu Shinkage-ryu, a kenjutsu art that can unleash powerful shockwaves or transparent wind blades from his sword swings, allowing him to blast or slice respectively his opponents from a distance. The Yagu Shinkage-ryu also has three principal Yagyu techniques. The first technique, &quot;The First Blade: Residual Moon&quot;, draws a small circle with the tip of his sword, producing a perfectly tangible after-image of himself for diversions. The second technique, &quot;The Second Blade: Phantom Moon&quot;, involves a high-speed spin, allowing Blade to launch an omnidirectional slash in rapid succession with such intensity that it sets his strike ablaze. The final technique, &quot;The Third Blade: Chaotic Moon&quot;, launches several shadow blades around the opponent, hiding the user&#x27;s attack path with little chance of being noticed.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, Nick Fury explained to Blade and those who joined the resistance aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier how serious he believed the situation to be; that it was the end of the world. He also explained that whatever the histories of those assembled, they were all on the same side. However, Blade was later seen as one of the infected heroes.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
An alternate universe variant of Blade from Earth-61610 appears in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; as a member of the Thor Corps.

===&quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot;===
An &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; imprint of Blade appears. This alternate universe version, called &quot;the Daywalker&quot; by the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, has numerous small scars across his eyes and cheeks.

Spider-Man met Blade when the Daywalker was hunting a vampire in an alley. Believing Blade to be a crazed gunman, Spider-Man webbed him and tended to a person who he thought was an ordinary civilian, until the vampire attacked. Blade freed himself and staked the creature, saving Spider-Man from being bitten. Blade then threatened Spider-Man with his superior strength and menacing vampiric appearance, that if the youth ever attacked him again, he would &quot;eat [Spider-Man&#x27;s] heart for breakfast!&quot; Shaken by this encounter, Spider-Man later took Blade&#x27;s discarded wooden stake as a of the discovery of the existence of vampires. This experience also later helps when trying to save Ben Urich from being one.

Blade is one of the many heroes recruited by Nick Fury in &quot;Ultimate Comics: Avengers&quot;. When vampires started infecting superheroes, going from street-heroes, such as the new Daredevil, to major heroes such as the Nerd Hulk and even Captain America, Blade became the center of attention as he infiltrated the Triskelion, where he fought more vampires. After repelling Captain America, Blade was taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. and interrogated on the nature of the vampires and who was behind this. He explained that this was orchestrated by Anthony, another vampire hunter like Blade, who was turned into a vampire and put his mind and strategy into infecting the superhero community to dominate the world. As S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates were preparing to fight against the vampires, Blade was incarcerated below the Triskelion as he could not be trusted until the situation was over. When the vampires assaulted the Triskelion, Blade was let out by his handlers in confronting the vampires Daredevil and his former master. He was forced to retreat from the vampires armed with Iron Man&#x27;s armor before being subdued and prepared to be beheaded by Daredevil, but Captain America was cured and teleported the Triskelion to a daylight Iran where the vampires were incinerated, saving Blade in the process.

Nick Fury managed to convince Blade to join a black ops group by promising to deliver to him the recently captured vampire who is responsible for his condition. While attempting to intervene on an illegal sale of S.H.I.E.L.D. Super-Soldiers, the Avengers were attacked by Tyrone Cash. However, Blade was able to hypnotize him before he could cause any real threat. Cash revealed that he was working for Carol Danvers. During the main battle between the Avengers and the New Ultimates, Blade managed to capture Danvers briefly before he was intercepted by the Black Widow. Iron Man intervened to help but Blade was crushed, not realizing that Blade did not have super-human invulnerability. After being arrested by the New Ultimates, Blade and the rest of the Avengers take Cash&#x27;s serum and they gain massive strength and bulk bodies. When they confront Iron Man&#x27;s brother Gregory Stark, the group is easily overpowered by Stark&#x27;s nanite-based powers and sends them over the edge of the . They later join the New Ultimates on their mission to South Korea to settle the civil unrest which Gregory engineered.

==Marv Wolfman lawsuit==
In 1997, on the eve of the impending release of the &quot;Blade&quot; film, Marv Wolfman sued Marvel Characters Inc. over ownership of all characters he had created for Marvel Comics, including Blade and Nova. A ruling in Marvel&#x27;s favor was handed down on November 6, 2000. Wolfman&#x27;s stance was that he had not signed work-for-hire contracts when he created his characters, including Blade and Nova. In a non-jury trial, the judge ruled that Marvel&#x27;s later use of the characters was sufficiently different to protect it from Wolfman&#x27;s claim of copyright ownership.

==Reception==
IGN ranked Blade as the 63rd greatest comic character, stating that Blade is the most iconic hero to spring from the period of monster-themed stories.

===Film===
* Blade appears in a trilogy of films from New Line Cinema, portrayed by Wesley Snipes. The first, &quot;Blade&quot;, was released in 1998, and presented the character as stoic while revising his powers and weaknesses. Rather than a normal human with immunity to vampirism, the film version is a dhampir with vampiric powers and a bloodthirst, the latter of which is controlled through a special serum. The film was financially successful and received two sequels, &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002) and &quot;&quot; (2004).
* By August 2012, the film rights to Blade had reverted to Marvel Studios, and a script for a new film was ready by May 2013. By July 2015, Snipes and Marvel had discussed the actor reprising his role. A crossover with the &quot;Underworld&quot; film series had also been discussed, but was rejected because Marvel Studios wanted to introduce Blade into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Mahershala Ali had been cast as Blade in July 2019. In 2021, Stacy Amma Osei-Kuffour was hired to write the script in February while Bassam Tariq was confirmed to direct in September. Tariq left a year later due to the film&#x27;s production shifts, when Beau DeMayo joined to rewrite the script. Yann Demange was hired to direct in November 2022, with Michael Starrbury doing a page-one rewrite. Further rewrites were conducted by Nic Pizzolatto in April 2023 and Michael Green in November 2023. The film was planned to begin principal photography following the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, at Tyler Perry Studios, Atlanta. &quot;Blade&quot; does not currently have a release date.
* Ali makes an uncredited vocal cameo appearance as Blade in a post-credits scene for &quot;Eternals&quot;.

<doc id="505037" wikidata="Q1784093" url="?curid=505037" title="Joe Millionaire">
<text>Joe Millionaire is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The series premiered on January 6, 2003, and concluded with the finale of its second season on November 24, 2003. Both seasons followed a group of single women in competition for the affection of a bachelor. The women were under the belief that the bachelor was a millionaire; however, he was actually a working class average Joe. If the final remaining woman still accepted the bachelor after learning about the ruse, the two split a $1,000,000 reward. The series was hosted by American television presenter Alex McLeod.

The first season of &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; experienced high success in ratings, with its season finale being the highest-rated entertainment program (excluding Super Bowl lead-out programs) aired on network television since 2000. The second season, titled &quot;The Next Joe Millionaire&quot;, experienced disappointing ratings throughout its run. In 2005, &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; and &quot;The Next Joe Millionaire&quot; were among several television programs cited in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Writers Guild of America concerning labor law violations.

In November 2021, Fox announced a revival entitled Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer, which aired from January 6 to March 10, 2022. The revival featured two bachelors, one a working-class man and the other a secret millionaire.

==First season==
The women were not aware that the bachelor, Evan Marriott, was in fact a working-class construction worker. The Smoking Gun later discovered that Marriott had also been an underwear model. A theme throughout the first season was Marriott&#x27;s attempt to ascertain which of the twenty contestants were sincere and which ones were simply seeking a wealthy mate. Season 1 was helmed by showrunner and co-executive producer Liz Bronstein, whose vision of the show as a spoof of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and comedic send-up of reality shows was widely praised.

The show made a minor star out of Paul Hogan, the manservant whose role developed, in the words of the network, &quot;into the glue that held the show together&quot;. Hogan was not actually the host of the program: Alex McLeod was the program&#x27;s host, although she appeared only briefly on each episode for an estimated total of five minutes during the six-episode season.

Runner-up Sarah Kozer received notoriety when the media reported during the course of the show that she had appeared in bondage videos while she was attending law school. A scene from the show implied that Kozer and Marriott engaged in a sex act while out for a walk together. Marriott and Kozer claim no sex acts occurred. In the VH1 program &quot;VH1 News Presents: Reality TV Secrets Revealed&quot; she alleges that her statement, &quot;let&#x27;s go somewhere quiet&quot; was in fact spoken while she was receiving a back massage from another female contestant and that the producers dubbed it in during post-editing and added suggestive sound effects and subtitles. The show&#x27;s editors corroborated this fact later in an interview for &quot;Radar&quot; magazine.

Zora Andrich was the last woman to be chosen by Marriott, and they split a bonus prize of $1 million. Their relationship did not last.

&quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; was filmed primarily at the Château de la Bourdaisière in the countryside of the commune of Montlouis-sur-Loire in the Indre-et-Loire département in France. Marriott is said to have made upwards of $2.5 million between Fox Networks payout, personal appearances, and commercials. In 2004, he hosted the less popular (GSN) Game Show Network show &quot;Fake A Date&quot;. Marriott went back to contracting in Orange County, California, and started his own business. In hiring a bachelor, Marriott explained that Fox &quot;needed a guy that was in construction but didn&#x27;t have kids, hadn&#x27;t been in jail, wasn&#x27;t on drugs.&quot;

The series was highly successful for Fox; the two-hour season finale was seen by at least 34.6 million viewers, which made it one of Fox&#x27;s highest-rated entertainment programs to date. Fox stated that, excluding Super Bowl lead-outs, it was the highest-rated entertainment program on television since the finale of &quot;Survivor&quot; in 2000.

==&quot;The Next Joe Millionaire&quot;==
The second season, released in 2003, was set in Northern and Central Italy, primarily at the Villa Oliva in Tuscany. Marriott was replaced by 24-year-old David Smith from Midland, Texas, who, viewers were told, had earned only $11,000 the previous year as a cowboy on the rodeo circuit. Needing to find contestants who were unaware of the first show, the producers went to Europe and cast 14 English-speaking European women from the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden. During casting, the women were told by Fox casting agents that the show they were going to appear on would involve a group of European women interacting with American men on an island somewhere. There was also a new &quot;hostess&quot;, a then-unknown Samantha Harris. The butler was, once again, played by Paul Hogan.

However, the show&#x27;s popularity dissolved very quickly; Fox&#x27;s head of entertainment Sandy Grushow stated that &quot;our instincts told us from the very beginning that &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; was a one-time stunt and I think we got greedy.&quot; He added, &quot;We tried to sneak it by the American public a second time and we got called on it.&quot;

The show&#x27;s climax occurred when one of the contestants, Linda Kazdová, from the Czech Republic, was brought back to the show after eliminating herself and was later selected by Smith as the winner. By that time, though, the show&#x27;s popularity had declined.

Instead of sharing a million dollars, as Andrich and Marriott had in the first show, Smith was awarded a ranch in Texas, while Kazdova received $250,000. As with the first installment, the couple&#x27;s post-show interaction was short-lived, as Smith and Kazdova were separated by distance shortly after the show aired.

&quot;The Next Joe Millionaire&quot; drew fewer than 7 million viewers a week, with a season finale attracting only 9 million viewers.

==&quot;For Richer or Poorer&quot;==
In October 2021, Fox Alternative Entertainment announced that a reboot of the series produced by SallyAnn Salsano, &quot;Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer&quot;, would premiere on January 6, 2022. &quot;For Richer or Poorer&quot; features women competing over two bachelors: one of the bachelors is a millionaire, but the women do not know which.

===Cast===
This season of &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; has two bachelors: Kurt F. Sowers and Steven McBee. Sowers is a 32-year-old construction manager and CEO from Charlotte, North Carolina and McBee is a 27-year-old farmer and CEO from Gallatin, Missouri. For this season, the butler and host is Martin Andrew.

====Contestants====
There are 18 contestants this season.

==British version==
A short-lived British version called &quot;Joe Millionaire UK&quot; ran on E4 from November 27, 2003, until January 1, 2004, hosted by Rebecca De Young while the bachelor, in general, was Dominic Lijertwood.

<text>The New Universe is an imprint from Marvel Comics that was published in its original incarnation from 1986 to 1989. It was the first line produced by Marvel Comics utilizing a pre-conceived shared universe concept. It was created by Jim Shooter, Archie Goodwin, Eliot R. Brown, John Morelli, Mark Gruenwald, Tom DeFalco, and edited by Michael Higgins.

In 1986, in honor of Marvel Comics&#x27; 25th anniversary, Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter launched the New Universe line of comics. This was to be a distinctly separate world, fully divorced from the mainstream continuity of the Marvel Universe, consisting of its own continuing characters and stories in a more realistic setting. There would be no hidden races, gods, mythological beings, magic, or supertechnology. Superhuman characters and powers would be limited and thus more subdued in their activities, and their actions would have more realistic consequences. This was in contrast to the traditional Marvel Universe, which always purported to take place in a mirror of the real world, yet public knowledge of superheroes, supervillains and their activities had little effect on normal day-to-day business.

Adding to the sense of realism, the New Universe titles were designed to operate in real-time: a month would lapse in the universe for each month that passed in reality. The limitation of fantasy elements, and the low-key nature of the characters&#x27; activities in the New Universe, gave the imprint verisimilitude, to seem like &quot;the world outside your window&quot;, which was the imprint&#x27;s catchphrase.

==Original titles==
The New Universe initially launched with eight monthly titles:
* &quot;DP 7&quot; (created by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Ryan) (32 issues, one annual)
:DP 7 focuses on a group of seven paranormals on the run from a sinister medical facility created to deal with the booming paranormal population.
* &quot;Justice&quot; (created by Archie Goodwin) (32 issues)
:The titular hero is an alien knight exiled to Earth by his enemies. With no way to return to his home dimension, he metes out justice to evildoers everywhere.
* &quot;Kickers, Inc.&quot; (created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz) (12 issues)
:Kickers Inc. is a group of heroes-for-hire, all former pro-football players, led by Jack Magniconte, who gains super-human strength, speed, and invulnerability after the White Event at the cost of his brother&#x27;s life.
* &quot;Mark Hazzard: Merc&quot; (created by Archie Goodwin) (12 issues, one annual)
:Mark Hazzard is a Vietnam veteran turned soldier of fortune whose mercenary lifestyle has cost him the love of his family.
* &quot;Nightmask&quot; (created by Archie Goodwin) (12 issues)
:Orphaned Keith Remsen is a counselor, aided by his sister Teddy, who uses his newfound ability to enter people&#x27;s dreams to help them recover from trauma and mental illness.
* &quot;Psi-Force&quot; (created by Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson) (32 issues, one annual)
:Psi-Force is a group of paranormals on the run from a government that seeks to control them. They can meld their abilities into a powerful psionic being called The Psi-Hawk.
* &quot;Spitfire and the Troubleshooters&quot; (created by Eliot R. Brown and John Morelli) (13 issues; renamed &quot;Spitfire&quot; from issue #8; renamed &quot;Codename: Spitfire&quot; from issue #10)
:Aided by five prankster students, Professor Jenny Swensen steals her father&#x27;s M.A.X. armor (a construction suit built for use in a variety of capacities) when she suspects his murderer intends to use it as a weapon of war.
* &quot;Star Brand&quot; (created by Jim Shooter) (19 issues, one annual; renamed &quot;The Star Brand&quot; from issue #11)
:Ken Connell is given a power called the Star Brand by a mysterious visitor from space, who tells him to guard it well. Driven by his conscience, Connell struggles to find the most just and appropriate use for the Brand&#x27;s unlimited power.

==Publication history==
===Concept and creation===
To discuss how to capitalize on Marvel Comics&#x27;s upcoming 25th anniversary, president Jim Galton held a meeting with Marvel&#x27;s vice presidents, including Jim Shooter, who was also Marvel editor-in-chief. Shooter proposed an idea similar to the later Ultimate Marvel line: end the Marvel Universe, and relaunch all the titles in a remade universe which would use the same characters and story concepts as the original Marvel Universe, but updated to the present era. This idea was rejected because it was seen as meddling with a line that was very successful at the time, and so Shooter instead proposed creating a new universe entirely, one that would supplement the Marvel Universe rather than replace it. This new proposal was approved and given a $120,000 budget.

After a false start in which Tom DeFalco was placed in charge of the project and reportedly made little progress, Shooter conceived a line of comics that would be the next innovation for greater realism in superhero comics. The concept was fleshed out, and ideas for the individual series proposed, at a meeting with Shooter, DeFalco, Archie Goodwin, Eliot R. Brown, John Morelli, and Mark Gruenwald.

The premise behind the line of comics was that, prior to July 22, 1986, the New Universe was identical to the real world. The New Universe&#x27;s first divergence from normal reality was the White Event, a strange astronomical phenomenon that occurred on that date, at 4:22 a.m., EDT, and lasted for mere moments. It bathed the Earth in a bright white light and caused genetic anomalies in two out of every one million humans, which led to their developing superhuman powers. Many looked completely normal, but for others the anomaly resulted in a physical manifestation that led to horrible disfiguration. Human beings who developed a reaction to the White Event were referred to as paranormals. According to Goodwin, it was intended from the beginning that all the major characters in the New Universe would be either paranormals or in some other way linked to the White Event. However, three of the eight launch titles, including two created by Goodwin himself, had no connection of any sort to the White Event: &quot;Mark Hazzard: Merc&quot;, &quot;Spitfire and the Troubleshooters&quot;, and &quot;Justice&quot;.

===First year===
The New Universe was heavily marketed but faced substantial problems. Jim Shooter had planned to recruit top creators, but this became unfeasible when Marvel&#x27;s parent company, Cadence Industries, threatened to sell off the company, creating immense pressure for Marvel to cut costs and increase revenues. As a result, the New Universe&#x27;s budget was cut to nothing, and the titles in the line were staffed almost entirely by editors and creators who were new to the industry or otherwise could not get work elsewhere. Because of false starts, and delays in developing the New Universe concept, production of the first issues faced harsh deadline pressures as the 25th anniversary approached. Following the launch, certain books lacked focus as creative teams were swapped. Shooter was also involved with complex politics at Marvel Comics (which eventually led to his termination), and thus could not give the line as much attention as he would have liked. In addition, many readers felt that the line did not follow the advertised &quot;world outside your window&quot; concept; especially strong contradictions to the line&#x27;s supposed realism were &quot;Justice&quot; (about an alien knight from a quasi-medieval civilization), &quot;Kickers Inc.&quot; (a team of five professional football players who work as heroes-for-hire as a sideline), and &quot;Codename: Spitfire&quot; (whose later issues involved technology that verged on the fantastical). In 2007, comics journalist Philippe Cordier went so far as to declare Jim Shooter&#x27;s run on &quot;Star Brand&quot; to be &quot;the New Universe&#x27;s only good title&quot;.

By the end of the imprint&#x27;s first year, four of the titles (&quot;Kickers, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Mark Hazzard: Merc&quot;, &quot;Nightmask&quot; and &quot;Codename: Spitfire&quot;) were cancelled, while a fifth (&quot;Star Brand&quot;) had been downgraded to bimonthly status, and Shooter himself had departed Marvel. Though the news bulletins published in the comics reassured readers that the cancellations were only a case of some series not selling as well as others, in fact, even the four remaining New Universe titles were on the brink of cancellation.

===The &quot;New New Universe&quot;===
In an effort to save the line, DeFalco (now Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief), Gruenwald, John Byrne, and editor Howard Mackie ended up removing some of the more fantastic elements from it and, in a few cases, doing radical revamps. Byrne signed up to write and do breakdowns on &quot;Star Brand&quot;, altering the series so that it focused less on Ken Connell and more on the power of the titular object itself. This began initially with the idea of having Ken Connell go public with his identity as Star Brand. Similarly, the premise of &quot;Justice&quot; was revealed to be a hallucination that had been artificially induced in the title&#x27;s protagonist by another paranormal. From this point on, Justice becomes a serial killer who targets paranormals who abuse their powers. Some of the characters whose titles had been cancelled returned as backup features or even as supporting characters in the remaining books.

One of the founding ideas of the New Universe was that the existence of paranormals would have real and lasting consequences, but so far these had been few and on the personal level. Gruenwald elaborated: This changed in issue #12 of &quot;Star Brand&quot;, in which Ken Connell transfers a portion of the Star Brand to an inanimate object. This same issue reveals that a similar transfer of the Star Brand&#x27;s power into an asteroid was the trigger for the White Event in the first place. Connell&#x27;s effort results in a tremendous release of energy, which scoops out a massive crater, obliterating the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and most of the surrounding area in what became known as the Black Event. The crater that existed where Pittsburgh had once been became known as &quot;The Pitt&quot;, and its creation marked a turn into a generally grimmer tone for the line, with a more militarized international political scene, and some themes of post-apocalyptic fiction being explored. The increasingly unstable political scene would have effects such as the forcible military recruitment of paranormals for a war with the Soviet Union (believed by the Americans to have caused the disaster), as portrayed in the graphic novel &quot;The Draft&quot;.

Despite all of this, the imprint was discontinued in late 1989 after a total of 170 comics had been published. Readers often assumed that the New Universe had suffered from poor sales, but in fact, all four series were solidly profitable right up until their cancellation; the actual reason for discontinuing the line was that, with Marvel Comics in one of its most successful eras, it was felt that staff and production resources would be better used on new, more promising series. The lineup&#x27;s discontinuation was immediately followed by a four-issue limited series, &quot;The War&quot;, which was intended as the conclusion of the New Universe.

===1993–2005===
Writer Peter David introduced an amnesiac character known as the &quot;Net Prophet&quot; into &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;. He eventually revealed that &quot;Net Prophet&quot; was actually the New Universe character Justice, who slowly regained his memories during the course of the storyline. 
* &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; #12–14 (1993)
* &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; #25 (1994)
* &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; #41, 42, 44 (1996)
* &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; Annual #1 (1994)

Following the dissolution of the New Universe imprint, Mark Gruenwald, the writer of the New Universe title &quot;DP7&quot;, decided to bring the Star Brand and other New Universe characters into the Marvel Universe proper some years later, when he was the writer for &quot;Quasar&quot;. He later incorporated them into the Marvel Multiverse, allowing crossovers with other Marvel titles, in the &quot;Starblast&quot; storyline:

* Part 1: &quot;Starblast&quot; #1 (January 1994)
* Part 2: &quot;Quasar&quot; #54 (January 1994)
* Part 3: &quot;The Secret Defenders&quot; #11 (January 1994)
* Part 4: &quot;Starblast&quot; #2 (February 1994)
* Part 5: &quot;Quasar&quot; #55 (February 1994)
* Part 6: &quot;Namor the Sub-Mariner&quot; #47 (February 1994)
* Part 7: &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #385 (February 1994)
* Part 8: &quot;Starblast&quot; #3 (March 1994)
* Part 9: &quot;Namor the Sub-Mariner&quot; #48 (March 1994)
* Part 10: &quot;Quasar&quot; #56 (March 1994)
* Part 11: &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #386 (March 1994)
* Part 12: &quot;Starblast&quot; #4 (April 1994)

In addition, &quot;Namor the Sub-Mariner&quot; #46, &quot;Quasar&quot; #31-53, and &quot;Quasar&quot; #57-60 were unnumbered tie-ins to the crossover.

In this crossover, Kayla Ballantine is Quasar&#x27;s secretary at the time that she receives the Star Brand. Once her powers begin to manifest, she becomes the target of numerous alien individuals and groups. These include: the Dance, the Chief Examiner, and a group of interplanetary marauders known as the Starblasters. Quasar recruits some of Earth&#x27;s most powerful heroes to stop them when the Starblasters try to push the moon away from Earth’s orbit.

The Imperial Guard were informed about a hijacked Shi&#x27;ar craft and later joined Quasar. When it becomes clear that the Starblasters are working for the Stranger, Guard members Solar Wind, Voyager and Moondancer opt to help Quasar&#x27;s team against the Stranger, even though it means they have to resign from active Guard duty. These three Guardsmen were once captured and caged by the Stranger some years before. After helping Quasar, these three &#x27;former&#x27; Guardsmen are never seen again serving the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard, and their whereabouts are unknown.

Ballantine would eventually pass the Star Brand on to the Stranger in order to prevent Skeletron (the leader of the Starblasters) from forcibly taking the Star Brand. The Stranger uses the Star Brand to move the Earth of the New Universe into orbit around his Labworld. The Living Tribunal then judges the Star Brand to be a threat to the hierarchy of the greater powers of the Marvel Multiverse. The New Universe&#x27;s Earth is quarantined and surrounded by an impenetrable energy barrier so that no one can enter or leave it, and none of the greater powers are ever allowed to observe it again. After the threat posed by the Starblasters is over, the Star Brand is returned to Ballantine. She remains on the New Universe Earth after it is moved into the Marvel Universe and cut off from the rest of that universe.

===2005–present===
&quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005&quot; features a two-page entry on the New Universe wherein New Universe Earth is designated Earth-148611.

In late 2005, the Exiles find a Proteus-possessed Mimic in an approximation of New Universe era Pittsburgh. After observing this world, Proteus becomes determined to retrieve the most powerful weapon in the known universe, the Star Brand, by attempting to take the body of Ken Connell. He also encounters Justice, DP 7, and Nightmask. This arc runs through &quot;Exiles&quot; #72–74 and is the second of six stops on the &quot;World Tour&quot; storyline.

This alternate universe has the Marvel Multiverse designation Earth-15731 and exists circa 1986, shortly after the White Event. As a result of Proteus&#x27;s actions, including the premature death of Justice, it is completely divorced from the original New Universe continuity. Other notable differences include Connell, Nightmask, and Lenore Fenzl of the D.P. 7 becoming aware of each other&#x27;s existence and abilities long before the characters did so in the original continuity (due to the Exiles gathering them to combat Proteus) and Connell beginning to develop a greater sense of responsibility towards the Star Brand after Proteus threatens his life and the lives of people he cares for.

In 2006, Editor-In-Chief Joe Quesada and Editor Mark Paniccia set in motion events to celebrate &quot;Marvel Comics&#x27; 20th Anniversary of the New Universe&quot;. In late February and early March, Marvel launched the &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe&quot;, a five-week comic event that took place in a pre-Pitt timeframe in the original continuity.

These were released as a lead-in to Warren Ellis&#x27;s then-forthcoming &quot;newuniversal&quot;, an ongoing title that would re-introduce the New Universe Saga to the world. 
The line of &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe&quot; titles included the following:
* &quot;The New Avengers&quot; #16, &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe - Kickers, Inc.&quot;: &quot;Kickin&#x27; It in Hell&quot;
* &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #18, &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe&quot; - &quot;Mark Hazzard: Merc&quot;
* &quot;Marvel Milestones: Star Brand&quot; &amp; &quot;Quasar&quot;
* &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe — Star Brand&quot;: &quot;Adventures in the Mulletverse&quot;
* &quot;Untold Tales of The New Universe: Nightmask&quot; - &quot;Kingdom of the Gnome&quot; - this issue served as the conclusion of a story arc in the original comic never completed because of a change in creative team.
* &quot;Untold Tales of The New Universe: Justice&quot; - &quot;Who Judges the Judge?&quot;
* &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #19 - &quot;Spitfire&quot;: &quot;Danger Zone&quot;
* &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe: DP 7&quot; - &quot;The Dead Plains Seven&quot;
* &quot;Untold Tales of the New Universe - Psi-Force&quot;: &quot;An Army Of One&quot;

New Universe reference material is given in the &quot;All New Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe A - Z&quot; series. Issue #6 of this series features a biography of John Tensen (&quot;Justice&quot;). Issue #10 features a biography of the Starblasters, who are instrumental in &quot;Quasar&quot;: Prelude to Starblast (1992–1994) and Starblast (1994). The Starblasters had frequent interactions with many of the New Universe characters throughout these storylines. This was followed by a 2007 update series, &quot;All-New Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe A - Z: Update&quot;, the first issue of which (January 2007) features an updated biography of &quot;Mark Hazzard: Merc&quot;, &quot;Quasar&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;. Issue #2 (March 2007) features an updated biography of Jack Magniconte, the All-American. Issue #3 (July 2007) features an updated biography of Chrome.

In November 2006, Marvel released a 1980s version of &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;. The profiles within covered everything published by Marvel Comics in that decade and featured &quot;D.P. 7&quot;, &quot;Nightmask&quot;, and &quot;Psi-Force&quot;.

In 2007, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the New Universe, Marvel launched &quot;newuniversal&quot;, a mini-series re-imagining of the New Universe concepts by writer Warren Ellis, artist Salvador Larroca and color artist Jason Keith. As with the original New Universe, &quot;newuniversal&quot; is set in a world where a number of people suddenly develop superhuman abilities. However, where the New Universe began with the &#x27;real&#x27; world as its starting point, the world of &quot;newuniversal&quot; is already markedly different.

The one-shot &quot;Exiles: Days of Then and Now&quot; (January 2008) celebrates 100 issues of &quot;The Exiles&quot; and features an appearance by Jenny Swensen (Spitfire) in &quot;Chapter 4: World Tour&quot;.

In 2013, as part of Marvel&#x27;s NOW! initiative, in the fifth volume of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, writer Jonathan Hickman resurrects several concepts from the New Universe including The White Event, Nightmask and Star Brand, as well as elements from &quot;newuniversal&quot; like the Superflow.

<text>Dominic John Romulus Joly (; born 15 November 1967) is an English comedian and writer. He is best known as the star of &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; (2000–2003), a hidden camera prank show that was broadcast in over 70 countries.

==Early life==

Dominic John Romulus Joly was born in Beirut on 15 November 1967, to British parents John Joly and his second wife, Yvonne. John Joly, a pilot with the Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War, owned banking, insurance and shipping agency Henry Heald &amp; Co., which was managed, and later bought, by Joly&#x27;s great-grandfather. The family business is now run by Joly&#x27;s sister. Joly&#x27;s parents were &quot;quite detached&quot; and he was raised with a nanny; his parents separated when Joly was 18, and for 20 years he had little contact with his father, reconciling in his old age prior to the latter&#x27;s death in 2011. He has a half-brother and two half-sisters resident in Lebanon and England, to whom he is not close.

Joly attended Brummana High School in Lebanon. He then moved to England, where he was educated at Dragon School in Oxford and Haileybury College near Hertford. He later attended the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. He studied for a degree in politics. Joly speaks Arabic, Czech and French in addition to English.

In 2018, Joly told &quot;The Sunday People&quot; that when he was at school in Beirut in the 1970s a fellow pupil brought a severed head to show his class.

==Career==
After university, Joly was a diplomat, based in Prague.

===Television===
====&quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;====

The original series ran for two series on Channel 4 from 2000 to 2003.

In 2003, a new series of &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; was made for an American audience with an altered format that featured a band of different comedians who performed skits without Joly although he cameoed. Joly was not happy with the US version.

Following the success of &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; on Channel 4, Joly was secured by the BBC for a rumoured £5 million.

====&quot;This is Dom Joly&quot;====
&quot;This is Dom Joly&quot; was a spoof chat show presented by Dom Joly, originally shown on BBC Three in 2003.

====&quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot;====

&quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot; was a hidden camera television series starring Joly. It ran on Friday nights in 2005 on BBC One.

====&quot;Dom Joly&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot;====

In this series which aired in 2006, Joly and his partner Peter Wilkins travelled the world and tried the unique alcoholic beverages of each country. It ran on BBC One.

====&quot;Made in Britain&quot;====
In 2009, Joly fronted a show titled &quot;Made in Britain&quot;, shown on the Blighty channel in the UK.

====&quot;Fool Britannia&quot;====
In 2012–13, Joly made two series of &quot;Fool Britannia&quot;, a hidden camera show that aired on Saturday evenings on ITV1.

====&quot;Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls&quot;====
In 2016, Joly was marooned on a desert island for two weeks for &quot;Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls&quot;.

===&quot;Pilgrimage&quot;===
In 2020, Joly walked the Sultans Trail from Belgrade to Istanbul for the BBC One series &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;.

===Writing===
Joly was a columnist for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; from 2003 until the paper closed in 2016.

He was thought to be the writer of a spoof column in &quot;The Independent&quot; and then &quot;i&quot; called &quot;Cooper Brown: He&#x27;s out there&quot;, and later confirmed in his autobiography that this was the case. The column was presented as the work of an American character named Cooper Brown and revolves around his putative adventures as &quot;a garrulous American showbiz type&quot;.

In 2010, Joly published a travel book called &quot;The Dark Tourist: Sightseeing in the World&#x27;s Most Unlikely Holiday Destinations&quot;, investigating dark tourism. In the book Joly travels to places that witnessed great tragedy and death, including Chernobyl, which he visited on 4 May 2009; his childhood home of Lebanon; North Korea; various spots in the United States including locations of famous assassinations; the Killing Fields of Cambodia; and Iran for a skiing holiday. The book was published on 2 September 2010 in the UK.

Joly published his second travel book, &quot;Scary Monsters and Super Creeps&quot;, in 2012. In the book, he travels the world in search of six cryptids such as Bigfoot and the Yeti.

In 2019, Joly published the travel book &quot;The Hezbollah Hiking Club&quot;, in which he documented his walk across Lebanon with two friends.

Joly was a special correspondent for the &quot;Independent&quot; at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. While in Beijing, he also appeared daily on the &quot;Drive&quot; programme on Five Live.

In 2023, Joly published a book &quot;The Conspiracy Tourist&quot;, in which he travels the world investigating conspiracy theories and the people who believe them including QAnon, hunting for UFOs in Roswell, chasing Alex Jones of Info Wars around Austin, trying to prove that Finland exists and taking a flat-earther to the edge of the world.

===Political career===
In the 1997 UK general election, Joly stood in Kensington and Chelsea against Alan Clark. Hiring out hundreds of teddy bear costumes, he staged mock protests at Westminster and came fifth out of nine candidates, receiving 218 votes (0.6%).

===Podcast===
On 29 June 2018, Joly released the first episode of his comedy podcast, &quot;Earworm&quot;. In 2020 the second series of the podcast was released by Audible.

==Personal life==
Joly is married to Canadian graphic designer Stacey MacDougall. Having lived in the Notting Hill area of London, the two later sold their apartment to novelist Salman Rushdie and bought a property in Gloucestershire to raise their children there.

Joly has spoken about his struggles with anxiety and depression.

<doc id="505052" wikidata="Q253004" url="?curid=505052" title="Purple Rain (album)">
<text>Purple Rain is the sixth studio album by the American singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Prince. It was released on June 25, 1984, by Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack album to the 1984 film of the same name. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was musically denser than Prince&#x27;s previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments.

Much of the album had a grandiose, synthesized, and psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince&#x27;s career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. The music video for the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; sparked controversy among network executives, who thought its sexual nature was too explicit for television. The risqué lyrics of &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; raised complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center and contributed to the implementation of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers.

&quot;Purple Rain&quot; became Prince&#x27;s first album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was present on the chart for a total of 167 weeks. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while &quot;Purple Rain&quot; peaked at number two and &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; peaked at number eight. In May 1996, the album was certified 13× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is Prince&#x27;s commercial peak, with total sales standing at 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Prince and the Revolution won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, while Prince also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

Music critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack&#x27;s music, most famously on the spare, bass-less &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances along with its consolidation of rock and R&amp;B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is regularly ranked among the greatest albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 8 on its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==

While Prince&#x27;s previous albums were primarily solo recordings by Prince, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; contained the credits &quot;produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince and the Revolution&quot;, though he had teased the name two years earlier on &quot;1999&quot;, writing &quot;and the Revolution&quot; backwards on the album cover. The album was mostly written and recorded between May 1983 and March 1984, with &quot;Baby I&#x27;m a Star&quot; dating to 1981. The last three songs on the album (&quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m A Star&quot; and the title track &quot;Purple Rain&quot;) were recorded live at the 3August 1983 First Avenue show in Minneapolis, although overdubs and edits took place on all three in September 1983; this marked Prince&#x27;s first album to include live recordings.

Regarding the meaning of &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, both Mikel Toombs of &quot;The San Diego Union&quot; and Bob Kostanczuk of the &quot;Post-Tribune&quot; have written that Prince took the title &quot;Purple Rain&quot; from lyrics in the America song &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;. Asked to explain the phrase &quot;purple rain&quot; in &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, Gerry Beckley responded: &quot;You got me.&quot; However, Prince explained the meaning of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; as follows: &quot;When there&#x27;s blood in the skyred and blue = purple... purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain.&quot;

&quot;Purple Rain&quot; was originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration with Stevie Nicks. According to Nicks, she received a 10-minute instrumental version of the song from Prince with a request to write the lyrics, but felt overwhelmed. She said: &quot;I listened to it and I just got scared. I called him back and said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t do it. I wish I could. It&#x27;s too much for me.&#x27;&quot; At a rehearsal, Prince then asked his backing band to try the song: &quot;I want to try something before we go home. It&#x27;s mellow.&quot; According to the Revolution member Lisa Coleman, Prince then changed the song after the Revolution&#x27;s Wendy Melvoin started playing guitar chords to accompany the song: &quot;He was excited to hear it voiced differently. It took it out of that country feeling. Then we all started playing it a bit harder and taking it more seriously. We played it for six hours straight and by the end of that day we had it mostly written and arranged.&quot;

&quot;Take Me with U&quot; was written for the Apollonia 6 album &quot;Apollonia6&quot; (1984), but later enlisted for &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. The inclusion of that song necessitated cuts to the suite-like &quot;Computer Blue&quot;, the full version of which did not earn an official release, although a portion of the second section can be heard in the film of the same name, in a sequence where Prince walks in on the men of the Revolution rehearsing. The risqué lyrics of &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; contributed to the use of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers that were the record label&#x27;s answer to complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC).

Prince wrote and composed the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; after all the other tracks were complete on &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. In addition to providing vocals, he played all instruments on the track. With there being no bass line, the song&#x27;s production is noted for being unconventionally bare in comparison to 1980s pop hits. Prince said there originally was a bass line but, after a conversation with singer Jill Jones, he decided the song was too conventional with it included.

==Composition==
Like Prince&#x27;s previous albums, nearly all tracks on &quot;Purple Rain&quot; were written by him. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was musically denser than Prince&#x27;s previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments. As a soundtrack record, much of the music had a grandiose, synthesized, and evenby some evaluationsa psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince&#x27;s career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. Apollonia6 member Apollonia recalled that after watching the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; cinematographic takes, she told Prince, &quot;You know you&#x27;re going to get an Oscar for this movienot for the acting, but for the music.&quot;

The Revolution member Doctor Fink told &quot;PopMatters&quot; in 2009 the recording of the album was &quot;a very creative time... There was a lot of influence and input from band members towards what [Prince] was doing. He was always open to anybody trying to contribute creatively to the process of writing... But Prince was the main lyricist and melody maker for all the songs... and never took any lyrical content from people.&quot; Melvoin told &quot;Mojo&quot; in 1997 the band members were &quot;absolute musical equals in the sense that Prince respected us, and allowed us to contribute to the music without any interference... I think the secret to our working relationship was that we were very non-possessive about our ideas, as opposed to some other people that have worked with him.&quot;

Revolution members Fink, Coleman, and Melvoin helped write the album&#x27;s fourth track &quot;Computer Blue&quot;. Doctor Fink, who wrote a keyboard bass line for the track, said he &quot;started playing that main bass groove which later became &#x27;Computer Blue&#x27;. So the band [the Revolution] started grooving on it, and Prince started coming up with some stuff, then we recorded a rough version and he took it into the studio and just incorporated it all and made it fly that way. Wendy [Melvoin] and Lisa [Coleman] did some of the stuff on it. Prince borrowed the bridge/portal section from the then-unreleased Father&#x27;s Song, by his father jazz musician John L. Nelson, who had given him some music over the years to play around with. So the song was a real mixture of different people and influences.&quot;

The full band appears on six tracks: &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;Take Me With U&quot;, &quot;Computer Blue&quot;, &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m A Star&quot; and &quot;Purple Rain&quot; while the remaining three tracks are essentially solo performances by Prince. Apollonia sings co-lead on &quot;Take Me WithU&quot;. Three of the tracks include a string section arranged by Coleman and Prince which were conducted by Coleman and Melvoin: &quot;Take Me WithU&quot;, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m A Star&quot;, and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. The string players are violin and viola player Novi Novog and cellists David Coleman and Suzie Katayama.

==Early configurations==
Prince configured at least two unique track listings of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; prior to setting the final running order. November 7, 1983 and March 23, 1984, configurations are listed below. The early configuration included &quot;Wednesday&quot; (a song by Prince with Jill Jones) and &quot;Father&#x27;s Song&quot;. The latter was replaced by &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. Edits to &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;Computer Blue&quot; were introduced in order to include &quot;Take Me withU&quot; in the final running configuration. The full length version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, as it can be seen in the movie, would later be released as &quot;Special Dance Mix&quot; on 12&quot; maxi-single.

==Promotion==
===Artwork===
The album cover was photographed at the Warner Bros Studio Backlot in California. The area known as Hennesy St, designed to look like a New York tenement area, was the location of the balcony where the album photo was taken.

===Tour===
The Purple Rain Tour began at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit in November 1984. In addition to Prince and the Revolution, the Purple Rain Tour featured Apollonia6, and Sheila E. and her band. The tour opened with the album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;. Three singles from &quot;1999&quot; (1982) followed: &quot;Delirious&quot;, &quot;1999&quot; and &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;. An instrumental interlude of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; usually introduced another song from &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;Free&quot;. The B-side &quot;God&quot; was often played, followed by a usual sequence of &quot;Computer Blue&quot;, &quot;Darling Nikki&quot;, &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; and &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. As encores, the remaining &quot;Purple Rain&quot; songs closed the concert, &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m a Star&quot; and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

The tour spanned 98 shows, ending in April 1985, and sold 1.7 million tickets. Prince and the Revolution played the final date of the tour, to an audience of 55,000 in Miami&#x27;s Orange Bowl. Prince ended the show saying, &quot;I have to go now. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll be back. I want you to know that God loves you. He loves us all.&quot; Two weeks after the end of the tour, &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; (1985) was released, which officially brought an end to Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot; era. The tour was considered by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;groundbreaking in many ways&quot; because it introduced Prince&#x27;s most &quot;elaborate&quot; sets and featured occasional cameos from Bruce Springsteen and Madonna, which confirmed Prince&#x27;s place as &quot;pop&#x27;s most commanding star&quot; during the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; era.

===Singles===
&quot;Purple Rain&quot;&#x27;s lead single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was Prince&#x27;s first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single, staying there for five weeks, and was also a worldwide hit. It was ranked number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1984. The music video, directed by Prince himself, was premiered on MTV in June 1984. The video sparked controversy among network executives, who thought its sexual nature was too explicit for television.

The second single &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; became Prince&#x27;s second number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Common to much of Prince&#x27;s writing, the song is thought to be exhortation to follow Christian ethics, with the &quot;De-elevator&quot; of the lyrics being a metaphor for the Devil.

A power ballad and a combination of rock, R&amp;B, gospel, and orchestral music, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; reached number2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and stayed there for two weeks. 
&quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;, the fourth and final &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 hit from &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, reaching number eight on the chart. The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Take Me withU&quot;, was released on January 25, 1985.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Purple Rain&quot; was well received by contemporary critics. Kurt Loder, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1984, compared Prince to Jimi Hendrix and praised him for merging &quot;black and white styles&quot;: &quot;The spirit of Jimi Hendrix must surely smile down on Prince Rogers Nelson. Like Hendrix, Prince seems to have tapped into some extraterrestrial musical dimension where black and white styles are merely different aspects of the same funky thing. Prince&#x27;s rock &amp; roll is as authentic and compelling as his soul and his extremism is endearing in a era of play-it-safe record production and formulaic hit mongering.&quot;

At the end of 1984, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was voted the second best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. However, the newspaper&#x27;s chief critic and poll creator Robert Christgau was less impressed by the album, saying that while it is &quot;quirky, dangerous, [and] unabashedly pop&quot;, it is also plagued by &quot;despair&quot; and, &quot;for Prince ... ingratiatingly unsolipsistic&quot;, although he would later call it &quot;seriously gorgeous&quot;.

Prince and the Revolution won a 1984 Grammy Award for &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, the four composers (Nelson, Coleman, Prince, and Melvoin) won Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, and the album was nominated for Album of the Year. Prince won a third Grammy that year for Best R&amp;B Song for Chaka Khan&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Feel for You&quot;. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; also won an Oscar for Best Original Song Score in 1985. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; posthumously won Top Soundtrack at the American Music Awards in 2016.

Retrospective appraisals have also been positive. Music critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack&#x27;s music, most famously on the spare, bass-less &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances (some, as noted above, recorded live) along with its landmark consolidation of rock and R&amp;B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors.

Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Purple Rain&quot; finds Prince &quot;consolidating his funk and R&amp;B roots while moving boldly into pop, rock, and heavy metal&quot;, as well as &quot;push[ing] heavily into psychedelia&quot; under the influence of the Revolution. Erlewine identifies the record&#x27;s nine songs as &quot;uncompromising ... forays into pop&quot; and &quot;stylistic experiments&quot;, echoing general sentiment that &quot;Purple Rain&quot;″s music represented Prince at his most popular without forsaking his experimental bent. In a retrospective review, Kenneth Partridge, writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, described the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, as &quot;arguably the best intro in pop history&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; debuted at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week of July 14, 1984. After four weeks on chart, it reached number one on August 4, 1984. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 from August 4, 1984, to January 18, 1985, and more than 32 weeks in the top 10, becoming one of the most successful soundtracks ever. Prince also joined Elvis Presley and the Beatles in being the only artists to have the number-one album, single and film in the US all at the same time.

It traded the number-one position on the chart with Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; twice, during 1984 and 1985. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was present on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for one hundred twenty two weeks. After the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further three million copies. By 1996, the album had sold 13 million copies in the United States, making it certified 13× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number 21 on July 21, 1984, after thirty five weeks on the chart it reached and peaked at number seven during the week of March 16, 1985 and stayed there for a week, it fell off to number twelve the next week. The album remained on the chart for 86 weeks. It was certified 2× Platinum by the BPI on May 1, 1990, denoting shipments of 600,000 units. By 1988, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; had sold 17 million copies worldwide making it one of the most successful albums of the 1980s. Its sales as of 2008 stood at over 25million copies worldwide. The album is also multi-platinum in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;Purple Rain&quot; further established Prince as a figurehead for pop music of the 1980s and is regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2010, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2012, the album was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that &quot;are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot;. In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Carvell Wallace appraised the album&#x27;s impact and Prince&#x27;s musicianship, &quot;With &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, Prince bursts forth from the ghetto created by mainstream radio and launches himself directly onto the Mt. Rushmore of American music. He plays rock better than rock musicians, composes better than jazz guys, and performs better than everyone, all without ever abandoning his roots as a funk man, a party leader, a true MC... for the 24 weeks &quot;Purple Rain&quot; spent atop the charts in 1984, the black kid from the midwest had managed to become the most accurate expression we had of young America&#x27;s overabundance of angst, love, horniness, recklessness, idealism, and hope.&quot;

Partridge of &quot;Billboard&quot; emphasized Prince&#x27;s popularity during the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; era, writing,

Described as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; by the Grammy Awards, Ana Yglesias wrote, &quot;Even after his heartbreaking passing, Prince will live on forever in our hearts, through his music, and even on the charts. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was inducted into Grammy Hall of Fame in 2011, celebrating it as a &#x27;recording of lasting qualitative or historical significance&#x27;... It is safe to say there will never be another star quite like Prince.&quot; For &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Ben Greenmane wrote, &quot;&quot;Purple Rain&quot; may or may not be Prince&#x27;s best record, but it came at the best time, propelling him from ordinary stardom (his previous album &quot;1999&quot; put three singles into the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20) to supernova status. It created his iconic look (ruffled shirt, purple jacket, motorcycle), formally introduced his most famous backing band (the Revolution), and included the lion&#x27;s share of the songs most likely to appear in a capsule bio (&#x27;When Doves Cry&#x27;, &#x27;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&#x27;, and the title track).&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 25 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was described as &quot;an epic celebration of everything rock &amp; roll, which means sex and religion and eyeliner and motorcycles and guitars and Lake Minnetonka&quot;.

Chris Gerard wrote for &quot;PopMatters&quot; that &quot;&quot;Purple Rain&quot; is one of the cornerstone albums not just of the 80s, but in all of pop/rock history... at the core of [Prince&#x27;s] legacy &quot;Purple Rain&quot; will always stand as his signature triumph, a monument to his boundless talent and ambition.&quot; Gerard also praised &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; for being the &quot;gateway&quot; to the &quot;&quot;Purple Rain&quot; universe: an album, a major motion picture, and a tour that dominated the pop culture landscape of 1984&quot;. Andrew Unterberger of &quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album high appraisal, regarding it as one of the greatest albums in popular music: &quot;&quot;Purple Rain&quot; is certainly in contention for the most perfect album in rock or pop history, expertly flowing from track to track while delighting, surprising and astounding at each bend. Personal and universal, familiar and challenging, romantic and narcissistic, religious and orgasmic, accessible to all and profoundly weird, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; rightly remains the cornerstone of Prince&#x27;s recorded legacy, almost too obvious in its brilliance to even be worth discussing at length.&quot;

Jon Bon Jovi, lead singer of the rock band Bon Jovi, observed that &quot;There&#x27;s every emotion [in &quot;Purple Rain&quot;] from the ballad to the rocker&quot; and &quot;All the influences were evident, from Hendrix to Chic.&quot; Lionel Richie praised Prince for making a &quot;very important step&quot; in advancing the concept from creating music videos for songs to making a motion picture for an album.

===Accolades===

He was the fourth son of Sir Richard Carr Glyn, 1st Baronet, of Gaunt&#x27;s House, Lord Mayor of London in 1798, himself the fourth son of Sir Richard Glyn, 1st Baronet, of Ewell, Lord Mayor of London in 1758. Lord Wolverton was succeeded by the eldest of his nine sons, the second Baron. He was a Liberal politician and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Paymaster General and as Postmaster General. He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the third Baron. He was the eldest son of Vice-Admiral the Hon. Henry Carr Glyn, younger son of the first Baron.

He served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 1902 to 1905 in the Conservative administration of Arthur Balfour. On the death in 1988 of his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Baron, this line of the family failed. The title was inherited by the late Baron&#x27;s second cousin, the sixth Baron. He was the grandson of the Hon. Pascoe Glyn, younger son of the first Baron. the title is held by his grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded in 2011.

Several other members of the Glyn family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Pascoe Glyn, younger son of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Dorset East. The Hon. Sidney Glyn, younger son of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury. The Right Reverend the Hon. Edward Glyn, younger son of the first Baron, was Bishop of Peterborough and the father of Ralph Glyn, 1st Baron Glyn. The Hon.

<text>Acoustical intelligence (ACOUSTINT, sometimes ACINT) is an intelligence gathering discipline that collects and processes acoustic phenomena. It is a subdiscipline of MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence).

This uses broadband and narrowband analysis of acquired acoustic signatures from surface ships and submarines, although it can also be used for low-flying aircraft such as helicopters. Broadband analysis concerns the overall noise created by a platform, whereas narrowband analysis examines the spectra of the received energy at a more precise level.

Broadband analysis is useful for identifying any vessel at a long range, whereas narrowband analysis is generally more useful for identifying the category, type and ideally the individual vessel name. The category might be for example differentiating between a commercial vessel and a warship; the type might be narrowing this down to an individual class and hence identifying nationality, and the individual name might identify the specific ship or submarine. 

As a simple example, narrowband analysis might identify whether a subject of interest has single or multiple propeller shafts; how many blades per shaft and other salients that may help identify the platform. This may include the fundamental or harmonic emissions based on the electric services used, the gearing between shaft and engine and also the combination of gear teeth used in the ratio(s). For nuclear vessels, necessary pump frequencies can be detected. It is possible for an expert to work out how many gears, teeth and ratios are used from engine right through to propeller; this can be used to identify a particular type. Sometimes, there are machining faults - however small - introduced at the manufacturing stage. This can help to identify individual platforms.

<text>Dawn Coe-Jones (October 19, 1960 – November 12, 2016) was a Canadian professional golfer who played on the LPGA Tour, and a member of the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame. She was the first female Canadian golfer to surpass $1million in career earnings, announcing the arrival of Canadian female golfers upon the world stage in the 1990s.

==Early years==
Coe-Jones was born in Campbell River, British Columbia. Growing up in Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island, she worked as a teenager at March Meadows Golf Course in Honeymoon Bay.

She had an outstanding amateur career, scoring back-to-back wins in the B.C. Junior tournament in 1978 and 1979 and the B.C. Amateur in 1982 and 1983. She capped her 1983 season with the Canadian Women&#x27;s Amateur title and won NCAA all-American honours at Lamar University. She won a scholarship in her sophomore year and graduated in 1983 with a degree in elementary education.

==Professional career==
Her first LPGA win came at the Women&#x27;s Kemper Open in 1992. Coe-Jones was accompanied by caddie and childhood friend Kelly Feltrin, who was on her bag when she won the Kemper. She went on to claim the 1994 LPGA Palm Beach Classic and 1995 Tournament of Champions. Her best score ever was 63 at the Safeco Classic in 1998. In 1993, she became the first female golfer to sink an albatross in a women&#x27;s major.

Coe-Jones played on the LPGA Tour from 1984 to 2008, winning three tournaments, and over $3 million in career earnings. She competed in over 20 Canadian Women&#x27;s Opens. Her best chance to win her national open was in 1993, when she was third behind Brandie Burton and Betsy King at London Hunt. She tied for fourth with Canadian Gail Graham in 1998 in Windsor, Ontario.

Coe-Jones made her farewell appearance at the CN Canadian Open in 2008, finishing 14-over after two rounds and missing the cut.

==Personal==
She competed under her maiden name, Dawn Coe, until her marriage to Jimmy Jones in November 1992. She moved to Tampa from Texas in 1992 to be near the man she would marry that year, Jimmy Jones, and friends from the tour. Their son James was born three years later.

Coe-Jones&#x27; favourite hockey team growing up was the Montreal Canadiens, but after living in Florida for many years she adopted the Tampa Bay Lightning. She was present for their 2004 Stanley Cup victory.

==Death==
She died of chondrosarcoma, a form of bone cancer at a hospice on November 12, 2016, near her home in Tampa, Florida, aged 56.

She is survived by her husband, Jimmy, son, Jimmy, in-laws Sandy and General James Jones, and brothers Mark and John Coe. Her son is a college golfer at the University of South Florida and winner of the 2015 Florida State Amateur.

==Legacy==
The inaugural Dawn Coe-Jones Golf Classic was held in October 2016 to raise funds for Sarcoma research in her name.

==Honours==
Coe-Jones was inducted into the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 2003, and the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.

<text>Erigoninae are the largest subfamily of sheet weavers (Linyphiidae), which is itself the second largest spider family. In the United States they are known as dwarf spiders, while they are called money spiders in England. The exact taxonomic limits of the subfamily are not yet known.

Erigoninae are the most numerous of the sheet weavers, with more than 2,000 described species.

Many species live in leaf litter and build minute sheet webs.

These spiders probably are more important as members of the beneficial complex of predators in agroecosystems than is generally known.
One species, &quot;Atypena formosana&quot;, lives in colonies in wetland habitats, where it builds nets just above the water line in rice fields to hunt planthopper nymphs.

The most well-known genus is &quot;Erigone&quot;.

==Description==
Most are very small (some less than 1 mm, very few up to 6 mm) spiders that balloon both as spiderlings and adults.

Many males have bizarre projections on their carapaces, including lobes, turrets, grooves, pits and modified hairs. The function of these projections is little understood, but is presumed to be involved with courtship. In a few species the females have been observed to grip the males by the pits or grooves during copulation, using their chelicerae. They later ingested secretions produced by the male prosomic glands after depositing saliva-like fluid on them.

==Distribution==
More than 300 species occur in northern Europe, comprising about one fourth of the spider fauna there. About 650 are known from North America. While they are the dominant spider group of the temperate and cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere they are less diverse in the Southern Hemisphere. No native species have been found from New Zealand and Australia.

<text>Blonde Redhead is an American alternative rock band composed of Kazu Makino (vocals, keyboards, rhythm guitar) and identical twin brothers Simone (drums, keyboards) and Amedeo Pace (lead guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals) that formed in New York City in 1993. The band&#x27;s earliest albums were noted for their noise rock influences, though their sound evolved by the early 2000s with the releases of &quot;Misery is a Butterfly&quot; (2004) and &quot;23&quot; (2007), which both incorporated elements of dream pop, shoegaze and other genres. They have released ten studio albums and have toured internationally.

==Career==
Amedeo and Simone Pace were born in Milan, Italy, and grew up in Montreal (Saint-Léonard), but later moved to Boston to study jazz. After earning Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, they entered the New York City underground music scene. Blonde Redhead formed in New York in 1993 after Amedeo and Simone met Kazu Makino, a film student at the time, through mutual friends. John Lurie stated in his memoir that he introduced the twins to Kazu, a long time friend. The band named themselves after a song on the 1981 EP &quot;A Taste of DNA&quot; by the no wave group DNA. For the group&#x27;s first decade, Amedeo and Makino were romantically involved.

Blonde Redhead&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1995. Shortly afterwards, fourth member Maki Takahashi left the band and was replaced by her friend Toko Yasuda as bassist. Yasuda played on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;La Mia Vita Violenta&quot; also released in 1995. Both records appeared on the New York label Smells Like. The band continued as a trio.

Their third album, &quot;Fake Can Be Just as Good&quot;, was released through Touch &amp; Go in 1997. The band enlisted the help of Vern Rumsey of Unwound, who filled the role of guest bassist, while the subsequent albums have featured the Icelandic musician Skúli Sverrisson.

On their fourth album, &quot;In an Expression of the Inexpressible&quot;, Guy Picciotto of Fugazi was hired as producer. Picciotto also contributed in the construction to the song &quot;Futurism vs. Passéism Part 2&quot; as well as lending it his vocals to the 1998 release. In 2000 Picciotto also co-produced &quot;Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons&quot; with Ryan Hadlock, an album about the relationship between Makino and Amedeo Pace.

The four-year delay between &quot;Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons&quot; and &quot;Misery Is a Butterfly&quot; is attributed to Makino&#x27;s recovery time after being trampled by a horse. Much of the visual and lyrical imagery of &quot;Misery Is a Butterfly&quot; is reflective of the accident, especially in the music video for &quot;Equus.&quot; It was the last time Picciotto produced the band.

In 2006 Makino recorded vocals for the film &quot;Sisters&quot;. Alan Moulder mixed the trio&#x27;s album &quot;23&quot; which was released on 4AD, in April 2007.

In mid-2008, they wrote and recorded the score of the documentary feature film &quot;The Dungeon Masters&quot;. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released on February 12, 2010; a soundtrack album was released in July 2010. In 2009, Blonde Redhead collaborated with Devestations on &quot;When the Road Runs Out&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

In March 2010 the band included a demo version of the song &quot;Not Getting There&quot; on a 4AD sampler entitled &quot;Fragments From Work In Progress&quot;. Their eighth album, &quot;Penny Sparkle&quot;, was released in September 2010 through 4AD. The album was again mixed by Alan Moulder, and reached 79 in the Billboard 200 chart. For the subsequent tour the band added a key-board player. The band released a six-track remix EP in July 2011.

A year later, the band started the project for their next album but without the support of 4AD. Self-financed, the band embarked on a haphazard recording schedule with producer Drew Brown. Simone Pace noted about Brown&#x27;s involvement that &quot;he has so much experience and definitely dictated the direction of the record; the choices of instruments, concept and that it was minimal.&quot; He forced the band to use analogue instruments.

In April 2014 their song &quot;For the Damaged Coda&quot; was used in an episode of the first season of the cartoon Rick and Morty. The use of this song was again repeated in April 2017 in the third season. The use of the song became an important plot device regarding the character &quot;Evil Morty&quot; for the series. Around 2018 this song became an Internet meme expressing the sadness one feels at the worst moments of one&#x27;s life.

The band released their ninth album, &quot;Barragán&quot;, on September 2, 2014, through Kobalt. It was preceded by the single &quot;No More Honey&quot; that appeared in June. It was followed by the second single, &quot;Dripping,&quot; which included a video. The band also provided the soundtrack to the Danish film &quot;The Commentator&quot;.

In June 2016 it was announced that the band would release the box set &quot;Masculin Féminin&quot; on September 30 through The Numero Group. It contains 37 tracks, which cover the first two albums, associated singles, radio sessions and unreleased demos from the period. In 2017, the band released the EP &quot;3 O&#x27;Clock&quot;, which comprises four songs and featured contributions from Eyvind Kang, Michael Leonhart, Sam Owens and Mauro Refosco, among others.

In September 2019, Kazu Makino released her first solo album, &quot;Adult Baby&quot;, which featured Ryuichi Sakamoto (on piano, field recordings, and &quot;organic instruments&quot;), Ian Chang and Greg Saunier (drums), and Mauro Refosco (percussion).

The band toured the US in 2022 on select dates supporting Tool. The following year, the band announced the release of their tenth album, &quot;Sit Down for Dinner&quot;, on September 29, 2023, through section1. In November, they released a reworked version of &quot;Damaged Coda&quot; entitled &quot;More Coda&quot; for &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. On June 14, 2024, Blonde Redhead performed at the Forum Melbourne in Melbourne, appearing as part of the 2024 RISING: festival, supported by Melbourne-based singer, Georgia Knight.

<text>The Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) is a public community college in New York City. Founded in 1963 as part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system, BMCC grants associate degrees in a wide variety of vocational, business, health, science, engineering and continuing education fields.

BMCC&#x27;s original campus was scattered all over midtown Manhattan, utilizing office spaces, hotel conference rooms, and various spaces throughout Manhattan. In the mid-1970s, CUNY began scouting for suitable property on which to erect a new campus of its own. The current campus has been in use since 1983.

==History==
Martin B. Dworkis was BMCC&#x27;s first president. Classes were originally held in part of the ground floor, the entire second floor, and part of the third floor of an office building at 131 West 50th Street in midtown Manhattan. BMCC renovated the office space into classrooms and administrative areas, and it created its own entrance at 134 West 51st Street. Fred Kelly, a graphic designer living in Kew Gardens, designed BMCC&#x27;s official seal. BMCC&#x27;s first classes were held in fall 1964. During its first school year, 42 percent of its students were African American.

Plans were announced for BMCC to have its own buildings to hold its classes in 1968. In 1974, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools determined that BMCC&#x27;s physical facilities were &quot;so inadequate as to defy description&quot;, and it said it would suspend BMCC&#x27;s accreditation unless improvements were made quickly. The City University of New York&#x27;s central administration evaluated BMCC the same year, and it found that student grades were inflated to such an extent that they were essentially meaningless. There was a ground-breaking ceremony on a new building for BMCC the same year. Because of the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, however, construction was suspended the next year. In 1977, BMCC&#x27;s president, Edgar D. Draper, was fired after he improperly persuaded a college association evaluation team to alter its report to show the college administration more favorably. By 1980, BMCC&#x27;s passing rates on nursing certification exams had significantly improved, and BMCC no longer had a financial deficit. BMCC&#x27;s new campus building opened in January 1983. A 15-story building at 30 West Broadway was donated to BMCC in 1993 by Miles and Shirley Fiterman; the building was subsequently named Fiterman Hall in their honor.
On the morning of September 11, 2001, BMCC&#x27;s students, teachers, and staff members heard explosions coming from the direction of the World Trade Center, which was located just a few blocks away. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey used the gymnasium at BMCC&#x27;s main building to triage survivors, and BMCC donated medical supplies from BMCC&#x27;s Nursing Department to treat victims. The Port Authority set up generators at BMCC&#x27;s main building, and the building became its command center. That afternoon, 7 World Trade Center, across the street from BMCC&#x27;s Fiterman Hall, collapsed, and the building fell onto Fiterman Hall, rendering the hall uninhabitable. BMCC&#x27;s staff worked constantly to restore Fiterman Hall and, on October 1, the building reopened for classes. The hall was eventually demolished and a new building opened in September 2012.

==Academics==
BMCC has also recorded a large rise in remedial education, lack of freshman retention, and overcrowding. Due to its larger base of capital compared to most other two-year colleges, expansion of new campuses during the rebuilding of Fiterman Hall was possible. Several trailers are still used as classrooms to help expand capacity. Internal programs have also been created or expanded to help with academic advisement, provide online access for registration, transferring to other colleges, and job placement.

BMCC also has a diverse student base, some of whom had immigrated to America shortly before enrolling. Among other issues are improving the retention and graduation rate, as well as the increased financial and academic burdens of a remedial program.

==Campus==

Borough of Manhattan Community College&#x27;s four main campuses are in the Tribeca, Civic Center, and Financial District neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. BMCC occasionally hosts the Tribeca Film Festival&#x27;s ceremonies and films. The main campus on 4.28 acres is located in Chambers Street, North Moore Street and covers a four block radius. It houses a swimming pool and gymnasium as well as technical facilities, computer laboratories, and a media centre.

===Downtown/Tribeca campus===
*199 Chambers Street, New York, NY 10008 – Main Campus 
*245 Greenwich Street (North entrance), 81 Barclay Street (South entrance); New York, NY 10007 – Fiterman Hall 
*70 Murray Street, New York, NY 10008 – Chambers Street

====Fiterman Hall====
The original Fiterman Hall opened in 1959 and occupied a block bounded by Greenwich Street, Barclay Street, West Broadway, and Park Place. It had been the original location of King&#x27;s College, before it was renamed Columbia University and moved to Morningside Heights. Fiterman Hall was donated to BMCC in 1993 by Miles and Shirley Fiterman, for whom the building was subsequently named. The building had previously been used as a bank, and CUNY had wanted to rent the building from the Fitermans, but they decided to donate the building to CUNY instead. It was the largest gift of a building to a community college in the United States, and it was the largest donation ever to CUNY. The building was renamed Miles and Shirley Fiterman Hall. In 2000, the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, which owned the building, began a massive renovation to better adapt the building for classroom use.

During the September 11 attacks, the building&#x27;s structure was heavily compromised by debris from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center, and the renovation was never completed. The building became unsafe to occupy because of exposed asbestos and mold growth. Since traditional demolition would result in an unacceptable environmental impact, the building was scheduled for deconstruction and decontamination as a part of the Lower Manhattan redevelopment project.

Fiterman Hall was to be replaced by a new building designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners after the deconstruction, and was scheduled to be completed by February 2007. However, environmental impact concerns and funding issues caused numerous delays. At a press conference at BMCC on November 13, 2008, city and state officials announced a new agreement that revised demolition and reconstruction plans through a funding agreement among New York City, New York State, and the City University of New York. In addition, approximately $80 million from an insurance settlement would be applied to the project&#x27;s budget. Under the plan, the building was demolished and rebuilt in November 2009, and the new Fiterman Hall was completed in September 2012.

===Off-site programs===
* Brooklyn College
* CUNY in the Heights
* John Jay College
* Lehman College
* Long Island University Brooklyn
* St. John&#x27;s University Manhattan

==Athletics==
College teams of the BMCC participate as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). The Panthers are a member of the community college section of the City University of New York Athletic Conference (CUNYAC). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, soccer and swimming; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, soccer, swimming and volleyball.

BMCC offers a large state-of-the-art recreation facility including a regulation basketball court, swimming pool, and weight room. There are active teams in many sports such as handball, bowling, baseball, soccer, and basketball. Sports teams compete in both the CUNY athletic system and the local NJCAA collegiate sports system. The women&#x27;s basketball team has won numerous championships including the CUNY basketball championship and the regional Division III championships including placing third nationally in 2000 with a 21–3 regular season record. The chess team has won national awards. One of the most successful programs at BMCC is the men&#x27;s soccer team with 6 consecutive wins at CUNY soccer championships, 1 regional Division III championship, and placing third in the NJCAA national championship in 2005.

<doc id="505083" wikidata="Q1232580" url="?curid=505083" title="Grattius">
<text>Grattius (or Gratius) Faliscus was a Roman poet who flourished during the life of Augustus (63 BC – 14 AD). He is known as the author of a &quot;Cynegetica&quot;, a poem on hunting.

==Life==
The only reference to Grattius in any extant ancient writer is a passing reference in Ovid, &quot;Ex Ponto&quot;: 
:&quot;Tityrus antiquas et erat qui pasceret herbas &lt;br&gt;Aptaque venanti Gratius arma daret.&quot;

Some lines by Manilius have been supposed to allude to Grattius, but the terms in which they are expressed are too vague to warrant such a conclusion. According to Johann Christian Wernsdorf, who argued from the name, he must have been a slave or a freedman. The cognomen, or epithet, Faliscus, from which it has been inferred that he was a native of Falerii was first introduced by Barth, on the authority of a manuscript which no one else ever saw, and probably originated in a forced interpretation of one of the lines in the poem, &quot;At contra nostris imbellia lina Faliscis&quot; (5.40). William Ramsay argued that in the context, &quot;nostris&quot; here denotes merely &quot;Italian&quot;, in contradistinction to the various foreign tribes spoken of in the preceding verses.

==Cynegeticon==
541 hexameter lines of Grattius&#x27;s poem about hunting are preserved in a manuscript of c. 800 AD. The work describes various kinds of game, methods of hunting, and the best breeds of horses and dogs, using a fairly regular hexameter to do so. Grattius stresses the role of &quot;ratio&quot; (reason) in hunting, seeing it as a civilising endeavour in the tradition of Hercules, as opposed to indulgence in luxuria.

===Contents===
The poem, entitled &quot;Cynegeticon Liber&quot;, professes to set forth the apparatus (&quot;arma&quot;) necessary for the sportsman, and the manner in which the various requisites for the pursuit of game are to be procured, prepared, and preserved (&quot;artes armorum&quot;). Among the &quot;arma&quot; of the hunter are included not only nets, gins, snares (&quot;retia, pedicae, laquei&quot;), darts and spears (&quot;jacula, venabula&quot;), but also horses and dogs, and a large portion of the undertaking (verses 150–430) is devoted to a systematic account of the different kinds of hounds and horses.

The matter and arrangement of the treatise are derived in a great measure from Xenophon, although information was drawn from other ancient sources, such as Dercylus the Arcadian, and Hagnon of Boeotia.

===Appraisal===
According to Ramsay, the language of the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; is pure, and not unworthy of the age to which it belongs, but there is frequently a harshness in the structure of the periods, a strange and unauthorised use of particular words, and a general want of distinctness, which, in addition to a very corrupt text, render it a task of great difficulty to determine the exact meaning of many passages. Although considerable skill is manifested in the combination of the parts – Ramsay continues – the author did not possess sufficient power to overcome the obstacles which were triumphantly combated by Virgil.

It is remarkable that both the second-century poets Oppianus and Nemesianus arrogate to themselves the honour of having entered upon a path altogether untrodden. Whether we believe them to be sincere and ignorant, or suspect them of deliberate dishonesty, their bold assertion is sufficient to prove that the poem of Grattius had in their day become almost totally unknown.

===Editions===
The Cynegetica has been transmitted to modern times through the medium of a single manuscript, which was brought from Gaul to Italy by Actius Sannazarius about the beginning of the sixteenth century, and contained also the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; of Nemesianus, and the &quot;Halieutica&quot; ascribed to Ovid. A second copy of the first 159 lines was found by Jan van Vliet appended to another manuscript of the Halieutics.

The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was printed at Venice in February 1534, by Aldus Manutius, in a volume that included the &quot;Halieutica&quot; of Ovid, the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; and &quot;Carmen Bucolicum&quot; of Nemesianus, the Buolica of Calpurnius Siculus, and the &quot;Venatio&quot; of Hadrianus. This edition was reprinted at Augsburg in July of the same year. The best editions are those contained in the &quot;Poetae Latini Minores&quot; of Pieter Burmann the Elder (vol. i. Lug. Bat. 1731), and of Wernsdorf (vol. i. p. 6, 293, ii. p. 34, iv. pt. ii. p. 790, 806, v. pt. iii. p. 1445), whose introductions provide all the requisite preliminary information.

===Translations===
A translation into English verse with notes, and the Latin text, by Christopher Wase, was published at London in 1654, and a translation into German, also metrical, by S. E. G. Perlet, at Leipzig, in 1826.

<text>A module in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is an adventure published by TSR. The term is usually applied to adventures published for all &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games before 3rd Edition. For 3rd Edition and beyond new publisher Wizards of the Coast uses the term adventure. For a list of published 3rd, 4th, and 5th Edition Adventures see List of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures. For description and history of Adventures/Modules see Adventure (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). Adventures for various campaign settings are listed in different articles, including Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Mystara, Kara-Tur, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Al-Qadim, Dark Sun, Planescape, Birthright, and Eberron. Note that this article includes the modules for most of those campaign settings; it excludes most modules for Forgotten Realms, Al-Qadim, and Planescape.

The modules listed here are in three separate lists of official TSR &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; modules only.
The coded modules (1978–1994) are listed by module code.
Modules made after the code system was dropped (1993–2000) are displayed in alphabetical order.
Note: There is considerable overlap caused by the transition period and early pre-advertising for some modules.
==Coded modules (1978–1994)==
Module codes in brackets indicate implied codes either by earlier advertising or place in a series; some of these modules did not actually have codes printed on the cover.

===A===
A—Aerie of the Slave Lords is a linked campaign of four &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st Ed.) modules created for Gen Con XIII and set in Greyhawk. They can also form an extended campaign following T and followed by G and Q.

AC—ACcessory Modules is a series of accessory items for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; (Basic/Expert/Companion/Master), many of which included mini-adventures. They are generally associated with Mystara albeit quite generic.

===B===
B—Basic were designed for use with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Basic set. Mostly they are independent adventures, set in Mystara.
===C===
C—Competition modules for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st) are specially designed for competition play and come with a scoring system for player actions.

CA—City of Adventure for AD&amp;D (1st) require the &quot;Lankhmar: City of Adventure&quot; supplement to play.

CB—Conan the Barbarian modules for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st) tie in with the Conan movies.
CM—CoMpanion is for use with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Companion Set&quot; (or &quot;Rules Cyclopedia&quot;), and were set in Mystara.
===D===
D—Drow is a linked campaign of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st Ed) modules created for Gen Con XI set in Greyhawk. They can also form an extended campaign following T, A, and G, and followed by Q.

DA—Dave Arneson is set in Blackmoor for Expert Set

DDA—Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure for Basic Set, set in Mystara.

DL—Dragonlance introduced the Dragonlance campaign. They are linked series traditional modules for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st Ed) except where noted.


DLA—Dragonlance Adventure trilogy of linked adventures are set on the lost continent of Taladas in the Dragonlance world, for 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;.
DLC—Dragonlance Classics collects the original Dragonlance modules, revised for 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;.
DL(E/Q/S/T)—Dragonlance (Epic/Quest/Saga/Tales) for 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;.
DQ—DragonQuest is compatible with both &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st Edition) or DragonQuest RPG
DS(Q/E)—Dark Sun (Quest/Epic) is a set of linked modules that require Dark Sun campaign setting.
DSM—Dark Sun Mission is a set of linked modules that require the Dark Sun campaign setting.
===E===
EX—EXtension Series are &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; modules designed as a &quot;tack-on&quot; adventure set in Greyhawk.
===G===
G—Giants is a linked campaign of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (1st Ed) module(s) created for Origins &#x27;78 set in Greyhawk. They can also form an extended campaign following A, and followed by D.
GA—General Adventure for 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, not specific to any campaign setting.
GAZ—GAZetteer The GAZ series described countries in the Known World of Mystara, using the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Basic and Expert Set rules, although beginning with GAZ07, rules for adapting to &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; are provided. However the 15th product in this Mystara Gazetteer series, &quot;Dawn of the Emperors: Thyatis and Alphatia&quot;, was instead sold as a boxed set without an official GAZ-module code.
===H===
H—The Bloodstone Pass Saga is a linked campaign series that focuses on using Battlesystem battles in Forgotten Realms &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; adventures.
HHQ—Head to Head Quest modules for 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; are designed for one Player and a DM

HW—Hollow World set in Mystara.
===I===
I—Intermediate, for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, mostly separate adventures though some sequels do exist within the series.

IM—Immortal, for use with &quot;D&amp;D Immortals Set&quot;. Set in Mystara.

===L===
L—Lendore Isles was Lenard Lakofka&#x27;s campaign that was made part of Greyhawk. It was originally planned to be a series of five linked modules, but only three were ever published.

LN(A/Q/R)—Lankhmar/Nehwon (Adventure/Quest/Reference) independent adventures for use with Lankhmar City of Adventure box set.
===M===
M—Master for use with the Master &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules, set in Mystara.

===N===
N—Novice
===O===
O—One on one (one player one master) set in Mystara.

OP—Outer Planes for use with the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Manual of the Planes.
===Q===
Q—Queen of the Demonweb Pits single module conclusion to the G and D series
===R===
R—Role Playing Game Association tournament modules, R1–6 were also available to RPGA members. R1–4 were later revised and abridged as I12. Mentzer initially intended the &quot;R&quot; series to take place in Greyhawk (on a different continent from Oerik) as part of an &quot;Acquaria&quot; or &quot;Aqua-Oeridian&quot; campaign. The original concept was to use these modules to form the basis of a new Greyhawk boxed set, although TSR never went forward with these plans and as such the modules are not officially for Greyhawk.

RA—Ravenloft / RQ—Ravenloft Quests TSR changed coding for sales purposes. Grand Conjunction Campaign was developed after the first 3 modules were made
RM—Ravenloft Missions TSR changed coding again for sales purposes 

RPGA—Role Playing Game Association tournament modules, also available to RPGA members. This series was later revised and reprinted as B7, C4 &amp; C5.

===U===
U—Underwater a linked trilogy set in Greyhawk, published in the UK.

UK—United Kingdom a series of mostly independent adventures developed by the TSR UK office

===W===
WG—World of Greyhawk was a series of stand-alone adventures set in Greyhawk for 1st edition except as noted. No modules were ever assigned codes WG1–WG3. WG1 was earmarked for &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; (T1), and WG2 was earmarked for &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; (T1-4). WG3 was to be &quot;Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot; (S4), a loosely tied predecessor to WG4. WG7 was advertised during summer 1986 as &quot;Shadowlords&quot;, a collaboration between Gary Gygax and Skip Williams. Gygax&#x27;s lawsuit with TSR put &quot;Shadowlords&quot; in limbo, and it was replaced with &quot;Castle Greyhawk&quot;.
WGA—World of Greyhawk Adventure 
WGM—World of Greyhawk Mission
WGQ—World of Greyhawk Quest
WGR—World of Greyhawk Reference is a mix of adventures and background information.
WGS—World of Greyhawk Swords was originally intended as a trilogy. The planned third module became instead the Greyhawk Wars boxed wargame.
===X===
X—eXpert series was for use with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set&quot; except where noted and set in Mystara.

<doc id="505088" wikidata="Q2997817" url="?curid=505088" title="Perfect field">
<text>In algebra, a field &quot;k&quot; is perfect if any one of the following equivalent conditions holds:
* Every irreducible polynomial over &quot;k&quot; has no multiple roots in any field extension &quot;F/k&quot;.
* Every irreducible polynomial over &quot;k&quot; has non-zero formal derivative.
* Every irreducible polynomial over &quot;k&quot; is separable.
* Every finite extension of &quot;k&quot; is separable.
* Every algebraic extension of &quot;k&quot; is separable.
* Either &quot;k&quot; has characteristic 0, or, when &quot;k&quot; has characteristic , every element of &quot;k&quot; is a &quot;p&quot;th power.
* Either &quot;k&quot; has characteristic 0, or, when &quot;k&quot; has characteristic , the Frobenius endomorphism is an automorphism of &quot;k&quot;.
* The separable closure of &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed.
* Every reduced commutative &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a separable algebra; i.e., formula_1 is reduced for every field extension &quot;F&quot;/&quot;k&quot;. (see below)
Otherwise, &quot;k&quot; is called imperfect.

In particular, all fields of characteristic zero and all finite fields are perfect.

Perfect fields are significant because Galois theory over these fields becomes simpler, since the general Galois assumption of field extensions being separable is automatically satisfied over these fields (see third condition above).

Another important property of perfect fields is that they admit Witt vectors.

More generally, a ring of characteristic &quot;p&quot; (&quot;p&quot; a prime) is called perfect if the Frobenius endomorphism is an automorphism. (When restricted to integral domains, this is equivalent to the above condition &quot;every element of &quot;k&quot; is a &quot;p&quot;th power&quot;.)

==Examples==

Examples of perfect fields are: 
* every field of characteristic zero, so formula_2 and every finite extension, and formula_3;
* every finite field formula_4;
* every algebraically closed field;
* the union of a set of perfect fields totally ordered by extension;
* fields algebraic over a perfect field.

Most fields that are encountered in practice are perfect. The imperfect case arises mainly in algebraic geometry in characteristic . Every imperfect field is necessarily transcendental over its prime subfield (the minimal subfield), because the latter is perfect.

An example of an imperfect field is the field formula_5 of rational polynomials in an unknown element formula_6. This can be seen from the fact that the Frobenius endomorphism sends formula_7 and therefore is not surjective. Equivalently, one can show that the polynomial formula_8, which is an element of formula_9, is irreducible but inseparable.

This field embeds into the perfect field
:formula_10

called its perfection. Imperfect fields cause technical difficulties because irreducible polynomials can become reducible in the algebraic closure of the base field. For example, consider formula_11 for formula_12 an imperfect field of characteristic formula_13 and &quot;a&quot; not a &quot;p&quot;-th power in &quot;k&quot;. Then in its algebraic closure formula_14, the following equality holds:
:formula_15
where &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and such &quot;b&quot; exists in this algebraic closure. Geometrically, this means that formula_16 does not define an affine plane curve in formula_17.

== Field extension over a perfect field ==
Any finitely generated field extension &quot;K&quot; over a perfect field &quot;k&quot; is separably generated, i.e. admits a separating transcendence base, that is, a transcendence base Γ such that &quot;K&quot; is separably algebraic over &quot;k&quot;(Γ).

==Perfect closure and perfection==
One of the equivalent conditions says that, in characteristic &quot;p&quot;, a field adjoined with all &quot;p&quot;-th roots () is perfect; it is called the perfect closure of &quot;k&quot; and usually denoted by formula_18.

The perfect closure can be used in a test for separability. More precisely, a commutative &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot; is separable if and only if formula_19 is reduced.

In terms of universal properties, the perfect closure of a ring &quot;A&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot; is a perfect ring &quot;Ap&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot; together with a ring homomorphism such that for any other perfect ring &quot;B&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot; with a homomorphism there is a unique homomorphism such that &quot;v&quot; factors through &quot;u&quot; (i.e. ). The perfect closure always exists; the proof involves &quot;adjoining &quot;p&quot;-th roots of elements of &quot;A&quot;&quot;, similar to the case of fields.

The perfection of a ring &quot;A&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot; is the dual notion (though this term is sometimes used for the perfect closure). In other words, the perfection &quot;R&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) of &quot;A&quot; is a perfect ring of characteristic &quot;p&quot; together with a map such that for any perfect ring &quot;B&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot; equipped with a map , there is a unique map such that &quot;φ&quot; factors through &quot;θ&quot; (i.e. ). The perfection of &quot;A&quot; may be constructed as follows. Consider the projective system
:formula_20
where the transition maps are the Frobenius endomorphism. The inverse limit of this system is &quot;R&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) and consists of sequences (&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;x&quot;1, ... ) of elements of &quot;A&quot; such that formula_21 for all &quot;i&quot;. The map sends (&quot;xi&quot;) to &quot;x&quot;0.

<text>Baron Northbrook, of Stratton in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1866 for the Liberal politician and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Francis Baring, 3rd Baronet. The holders of the barony represent the genealogically senior branch of the prominent Baring family. The name Northbrook is derived from a tithing of the local parish.

==History==
The holders of the barony descend from Francis Baring, whose father had emigrated to Great Britain from Germany. Francis was the founder of the family firm that grew into Barings Bank. The firm increased in wealth and influence to the point that, on 29 May 1793, Francis was created a baronet, of Larkbeer in the County of Devon, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. His eldest son Thomas became the second Baronet, also representing Chipping Wycombe and Hampshire in the House of Commons. Sir Thomas was succeeded by his eldest son Francis, third Baronet. Sir Francis held office as Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1866 he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Northbrook, of Stratton in the County of Southampton.

Lord Northbrook&#x27;s eldest son Thomas, the second Baron, was Viceroy of India from 1872 to 1876. In that year he was created Viscount Baring, of Lee in the County of Kent, and Earl of Northbrook, in the County of Southampton. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son Francis George, second Earl. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Winchester and Biggleswade. The second Earl was childless, and on his death in 1929, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony by his first cousin Francis Arthur, who became the fourth Baron Northbrook. Francis Arthur was the son of the Hon. Francis Baring (1850–1915), third son of the first Baron and a partner in Barings Bank.

 the titles are held by the fourth Baron&#x27;s grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1990. Lord Northbrook is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers who remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches.

The Baring family is one of the most ennobled in the United Kingdom and numerous other members of the family have gained distinction. The first Baron Northbrook&#x27;s uncle (his father&#x27;s next youngest brother) was Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, two of his first cousins (both sons of Henry Baring, his father&#x27;s next youngest brother after Lord Ashburton) were Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, and Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, and one of his first cousins once removed (third son of Lord Cromer) was Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale. Also, the Right Reverend Charles Baring, Bishop of Durham, was his younger brother. The Bishop&#x27;s son Thomas was a banker and Conservative politician.

<doc id="505090" wikidata="Q6961306" url="?curid=505090" title="Paavo Susitaival">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel Paavo Susitaival (9 February 1896 – 27 December 1993), born Paavo Sivén, was a Finnish author, soldier and politician. Paavo Sivén and his brother, Bobi Sivén were prominent figures in the Finnish interwar Nationalist movement. Paavo had acquired his reputation smuggling volunteers to Germany to enlist in the 27. Imperial Jaeger Battalion; Bobi gained his by being the last alderman of Porajärvi municipality before the ratification of the Treaty of Tartu who shot himself rather than acknowledge the transfer of Porajärvi and Repola to the Soviet Union.

== Early life ==

Paavo Sivén adopted the name Susitaival (&quot;wolf&#x27;s path&quot; in English) during the First World War to throw off the Czar&#x27;s secret service. Later, during the Finnish Civil War he attempted to enlist in the Finnish Army, only to realize that he – or rather, one of his pseudonyms – had already been appointed Captain in the Army, while he under his real name was listed as a draft-dodger. After the war he continued as a career soldier. He changed his name permanently to Susitaival in protest against the Svecoman sentiment in the Finnish Army, after attending an Army Cadet School church services where the Swedish-speaking cadets would not take communion with Finnish-speaking cadets.

== Finnish parliament ==

Susitaival participated in the Rebellion of Mäntsälä in a minor role, for which he served time in prison. Representing the Finnish fascist party IKL, Susitaival was elected as a member of the Finnish parliament in 1939. His career in the parliament was short lived, as at the beginning of the Winter War he chose to apply for active duty, one of only three Finnish MPs to do so.

== Winter War ==

During the Winter War, Susitaival served as a Lieutenant Colonel, commanding Osasto Susi in the Battle of Suomussalmi. He also held various command positions in the Continuation War. Despite his leadership skills and charisma, his abrasive, demanding character and a personal feud with Marshal Mannerheim, among other prominent officers, was the cause of him never advancing beyond that rank.

== Later life and death ==

After the war, Paavo Susitaival retired from the Army and lived as an author in Lappeenranta, where a street is named after him. In later life, his physical condition worsened but he never lost his mental acumen. In spite of being a heavy smoker (reputedly consuming at least one bag of pipe tobacco per day after the age of 14) and an avid coffee-drinker, he died at the age of 97. In his will, he requested that he should be buried with his officer&#x27;s sword, in order that future archaeologists would know that his grave was that of a soldier.

He summed up his life thus: &quot;Three wars, two rebellions, four prison stints. Unfortunately, once in parliament as well.&quot;
