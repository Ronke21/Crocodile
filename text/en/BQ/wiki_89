<text>The Indo-Pakistani war of 1947–1948, also known as the first Kashmir war, was a war fought between India and Pakistan over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir from 1947 to 1948. It was the first of four Indo-Pakistani wars between the two newly independent nations. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after its independence by launching tribal &quot;lashkar&quot; (militias) from Waziristan, in an effort to capture Kashmir and to preempt the possibility of its ruler joining India.

Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, was facing an uprising by his Muslim subjects in Poonch, and lost control in portions of the western districts. On 22 October 1947, Pakistan&#x27;s Pashtun tribal militias crossed the border of the state. These local tribal militias and irregular Pakistani forces moved to take the capital city of Srinagar, but upon reaching Baramulla, they took to plunder and stalled. Maharaja Hari Singh made a plea to India for assistance, and help was offered, but it was subject to his signing of an Instrument of Accession to India.

The war was initially fought by the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces and by militias from the frontier tribal areas adjoining the North-West Frontier Province. Following the accession of the state to India on 26 October 1947, Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar, the state capital. British commanding officers initially refused the entry of Pakistani troops into the conflict, citing the accession of the state to India. However, later in 1948, they relented and Pakistan&#x27;s armies entered the war shortly afterwards. The fronts solidified gradually along what later came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal ceasefire was declared effective 1 January 1949. Numerous analysts state that the war ended in a stalemate, with neither side obtaining a clear victory. Others, however, state that India emerged victorious as it successfully gained the majority of the contested territory.

== Background ==

Prior to 1815, the area now known as &quot;Jammu and Kashmir&quot; comprised 22 small independent states (16 Hindu and six Muslim) carved out of territories controlled by the Amir (King) of Afghanistan, combined with those of local small rulers. These were collectively referred to as the &quot;Punjab Hill States&quot;. These small states, ruled by Rajput kings, were variously independent, vassals of the Mughal Empire since the time of Emperor Akbar or sometimes controlled from Kangra state in the Himachal area. Following the decline of the Mughals, turbulence in Kangra and invasions of Gorkhas, the hill states fell successively under the control of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh.

The First Anglo-Sikh war (1845–46) was fought between the Sikh Empire, which asserted sovereignty over Kashmir, and the East India Company. In the Treaty of Lahore of 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the Beas River and the Sutlej River and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily raise this sum, the East India Company allowed the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the company. Gulab Singh became the first Maharaja of the newly formed princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, founding a dynasty that was to rule the state, the second-largest principality during the British Raj, until India gained its independence in 1947.

From February 1944 to January 1947, Afghanistan faced a series of tribal revolts. These revolts influenced Afghanistan to take a pro-Pakistan stance during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948. A pro-India stance in this case would necessitate stopping Pashtuns from joining Pakistan&#x27;s war against India, which was expected to cause a resurgence in rebel activity when the government was hoping to focus on national reform.

== Partition of India ==


The years 1946–1947 saw the rise of All-India Muslim League and Muslim nationalism, demanding a separate state for India&#x27;s Muslims. The demand took a violent turn on the Direct Action Day (16 August 1946) and inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims became endemic. Consequently, a decision was taken on 3 June 1947 to divide British India into two separate states, the Dominion of Pakistan comprising the Muslim majority areas and the Dominion of India comprising the rest. The two provinces Punjab and Bengal with large Muslim-majority areas were to be divided between the two dominions. An estimated 11 million people eventually migrated between the two parts of Punjab, and possibly 1 million perished in the inter-communal violence. Jammu and Kashmir, being adjacent to the Punjab province, was directly affected by the happenings in Punjab.

The original target date for the transfer of power to the new dominions was June 1948. However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy Lord Mountbatten advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only six weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition. Mountbatten&#x27;s original plan was to stay on as the joint Governor General for both of the new dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General. It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August and hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, who was titled the &#x27;Supreme Commander&#x27;, answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General Rob Lockhart as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General Frank Messervy.

The presence of the British commanding officers on both sides made the Indo-Pakistani war of 1947 a strange war. The two commanding officers were in daily telephone contact and adopted mutually defensive positions. The attitude was that &quot;you can hit them so hard but not too hard, otherwise there will be all kinds of repercussions.&quot; Both Lockhart and Messervy were replaced in the course of war, and their successors Roy Bucher and Douglas Gracey tried to exercise restraint on their respective governments. Bucher was apparently successful in doing so in India, but Gracey yielded and let British officers be used in operational roles on the side of Pakistan. One British officer even died in action.

== Developments in Jammu and Kashmir (August–October 1947) ==
With the independence of the Dominions, the British Paramountcy over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an Instrument of Accession. Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister Ram Chandra Kak, decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the state would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.

In 1947, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir had a wide range of ethnic and religious communities. The Kashmir province consisting of the Kashmir Valley and the Muzaffarabad district had a majority Muslim population (over 90%). The Jammu province, consisting of five districts, had roughly equal numbers of Hindus and Muslims in the eastern districts (Udhampur, Jammu and Reasi), and a Muslim majority in the western districts (Mirpur and Poonch). The mountainous Ladakh district (&quot;wazarat&quot;) in the east had a significant Buddhist presence with a Muslim majority in Baltistan. The Gilgit Agency in the north was overwhelmingly Muslim and was directly governed by the British under an agreement with the Maharaja. Shortly before the transfer of power, the British returned the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja, who appointed a Dogra governor for the district and a British commander for the local forces.

The predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the National Conference led by Sheikh Abdullah, believed in secular politics. It was allied with the Indian National Congress and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the Muslim Conference, which was allied to the All-India Muslim League and favoured joining Pakistan. The Hindus of the Jammu province favoured an outright merger with India. In the midst of all the diverging views, the Maharaja&#x27;s decision to remain independent was apparently a judicious one.
=== Operation Gulmarg plan ===
According to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called Operation Gulmarg and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan&#x27;s independence. The plan was accidentally revealed to an Indian officer, Major O. S. Kalkat serving with the Bannu Brigade. According to the plan, 20 &quot;lashkars&quot; (tribal militias), each consisting of 1,000 Pashtun tribesmen, were to be recruited from among various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. They were expected to reach the launching point of Abbottabad on 18 October, and cross into Jammu and Kashmir on 22 October. Ten &quot;lashkars&quot; were expected to attack the Kashmir Valley through Muzaffarabad and another ten &quot;lashkars&quot; were expected to join the rebels in Poonch, Bhimber and Rawalakot with a view to advance to Jammu. Detailed arrangements for the military leadership and armaments were described in the plan.

The regimental records show that, by the last week of August, the 11th Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) (PAVO Cavalry) regiment was briefed about the invasion plan. Colonel Sher Khan, the Director of Military Intelligence, was in charge of the briefing, along with Colonels Akbar Khan and Khanzadah. The Cavalry regiment was tasked with procuring arms and ammunition for the &#x27;freedom fighters&#x27; and establishing three wings of the insurgent forces: the South Wing commanded by General Kiani, a Central Wing based at Rawalpindi and a North Wing based at Abbottabad. By 1 October, the Cavalry regiment completed the task of arming the insurgent forces. &quot;Throughout the war there was no shortage of small arms, ammunitions, or explosives at any time.&quot; The regiment was also told to be on stand by for induction into fighting at an appropriate time.

Scholars have noted considerable movement of Pashtun tribes during September–October. By 13 September, armed Pashtuns drifted into Lahore and Rawalpindi. The Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ismail Khan noted a scheme to send tribesmen from Malakand to Sialkot, in lorries provided by the Pakistan government. Preparations for attacking Kashmir were also noted in the princely states of Swat, Dir, and Chitral. Scholar Robin James Moore states there is &quot;little doubt&quot; that Pashtuns were involved in border raids all along the Punjab border from the Indus to the Ravi.

Pakistani sources deny the existence of any plan called Operation Gulmarg. However, Shuja Nawaz does list 22 Pashtun tribes involved in the invasion of Kashmir on 22 October.

=== Rebellion in Poonch ===
Sometime in August 1947, the first signs of trouble broke out in Poonch, about which diverging views have been received. Poonch was originally an internal &quot;jagir&quot; (autonomous principality), governed by an alternative family line of Maharaja Hari Singh. The taxation is said to have been heavy. The Muslims of Poonch had long campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the Punjab province of British India. In 1938, a notable disturbance occurred for religious reasons, but a settlement was reached. During the Second World War, over 60,000 men from Poonch and Mirpur districts enrolled in the British Indian Army. After the war, they were discharged with arms, which is said to have alarmed the Maharaja. In June, Poonchis launched a &#x27;No Tax&#x27; campaign. In July, the Maharaja ordered that all the soldiers in the region be disarmed. The absence of employment prospects coupled with high taxation drove the Poonchis to rebellion. The &quot;gathering head of steam&quot;, states scholar Srinath Raghavan, was utilised by the local Muslim Conference led by Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (Sardar Ibrahim) to further their campaign for accession to Pakistan.

According to state government sources, the rebellious militias gathered in the Naoshera-Islamabad area, attacking the state troops and their supply trucks. A battalion of state troops was dispatched, which cleared the roads and dispersed the militias. By September, order was reestablished. The Muslim Conference sources, on the other hand, narrate that hundreds of people were killed in Bagh during flag hoisting around 15 August and that the Maharaja unleashed a &#x27;reign of terror&#x27; on 24 August. Local Muslims also told Richard Symonds, a British Quaker social worker, that the army fired on crowds, and burnt houses and villages indiscriminately. According to the Assistant British High Commissioner in Pakistan, H. S. Stephenson, &quot;the Poonch affair... was greatly exaggerated&quot;.

===Operation Datta Khel===

Operation Datta Khel was a military operation and coup planned by Major William Brown along with the Gilgit Scouts, aimed at overthrowing the rule of the Dogra dynasty of Kashmir. The operation was launched shortly after the independence of Pakistan. By 1 November, Gilgit-Baltistan had been annexed from the Dogra dynasty, and was made part of Pakistan after a brief provisional government.

=== Pakistan&#x27;s preparations, Maharaja&#x27;s manoeuvring ===
Scholar Prem Shankar Jha states that the Maharaja had decided, as early as April 1947, that he would accede to India if it was not possible to stay independent. The rebellion in Poonch possibly unnerved the Maharaja. Accordingly, on 11 August, he dismissed his pro-Pakistan Prime Minister, Ram Chandra Kak, and appointed retired Major Janak Singh in his place. On 25 August, he sent an invitation to Justice Mehr Chand Mahajan of the Punjab High Court to come as the Prime Minister. On the same day, the Muslim Conference wrote to the Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan warning him that &quot;if, God forbid, the Pakistan Government or the Muslim League do not act, Kashmir might be lost to them&quot;. This set the ball rolling in Pakistan.

Liaquat Ali Khan sent a Punjab politician Mian Iftikharuddin to explore the possibility of organising a revolt in Kashmir. Meanwhile, Pakistan cut off essential supplies to the state, such as petrol, sugar and salt. It also stopped trade in timber and other products, and suspended train services to Jammu. Iftikharuddin returned in mid-September to report that the National Conference held strong in the Kashmir Valley and ruled out the possibility of a revolt.
Meanwhile, Sardar Ibrahim had escaped to West Punjab, along with dozens of rebels, and established a base in Murree. From there, the rebels attempted to acquire arms and ammunition for the rebellion and smuggle them into Kashmir. Colonel Akbar Khan, one of a handful of high-ranking officers in the Pakistani Army, with a keen interest in Kashmir, arrived in Murree, and got enmeshed in these efforts. He arranged 4,000 rifles for the rebellion by diverting them from the Army stores. He also wrote out a draft plan titled &quot;Armed Revolt inside Kashmir&quot; and gave it to Mian Iftikharuddin to be passed on to the Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister.

On 12 September, the Prime Minister held a meeting with Mian Iftikharuddin, Colonel Akbar Khan and another Punjab politician Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan. Hayat Khan had a separate plan, involving the Muslim League National Guard and the militant Pashtun tribes from the Frontier regions. The Prime Minister approved both the plans, and despatched Khurshid Anwar, the head of the Muslim League National Guard, to mobilise the Frontier tribes.
The Maharaja was increasingly driven to the wall with the rebellion in the western districts and the Pakistani blockade. He managed to persuade Justice Mahajan to accept the post of Prime Minister (but not to arrive for another month, for procedural reasons). He sent word to the Indian leaders through Mahajan that he was willing to accede to India but needed more time to implement political reforms. However, it was India&#x27;s position that it would not accept accession from the Maharaja unless it had the people&#x27;s support. The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru demanded that Sheikh Abdullah should be released from prison and involved in the state&#x27;s government. Accession could only be contemplated afterwards. Following further negotiations, Sheikh Abdullah was released on 29 September.

Nehru, foreseeing a number of disputes over princely states, formulated a policy that states

The policy was communicated to Liaquat Ali Khan on 1 October at a meeting of the Joint Defence Council. Khan&#x27;s eyes are said to have &quot;sparkled&quot; at the proposal. However, he made no response.
=== Operations in Poonch and Mirpur ===
Armed rebellion started in the Poonch district at the beginning of October 1947.
The fighting elements consisted of &quot;bands of deserters from the State Army, serving soldiers of the Pakistan Army on leave, ex-servicemen, and other volunteers who had risen spontaneously.&quot;
The first clash is said to have occurred at Thorar (near Rawalakot) on 3–4 October 1947.
The rebels quickly gained control of almost the entire Poonch district. The State Forces garrison at the Poonch city came under heavy siege.

In the Kotli tehsil of the Mirpur district, border posts at Saligram and Owen Pattan on the Jhelum river were captured by rebels around 8 October. Sehnsa and Throchi were lost after some fighting. State Force records reveal that Muslim officers sent with reinforcements sided with the rebels and murdered the fellow state troops.

Radio communications between the fighting units were operated by the Pakistan Army. Even though the Indian Navy intercepted the communications, lacking intelligence in Jammu and Kashmir, it was unable to determine immediately where the fighting was taking place.

== Accession of Kashmir ==
Following the rebellions in the Poonch and Mirpur area and the Pakistan-backed Pashtun tribal intervention from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Maharaja asked for Indian military assistance. India set the condition that Kashmir must accede to India for it to receive assistance. The Maharaja complied, and the Government of India recognised the accession of the princely state to India. Indian troops were sent to the state to defend it. The Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference volunteers aided the Indian Army in its campaign to drive out the Pathan invaders.

Pakistan refused to recognise the accession of Kashmir to India, claiming that it was obtained by &quot;fraud and violence.&quot; Governor General Mohammad Ali Jinnah ordered his Army Chief General Douglas Gracey to move Pakistani troops to Kashmir at once. However, the Indian and Pakistani forces were still under a joint command, and Field Marshal Auchinleck prevailed upon him to withdraw the order. With its accession to India, Kashmir became legally Indian territory, and the British officers could not a play any role in an inter-Dominion war. The Pakistan Army made available arms, ammunition, and supplies to the rebel forces who were dubbed the &quot;Azad Army&quot;. Pakistan Army officers &quot;conveniently&quot; on leave and the former officers of the Indian National Army were recruited to command the forces.

In May 1948, the Pakistan Army officially entered the conflict, in theory to defend the Pakistan borders, but it made plans to push towards Jammu and cut the lines of communications of the Indian forces in the Mehndar Valley. In Gilgit, the force of Gilgit Scouts under the command of a British officer Major William Brown mutinied and overthrew the governor Ghansara Singh. Brown prevailed on the forces to declare accession to Pakistan. They are also believed to have received assistance from the Chitral Scouts and the Bodyguard of the state of Chitral, one of the princely states of Pakistan, which had acceded to Pakistan on 6 October 1947.

== Stages of the war ==

=== Initial invasion ===
On 22 October the Pashtun tribal attack was launched in the Muzaffarabad sector. The state forces stationed in the border regions around Muzaffarabad and Domel were quickly defeated by tribal forces (Muslim state forces mutinied and joined them) and the way to the capital was open. Among the raiders, there were many active Pakistani Army soldiers disguised as tribals. They were also provided logistical help by the Pakistan Army. Rather than advancing toward Srinagar before state forces could regroup or be reinforced, the invading forces remained in the captured cities in the border region engaging in looting and other crimes against their inhabitants. In the Poonch valley, the state forces retreated into towns where they were besieged.

Records indicate that the Pakistani tribals beheaded many Hindu and Sikh civilians in Jammu and Kashmir.
=== Indian operation in the Kashmir Valley ===

After the accession, India airlifted troops and equipment to Srinagar under the command of Lt. Col. Dewan Ranjit Rai, where they reinforced the princely state forces, established a defence perimeter and defeated the tribal forces on the outskirts of the city. Initial defense operations included the notable defense of Badgam holding both the capital and airfield overnight against extreme odds. The successful defence included an outflanking manoeuvre by Indian armoured cars during the Battle of Shalateng. The defeated tribal forces were pursued as far as Baramulla and Uri and these towns, too, were recaptured.

In the Poonch valley, tribal forces continued to besiege state forces.

In Gilgit, the state paramilitary forces, called the Gilgit Scouts, joined the invading tribal forces, who thereby obtained control of this northern region of the state. The tribal forces were also joined by troops from Chitral, whose ruler, Muzaffar ul-Mulk the Mehtar of Chitral, had acceded to Pakistan.

=== Attempted link-up at Poonch and fall of Mirpur ===

Indian forces ceased pursuit of tribal forces after recapturing Uri and Baramula, and sent a relief column southwards, in an attempt to relieve Poonch. Although the relief column eventually reached Poonch, the siege could not be lifted. A second relief column reached Kotli, and evacuated the garrisons of that town and others but were forced to abandon it being too weak to defend it. Meanwhile, Mirpur was captured by the tribal forces on 25 November 1947 with the help of Pakistan&#x27;s PAVO Cavalry. This led to the 1947 Mirpur massacre where Hindu women were reportedly abducted by tribal forces and taken into Pakistan. They were sold in the brothels of Rawalpindi. Around 400 women jumped into wells in Mirpur committing suicide to escape from being abducted.
=== Fall of Jhanger and attacks on Naoshera and Uri ===

The tribal forces attacked and captured Jhanger. They then attacked Naoshera unsuccessfully, and made a series of unsuccessful attacks on Uri. In the south a minor Indian attack secured Chamb. By this stage of the war the front line began to stabilise as more Indian troops became available.

=== Operation Vijay: counterattack to Jhanger ===
The Indian forces launched a counterattack in the south recapturing Jhanger and Rajauri. In the Kashmir Valley the tribal forces continued attacking the Uri garrison. In the north, Skardu was brought under siege by the Gilgit Scouts.

=== Indian spring offensive ===
The Indians held onto Jhanger against numerous counterattacks, who were increasingly supported by regular Pakistani Forces. In the Kashmir Valley the Indians attacked, recapturing Tithwail. The Gilgit scouts made good progress in the High Himalayas sector, infiltrating troops to bring Leh under siege, capturing Kargil and defeating a relief column heading for Skardu.

=== Operations Gulab and Eraze ===

The Indians continued to attack in the Kashmir Valley sector driving north to capture Keran and Gurais (Operation Eraze). They also repelled a counterattack aimed at Teetwal. In the Jammu region, the forces besieged in Poonch broke out and temporarily linked up with the outside world again. The Kashmir State army was able to defend Skardu from the Gilgit Scouts impeding their advance down the Indus valley towards Leh. In August the Chitral Scouts and Chitral Bodyguard under Mata ul-Mulk besieged Skardu and with the help of artillery were able to take Skardu. This freed the Gilgit Scouts to push further into Ladakh.

=== Operation Bison ===

During this time the front began to settle down. The siege of Poonch continued. An unsuccessful attack was launched by 77 Parachute Brigade (Brig Atal) to capture Zoji La pass. Operation Duck, the earlier epithet for this assault, was renamed as Operation Bison by Cariappa. M5 Stuart light tanks of 7 Cavalry were moved in dismantled conditions through Srinagar and winched across bridges while two field companies of the Madras Sappers converted the mule track across Zoji La into a jeep track. The surprise attack on 1 November by the brigade with armour supported by two regiments of 25-pounder gun-howitzers and a regiment of 3.7-inch mountain guns, forced the pass and pushed the tribal and Pakistani forces back to Matayan and later Dras. The brigade linked up on 24 November at Kargil with Indian troops advancing from Leh while their opponents eventually withdrew northwards toward Skardu. The Pakistani attacked the Skardu on 10 February 1948 which was repulsed by the Indian soldiers. Thereafter, the Skardu Garrison was subjected to continuous attacks by the Pakistan Army for the next three months and each time, their attack was repulsed by the Colonel Sher Jung Thapa and his men. Thapa held the Skardu with hardly 250 men for whole six long months without any reinforcement and replenishment. On 14 August, Thapa had to surrender Skardu to the Pakistani Army and raiders after a year long siege.

=== Operation Easy; Poonch link-up ===

The Indians now started to get the upper hand in all sectors. Poonch was finally relieved after a siege of over a year. The Gilgit forces in the High Himalayas, who had previously made good progress, were finally defeated. The Indians pursued as far as Kargil before being forced to halt due to supply problems. The Zoji La pass was forced by using tanks (which had not been thought possible at that altitude) and Dras was recaptured.

At 23.59 hrs on 1 January 1949, a United Nations-mediated ceasefire came into effect, bring the war to an end.

== Aftermath ==

The terms of the ceasefire, laid out in a UN Commission resolution on 13 August 1948, were adopted by the commission on 5 January 1949.This required Pakistan to withdraw its forces, both regular and irregular, while allowing India to maintain minimal forces within the state to preserve law and order. Upon compliance with these conditions, a plebiscite was to be held to determine the future of the territory. Owing to disagreements over the demilitarisation steps, a plebiscite was never held and the cease-fire line essentially became permanent. Some sources may refer to 5 January as the beginning of the ceasefire.

Indian losses in the war totalled 1,104 killed and 3,154 wounded; Pakistani, about 6,000 killed and 14,000 wounded.

Numerous analysts state that the war ended in a stalemate, with neither side obtaining a clear victory. Others, however, state that India emerged victorious as it successfully gained the majority of the contested territory.

India gained control of about two-thirds of the Jammu and Kashmir princely state, including the Kashmir Valley, the Jammu province and Ladakh. Pakistan had control of one-third of the state: three western districts later named Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the northern areas including the Gilgit district, the Gilgit Agency and the Baltistan tehsil of the Ladakh district (later renamed Gilgit-Baltistan).

India and Pakistan signed the Karachi Agreement in July 1949 and established a ceasefire line to be supervised by observers. After the termination of the UNCIP, the Security Council passed Resolution 91 (1951) and established a &quot;United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan&quot; (UNMOGIP) to observe and report violations of ceasefire.

The resentment over Pakistani defeat in the war resulted in a failed coup led by General Akbar Khan in 1951 against the government of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. Army officers thought the government&#x27;s acceptance of UN mediation and ceasefire was weak and squandered an opportunity to capture the entirety of Kashmir.

After two further wars in 1965 and 1971, only minor changes in the ground situation had been effected. After the last war, the two countries reached the 1972 Simla Agreement, converting the cease-fire line into a Line of Control and disavowing the use of force across it. In 1984, India gained Siachen after launching a short military action.

<doc id="506956" wikidata="Q844412" url="?curid=506956" title="United States intervention in Chile">
<text>United States intervention in Chilean politics started during the War of Chilean Independence (1812–1826). The influence of United States in both the economic and the political arenas of Chile has since gradually increased over the last two centuries, and continues to be significant.

==Chilean independence==
The arrival of Joel Roberts Poinsett, in 1811, marked the beginning of U.S. involvement in Chilean politics. He had been sent by President James Madison in 1809 as a special agent to the South American Spanish colonies (a position he filled from 1810 to 1814) to investigate the prospects of the revolutionaries, in their struggle for independence from Spain.

==War scare of 1891==
During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, the U.S. backed President José Manuel Balmaceda, as a way to increase their influence in Chile, while Britain backed the successful Congressional forces.

===Itata incident===

The Itata incident concerned an attempted shipment of 5000 rifles in 1891 by the ship &quot;Itata&quot; of arms purchased in California from Remington. The US Navy with a fleet made up of a multi-national ships some from the Royal navy and Kriegsmarine. This Fleet went to the port of Iquique and &#x27;convinced&#x27; the port authorities to hand over the weapons

===Baltimore crisis===

Washington sent a warship to Chile to protect American interests. The crew of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; took shore leave at Valparaiso. During the US sailors&#x27; shore leave on 16 October 1891, a mob of enraged Chileans angry about the &quot;Itata&#x27;s&quot; capture, attacked them. Two American sailors were killed, 17 were wounded and 36 others were jailed. That Valparaiso riot prompted saber rattling from enraged US officials. A war between the U.S. and Chile was remotely possible. Chile&#x27;s foreign minister escalated the tension but in Washington Secretary of State James G. Blaine cooled off the hotheads. The crisis ended when the Chilean government bowed, and while maintaining that the seamen were to blame for the riot paid an indemnity of $75,000 to the victims&#x27; families.

==First half of the 20th century==

United States involvement in Chilean affairs intensified in the early decades of the 20th century. After World War I, the United States replaced Britain as the leading superpower controlling most of Chile&#x27;s resources, as most economic activity in the country lay in US hands. Such a change prevented Chile from profiting as a result of the war and gaining its financial independence. The dependence on the United States formally began in the early years of the 1920s as two major US companies Anaconda and Kennecott took control of the valuable resources. Up until the 1970s, &quot;both industries controlled between 7% to 20% of the country&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product&quot;.

The conclusion of World War II brought more of the same as Chile could not even exploit the &quot;excess of copper they produced as almost all the copper was marketed through subsidiaries of United States copper firms established in Chile for whom the allied government fixed a ceiling price upon copper products during the course of the war.&quot;

As the working class demanded an improvement in their standard of living, higher wages and improved working conditions, the notion that a leftist government could be the solution for the people began to take form.

==1950s and 1960s==

During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States put forward a variety of programs and strategies, ranging from funding political campaigns to funding propaganda, aimed at impeding the presidential aspirations of leftist candidate Salvador Allende, who served as President of the Senate (1966–1969) before running a final time to become the 28th President of Chile, which lasted until his death in 1973. Throughout these two decades, left-wing parties in Chile failed to gain power, in part due to the fact that the United States was, verifiably, impeding the left wing parties through various means. In the 1958 presidential election, Jorge Alessandri – a nominal independent with support from the Liberal and Conservative parties – defeated Allende by nearly 33,500 votes to claim the presidency. His laissez-faire policies, endorsed by the United States, were regarded as the solution to the country&#x27;s inflation problems. Under recommendations from the United States, Alessandri steadily reduced tariffs starting in 1959, a policy that caused the Chilean market to be overwhelmed by American product. These governmental policies angered the working class of Chile, who demanded higher wages, and the repercussions of this massive discontent were felt in the 1961 congressional elections. The president suffered terrible blows, sending the message that laissez-faire policies were not desired. As the &quot;grand total of $130 million from the U.S. banking Industry, the U.S. Treasury Department, the IMF and the ICA&quot; accepted by Alessandri illustrates, laissez-faire policies may have induced the opposite of the intended effect – making Chile more dependent on the United States, not less.

Presidential candidate Salvador Allende was a top contender in the 1964 election. The US, through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), covertly spent three million dollars campaigning against him, before and after the election, mostly through radio and print advertising. The Americans viewed electing Christian Democratic contender Eduardo Frei Montalva as vital, fearing that Alessandri&#x27;s failures would lead the people to support Allende. Allende was feared by the Americans because of his warm relations with Cuba and his open criticism of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Furthermore, clandestine aid to Frei was put forward through John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Latin American Alliance for Progress, which promised &quot;$20 billion in public and private assistance in the country for the next decade.&quot;

==The 1970 election==
According to a U.S. Senate select committee, publishing a Church Commission Report in 1975 to describe international abuses committed by the CIA, NSA, and FBI, covert United States involvement in Chile in the decade between 1963 and 1973 was &quot;extensive and continuous&quot;. The CIA spent $8 million in the three years between 1970 and the military coup of September 1973, with over $3 million allocated toward Chilean intervention in 1972 alone. Covert American activity was present in almost every major election in Chile in the decade between 1963 and 1973, but its tangible effect on electoral outcomes is not altogether clear. Chile, more than any of its South American neighbors, had a long-standing democratic tradition dating back to the early 1930s, and it has been difficult to gauge how successful CIA tactics were in swaying voters.

A declassified file from August 19, 1970, reveals the minutes of high-level officials in the CIA known as the &quot;Special Review Group.&quot; It was chaired by Henry Kissinger and was sanctioned by then-president Nixon. This was one of several documents released as part of the &quot;Foreign Relations of the United States&quot; (FRUS) series dedicated toward US-Chilean interventionalism – collectively known as &quot;Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume XXI, Chile, 1969–1973&quot; and &quot;Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume E–16, Documents on Chile, 1969–1973&quot; – that revealed a detailed account of correspondences between each of these officials, telegrams from the Chilean embassy, memorandums, and &quot;Special Reports&quot; concerning the state of affairs in Chile. For instance, a National Intelligence Estimate from January 28, 1969, stated the problems and conclusions that senior officials in Washington identified over the proliferating crisis in Chile. The document indicates that the 1970 election stood above all other issues as of critical importance, with Chile&#x27;s political and economic stability depending heavily on that particular election&#x27;s outcome; the document notes the possibility of out of control economic stagnation and inflation in Chile as concerns. The conclusions of the document suggest that factionalism needed to be addressed, and expounded on United States interests in copper extraction companies operating in Chile. The election represented the potential for important economic relations to collapse or continue. The document further focuses on potential ramifications if the election outcome were to not align with US interests.

At a 8 September 1970 meeting of the 40 Committee, the chairman of the committee asked for an analysis of where the US/CIA stood in terms of taking action to prevent Allende from becoming President of Chile. William Broe, a high-ranking CIA officer, said Eduardo Frei Montalva, the 29th President of Chile, was essential to the situation in Chile, regardless of the type of involvement — military or congressional. The 40 Committee asked that the CIA collect information and create more intelligence reports to see what could be further done in Chile. The committee decided it was unlikely they were going to be able to influence the 24 Oct, congressional election to go against Allende. Richard Helms was also concerned about Allende supporters in the Chilean military, as it seemed they would support Allende in the event of a coup. As a result of all this information, the Committee decided they wanted a full analysis of two things: (1.) a cost versus benefit analysis of organizing a military (Chilean) coup; (2.) a cost versus benefit analysis of organizing future oppositions to Allende to topple his influence. This presented two options for Henry Kissinger: political maneuvering or outright force.

Four days after the 8 September 1970 meeting of the 40 Committee, a cable between Helms and Henry Kissinger discussed the lack of morale that the US embassy had in Chile according to the American Ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry. Kissinger stated in response that he would call another 40 Committee Meeting for the following Monday. Kissinger further noted: &quot;We will not let Chile go down the drain.&quot;

==Allende presidency==

Salvador Allende ran again in the 1970 presidential election, winning a narrow victory plurality vote (near 37%). U.S. president Richard Nixon feared that Chile could become &quot;another Cuba&quot; and cut off most foreign aid to Chile. The U.S. government believed that Allende would become closer to socialist countries such as Cuba and the Soviet Union. They feared that Allende would push Chile into socialism, resulting in the loss of all the U.S. investments made in Chile.

On 15 September 1970, before Allende took office, Richard Nixon gave the order to overthrow him. According to a declassified document from the NSA, the handwritten notes from Richard Helms (CIA director at the time) state: &quot;1 in 10 chance perhaps, but save Chile!; worth spending; not concerned; no involvement of embassy; $10,000,000 available, more if necessary; full-time job—best men we have; game plan; make the economy scream; 48 hours for plan of action.&quot; These notes came from a meeting Helms had with President Nixon, indicating the administration&#x27;s willingness to stage a coup in Chile and the extent to which Nixon was willing to go to do so. On 5 November 1970, Henry Kissinger advised President Nixon against peaceful coexistence with the Allende administration and instead advocated one of two positions. &quot;Track I&quot; was a State Department initiative designed to thwart Allende by subverting Chilean elected officials within the bounds of the Chilean constitution, excluding CIA involvement. Track I expanded to encompass some policies whose ultimate goal was to create the conditions that would encourage a coup. &quot;Track II&quot; was a CIA operation overseen by Henry Kissinger and Thomas Karamessines, the CIA&#x27;s director of covert operations. Track II excluded the State Department and Department of Defense. The goal of Track II was to find and support Chilean military officers who would support a coup.

Immediately after the Allende government came into office, Nixon&#x27;s administration sought to place pressure on it to limit its ability to implement policies contrary to U.S. and hemispheric interests, such as the total nationalization of several U.S. corporations operating in Chile. Nixon directed that no new bilateral economic aid commitments be undertaken with the government of Chile. The U.S. supported Allende&#x27;s opponents in Chile during his presidency, intending to encourage either Allende&#x27;s resignation, his overthrow, or his defeat in the election of 1976. The Nixon administration also covertly funded independent and non-state media and labor unions.

===Track I===
Track I was a U.S. State Department plan designed to persuade the Chilean Congress, through outgoing Christian Democratic President Eduardo Frei Montalva, to confirm conservative runner-up Jorge Alessandri as president. Alessandri would resign shortly after, rendering Frei eligible to run against Allende in new elections. As part of the Track I strategy to block Allende from assuming office after the election, the CIA needed to influence a Congressional run-off vote required by the Constitution since Allende did not win the absolute majority. Their tactics were political warfare, economic pressure, propaganda, and diplomatic hardball as they aimed to buy enough Chilean senatorial votes to block Allende&#x27;s inauguration. Should that plan not succeed, U.S. Ambassador Edward Korry would attempt to persuade President Frei to create a constitutional coup. Their last resort was to have the U.S. &quot;condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmost deprivation and poverty, forcing Allende to adopt the harsh features of a police state,&quot; Korry told Kissinger. To aid in this mission, the CIA station chief in Brazil, David Atlee Phillips, was brought in along with twenty-three foreign reporters who worked to stir up international opinion against Allende, the centerpiece of this part of the operation being the strong anti-Allende story on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

===Track II===

The CIA had also drawn up a second plan, Track II, in which the agency would find and support military officers willing to participate in a coup. They could then call new elections in which Allende could be defeated.

In September 1970, Nixon authorized the expenditure of $10 million to stop Allende from coming to power or to unseat him. As part of the Track II initiative, the CIA used false flag operatives with fake passports to approach Chilean military officers and encourage them to carry out a coup. A first step to overthrowing Allende required removing General René Schneider, the chief commander of the army. As a constitutionalist, Schneider would oppose a coup d&#x27;état. On 18 October 1970, the CIA station in Santiago addressed the logistics of secret weapons and ammunitions for the use in a plot to kidnap Schneider. The CIA provided &quot;$50,000 in cash, three submachine guns, and a satchel of tear gas, all approved at headquarters ...&quot; The submachine guns were delivered by diplomatic pouch.

A group was formed, led by the retired General Roberto Viaux. Considered unstable by the U.S., Viaux had been discouraged from attempting a coup alone. The CIA encouraged him to join forces with an active duty general, Camilo Valenzuela, who had also been approached by CIA operatives. They were joined by Admiral Hugo Tirado, who had been forced into retirement after the Tacnazo insurrection. On 22 October, Viaux went ahead with a plan to kidnap Schneider, but Schneider drew a handgun to protect himself from his attackers, who then shot him in four vital areas. He died in Santiago&#x27;s military hospital three days later. The attempted kidnapping and Schneider&#x27;s subsequent death shocked the public and increased support for the Chilean Constitution, the exact opposite of the expected outcome of the planned coup. The Chilean people rallied around their government which, in turn, overwhelmingly ratified Allende on 3 November 1970.

On 25 November 1970, Henry Kissinger issued a memorandum that detailed the Covert Action Program that the U.S. would undertake in Chile. In the memorandum, Kissinger stated that there were five principles of the program. The U.S. would continue to maintain contacts in the Chilean military, take steps to divide Allende&#x27;s supporters, cooperate with the media to run anti-Allende propaganda campaigns, support non-communist political parties in Chile, and publish materials stating that Allende did not adhere to the democratic process and also wanted to form connections with Cuba and the Soviet Union.

A CIA and White House cover-up obscured American involvement, despite Congressional investigative efforts. The Church Committee, which investigated U.S. involvement in Chile during this period, determined that the weapons used in the kidnapping attempt &quot;were, in all probability, not those supplied by the CIA to the conspirators.&quot;

After Schneider&#x27;s death, the CIA recovered the submachine guns and money it had provided. Both Valenzuela and Viaux were arrested and convicted of conspiracy after Schneider&#x27;s assassination. One of the coup plotters who escaped arrest requested assistance from the CIA and was paid $35,000, so &quot;The CIA did, in fact, pay &#x27;hush&#x27; money to those directly responsible for the Schneider assassination—and then covered up that secret payment for thirty years.&quot;

In 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company ITT Corporation owned 70 percent of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company, and funded &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, a Chilean right-wing newspaper. The CIA used ITT as a conduit to financially aid opponents of Allende&#x27;s government. On 28 September 1973, ITT&#x27;s headquarters in New York City were bombed by the Weather Underground for the alleged involvement of the company in the overthrow of Allende.

On 10 September 2001, a suit was filed by Schneider&#x27;s family accusing former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of arranging an assassination because Schneider would have opposed a military coup. CIA documents indicate that while the agency had sought to kidnap him, his death was never intended. Kissinger said he had declared the coup &quot;hopeless&quot; and had &quot;turned it off&quot;. However, the CIA claimed that no such &quot;stand-down&quot; order was ever received.

==1973 coup==
On 11 September 1973, Augusto Pinochet rose to power, overthrowing the democratically elected president Salvador Allende. A subsequent September 2000 report from the CIA, using declassified documents related to the military coup, found that the CIA &quot;probably appeared to condone&quot; the 1973 coup, but that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; that the US actually participated in it. This view has been challenged by some authors, who have stated that the covert support of the United States was crucial to the preparation for the coup, the coup itself, and the consolidation of the regime afterwards. It seemed to the CIA that, even if this coup did not come together, Allende would still have a very difficult political future. This point of view has been supported by non-scholarly commentary.

According to the CIA document &quot;CIA Activities in Chile&quot;, dated 18 September 2000, the local CIA station suggested during late summer 1973 that the US commit itself to support a military coup. In response, CIA Headquarters reaffirmed to the station that &quot;there was to be no involvement with the military in any covert action initiative; there was no support for instigating a military coup.&quot;

On the issue of CIA involvement in the 1973 coup, the CIA document is equally explicit:

On 10 September 1973 – the day before the coup that ended the Allende government – a Chilean military officer reported to a CIA officer that a coup was being planned and asked for US government assistance. He was told that the US Government would not provide any assistance because this was strictly an internal Chilean matter. The Station Officer also told him his request would be forwarded to Washington. CIA learned of the exact date of the coup shortly before it took place. During the attack on the Presidential Palace and its immediate aftermath, the Station&#x27;s activities were limited to providing intelligence and situation reports.

The report of the Church Committee, published in 1975, stated that during the period leading up to the coup, the CIA received information about potential coup plots.

The intelligence network continued to report throughout 1972 and 1973 on coup plotting activities. During 1972 the Station continued to monitor the group which might mount a successful coup, and it spent a significantly greater amount of time and effort penetrating this group than it had on previous groups. This group had originally come to the Station&#x27;s attention in October 1971. By January 1972 the Station had successfully penetrated it and was in contact through an intermediary with its leader.

Intelligence reporting on coup plotting reached two peak periods, one in the last week of June 1973 and the other during the end of August and the first two weeks in September. It is clear the CIA received intelligence reports on the coup planning of the group which carried out the successful September 11 coup throughout the months of July, August, and September 1973.

The Church report also considered the allegation that the US government involved itself in the 1973 coup:

Was the United States DIRECTLY involved, covertly, in the 1973 coup in Chile? The Committee has found no evidence that it was.There is no hard evidence of direct U.S. assistance to the coup, despite frequent allegations of such aid. Rather the United States – by its previous actions during Track II, its existing general posture of opposition to Allende, and the nature of its contacts with the Chilean military – probably gave the impression that it would not look with disfavor on a military coup. And U.S. officials in the years before 1973 may not always have succeeded in walking the thin line between monitoring indigenous coup plotting and actually stimulating it.Ultimately, the CIA may not have a direct hand in the military coup, as some declassified documents do not establish a direct hand of the CIA role in the military coup, the information gleaned from some of these documents is enough to establish a close connection between the CIA and various fashions of the coup plotting, and emphasis its indirect hand to at least end the tenured of Allende. One such document dated September 7, 1973, shared an in-depth knowledge the CIA had on the road map to the immediate day of the coup. In the document, a CIA officer informed the White House that a coup was imminent and was going to take effect on September 8, 1973. The CIA officer whose name was kept hidden in the document, in updating the White House on the situation and current development in Chile, reported some level of a consensus among &quot;three services&quot; including the military, and opposing parties to the Allende government, to force him out of power through Self-Resignation as pressure asserted on him from the &quot;rightist National Party&quot;. In the event that Allende resisted such an attempt, which he eventually did, the Militantly then &quot;finalized&quot; its &quot;decision&quot; to force him out of office through a coup. In another breadth, the CIA showcased its close connection with the coup plotters, through its knowledge about a change in the military plan in which &quot;some armed forces units wanted to&quot; carried out &quot;as early as the 8th &quot; &quot;but were dissuaded by higher-ranking officers&quot; who said &quot;could not possibly be put together until 10 September&quot;, as &quot;the need for a coordinated effort&quot;  was lacking from both ranks.

The CIA in their report, was confident that Allende was definitely going to be ousted from office, and that a &quot;coup appears to have the support of all the service commanders&quot;, which neither Allende nor his supporters could resist. And that Allende was aware that any attempt &quot;to oppose the military could result in heavy casualties.&quot; The CIA informed the White House about the National Police of Chile&#x27;s knowledge about an imminent coup, who were in &quot;contact with plotters and have agreed not to resist the military if a coup is attempted.&quot; This level of knowledge the CIA shared with the White House not only demonstrated an effective way the agency deployed in picking intelligence, but also its closed network or otherwise indirect involvement in the coup.

On one breadth, the CIA entrusted in the non-friendly political atmosphere in Chile at the time which opposed Allende&#x27;s government would eventually force him out of office, &quot;should no coup develop.&quot; The CIA reported that the &quot;rightist National Party&quot; was a step further &quot;demanding Allende’s resignation&quot; on the backdrop of his &quot;incompetence.&quot; This incompetence and non-friendly opposed political atmosphere were a direct economic orchestration by the CIA that made Chile ungovernable, a situation the National Parties aimed to use to their advantage.  

Transcripts of a phone conversation between Kissinger and Nixon reveal that they did not have a hand in the final coup. They do take credit for creating the conditions that led to the coup. Kissinger says that &quot;they created the conditions as great as possible.&quot; Nixon and Kissinger also discussed how they would play this event with the media and lamented the fact that, if this were the era of Eisenhower, then they would be seen as heroes. There was a PDB that had a section on Chile dated 11 September 1973 that is still completely censored, as was an entire page on Chile provided to Nixon on 8 September 1973. Additionally, a cable from CIA operative Jack Devine dated 10 September 1973, confirmed to top U.S. officials that the coup would take place the following day. In collaboration with the coup, a Defense Intelligence Agency summary, also dated on 8 September and classified &quot;Top Secret Umbra&quot;, provided detailed information on an agreement among the Chilean Army, Navy, and Air Force to move against Allende on 10 September. As the CIA denies its involvement in the coup, another cable sent from the agency on 8 September classified &quot;Secret&quot; had information on the Chilean Navy time and date to overthrow the government of President Allende. The cable also identified key Chilean officials who were supporting the coup. The cables from around this time with another one stating that the coup was postponed in order to improve tactical coordination and would attempt the coup on 11 September.

Following the coup on 12 September, &quot;The President&#x27;s Daily Brief,&quot; written as a top secret briefing paper by the CIA for Nixon, reported on the events of the coup as that day&#x27;s first principal development. In this briefing, there is no indication that the U.S. played any significant role in the coup. The CIA only reported the known facts of the situation, such as the state of the Chilean government and the unconfirmed reports of Allende committing suicide. In the last paragraph of the section on Chile, the CIA reported that &quot;The only strong reaction from among Latin American governments has come from Cuba.&quot;

A CIA intelligence report 25 October 1973, concerning General Arellano Stark, noted that Arellano had ordered the deaths of 21 political prisoners. Also, the disappearances of 14 other prisoners were also believed to be on the order of Arellano. General Arellano was considered Pinochet&#x27;s right-hand man after the coup.

Historian Peter Winn has argued that the role of the CIA was crucial to the consolidation of power that followed the coup; the CIA helped fabricate a conspiracy against the Allende government, which Pinochet was then portrayed as preventing. He states that the coup itself was possible only through a three-year covert operation mounted by the United States. He also points out that the US imposed an &quot;invisible blockade&quot; that was designed to disrupt the economy under Allende, and contributed to the destabilization of the regime. Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive&#x27;s Chile Documentation Project, argues in his book &quot;The Pinochet File&quot; that the US was extensively involved and actively &quot;fomented&quot; the 1973 coup. Authors Tim Weiner, in his book, &quot;Legacy of Ashes&quot;, and Christopher Hitchens, in his book, &quot;The Trial of Henry Kissinger&quot; similarly argue the case that US covert actions actively destabilized Allende&#x27;s government and set the stage for the 1973 coup. Joaquin Fermandois criticized Kornbluh&#x27;s &quot;black and white&quot; and &quot;North American centered conception of world affairs&quot;, stating that a variety of internal and external factors also played a role and that a careful reading of the documentary record reveals the CIA was largely &quot;impotent&quot;.

Conservative scholar Mark Falcoff alleged that Cuba and the Soviet Union supplied several hundred thousand dollars to the socialist and Marxist factions in the government. Additionally, documents transcribed and provided by KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin detail the relationship between Allende and the KGB starting in 1953. Allende&#x27;s KGB file documents &quot;systematic contact&quot; starting in 1961. KGB support for Allende&#x27;s 1970 campaign included $400,000 in initial financing, with additional funding including a &quot;personal subsidy&quot; of $50,000 to Allende, as well as bribing a left wing Senator $18,000 to persuade him not to stand as a presidential candidate and to remain within the Unidad Popular coalition. Peter Winn noted that &quot;the Chilean revolution always kept to its peaceful road, despite counterrevolutionary plots and violence.&quot; Moreover, this strong emphasis on nonviolence was precisely to avoid revolutionary terror which had blemished the reputations of the French, Russian and Cuban revolutions.

Allende later committed suicide, with an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; stating &quot;he committed suicide under mysterious circumstances as troops surrounded his place, ushering in more than 15 years of military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet&quot;. Former CIA agent Jack Devine, who was active in the CIA agency during the time of the coup, told &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that overthrowing Allende&#x27;s government was not the CIA&#x27;s decision, but rather the decision of the White House, particularly President Nixon. The coup and U.S. involvement remain an important episode, as a &quot;New York Times&quot; report in October 2017 indicates.

==Pinochet regime==
The U.S. provided material support to the military regime after the coup, although criticizing it in public. A document released by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2000, titled &quot;CIA Activities in Chile&quot;, revealed that the CIA actively supported the military junta after the overthrow of Allende and that it made many of Pinochet&#x27;s officers into paid contacts of the CIA or U.S. military, even though some were known to be involved in human rights abuses.

CIA documents show that the CIA had close contact with members of the Chilean secret police, DINA, and its chief Manuel Contreras (paid asset from 1975 to 1977 according to the CIA in 2000). Some have alleged that the CIA&#x27;s one-time payment to Contreras is proof that the U.S. approved of Operation Condor and military repression within Chile. The CIA&#x27;s official documents state that at one time, some members of the intelligence community recommended making Contreras into a paid contact because of his closeness to Pinochet; the plan was rejected based on Contreras&#x27; poor human rights track record, but a single payment was made due to a miscommunication. In the description of the CIA&#x27;s activities in Chile, it is acknowledged that one of their high-level contacts was more predisposed to committing abuse: &quot;although the CIA had information indicating that a high-level contact was a hard-liner and therefore more likely to commit abuses, contact with him was allowed to continue in absence of concrete information about human rights abuses.&quot;

A report dated 24 May 1977 also describes the newfound human rights abuses that may have been occurring in Chile: &quot;reports of gross violation of human rights in Chile, which had nearly ceased earlier this year, are again on the rise...the Pinochet government is reverting to the practices that jeopardized its international standing since the 1973 coup.&quot; The document also details how these human rights violations could have caused a worsening of Chile&#x27;s status on the international stage. It seems that the United States was unable to plan around these violations, as is referred to with the document&#x27;s mention of high-ranking officials taking parts in the abuses also.

On 6 March 2001, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the existence of a recently declassified State Department document revealing that the United States facilitated communications for Operation Condor. The document, a 1978 cable from Robert E. White, the U.S. ambassador to Paraguay, was discovered by Professor J. Patrice McSherry of Long Island University, who had published several articles on Operation Condor. She called the cable &quot;another piece of increasingly weighty evidence suggesting that U.S. military and intelligence officials supported and collaborated with Condor as a secret partner or sponsor.&quot;

In the cable, Ambassador White relates a conversation with General Alejandro Fretes Davalos, chief of staff of Paraguay&#x27;s armed forces, who told him that the South American intelligence chiefs involved in Condor &quot;&quot;keep in touch with one another through a U.S. communications installation in the Panama Canal Zone which covers all of Latin America&quot;. &quot; This installation is &quot;employed to co-ordinate intelligence information among the southern cone countries.&quot; White, whose message was sent to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, was concerned that the U.S. connection to Condor might be revealed during the then ongoing investigation into the deaths of the 44 year old former Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier and his American colleague Ronni Moffitt. Her husband Michael Moffit was in the car during the bombing, but was the only survivor. &quot;It would seem advisable,&quot; he suggests, &quot;to review this arrangement to insure that its continuation is in U.S. interest.&quot;
The document was found among 16,000 State, CIA, White House, Defense, and Justice Department records released in November 2000 on the nearly 17-year long Pinochet dictatorship in Chile, and Washington&#x27;s role in the violent coup that brought his military regime to power. The release was the fourth and final batch of records released under the Clinton Administration&#x27;s special Chile Declassification Project.

During the Pinochet regime, four American citizens were killed: Charles Horman, Frank Teruggi, Boris Weisfeiler, and Ronni Karpen Moffit. Later on, in late August 1976, the United States Government stated in a State Department Secret Memorandum, that the United States Government did play an indirect role in the death of one of the four American citizens, Charles Horman. The Secret Memorandum states:

&quot;Based on what we have, we are persuaded that: The GOC sought Horman and felt threatened enough to order his immediate execution. The GOC might have believed this American could be killed without negative

from the USG. There is some circumstantial evidence to suggest: U.S. intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in Horman&#x27;s death. At best, it was limited to providing or confirming information that helped motivate his murder by the GOC. At worst, U.S. intelligence was aware the GOC saw Horman in a rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing to discourage the logical outcome of GOC paranoia.&quot;- Department of State, Secret Memorandum, &quot;Charles Horman Case,&quot; 25 August 1976 (uncensored version)

On 30 June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that the United States played a key role in the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi. According to Judge Jorge Zepeda, U.S. Navy Capt. Ray E. Davis, who commanded the U.S. Military Mission in Chile, gave information to the Chilean government about Horman and Teruggi that resulted in their arrest and execution in the days following the coup. The Chilean Supreme Court sought to have Davis extradited from Florida to stand trial, but he was secretly living in Santiago and died in a nursing home in 2013.

In a document declassified under the Obama administration&#x27;s Chilean declassification project, documents were released stating that the CIA suspected Pinochet himself of personally giving the order for the assassination of Ronni Moffitt and Orlando Letelier. Although they were unable to gather enough intelligence that proved that he gave the order, they received shocking evidence from the Chilean Major, Armando Fernandez, who they convinced to come to the capital to provide them information, that Pinochet was directly involved in covering up the incident. Another declassified copy of a CIA special intelligence assessment on Pinochet&#x27;s role in the Letelier and Moffitt assassinations were presented to the Chilean President Bachelet in 2016. That document asserts the CIA believed that Pinochet, &quot;personally ordered his intelligence chief to carry out the murder.&quot; Even with the evidence that they had, the Secretary of State George Shultz did not feel that there was enough to indict Pinochet but instead used the information to try to convince Reagan to change their policy with Chile. Pinochet stepped down from power in 1990 and died on 10 December 2006, without facing trial.

==Politics in the 21st century==
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the release of numerous documents relating to U.S. policy and actions toward Chile. The documents produced by various U.S. agencies were opened to the public by the U.S. State Department in October 1999. The collection of 1,100 documents dealt with the years leading up to the military coup.

Regarding Pinochet&#x27;s rise to power, the CIA concluded in a report issued in 2000 that: &quot;The CIA actively supported the military junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency.&quot; However, the 2000 report also stated that: &quot;The major CIA effort against Allende came earlier in 1970 in the failed attempt to block his election and accession to the Presidency. Nonetheless, the U.S. Administration&#x27;s long-standing hostility to Allende and its past encouragement of a military coup against him were well known among Chilean coup plotters who eventually took activities of their own to oust him.&quot;

A White House press release in November 2000 acknowledged that &quot;actions approved by the U.S. government during this period aggravated political polarization and affected Chile&#x27;s long tradition of democratic elections&quot;

In a 2003 town hall with students, high school student James Doubek asked Secretary of State Colin Powell about the United States support for the coup, to which Powell replied that &quot;it is not a part of American history that we&#x27;re proud of&quot;.

During U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to Chile in 2011, the center-left coalition of Chilean political parties asked Obama to apologize for past U.S. support of Pinochet. An interview with the Associated Press, Mr Piñera said his government was &quot;categorically committed to contribute to the search for truth so that justice is done in all of these human rights cases&quot;. Obama did not respond to requests for an apology but said during a press conference that U.S. relations with Latin America had at times been &quot;extremely rocky,&quot; and that people needed to learn from and understand history, but not be trapped by it.

In February 2018, in an effort to create a &quot;lasting counterpoint&quot;, a statue honoring the slain Chilean diplomat and think tank policy analyst Orlando Letelier was erected on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C., near the location where Letelier was killed in a 1976 car bombing on the orders of Pinochet. The attack also claimed the life of Ronnie Karpen Moffitt, Letelier&#x27;s 25-year-old American co-worker. Michael Moffitt, husband of Ronnie Moffitt and also in the vehicle, survived the attack. The Chilean-orchestrated assassination had brought state-sponsored terrorism by an American-backed ally to the cradle of American dominion. Three of Letelier&#x27;s sons and a granddaughter whom Letelier had never been afforded the opportunity to meet attended the unveiling. The unveiling of Letelier&#x27;s commemorative statue came less than two years after the Obama administration had released a &quot;long classified CIA analysis...[that] cited &#x27;convincing evidence that President Pinochet personally ordered his intelligence chief to carry out the murder.&#x27;&quot; Letelier had served as Chile&#x27;s ambassador to the United States under Chile&#x27;s democratically elected Allende government. After Pinochet&#x27;s 1973 coup, Letelier became a political prisoner and sought political asylum in the United States, where he eventually came to spearhead the economic policy mission of a D.C.-based think tank, the Institute for Policy Studies, as well as organize international condemnation of Pinochet&#x27;s regime. The Institute for Policy Studies has long incorporated the advancement of human rights into the core of its mission.

<text>In commutative algebra, a regular local ring is a Noetherian local ring having the property that the minimal number of generators of its maximal ideal is equal to its Krull dimension. In symbols, let &quot;A&quot; be any Noetherian local ring with unique maximal ideal m, and suppose &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a minimal set of generators of m. Then Krull&#x27;s principal ideal theorem implies that &quot;n&quot; ≥ dim &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; is regular whenever &quot;n&quot; = dim &quot;A&quot;.

The concept is motivated by its geometric meaning. A point &quot;x&quot; on an algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; is nonsingular (a smooth point) if and only if the local ring formula_1 of germs at &quot;x&quot; is regular. (See also: regular scheme.) Regular local rings are &quot;not&quot; related to von Neumann regular rings.

For Noetherian local rings, there is the following chain of inclusions:
==Characterizations==
There are a number of useful definitions of a regular local ring, one of which is mentioned above. In particular, if formula_2 is a Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal formula_3, then the following are equivalent definitions:
* Let formula_4 where formula_5 is chosen as small as possible. Then formula_2 is regular if
::formula_7,
:where the dimension is the Krull dimension. The minimal set of generators of formula_8 are then called a &quot;regular system of parameters&quot;.
* Let formula_9 be the residue field of formula_2. Then formula_2 is regular if
::formula_12,
:where the second dimension is the Krull dimension.
* Let formula_13 be the global dimension of formula_2 (i.e., the supremum of the projective dimensions of all formula_2-modules.) Then formula_2 is regular if
::formula_17,
:in which case, formula_18.

Multiplicity one criterion states: if the completion of a Noetherian local ring &quot;A&quot; is unimixed (in the sense that there is no embedded prime divisor of the zero ideal and for each minimal prime &quot;p&quot;, formula_19) and if the multiplicity of &quot;A&quot; is one, then &quot;A&quot; is regular. (The converse is always true: the multiplicity of a regular local ring is one.) This criterion corresponds to a geometric intuition in algebraic geometry that a local ring of an intersection is regular if and only if the intersection is a transversal intersection.

In the positive characteristic case, there is the following important result due to Kunz: A Noetherian local ring formula_20 of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot; is regular if and only if the Frobenius morphism formula_21 is flat and formula_20 is reduced. No similar result is known in characteristic zero (it is unclear how one should replace the Frobenius morphism).

==Examples==
# Every field is a regular local ring. These have (Krull) dimension 0. In fact, the fields are exactly the regular local rings of dimension 0.
# Any discrete valuation ring is a regular local ring of dimension 1 and the regular local rings of dimension 1 are exactly the discrete valuation rings. For example, if &quot;k&quot; is a field and &quot;X&quot; is an indeterminate, then the ring of formal power series &quot;k&quot; is a regular local ring having (Krull) dimension 1.
# If &quot;p&quot; is an ordinary prime number, the ring of p-adic integers is an example of a discrete valuation ring, and consequently a regular local ring. In contrast to the example above, this ring does not contain a field.
# More generally, if &quot;k&quot; is a field and &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot; are indeterminates, then the ring of formal power series &quot;k&quot; is a regular local ring having (Krull) dimension &quot;d&quot;.
# Still more generally, if &quot;A&quot; is a regular local ring, then the formal power series ring &quot;A&quot; is regular local.
# If Z is the ring of integers and &quot;X&quot; is an indeterminate, the ring Z[&quot;X&quot;](2, &quot;X&quot;) (i.e. the ring Z[&quot;X&quot;] localized in the prime ideal (2, &quot;X&quot;) ) is an example of a 2-dimensional regular local ring which does not contain a field.
# By the structure theorem of Irvin Cohen, a complete regular local ring of Krull dimension &quot;d&quot; that contains a field &quot;k&quot; is a power series ring in &quot;d&quot; variables over an extension field of &quot;k&quot;.

== Non-examples ==
The ring formula_23 is not a regular local ring since it is finite dimensional but does not have finite global dimension. For example, there is an infinite resolution
:formula_24

Using another one of the characterizations, formula_2 has exactly one prime ideal formula_26, so the ring has Krull dimension formula_27, but formula_28 is the zero ideal, so formula_29 has formula_30 dimension at least formula_31. (In fact it is equal to formula_31 since formula_33 is a basis.)

==Basic properties==
The Auslander–Buchsbaum theorem states that every regular local ring is a unique factorization domain.

Every localization, as well as the completion, of a regular local ring is regular.

If formula_34 is a complete regular local ring that contains a field, then
:formula_35,
where formula_9 is the residue field, and formula_37, the Krull dimension.

==Origin of basic notions==

Regular local rings were originally defined by Wolfgang Krull in 1937, but they first became prominent in the work of Oscar Zariski a few years later, who showed that geometrically, a regular local ring corresponds to a smooth point on an algebraic variety. Let &quot;Y&quot; be an algebraic variety contained in affine &quot;n&quot;-space over a perfect field, and suppose that &quot;Y&quot; is the vanishing locus of the polynomials &quot;f1&quot;...,&quot;fm&quot;. &quot;Y&quot; is nonsingular at &quot;P&quot; if &quot;Y&quot; satisfies a Jacobian condition: If &quot;M&quot; = (∂&quot;fi&quot;/∂&quot;xj&quot;) is the matrix of partial derivatives of the defining equations of the variety, then the rank of the matrix found by evaluating &quot;M&quot; at &quot;P&quot; is &quot;n&quot; − dim &quot;Y&quot;. Zariski proved that &quot;Y&quot; is nonsingular at &quot;P&quot; if and only if the local ring of &quot;Y&quot; at &quot;P&quot; is regular. (Zariski observed that this can fail over non-perfect fields.) This implies that smoothness is an intrinsic property of the variety, in other words it does not depend on where or how the variety is embedded in affine space. It also suggests that regular local rings should have good properties, but before the introduction of techniques from homological algebra very little was known in this direction. Once such techniques were introduced in the 1950s, Auslander and Buchsbaum proved that every regular local ring is a unique factorization domain.

Another property suggested by geometric intuition is that the localization of a regular local ring should again be regular. Again, this lay unsolved until the introduction of homological techniques. It was Jean-Pierre Serre who found a homological characterization of regular local rings: A local ring &quot;A&quot; is regular if and only if &quot;A&quot; has finite global dimension, i.e. if every &quot;A&quot;-module has a projective resolution of finite length. It is easy to show that the property of having finite global dimension is preserved under localization, and consequently that localizations of regular local rings at prime ideals are again regular. 

This justifies the definition of &quot;regularity&quot; for non-local commutative rings given in the next section.

==Regular ring==

In commutative algebra, a regular ring is a commutative Noetherian ring, such that the localization at every prime ideal is a regular local ring: that is, every such localization has the property that the minimal number of generators of its maximal ideal is equal to its Krull dimension.

The origin of the term &quot;regular ring&quot; lies in the fact that an affine variety is nonsingular (that is every point is regular) if and only if its ring of regular functions is regular.

For regular rings, Krull dimension agrees with global homological dimension.

Jean-Pierre Serre defined a regular ring as a commutative noetherian ring of &quot;finite&quot; global homological dimension. His definition is stronger than the definition above, which allows regular rings of infinite Krull dimension.

Examples of regular rings include fields (of dimension zero) and Dedekind domains. If &quot;A&quot; is regular then so is &quot;A&quot;[&quot;X&quot;], with dimension one greater than that of &quot;A&quot;. 

In particular if is a field, the ring of integers, or a principal ideal domain, then the polynomial ring formula_38 is regular. In the case of a field, this is Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem.

Any localization of a regular ring is regular as well.

A regular ring is reduced but need not be an integral domain. For example, the product of two regular integral domains is regular, but not an integral domain.

<text>The Panama–Pacific International Exposition was a world&#x27;s fair held in San Francisco, California, United States, from February 20 to December 4, 1915. Its stated purpose was to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal, but it was widely seen in the city as an opportunity to showcase its recovery from the 1906 earthquake. The fair was constructed on a site along the northern shore, between the Presidio and Fort Mason, now known as the Marina District.

== Exhibits and themes ==
Among the exhibits at the exposition was the &quot;C. P. Huntington&quot;, the first steam locomotive purchased by Southern Pacific Railroad; the locomotive is now on static display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. A telephone line was also established to New York City so people across the continent could hear the Pacific Ocean. The Liberty Bell traveled by train on a nationwide tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to attend the exposition.

The 1915 American Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup auto races were held February 27 and March 6 on a circuit set up around the Exposition grounds. The Smithsonian Institution also had an exhibition at the Exposition.

=== Native American representation ===

Native American culture was a topic of interest during the nine-month long exposition with multiple attractions dedicated to Native American life. The most popular attraction at the exposition that depicted Native American life is James Earle Fraser&#x27;s statue &quot;The End of the Trail&quot;. Fraser&#x27;s statue, which showed a Native American man slumped over on a horse, reflected the American idea at the time, that the Native American race was doomed for extinction. The exposition not only celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal, but also advances made by the American people, part of which were the conquests of indigenous people by Americans as well as Europeans. These celebrations over the Native community, can be seen through artworks such as &quot;The End of the Trail&quot; and &quot;The Pioneer&quot; or tributes to Francisco Pizarro and Hernán Cortés. In comparison to previous world fairs, the Panama–Pacific International Exposition showcased Native Americans more as nobles rather than savage people, but who were still inevitably destined to become extinct. These ideas were presented in plays, known as pageants, where Native Americans played small roles such as in &quot;Catalonian dragoons, muleteers, and a tribe of Carmel Indians.&quot; While the demise of Native American people was a rhetoric created by fair organizers, scholars have argued that in reality, the Native persona was very present and did not reflect the idea that it was a disappearing civilization. Native Americans were in fact part of the fair, but also attended as visitors, performers, and workers. More recently, scholars have focused on Native representation in San Francisco&#x27;s 1915 rival world fair, San Diego&#x27;s 1915 Panama–California Exposition, that showed Native American life in a more anthropological light versus this American ideal.

=== Women and gender roles ===
During the Panama–Pacific International Exposition women were in charge of their own board, known as the Woman&#x27;s Board of San Francisco&#x27;s Panama–Pacific International Exposition. The board, also called the Board of Lady Managers, allowed women to take part in organizing different aspects of the fair and more importantly gave them the opportunity to have a campaigning platform for discussing women&#x27;s rights and social issues. It was commonly argued that the fair celebrated male dominance over women by not providing a building for women. Also, men and women were depicted differently in artworks advertising the exposition. White women, specifically, were presented as caretakers while men as strong and powerful saviors, such as in the poster &quot;13th Labor of Hercules.&quot;
At the time, there was an idea of a &quot;New Woman&quot; who was more progressive and advanced intellectually and sexually. This idea of a &quot;New Woman&quot; related to the overarching themes of the fair: modernity, and progress. In efforts to promote the fair, organizers used the &quot;New Woman&quot; as an advertising tactic and proof that San Francisco was an evolving and safe environment for tourists. During the fair, women could be seen posing with agriculture from around the state in celebration of California&#x27;s produce. All the women were young, beautiful white women who were often the highlight of newspaper articles and events. This use of women presented the idea that they were useful only for their beauty but failed to appreciate their intellectual capacity and physical abilities.

The International Conference of Women Workers to Promote Permanent Peace was held on July 4–7 in the &quot;Peace Palace&quot;, a transformation of the Civic Auditorium (now the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium). May Wright Sewall, by appointment of Charles C. Moore, chair of the exposition, organized the peace conference. It was attended by women pacificists from all over the world, especially the neutral countries of World War I.

One of the most memorable achievements of the Women&#x27;s Board was the installation of statues that celebrated women, specifically mothers, known as the &quot;Pioneer Mother.&quot; 

The National Society Colonial Dames XVII Century was established by six women while attending the exposition.

== Architecture ==
The centerpiece was the Tower of Jewels, which rose to and was covered with over 100,000 cut glass Novagems. The colored &quot;gems&quot; sparkled in sunlight throughout the day and were illuminated by over 50 powerful electrical searchlights at night.

South of the Tower, the Fountain of Energy flowed at the center of the South Gardens, flanked by the Palace of Horticulture on the west and the Festival Hall to the east. The arch of the Tower served as the gateway to the Court of the Universe, leading to the Court of the Four Seasons to the west and the Court of Abundance to the east. These courts formed the primary exhibit area for the fair, which included the Palaces of Food Products, Agriculture, Liberal Arts, and Education and Social Economy and surrounding the Court of the Four Seasons; and the Palaces of Transportation, Mines and Metallurgy, Varied Industries, and Manufacturers surrounding the Court of Abundance.

The central court group was bookended on the east by the Palace of Machinery, the largest of all the halls built for the Exhibition, and on the west by the Palace of Fine Arts, which survives onsite.

Further west into the Presidio, down The Avenue of the Nations, were national and states&#x27; buildings, displaying customs and products unique to the area represented. The far western end of the Fair, past the states&#x27; pavilions, was reserved for live stock exhibits. At the opposite end of the Fair, near Fort Mason was &quot;The Zone&quot;, an avenue of popular amusements and concessions stands.

=== Construction ===
Constructed from temporary materials (primarily staff, a combination of plaster and burlap fiber), almost all the fair&#x27;s various buildings and attractions were pulled down in late 1915. Intended to fall into pieces at the close of the fair (reportedly because the architect believed every great city needed ruins), the only presently-surviving building on the Exposition grounds, Bernard Maybeck&#x27;s Palace of Fine Arts, remained in place, slowly falling into disrepair. The hall, used to display painting and sculpture during the Fair, was repurposed as a garage for jeeps during World War II. The Palace, including the colonnade with its signature weeping women and rotunda dome, was completely reconstructed in the 1960s and a seismic retrofit was completed in early 2009. The Exploratorium, an interactive science museum, occupied the northern 2/3 of the Palace from 1969 to 2013; the city-owned Palace of Fine Arts Theater, has occupied the southern 1/3 since 1970.

Several other buildings were saved immediately following the Exposition, including the California, Missouri, and Philippine buildings, which were built on government land.

=== Other surviving buildings ===
Buildings from the Exposition that still stand today (other than the Palace of Fine Arts) include what is now called the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium at Civic Center Plaza and the Japanese Tea house, which was barged down the Bay to Belmont, California, and operated successively as a private residence, speakeasy, and restaurant.

Also surviving are the one-third scale steam locomotives of the Overfair Railroad that operated at the Exposition. They had been maintained in working order at the Swanton Pacific Railroad Society located on Cal Poly San Luis Obispo&#x27;s Swanton Ranch just north of Santa Cruz. But a forest fire swept through the area in 2020, severely damaging the railroad, which has not run since then.

The Legion of Honor Museum, in Lincoln Park, was the gift of Alma de Bretteville Spreckels, wife of the sugar magnate and thoroughbred racehorse owner/breeder Adolph B. Spreckels. The building is a full-scale replica of the French Pavilion from the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, which in turn was a three-quarter-scale version of the Palais de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur also known as the Hôtel de Salm in Paris by George Applegarth and H. Guillaume. At the close of the exposition, the French government granted Spreckels permission to construct a permanent replica of the French Pavilion, but World War I delayed the groundbreaking until 1921.

The warehouse for the exposition was moved to Fort Hunter Liggett in South Monterey County and the structure, nicknamed the &quot;Tin Barn&quot;, has served as the base fire department for the last 30 years. After its move, it initially served as a horse barn, and since then, it has served as a gym, PX and a movie theater for the base.

== Commemorations and legacy ==

The US Post Office issued a set of four postage stamps to commemorate the exposition, with designs depicting a profile of Vasco Núñez de Balboa (1¢), the Pedro Miguel Locks of the Panama Canal (2¢), the Golden Gate (5¢), and the discovery of San Francisco Bay (10¢). The stamps were first put on sale in 1913, to promote the coming event, and perforated 12, and then reissued in 1914 and 1915, perforated 10. Their prices today range widely; the 2¢ of 1913 is available for under a dollar in used condition, while an unused 10¢ of the scarcer orange-yellow variety in 1915 can be worth up to a thousand United States dollars.

The United States Congress authorized the San Francisco Mint (also known as &quot;The Granite Lady&quot;) to issue a series of five commemorative coins. Said coins were the 1915-S silver Panama-Pacific half dollar and four gold coins. The denominations of the gold coins were $1, $ (quarter eagle) and $50 (in two types: a round coin, and an unusual octagonal coin). The Panama-Pacific coins have the distinction of being the first commemorative coins to bear the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, and were also the first commemoratives to be struck at a branch mint. The two lower denomination gold coins are scarce, while the two $50 ones are extremely rare. The silver half dollar had a mintage of 27,134 and in modestly worn condition is available for several hundred dollars.
Numismatist Farran Zerbe supervised the creation of a series of commemorative medals, an award medal, a souvenir medal, and diplomas.

=== Centennial ===

In 2015, the California Historical Society, the Maybeck Foundation, and Innovation Hangar partnered with the City and County of San Francisco to commemorate the centennial of the transformative 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition.

On June 20, 2015 a commemorative orchestra, chorus and band concert was held at the Palace of Fine Arts to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the fair.

A feature film, &quot;When the World Came to San Francisco&quot;, which tells the story of the fair, was made by writer and director R. Christian Anderson. It was part of the city&#x27;s official centennial celebration sanctioned by the California Historical Society. The film had its world premiere at the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park on October 30, 2015.

A large exhibition marking the centennial of the PPIE opened at the de Young Museum in 2015, along with a concurrent exhibition of the photographs of Willard Worden, who had an exhibit of his Art Photos at the PPIE and, as an official photographer, took many photos of the fair by day and by night.

<doc id="506965" wikidata="Q2869975" url="?curid=506965" title="Ghriba synagogue bombing">
<text>}}

The Ghriba synagogue bombing was carried out by Niser bin Muhammad Nasr Nawar on the El Ghriba synagogue in Tunisia in 2002.

==Bombing==
On 11 April 2002, a natural gas truck fitted with explosives drove past security barriers at the ancient El Ghriba synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba. The truck detonated at the front of the synagogue, killing 14 German tourists, three Tunisians, and two French nationals. More than 30 others were wounded.

Although the explosion was initially called an accident, as Tunisia, France, and Germany investigated, it became clear that it was a deliberate attack. A 24-year-old man named Niser bin Muhammad Nasr Nawar was the suicide bomber, who carried out the attack with the aid of a relative. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the attack, which was reportedly organized by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Saad bin Laden. However, Saad&#x27;s family denied he was involved in the attack.

In March 2003, five people were arrested in Spain in connection with the attack. On May 10, 2006, two of them, Spanish businessman Enrique Cerda and Pakistani national Ahmed Rukhsar, were sentenced to five years in prison for collaborating with a terrorist group. In June 2003, a German man named Christian Ganczarski was arrested at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris in connection with the bombing. He was arrested by a joint intelligence operation, in the frame of Alliance Base, which is located in Paris, and transferred to Fresnes Prison in Paris. In February 2009, Ganczarski was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the bombing.

On 11 April 2012, Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Tunisian Grand Rabbi Haim Bitan, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Tunisia, and Boris Boillon, Ambassador of the French Republic to Tunisia, visited Djerba to pay their respects to the victims on the attack&#x27;s 10th anniversary. Marzouki met with victims&#x27; families and delivered a speech where he strongly condemned this attack and reassured Tunisian Jews of their place in Tunisian society.

<doc id="506966" wikidata="Q2702850" url="?curid=506966" title="Sheep (Pink Floyd song)">
<text>&quot;Sheep&quot; (Originally titled &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot;) is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on the 1977 album &quot;Animals&quot;. It was written by bassist Roger Waters and performed live from 1974 to 1977. Waters has since played the song on solo tours.

==History==
Waters&#x27; lyrics refer to the working class, who decide to rebel against the upper classes (referred to as &quot;Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pigs&quot; on &quot;Animals&quot;). This was influenced by inner-city riots that he remembered happening in Notting Hill, and that he felt were going to occur again, such as in Brixton.

During their tours in 1974, Pink Floyd played three new songs in the first half of the shows, followed by &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; in its entirety. The three new songs were &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Crazy&quot; (which later became &quot;Dogs&quot;), &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; and &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; (which later became &quot;Sheep&quot;).

During performances of &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot;, a recording of a DJ at BBC Radio called Jimmy Young was played after being cut up and reassembled randomly. This was Roger Waters&#x27; idea of a man &quot;raving and drooling&quot; (or being insane). The lyrics of the song at this point were different.

&quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; was originally a more jam-based song. While the basic motif was already in place—a held note from the vocalist (Waters) being crossfaded into the same note on a synthesizer, with various inhuman effects applied—Waters had yet to write anything for the sections repeating F♯7 and A7 (such as &quot;You better watch out! There may be dogs about&quot;, and so on), and so these sections, while clearly part of the song structure, were rendered instrumentally. While Gilmour later stated that &quot;Dogs&quot; in its earlier incarnation as &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Crazy&quot; simply had too many words for him to sing, &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; appeared to suffer more from a lack thereof.

&quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Crazy&quot; and &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; were originally planned to be on the album following the 1974 tours, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, but plans changed and they ended up in different forms on &quot;Animals&quot;. In November 2011, versions of both tracks recorded at Wembley in 1974 were officially released as part of the Experience and Immersion versions of the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; album.

In live versions from 1977, backing guitarist Snowy White played bass guitar as Waters shared electric guitar duties with David Gilmour. The performance was almost identical to the album version except that had a slower ending with Richard Wright playing an organ solo.

Ian Peel, a musical columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noted the resemblance of &quot;Sheep&quot; to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme, due to its bassline and sound effects.

==Recording==
The song was recorded during April, May and July 1976 at the band&#x27;s own Britannia Row Studios, Islington, London. On the 1974–75 tours, Waters played bass for the song, but during recording, he switched to rhythm guitar, while David Gilmour overdubbed the bass guitar part in a style similar to Waters. Richard Wright played the introduction on a Rhodes Piano, which was overdubbed with sheep noises in the background.

The middle section of the song features a narration processed through a vocoder and is a parody of Psalm 23. Live, the narration was performed by Nick Mason.

==Personnel==
*Roger Waters – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, tape and electronic effects, 
*David Gilmour – lead guitar, bass guitar, echoed vocal (from &quot;Dogs&quot;)
*Richard Wright – Fender Rhodes piano, EMS VCS 3, Minimoog, ARP String Synthesizer, Hammond organ 
*Nick Mason – drums, tape effects, vocoder

<doc id="506973" wikidata="Q567797" url="?curid=506973" title="Dallas College">
<text>Dallas College is a public community college with seven campuses in Dallas County, Texas. It serves more than 70,000 students annually in degree-granting, continuing education, and adult education programs.

Dallas College offers associate degree and career/technical certificate programs in more than 100 areas of study as well as a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education. It is one of the largest community college systems in Texas.

== History ==
Dallas College was founded as the Dallas County Junior College District in 1965, and became known as the Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) in 1972. The first campus, El Centro College, was established in 1966 in downtown Dallas. Bill J. Priest served as the founding chancellor from 1965 until his retirement in 1981.

=== Consolidation ===
In February 2020, the Dallas County Community College District announced a plan to consolidate its seven constituent institutions, which at the time were separately accredited, into one accredited institution with multiple campuses. The move was primarily aimed at simplifying the enrollment process and graduation requirements. Students originally needed to complete at least 25% of credits at one campus; the merger removed this requirement.

The merger was approved by accreditor SACSCOC on June 12, 2020. In tandem, the district changed its name to Dallas College, repositioning its former constituent institutions as campuses (e.g., Brookhaven College became Dallas College Brookhaven Campus).

The merger was controversial among faculty, as it resulted in layoffs, changes to campus culture, and a more centralized governance structure. In particular, the college eliminated its rolling three-year faculty contracts in favor of one-year contracts, which substantially weakened job security for full-time faculty. In October 2021, roughly a year after the consolidation, full-time faculty passed a resolution of no confidence against then-chancellor Dr. Joe May.

== Service area ==
As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of Dallas College consists of Dallas County and the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District, a portion of which is in adjacent Denton County.

Dallas College maintains an &quot;open-door&quot; admissions policy regarding new students, allowing many people to attend college who otherwise might not be able to do so.

== Campuses ==

Dallas College has seven primary campuses. Prior to the 2020 consolidation, each of these institutions were separately accredited.
=== Centers ===
In addition to the seven campuses, Dallas College has Centers which either serve surrounding communities or are used for specific purposes. Prior to the 2020 consolidation, each center was associated with a specific campus.
== Administration ==
The Dallas College board of trustees consists of seven members who are entrusted with governing the district. The board defines the vision of the district, serves as a liaison between the district and the community, approves annual budgets and sets policies, among other responsibilities. Board members are elected officials who serve six-year terms without compensation.

<doc id="506980" wikidata="Q366868" url="?curid=506980" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia">
<text>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis. It results from the deficiency of one of the five enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. Most of these disorders involve excessive or deficient production of hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, or sex steroids, and can alter development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in some affected infants, children, or adults. It is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in humans.

==Types==
CAH can occur in various forms. The clinical presentation of each form is different and depends to a large extent on the underlying enzyme defect, its precursor retention, and deficient products. Classical forms appear in infancy and nonclassical forms appear in late childhood. The presentation in patients with classic CAH can be further subdivided into two forms: salt-wasting and simple-virilizing depending on whether mineralocorticoid deficiency presents or absents, respectively. This subtyping is often not clinically meaningful, though, because all patients lose salt to some degree, and clinical presentations may overlap.

===Classic===
====Salt-wasting====
In 75% of cases of severe enzyme deficiency, insufficient aldosterone production can lead to salt wasting, failure to thrive, and potentially fatal hypovolemia and shock. A missed diagnosis of salt-loss CAH is related to the increased risk of early neonatal morbidity and death.

====Simple-virilizing====
The main feature of CAH in newborn females is the abnormal development of the external genitalia, which has varying degrees of virilization. According to clinical practice guidelines, for newborns found to have bilateral inaccessible gonads, CAH evaluation should be considered. If virilizing CAH cannot be identified and treated, both boys and girls may undergo rapid postnatal growth and virilization.

===Nonclassic===
In addition to the salt-wasting and simple-virilizing forms of CAH diagnosed in infancy, a mild or &quot;nonclassic&quot; form exists, which is characterized by varying degrees of postnatal androgen excess, but is sometimes asymptomatic. The nonclassic form may be noticed in late childhood and may lead to signs of hyperandrogenism such as accelerated growth, acne, hirsutism, premature pubarche, menstrual irregularities, and secondary polycystic ovary syndrome. In adult males, early balding and infertility may suggest the diagnosis. The nonclassic form is characterized by mild subclinical impairment of cortisol synthesis and serum cortisol concentration is usually normal.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of CAH vary depending upon the form of CAH and the sex of the patient. Symptoms can include:

Due to inadequate mineralocorticoids:
* Vomiting due to salt-wasting, leading to dehydration and death

Due to excess androgens:
* In extreme virilization, clitoromegaly (elongated clitoris) with a phallic-like structure is seen.
* Ambiguous genitalia, in some infants, occurs such that initially identifying external genitalia as &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; is difficult.
* Early pubic hair and rapid growth occurs in childhood.
* Precocious puberty or failure of puberty to occur (sexual infantilism: absent or delayed puberty)
* Excessive facial hair, virilization, and/or menstrual irregularity in adolescence
* Infertility due to anovulation
* Shallow vagina

Due to insufficient androgens and estrogens:
* Undervirilization in XY males can result in an apparent vulva.
* Ambiguous genitalia in XY males with 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (3β-HSD2D).
* In females, hypogonadism can cause sexual infantilism or abnormal pubertal development, infertility, and other reproductive system abnormalities.

==Genetics==
CAH results from mutations of genes for enzymes mediating the biochemical steps of production of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, or sex steroids from cholesterol by the adrenal glands (steroidogenesis).

Each form of CAH is associated with a specific defective gene. The most common type (95% of cases) involves the gene for 21-hydroxylase, which is found on 6p21.3 as part of the HLA complex; 21-hydroxylase deficiency results from a unique mutation with two highly homologous near-copies in series consisting of an active gene (&quot;CYP21A2&quot;) and an inactive pseudogene (&quot;CYP21A1P&quot;). Mutant alleles result from recombination between the active and pseudogenes (gene conversion). About 5% of cases of CAH are due to defects in the gene encoding 11β-hydroxylase and consequent 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. Other, more rare forms of CAH are caused by mutations in genes, including &quot;HSD3B2&quot; (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2), &quot;CYP17A1&quot; (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase),&quot; CYP11A1&quot; (P450scc; cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme), &quot;STAR&quot; (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; StAR), &quot;CYB5A&quot; (cytochrome b5), and &quot;CYPOR &quot;(cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; POR).

===Expressivity===
Further variability is introduced by the degree of enzyme inefficiency produced by the specific alleles each patient has. Some alleles result in more severe degrees of enzyme inefficiency. In general, severe degrees of inefficiency produce changes in the fetus and problems in prenatal or perinatal life. Milder degrees of inefficiency are usually associated with excessive or deficient sex hormone effects in childhood or adolescence, while the mildest forms of CAH interfere with ovulation and fertility in adults.

==Diagnosis==
===Clinical evaluation===
Female infants with classic CAH have ambiguous genitalia due to exposure to high concentrations of androgens &quot;in utero&quot;. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in genotypically normal female infants (46XX). Less severely affected females may present with early pubarche. Young women may present with symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovaries, hirsutism).

Males with classic CAH generally have no signs of CAH at birth. Some may present with hyperpigmentation, due to co-secretion with melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and possible penile enlargement. Age of diagnosis of males with CAH varies and depends on the severity of aldosterone deficiency. Boys with salt-wasting disease present early with symptoms of hyponatremia and hypovolemia. Boys with non-salt-wasting disease present later with signs of virilization.

In rarer forms of CAH, males are undermasculinized and females generally have no signs or symptoms at birth.

===Laboratory studies===
Genetic analysis can be helpful to confirm a diagnosis of CAH, but it is not necessary if classic clinical and laboratory findings are present.

In classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, laboratory studies will show:

:* Hypoglycemia (due to hypocortisolism) - One of cortisol&#x27;s many functions is to increase blood glucose levels. This occurs via a combination of several mechanisms, including (a) the stimulation of gluconeogesis (i.e. the creation of new glucose) in the liver, (b) the promotion of glycogenolysis (i.e. the breakdown of glycogen into glucose), and (c) the prevention of glucose leaving the bloodstream via the downregulation of GLUT-4 receptors (which normally promote movement of glucose from the bloodstream into adipose and muscle tissues). Therefore, when cortisol is deficient, these processes (effectively) occur in the reverse direction. Although there are compensatory mechanisms that mitigate the impact of hypocortisolism, they are limited in their extent and the net effect is still hypoglycemia.
:* Hyponatremia (due to hypoaldosteronism) - Aldosterone is the end product of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure via blood pressure surveillance in the Kidney Juxtaglomerular apparatus. Aldosterone normally functions to increase sodium retention (which brings water as well) in exchange for potassium. Thus, lack of aldosterone causes hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. In fact, this is a distinguishing point from 11-hydroxylase deficiency, in which one of the increased products is 11-deoxycorticosterone that has weak mineralocorticoid activity. In 11-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycorticosterone is produced in such excess that it acts to retain sodium at the expense of potassium. It is this reason that patients with 11-hydroxylase deficiency do not show salt wasting (although sometimes they do in infancy), and instead have hypertension/water retention and sometimes hypokalemia.
:* Hyperkalemia (due to hypoaldosteronism)
:* Elevated 17α-hydroxyprogesterone

Classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically causes 17α-hydroxyprogesterone blood levels &gt;242 nmol/L. (For comparison, a full-term infant at three days of age should have &lt;3 nmol/L. Many neonatal screening programs have specific reference ranges by weight and gestational age because high levels may be seen in premature infants without CAH.) Salt-wasting patients tend to have higher 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels than non-salt-wasting patients. In mild cases, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone may not be elevated in a particular random blood sample, but it will rise during a corticotropin stimulation test.

===Classification===
Cortisol is an adrenal steroid hormone required for normal endocrine function. Production begins in the second month of fetal life. Poor cortisol production is a hallmark of most forms of CAH. Inefficient cortisol production results in rising levels of ACTH, because cortisol feeds back to inhibit ACTH production, so loss of cortisol results in increased ACTH. This increased ACTH stimulation induces overgrowth (&quot;hyperplasia&quot;) and overactivity of the steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex. The defects causing adrenal hyperplasia are congenital (i.e. present at birth).

Cortisol deficiency in CAH is usually partial, and not the most serious problem for an affected person. Synthesis of cortisol shares steps with synthesis of mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone, androgens such as testosterone, and estrogens such as estradiol. The resulting excessive or deficient production of these three classes of hormones produce the most important problems for people with CAH. Specific enzyme inefficiencies are associated with characteristic patterns of over- or underproduction of mineralocorticoids or sex steroids.

Since the 1960s, most endocrinologists have referred to the forms of CAH by the traditional names in the left column, which generally correspond to the deficient enzyme activity. As exact structures and genes for the enzymes were identified in the 1980s, most of the enzymes were found to be cytochrome P450 oxidases and were renamed to reflect this. In some cases, more than one enzyme was found to participate in a reaction, and in other cases, a single enzyme mediated in more than one reaction. Variation in different tissues and mammalian species also was found.

In all its forms, congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for about 95% of diagnosed cases of CAH. Unless another specific enzyme is mentioned, &quot;CAH&quot; in nearly all contexts refers to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. (The terms &quot;salt-wasting CAH&quot;, and &quot;simple virilizing CAH&quot; usually refer to subtypes of this condition.) CAH due to deficiencies of enzymes other than 21-hydroxylase present many of the same management challenges, as 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but some involve mineralocorticoid excess or sex steroid deficiency.

==Screening==
Currently, in the United States and over 40 other countries, every child born is screened for 21-hydroxylase CAH at birth. This test detects elevated levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). Detecting high levels of 17-OHP enables early detection of CAH. Newborns detected early enough can be placed on medication and live relatively normal lives.

The screening process, however, is characterized by a high false-positive rate. In one study, CAH screening had the lowest positive predictive value (111 true-positive cases among 20,647 abnormal screening results in a 2-year period, or 0.53%, compared with 6.36% for biotinidase deficiency, 1.84% for congenital hypo-thyroidism, 0.56% for classic galactosemia, and 2.9% for phenylketonuria). According to this estimate, 200 unaffected newborns required clinical and laboratory follow-up for every true case of CAH.

In 2020, Wael AbdAlmageed from USC Information Sciences Institute and Mimi Kim from USC Keck School Of Medicine led a joint study in which they used deep learning technology to analyze the facial morphology and features of CAH patients compared to control. In this cross-sectional study of 102 patients with CAH and 144 control participants, deep learning methods achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92% for predicting CAH from facial images. Facial features distinguished patients with CAH from controls, and analyses of facial regions found that the nose and upper face were most contributory. The findings suggest that facial morphologic features, as analyzed by deep neural network techniques, can be used as a phenotypic biomarker to predict CAH.

==Treatment==
Since the clinical manifestations of each form of CAH are unique and depend to a large extent on the underlying enzyme defects, their precursor retention and defective products, the therapeutic goal of CAH is to replenish insufficient adrenal hormones and suppress excess of precursors.

Treatment of all forms of CAH may include any of:

# Supplying enough glucocorticoid to reduce hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens or mineralocorticoids
# Providing replacement mineralocorticoid and extra salt if the person is deficient
# Providing replacement testosterone or estrogens at puberty if the person is deficient
# Additional treatments to optimize growth by delaying puberty or delaying bone maturation

If CAH is caused by the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, then treatment aims to normalize levels of androstenedione, but normalization of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is a sign of overtreatment. Treatment can be monitored by measuring androstenedione and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels in blood or saliva.

Crinecerfont (Crenessity) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2024.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence varies ethnically. In the United States, congenital adrenal hyperplasia in its classic form is particularly common in Native Americans and Yupik Inuit (incidence ). Among American Caucasians, the incidence of the classic form is about ).

Continued treatment and wellness are enhanced by education and follow up.

==History==
===Before the twentieth century===
Italian anatomist, Luigi De Crecchio (1832-1894), provided the earliest known description of a case of probable CAH.

De Crecchio then described the internal organs, which included a normal vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

He interviewed many people and satisfied himself that Joseph Marzo &quot;conducted himself within the sexual area exclusively as a male&quot;, even to the point of contracting the &quot;French disease&quot; (syphilis) on two occasions. The cause of death was another in a series of episodes of vomiting and diarrhea.

This account was translated by Alfred Bongiovanni from De Crecchio (&quot;&quot;Sopra un caso di apparenzi virili in una donna&quot;. &quot;Morgagni&quot; 7:154–188, 1865) in 1963 for an article in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
The association of excessive sex steroid effects with diseases of the adrenal cortex have been recognized for over a century. The term &quot;adrenogenital syndrome&quot; was applied to both sex-steroid producing tumors and severe forms of CAH for much of the 20th century, before some of the forms of CAH were understood. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which also dates to the first half of the century, has become the preferred term to reduce ambiguity and to emphasize the underlying pathophysiology of the disorders.

Much modern understanding and treatment of CAH comes from research conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore in the middle of the 20th century. Lawson Wilkins, &quot;founder&quot; of pediatric endocrinology, worked out the apparently paradoxical pathophysiology: that hyperplasia and overproduction of adrenal androgens resulted from impaired capacity for making cortisol. He reported use of adrenal cortical extracts to treat children with CAH in 1950. Genital reconstructive surgery was also pioneered at Hopkins. After application of karyotyping to CAH and other intersex disorders in the 1950s, John Money, JL Hampson, and JG Hampson persuaded both the scientific community and the public that sex assignment should not be based on any single biological criterion, and gender identity was largely learned and has no simple relationship with chromosomes or hormones. See Intersex for a fuller history, including recent controversies over reconstructive surgery.

Hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and prednisone were available by the late 1950s. By 1980, all of the relevant steroids could be measured in blood by reference laboratories for patient care. By 1990, nearly all specific genes and enzymes had been identified. The last decade, though, has seen a number of new developments, discussed more extensively in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency:

# Debate over the value of genital reconstructive surgery and changing standards
# Debate over sex assignment of severely virilized XX infants
# New treatments to improve height outcomes
# Newborn screening programs to detect CAH at birth
# Increasing attempts to treat CAH before birth

<text>The 2002 Karachi bus bombing was one of a series of deadly strikes against Westerners in Pakistan in 2002. The blast killed 14 people and wounded another 40. The attack took place in Karachi, Sindh.

== Details ==
On May 8, 2002, a man driving a car bomb pulled up next to a bus outside Sheraton Hotel in Karachi. He detonated the car, ripping the bus apart, and killing himself, 11 Frenchmen, and two Pakistanis. The Frenchmen were engineers working with Pakistan to design an Agosta 90B-class submarine for Pakistani Navy. About 40 others were wounded.

The bombing occurred close to the Pearl-Continental Hotel where the New Zealand national cricket team were staying during their tour of 2002. The team&#x27;s physiotherapist Dayle Shackel received a minor cut to his forearm from flying glass. The team abandoned the tour immediately and returned to New Zealand on the first available flight.

Al-Qaeda was blamed for the blast. On September 18, 2002, a man named Sharib Zubair, who was believed to have masterminded the attack, was arrested. In 2003, two men were sentenced to death for the bombing by a Karachi court. The suspected bombmaker, Mufti Mohammad Sabir, was arrested in Karachi on September 8, 2005. There were several convictions in the case, though Pakistani courts acquitted three defendants by 2009.

==Karachigate==

Contrary to official announcements by the Pakistani and the French governments at the time, it is now thought to be unlikely that those responsible for the attack had links to al-Qaeda. In 2007, anti-terrorism judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, assigned to lead the investigation into the bombing, was replaced by two investigating magistrates, Marc Trevidic and Renaud Van Ruymbeke. The former opened a new line in the investigation: that the attack was linked to the halting of kickback. The resulting scandal has been dubbed &quot;Karachigate&quot;.

An investigation is currently underway in France to establish the extent to which former French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy were implicated in the sale of kickbacks to Pakistani officials. Sarkozy was allegedly involved in accepting kickbacks from Pakistan to fund the presidential campaign of Balladur. When Jacques Chirac came to power, he cancelled the Pakistani officials&#x27; kickbacks, angering many people in Pakistan.

<text>The South African 3rd Infantry Division was an infantry division of the South African Army during World War II.

== History ==

This division was formed in South Africa on 23 October 1940 with its headquarters in Pretoria.

The 3rd Infantry Division as a whole did not go into combat, but its 7th Motorized brigade group participated in the 1942 Invasion of Madagascar. The division organised and trained the South African home defence forces, performed garrison duties and trained and supplied replacements for the 1st and 2nd Divisions deployed to East Africa and later to the Western Desert.

The division was based in Pretoria until 1942, whereafter the division then moved to 
Ermelo in the Eastern Transvaal, although its constituent units were deployed as far as the then South West Africa. 
On 4 April 1942 the division was redesignated the South African 3rd Armoured Division. This division was disbanded on 17 May 1943, without ever having been deployed. However, one of the division&#x27;s constituent units, the 7th Motorised Brigade, did take part in the invasion of Madagascar.

Major General Hermanus Botha was the commander of the division from 23 August 1940 until its redesignation.

==Order of battle==
On formation in October 1940, the Division was structured as follows:
*Division Troops
**6th Light Field Brigade, SAA
**8th, 9th, 10th Field Companies, SAEC?
**17th Divisional Field Park Company, SAEC?

<doc id="506988" wikidata="Q590004" url="?curid=506988" title="Ninja Gaiden">
<text>is a media franchise based on action video games by Tecmo featuring the ninja Ryu Hayabusa as its protagonist. The series was originally known as in Japan. The word &quot;gaiden&quot; in the North American &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; title means &quot;side story&quot; in Japanese. The original arcade version, first two Nintendo Entertainment System games and Game Boy game were released as Shadow Warriors in PAL regions. As of 2008, the series has shipped over 7.7 million copies.

The series gained popularity on the NES for its tight action-platform gameplay, catchy music and, according to G4&#x27;s &quot;X-Play&quot;, for being the first console game to have the story presented in cinematic cutscenes. The 8-bit trilogy was enhanced for the 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. Sega released two &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games for the Game Gear and Master System, the latter only for PAL regions. The original series&#x27; setting of said universe is a retro-futuristic version of the 1980s. A new game, titled &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, was released in 2004 as a 3D action game on the Xbox, developed by Team Ninja, the makers of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;. The &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; franchise is known for its high degree of difficulty, particularly the original NES version and the Xbox revival.

According to &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, the gameplay of the &quot;Strider&quot; arcade franchise was a vital influence on the modern incarnation of the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; franchise.

==Arcade game==

The arcade version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (released in 1988, in Japan, North America, and Europe) was a &quot;Bad Dudes&quot;-style beat &#x27;em up, in which the player controls a nameless blue ninja (red for a second player) as he travels to various regions of the United States, to defeat an evil cult led by a descendant of Nostradamus, who is trying to fulfill his ancestor&#x27;s prophecy of the rise of an evil king in 1999. The player has a variety of techniques, such as a flying neck throw and a backflip. The player can obtain power-ups by throwing characters into background objects, such as street lights and dumpsters. The player fights primarily with their bare hands, although a sword can be used for a limited time as a power-up; they can use overhead environmental objects as a prop from which he can deliver more powerful kicking attacks. Although the game takes place in different environments, there are primarily only five kinds of enemies, all of which appear in every level (although some levels have extra enemy types). The game is remembered for its infamous continue screen, where the player character is chained to a table underneath a descending circular saw.

The original &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; arcade game was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, and ZX Spectrum. The Amiga version retained almost all of the graphics and functionality of the original game, including the two-player cooperative gameplay and the introduction. All these versions, developed by Ocean Software, were released in Europe as &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot;. An MS-DOS port of the original &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; was also developed by Hi Tech Expressions, this time for its release in North America as &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, as opposed to the other versions. However, it featured stripped down play mechanics and a low 16 colour palette. Lastly, it was ported to the Atari Lynx handheld system. An emulated version of the arcade game exists in the Xbox version&#x27;s update &quot;Ninja Gaiden Black&quot; as a bonus feature and was available through Nintendo&#x27;s Wii Virtual Console download service.

==NES series==
===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (NES)===

The first &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in Japan on December 9, 1988, in the United States in March 1989, and in Europe on August 15, 1991. Set in a retro-futuristic version of 1988, a ninja named Ryu Hayabusa finds a letter by his recently missing father, Ken, telling him to go to America and meet with an archaeologist Dr. Smith. Dr. Smith tells Ryu that two statues hidden by Ryu&#x27;s father and the doctor have the power to end the world if united. Ryu ends up in South America and battles Jaquio, an evil cult leader bent on reviving the ancient demon called &quot;Jashin&quot; and responsible for the attack on Ken Hayabusa.

While the arcade game itself bears little or no connection to the later NES trilogy or Xbox revival, certain aspects of it were carried over to the first NES title. The first stage in the NES game is a loose adaptation of the first stage in the arcade game and the opening cutscene in the NES game vaguely resembles the intro in the arcade version. Both games feature Jason Voorhees lookalikes and the final boss in the arcade game vaguely resembles Bloody Malth from the NES game. The game introduced many of the series&#x27; staples, including cinematic cutscenes, the boomerang-like Windmill Shuriken, and the magical techniques called Ninja Arts. To use the ninja arts, players must collect power-ups. Each art uses up a certain number of power-ups.

A port was developed by Hudson for the PC Engine featuring enhanced graphics, reworked music, and rebalanced difficulty. An LCD handheld version produced by Tiger Electronics was released in 1988, which also had a sequel.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos&quot;===

In the sequel, &quot;Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos&quot;, Ryu learns of a new villain named Ashtar, Emperor of Chaos and master to Jaquio. Ryu must rescue Irene Lew, a former CIA agent, from Ashtar and destroy the Dark Sword, a weapon of great power, forged from a bone of the demon, as the Dragon Sword is forged from a fang of a dragon. In the end, Ryu learns that Jaquio has been reborn to fulfill the destiny of Ashtar and the Dark Sword. This game was the first to feature Spirit Clones, invincible copies of Ryu which would mimic his movements and fight by his side. Also introduced was the ability to scale walls without the need to constantly jump upwards.

&quot;Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos&quot; was ported by GameTek for IBM PC compatibles and the Amiga, both for their release in North America. They include save and load, where the player&#x27;s exact position in the game can be saved at any given moment. The IBM PC version has 256 color VGA graphics.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom&quot;===

The third game, titled &quot;Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom&quot; features rogue secret agents, genetic engineering and the eponymous warship. The gameplay is largely unchanged and more is revealed about Foster, the CIA agent who sent Ryu after Jaquio in the first game and his true intentions towards the ninja. It is the first game in the series to have limited continues. Additionally, most attacks deal 2 damage units to the player character (rather than 1 in the previous games), who still has only 16 health units. Additions include a sword extension power-up that increases the range of the player&#x27;s attack until the end of the level or until death, new types of surfaces from which the player can hang, and automatically scrolling areas.

It was ported to the Atari Lynx handheld system. The port retains all the content of the NES game.

==Prequel series==
The story of the 2004 release of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and its sequels have been established as prequels to the NES series, and takes place in the same universe as Team Ninja&#x27;s &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting games and a futuristic version of the 21st century. The continuity also established by the two game franchises are often referred to as &quot;Earth-9604&quot;. The main story of the game involves Ryu Hayabusa setting out on a quest to retrieve the Dark Dragon Blade from the hands of evil after most of his clan was wiped out.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;===

The series was revived after several years with the 2004 release of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; for the Xbox. The title was developed over five years by Team Ninja under the direction of Tomonobu Itagaki and eventually released to high sales and critical acclaim, having a 94% score on Metacritic. The magazine &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded it Best Xbox game of the year..

An updated version with new content, modes and features came out the following year under the name Ninja Gaiden Black. Later, another updated version directed by Yosuke Hayashi was made for the PlayStation 3 as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, released on July 3, 2007. This version has its graphics reworked to high definition standards, and Rachel as a playable character. In 2012, a further updated version of &quot;Sigma&quot; was a launch title for the PlayStation Vita, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus. It added a few new costumes for the playable characters, touch controls and making ninpo attacks stronger, and a new trophy list for the game.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot;===

&quot;Ninja Gaiden II &quot; was published in 2008 by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. It is set one year after the events in the 2004 game. The new features in the game were four difficulty levels, a regenerating health bar, and upgraded graphics and enemy AI.

An enhanced version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot; was released for the PlayStation 3, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. Another updated version, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus, was released in 2013 for the PlayStation Vita. An Unreal Engine 5 remaster that combines features from the original game and &quot;Sigma 2&quot;, titled Ninja Gaiden II Black, was simultaneously announced and released on January 23, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot;===

Although series director Tomonobu Itagaki left shortly after the release of &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot;, Tecmo Koei still owned the franchise and planned to instigate developments of another title, with a newly restructured Team Ninja. This title was revealed as &quot;Ninja Gaiden III&quot; at the Tokyo Game Show 2010. Information about the game in the coming months revealed that the new director, Yosuke Hayashi, would be taking the series to new directions, including the addition of &quot;resistance&quot; in cutting through enemies. Later, at the E3 2011, the game was unveiled as &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot;. Changes to gameplay included removing dismemberment, replacing the roll with a new &quot;slide&quot; maneuver, and a &quot;kunai climb&quot; technique that would allow Ryu to scale certain walls. Tecmo Koei released the game on March 20, 2012, for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

An expanded version of the game titled Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor&#x27;s Edge was released later on November 18 of the same year for the Wii U. In early 2013, &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden 4&quot;===

In February 2020, &quot;Nioh 2&quot; director Fumihiko Yasuda stated that several members of Team Ninja were interested in making a new game, and that he &quot;[hoped] to deliver some good news one day&quot;. He also expressed interest in making a female spin-off featuring Kasumi, Ayane, Momiji and Rachel. In 2024, &quot;Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty&quot; director Masakazu Hirayama stated in an interview that there were currently &quot;no plans at the moment&quot; to revisit &quot;Ninja Gaiden.&quot;

However, a new entry in the modern series with Hirayama as the co-director was announced during Microsoft Gaming&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct video presentation in January 2025. The game is a joint production between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, and is set to be published by Xbox Game Studios in fall 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.

==Other games==
Sega, under license from Tecmo, developed three games but ultimately released only two: one for the Master System and another for the Game Gear, both bearing the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; title, marking the first time a game in the series was released with the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; name in Japan and Europe.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (Game Gear)===

Released in Japan, North America and Europe in 1991 for the Game Gear, this game was not very close to any of the other &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games. It featured a smaller screen size, bigger character sprites, slower game speed, and unlike the NES and Master System games which were more oriented to platforming action, this was more a linear side-scrolling game.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden Shadow&quot;===

Tecmo released a Game Boy version called &quot;Ninja Gaiden Shadow&quot;. It was a licensed edit of a proposed &quot;Shadow of the Ninja&quot; (Natsume) Game Boy port, and serves as a prequel to the original game.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (1992)===

Released in Europe, Australia and Brazil in 1992 for the Master System, this game has similar gameplay mechanics to the NES games, though Ryu bounces off walls instead of clinging to them, like the later 3D games. The game features a new storyline, characters and scenarios, not connected to any of the other &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (Mega Drive)===
A Mega Drive/Genesis version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; was in development by Sega sometime in 1992. It was planned to be a belt scroll-style beat-&#x27;em-up similar to the arcade version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, instead of following the side-scrolling platform game format from the NES trilogy. The plot would have involved Ryu traveling to the United States in order to track down a pair of sibling ninjas named Jin and Rika who have gone rogue by stealing the Secret Scrolls of the Huma (an alternate romanization of the name &quot;Fūma&quot;). The Mega Drive version is not a port of the arcade game, but some of the stages (such as a casino) and enemy characters (like the hockey mask-wearing punks) are similar, though the play mechanics are very different.

The game was not released commercially despite being reviewed in magazines, but a beta build was leaked through the internet as a ROM image. The beta features seven stages, including cut-scenes and bosses, but has several programming bugs such as odd moving controls, unfinished levels, and cut-scenes which are skipped before finishing. Although the opening and stage names are in Japanese, the rest of the cut-scenes were translated into English. The techniques available in the beta consist of a standard punch combo, a jump kick, a rolling move, a special somersault kick, and a throw.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden X&quot;===
The game was released in Japan for mobile phones as a prequel to the first NES title in 2004. The game is a short single act which retains the elements of the classic Nintendo trilogy.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot;===

&quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot; was released in March 2008, for the Nintendo DS. The game is played in a diagonal top-down view with 3D graphics, and the player needs to hold the Nintendo DS sideways. &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot; is played using the stylus. The story is set six months after the events of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;. There is a new playable female ninja character, Momiji.

===&quot;100 Man&#x27;nin no Ninja Gaiden&quot; (&quot;100万人のNinja Gaiden&quot;)===
The game was released in 2012 in Japan for Android and iOS mobile systems. A release in North America was announced in 2012 under the title &quot;Ninja Gaiden Clans&quot;, but was eventually cancelled. Gameplay is similar to &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot;, but the game involves card collection trading.

===&quot;Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z&quot;===

Released in 2014 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, the game follows the exploits of the ninja Yaiba Kamikaze. The game received mixed reviews, with many magazines and websites criticizing the repetitive gameplay, difficulty and level design.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound&quot;===
Announced during The Game Awards 2024, &quot;Ragebound&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling game in the vein of the original NES trilogy. It is developed by the Spanish indie studio The Game Kitchen and will be published by Dotemu, in association with Koei Tecmo, in 2025 for consoles and PC.

==Compilations==
===&quot;Ninja Gaiden Trilogy&quot;===

 is a 1995 SNES collection containing the three Ninja Gaiden games for the NES. It is also included as a bonus unlockable in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; for the Xbox. The three games are straight ports and were not optimized for the SNES, but there are several differences from the NES versions. Passwords are included and the cinematic sequences were redrawn. The third game is based on the Japanese version, with infinite continues and lower damage from enemy attacks. The ports have no closing credits. Parallax scrolling was removed from the backgrounds of some levels (&quot;Ninja Gaiden III&quot; stage 2-1 for example). Other graphical changes were made to comply with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Family Friendly&quot; censorship policy at the time (i.e. a pool of blood changed from red to green, and the removal of pentagrams). Some music tracks are omitted (two pieces of music from &quot;Ninja Gaiden III&quot; and the stage 1–1 music in the &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot; pursuit cutscenes). A degree of censorship was actually removed from certain parts of the script (for example, Jaquio&#x27;s &quot;Argh! He&#x27;s awake&quot; is replaced with &quot;Damn, he&#x27;s awake&quot;).

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection&quot;===
&quot;Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection&quot; is a compilation of &quot;Ninja Gaiden Sigma&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2&quot;, and &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;. It was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 10, 2021, marking the first time the &quot;Sigma&quot; games have been released on Nintendo and Xbox platforms.

==Related media==
===Anime===
An OVA titled &quot;Ninja Ryūkenden&quot; was released only in Japan in 1991.

===Print media===
The NES version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; received a novelization in the &quot;Worlds of Power&quot; series which had books based on other current Nintendo games. A prequel comic book based on &quot;&quot;, published by Dark Horse Comics and written by Tim Seeley and Josh Emmons, tells the story of how Yaiba&#x27;s sword came to be known as Heartless.

<doc id="507000" wikidata="Q1115836" url="?curid=507000" title="Ryu Hayabusa">
<text>is a fictional character and the protagonist of Tecmo and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; action-adventure video game series. He is a human-dragon hybrid who wields an ancestral weapon called the Dragon Sword, and is the leader of the Hayabusa Ninja Clan. One of Tecmo&#x27;s most enduring characters, Ryu has also appeared as a player character in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting game franchise by Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja where he serves as the protagonist in &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;. Ryu is featured on official series merchandise as well as in the feature film &quot;&quot;, and has made many crossover appearances in other games. He has received favorable reception from critics and audiences, and is considered to be one of the most iconic examples of a ninja character in video games as handful of critics have ranked him as one of the most iconic ninjas in gaming.

==Conception and design==
Ryu Hayabusa was given equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they used specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.

When asked in 2008 if he would ever explore a &quot;stealth aspect&quot; of Ryu in a future series title, &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot; designer Tomonobu Itagaki replied, &quot;The kind [of ninja] I like are the ones that go out and kill a bunch of enemies all at once.&quot; The Nintendo DS-exclusive game was played by holding the console vertically; Itagaki explained, &quot;We have implemented an immensely intuitive control system. If you use the stylus to slice side-to-side over an enemy, Hayabusa will slash him with his sword, and you can change the type of slash by varying the angle of your slice.&quot;

Starting with &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot;, the series&#x27; graphic violence greatly increases as Ryu is able to defeat opponents by decapitation or dismemberment. In a 2011 interview with PlayStation.blog, Team Ninja head Yosuke Hayashi described the character&#x27;s development in &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot;: &quot;The human side of Ryu Hayabusa comes through ... you see him suffering as a consequence of the murders he has committed and that is when [his] humanity comes through. I believe that, these days, people are looking for more realistic games and that’s not easy to do with &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, which is heavily based in fantasy.&quot; He commented on the gameplay itself, &quot;Within the course of the story, you will ... have a harder time progressing through stages, [but] we have to have the players feel like Ryu is a superhero, the Ryu Hayabusa they know, to make them emphasize with the consequences ... as the game progresses.&quot;

Team Ninja wrote that his signature move in &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; was the &quot;Izuna Drop—a powerful throw that he can perform even from strikes or holds.&quot; According to Prima Games&#x27; official guide for &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot;, Ryu is &quot;fairly fast and has decent power, though he doesn&#x27;t necessarily excel at either, making him a fairly well-balanced character,&quot; adding that he can be useful to a moderate-level player in certain situations. The publisher said for &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; that he &quot;continues to be one of the top characters in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series&quot; and can still be played at top levels; he was rated seven out of ten overall. According to GameSpot, Ryu&#x27;s attacks in &quot;DOA4&quot; &quot;are difficult, [but] the bulk of them are actually fairly easy to pull off, and he&#x27;s quite fast to boot, making him an excellent choice of character for new players.&quot;

During Tecmo&#x27;s development of the first &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting game, lead developer Tomonobu Itagaki initially planned to include a male ninja named &quot;Kamui&quot;. Another developer proposed they include Ryu instead as it was already a developed character under Tecmo&#x27;s corporate banner, and Itagaki received permission to include the character from the company&#x27;s then-CEO. Itagaki however was unfamiliar with what sort of character Ryu was, and in an interview with &quot;Famitsu&quot; explained to learn more about the character he located and assembled a &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; arcade cabinet from the company&#x27;s warehouse to play. To illustrate a distinction between &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; and &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, the former&#x27;s development team chose to refer to the character as &quot;Hayabusa&quot; within the games themselves, in contrast to how he is referred to by his first name more in the latter. As later &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games were released, his outfit from those games was included to better tie the franchises together.

While the development team wanted to add gymnastic attacks to the character in &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, the development process made that too difficult at the time, so Itagaki added moves such as a throat cut against opponents to try and &quot;bring out the image of Hayabusa&quot;. Additionally he envisioned Ryu as a grappling-type character that used throws, but did not want him to feel too similar to the wrestling move-based character Tina Armstrong. To achieve this he limited the character&#x27;s throwing attacks so Ryu would feel distinct from the &quot;grappler&quot; archetype in fighting games. Later games in the series focused on his hand motions to help design strikes that felt suited for the characters. Some attacks such as a handstand were removed from later titles as they felt inconsistent with character&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series (1988-1992)===

Ryu Hayabusa makes his official debut in the original &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; arcade game released in 1988. In the Nintendo Entertainment System home edition released the same year, taking place in the retro-futuristic version of 1988, he is given a backstory of searching for his missing father who had disappeared to partake in a life-or-death fight. Ken had instructed Ryu in a letter beforehand to travel to the United States to find his friend Dr. Walter Smith, but Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, who had defeated Ken in battle and then subjected him to a brainwashing that causes him to attack his own son, a spell that Ryu manages to break. However, Ken is slain by Malth&#x27;s superior, an evil sorcerer known as the Jaquio, whom Ryu then kills. Ryu later enters into a relationship with CIA agent Irene Lew, who had refused beforehand to carry out an order to terminate him.

In &quot;Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos&quot; (1990), Ryu foils the Jaquio&#x27;s demonic master Ashtar&#x27;s attempt at world domination. In retaliation, Ashtar kidnaps Irene in order to lure Ryu to his home dimension. Ryu defeats Ashtar a second time, but before he can rescue Irene, she is then captured by the Jaquio, who now bears the Dark Sword, the antithesis to Ryu&#x27;s signature &quot;Dragon Sword&quot; weapon. Having then been killed by Ryu once again, the Jaquio is revived by his blood flowing into his sword, with which he stabs Irene. Her own blood further empowers his sword and conjures a creature known as the Demon; Ryu kills it and Jaquio&#x27;s Dark Sword is destroyed in the process, but Irene dies from her wounds. She is then brought back to life by ancestral powers flowing through Ryu&#x27;s Dragon Sword.

1991&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom&quot; sees Ryu accused of murdering Irene, but she actually survives the attack, while the culprit is revealed to be a superhuman clone of Ryu called a &quot;Bio-Noid&quot;, created by Irene&#x27;s superior and corrupt CIA director, Foster. After Ryu defeats the double, Foster is killed by H.P. Clancy, who had instructed Ryu to locate a ruin called the &quot;Castle Rock Fortress&quot;, which was the base of Foster&#x27;s Bio-Noid experimentation and has also secretly housed an interdimensional warship that Clancy intends to use for global dominance. Ryu kills Clancy in battle and the ship is destroyed as Ryu escapes with Irene, bringing the first-generation &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; storyline to a close.

The 1991 Sega Game Gear version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; scraps the entire narrative of the original series timeline, where someone is trying to steal his dragon sword. He travels to four parts of the world to defeat the demon Shiragane and prevent World War III from starting.

The 1992 Sega Master System version of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; also eludes the original series timeline, featuring Ryu as a high-ranking member of his ninja clan whose village is massacred while an artifact called the &quot;Sacred Scroll of Bushido&quot; has been stolen. His mission is to regain the scroll from the hands of the evil Shogun of Darkness and his minions.

===&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series (2004-2025)===
In &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (2004), the first release in the second generation of the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series, the plot precedes Ryu&#x27;s acquisition of the Dragon Sword, though it contains story elements similar to the Master System port of the original game in that while Ryu is visiting his uncle Murai, Hayabusa Village is annihilated in his absence and a sword known as the &quot;Dark Dragon Blade&quot; is stolen by the evil Doku, whom Ryu vainly tries to stop before he is slain in his attempt. He is brought back to life by his clan&#x27;s animal spirit, the falcon, and he searches for the stolen sword while hoping to avenge his clan. He defeats Doku and then his overlord, the Holy Emperor Vigoor, and recovers the blade. In the end, Ryu and his newest accomplice, a fiend-hunter named Rachel, encounter the mysterious &quot;Dark Disciple&quot;, who is actually Ryu&#x27;s traitorous uncle. After Murai&#x27;s death, Ryu destroys the sword.

The plot of 2008&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot; begins with kunoichi Momiji abducted by the rival Black Spider ninja clan. Ryu&#x27;s objective therein is to find seven Dark Dragonstones, defeating several bosses along the way. At the climax, Doku&#x27;s former servant Ishtaros steals the stones and defeats Ryu in battle. However, when Kureha—Momiji&#x27;s sister and a childhood friend of Ryu from the previous game who had died in the village attack—fuses with an object called the Dragon Eye, the stones transform into the Dragon Sword. Ryu defeats Ishtaros and her sister (who takes the shape of a dragon during battle), then frees Momiji and returns her home where they begin training together.

In &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot; (2008), set six months after the events of &quot;Dragon Sword&quot;, a CIA agent named Sonia warns Ryu of a plot of the Greater Fiends, whose queen, Elizébet, attempts to steal an artifact called the Demon Statue, which is hidden in the Hayabusa ninja village and what she desires in order to resurrect the Archfiend Vazdah, the game&#x27;s final boss. After his village is razed once again and the statue is stolen, Ryu infiltrates a castle where the object is held. Joe is critically wounded in his battle against Black Spider clan leader Genshin, who then attempts multiple times to kill Ryu thereafter but fails and is slain in his final attempt despite Elizébet having transformed him into one of the game&#x27;s sub-bosses, the Four Greater Fiends. Before he dies, Genshin gives Ryu a sword called the &quot;Blade of the Archfiend&quot;, which Ryu needs to complete his mission. Following the demise of the three other Greater Fiends, Ryu kills Elizébet and Vazdah with both the blade and his own Dragon Sword. At the conclusion, he uses the Archfiend&#x27;s sword to mark Genshin&#x27;s gravesite in a cemetery located at the summit of Mount Fuji.

Ryu is summoned by the JSDF in &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; (2012) to assist with the suppression of a terrorist group called the Lords of Alchemy. He pursues the terrorists and their mysterious leader around the world, but realizes he cannot complete his mission without the Dragon Sword. While stalking the group, he also must save a young girl whom he had promised to protect, named Canna. After he succeeds in terminating the group, he destroys another final boss character bent on global destruction and returns the child safely to her mother before disappearing into the shadows. Ryu&#x27;s story continues in the 2013 release &quot;&quot;, in which he is not playable; instead, he is pursued by the game&#x27;s &quot;foul-mouthed&quot; protagonist, Yaiba Kamikaze, in his quest for revenge after having been wounded by Ryu&#x27;s Dragon Sword.

In &quot;Ninja Gaiden 4&quot;, the veteran Ryu Hayabusa serves as a &quot;major challenge and growth milestone&quot; for the protagonist Yakumo, while also being playable throughout the story (ignoring the events of &quot;&quot;), utilizing similar moveset and tools to his earlier appearances.

===&quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series===
Ryu is additionally a player character in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; games, which take place chronologically years after the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series. He is written into the events of each of the Dead or Alive fighting tournaments, starting with the 1996 original game, in which he receives an invitation to the inaugural Dead or Alive tournament which he participates in while searching for fellow ninja, Kasumi, after she broke shinobi code and ran away from her village to get revenge on Raidou who crippled her brother, Hayate. After Raidou&#x27;s defeat at Kasumi&#x27;s hands with little aid from Ryu, Kasumi was kidnapped, leaving Ryu and Ayane to search for her. Ryu is the primary protagonist in the 1999 sequel &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; where he canonically wins the second championship upon learning beforehand that an interdimensional creature named Gohyakumine Bankotsubo, escaped the Tengu world and joined the tournament to wreak chaos on the human world. Ryu with the help from Irene, rescues Kasumi from the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee&#x27;s (DOATEC) Germany facility, where she was being used as a test subject for the organization&#x27;s Super Human Development project. Ryu later comes across his lost friend Hayate, now an amnesiac calling himself &quot;Ein&quot;, who was also previously kidnapped and unwillingly use as a test subject in DOATEC&#x27;s Epsilon project. His defeat at Ryu&#x27;s hands restores parts of his memory. Ryu then destroys Tengu to save the world from his would-be plot, winning the second tournament. He later helps Hayate to fully recover his memories by fighting his own sister Kasumi, then found out together that Genra, Ayane’s foster father became a traitor like Raidou was, such as joining Victor Donovan’s DOATEC anti-Douglas faction, explaining the company’s faction involvement on kidnapping and cloning Kasumi for their Alpha clone project and implanting Hayate with “Epsilon”.

His role in &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; (2001) is more minor, as he faces off against Hayate, who has become the newest leader of the Mugen Tenshin ninja clan, as well as aiding both Hayate and Ayane against the Omega empowered Genra. In &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; (2005), Ryu joins fellow clansmen Hayate, Ayane, Kasumi, and other members of the Mugen Tenshin clan to stop the corruption within DOATEC by assaulting and detonating their &quot;Tritower&quot; headquarters. Victor Donovan&#x27;s hired assassin Christie attempts to stop them, until she is distracted by Helena Douglas, allowing the ninjas to succeed in destroying the building. Ryu returns in 2012&#x27;s &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; which chronologically takes place two years after &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; and &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot;. Ryu aids Hayate and Ayane in their battle against Donovan&#x27;s new organization, MIST, who plans to sell modified soldiers to various militia around the world. When Hayate is captured, Ryu sends his falcon to send a message to Kasumi in order to summon her to battle. When she frees Hayate, the four of them destroy the MIST laboratory. As Ryu sense the resurrection of Raidou set up by MIST is approaching in &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;, Ryu warns Kasumi about this referred threat, with MIST’s new target to resurrect Raidou as an undead cyber ninja by kidnapping both of his illegitimate daughters, Ayane, and Honoka. He was approached by the princess of the Tengu world Nyotengu, proving his might as a man who ended Bankotsubo’s crime, sparring her and tells her to leave human world, satisfying her as well. Whereas Hayate, Kasumi and Ayane goes after resurrected Raidou, and Helena goes after Raidou’s resurrector NiCO, Ryu, alongside Bayman and Marie Rose watching over Honoka recovering.

A demo version of &quot;DOA5&quot; featuring a playable Ryu and Hitomi was included as a downloadable bonus with pre-orders of both the standard and collector&#x27;s PlayStation 3 editions of &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot;, as well as the Xbox 360 version.
===Other appearances===
====Other video games====
The 2007 Xbox 360 game &quot;Halo 3&quot; features an unlockable &quot;Hayabusa&quot; armor set, while players are awarded an in-game unusable replica of Ryu&#x27;s Dragon Sword upon reaching a specific gamerscore objective. &quot;Hayabusa Ninja&quot; is an alternative costume for the character Max in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Super Swing Golf: Season 2&quot;.

In commemoration of the 2009 merger of Koei and Tecmo, Ryu, Ayane and Momiji were unplayable guest characters in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce&quot; released that year. In the company&#x27;s 2011 hack and slash title &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot;, Ryu, Ayane, Rachel, Momiji and Kasumi appear in another dimension and assist the game&#x27;s playable characters. Ryu&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; costume parts were available as exclusive downloads as part of the first-anniversary promotion campaign for &quot;Dynasty Warriors Online&quot;. Ryu additionally appeared with Ayane in the April 2012 Japan-only release &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3DS &quot;. Ryu also appeared in Warriors All-Stars. Two side boss characters known as Jin and Ren Hayabusa, based on Ryu’s classic looks appears in &quot;Nioh&quot; and its followup respectively.

====Film====
In the 1991 Japan-exclusive OVA film &quot;Ninja Ryūkenden&quot;, an original adventure loosely based on the early games, Ryu was voiced by Keiichi Nanba, and he was given a red and purple palette as opposed to his solid blue in the NES series, while he is unmasked. Set in New York City, the plot involves a doctor who has supposedly discovered a cure for cancer. He in turn is investigated by a reporter named Sarah, who soon discovers that he is conducting biotechnological experiments on live humans, which possibly involves the power of the Evil Gods, whom Ryu had defeated in the past. This is compounded by the abduction of Irene—the only other returning character from the games, but identified therein only as Sarah&#x27;s friend—in turn forcing Ryu to become the Dragon Ninja once again and defeat this new enemy and save her. The conclusion has Ryu remaining in America, where he marries Irene and they open an antique shop together.

Ryu is briefly seen in the 2002 film &quot;Run Ronnie Run&quot;, where the character, Jerry Trellis (portrayed by E.J. De la Pena), is playing on a &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; arcade cabinet.

Ryu was played by Japanese-American actor Kane Kosugi in the 2006 live-action &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; film adaptation &quot;&quot;. He serves as the love interest of Kasumi after he informs her of Hayate&#x27;s supposed death, and his fight scenes consist of him defeating a fighter during the tournament, and later stopping Victor Donovan&#x27;s hired assassin Bayman from stealing the prize money.

====Merchandise====
&quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot; statues of Ryu were released in 2008 by First 4 Figures and NECA. Other action figures based on his &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; incarnations were made available by Kotobukiya in 2005 and One 2 One Collectibles in 2009. A limited-edition figurine of Ryu battling enemy character Regent of the Mask was included along with an art book and soundtrack in the 2012 collector&#x27;s-edition release of &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot;. In 2015, a 13&quot; resin statue of Ryu was released by Multiverse Studios, available in variations of either his &quot;Ninja Gaiden III&quot; or classic series costumes and the base adorned with LED lights.

Ryu has featured on decisively less &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; merchandise than his female counterparts. Epoch Co. distributed a Japan-exclusive action figure, while Koei Tecmo released a keychain and a three-dimensional poster in 2013 featuring Ryu and the &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Plus&quot; cast.

==Reception==

Since his 1988 debut, Ryu Hayabusa has been both critically and publicly received as a popular character in general video gaming when it comes Nintendo and Xbox audiences. The character was popular through how he promoted the first games with his image. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; honored the game in its November 2010 issue. The magazine listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, as one of its favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game&#x27;s box art. IGN the character had a notable evolution ever since 8-bit generations and he always looked well designed in gameplay and cutscenes. The same site especially regarded one of the latter as one of the best cinematic scenes for starting Ryu&#x27;s journey after the death of his father. Eurogamer said that Ryu Hayabusa became a more notable character thanks to the presentation of the first NES &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; as its cutscenes elaborated more on him like links to a father figure and villains the hero often has to fight. However, he still thought the story was the weak point of the games.

In 2010, the magazine listed Ryu as one of the best ninja characters to appear on Nintendo consoles. GameRant regarded Ryu Hayabusa as one of the best martial artists in gaming thanks to how fun is his ninjutsu to use in the video games especially with his Dragon Sword. GamesRadar found him as a brutal character despite his heroic portrayal, remaining as one of the &quot;most memorable, influential, and badass&quot; gaming protagonists. &quot;GamesTM&quot; enjoyed his design, seeing as one of the most athletic characters in gaming.

Despite the positive response Ryu&#x27;s character received in his games, his portrayal in &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; was the subject of critcism by &quot;Daily News&quot; for being portrayed as a passive fighter compared to his past brutal characterization with his design no longer involving his mask. The writer said &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; features a more sensitive and vulnerable Ryu as a result of killing so many enemies in previous games. The change of personality was compared to Samus Aran from &quot;&quot; which resulted in the protagonist receiving negative backlash for her characterization. &quot;Siliconera&quot; panned the handling of the protagonist in &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; for being overly guilty over his actions despite spending multiple installments killing enemies, ruining the appeal of the franchise. The Gamer also panned this take of Ryu, calling it &quot;murder hobo&quot; and all of murders Ryu keeps committing make the plot lack any sense. In contrast, &quot;Siliconera&quot; saw the altered Ryu from the remake &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; as more violence than in the original &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; which the writer noted to have ended on failure with one of the reasons being the protagonist&#x27;s personality. Dual Shockers and GamesRadar praised how &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; no longer questions the character&#x27;s moral and instead give the player freedom in regards to what Ryu can do to the enemies at the cost of removing several scenes involving such state of the protagonist.

After &quot;Soulcalibur V&quot; was released, Elton Jones of &quot;Complex&quot; wanted him as guest characters a future series entry; He enjoyed the skills of Taki and Natsu but wanted Ryu to be the focus of the story. Merchandising of the character has appealing to EndGadget for its chibi form that contrasts his signature style. Red Bull regarded &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; as one of the best crossover games ever mainly because the writer favorited Ryu Hayabusa, referring him as the best ninja in fiction, and playing as him was rewarding. Ryu&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Orochi&quot; was praised by PlayStation Blog due to how his continuous guest appearances in several games made him an icon in Koei Tecmo.

<text>Dallas College Cedar Valley Campus (Cedar Valley or CVC) is a public community college in Lancaster, Texas. It opened in 1977 and has an enrollment of more than 6,000 students. It is part of Dallas College.

Beginning in the spring of 2004, Cedar Valley College began operating the Cedar Valley College Center at Cedar Hill. The extension center, located in Cedar Hill, Texas, will assist the district&#x27;s continuing education program featuring classes on computer software, dance, English as a second language, health and wellness, writing résumés and CPA accreditation.

For the 2008-09 school year, Cedar Valley began a joint dual credit enrollment project with the Dallas Independent School District and the Cedar Hill Independent School District by opening two early college high school campuses, one in Dallas and one in Cedar Hill.

The new Dallas school is named Early College High School and provides the opportunity for its graduates to accomplish a high-school diploma and 60 hours of college credit concurrently. Like most early college high school programs, the school was designed to attract students who do not typically enroll in traditional dual-credit programs, such students whose parents did not attend college and those that might feel a college education is not financially possible.

The new Cedar Hill school is named Cedar Hill Collegiate High School, and attracts students who are seeking 60 college credit hours upon graduating from high school. The school is open to students of all backgrounds; however, the staff worked particularly hard to recruit black and Latino males, who are the least likely to earn college degrees.

==Service area==
Dallas College Cedar Valley Campus serves an approximately area of southern Dallas County including the suburbs of Cedar Hill, DeSoto, Duncanville, Glenn Heights, Hutchins, Lancaster, Seagoville, and Wilmer as well as the Dallas neighborhoods of Highland Hills (zip code 75241), Pleasant Grove (75217), and Red Bird (75232 &amp; 75237).

Dallas College Cedar Valley Campus also hosts the Distance Education Veterinary Technology Program.

<text>Baron Savile, of Rufford in the County of Nottingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1888 for the diplomat Sir John Savile. He was the eldest of the five illegitimate children of John Lumley-Savile, 8th Earl of Scarbrough, and the grandson of John Lumley-Savile, 7th Earl of Scarbrough. The latter was the fourth of the seven sons of Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 4th Earl of Scarbrough, and his wife Barbara, sister and heiress of the politician Sir George Savile, 8th and last Baronet, of Thornhill (see Savile Baronets for more information on this title), who bequeathed the substantial Savile estates in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire (including Rufford and Thornhill) to his nephew the Hon. Richard Lumley-Saunderson, later 6th Earl of Scarbrough.
On his death the estates passed to his younger brother, the aforementioned seventh Earl, and then to his son the eighth Earl. The latter bequeathed the estates to his second natural son Captain Henry Lumley-Savile (d. 1881). When he died they passed to his younger brother Augustus William Lumley-Savile (1829–1887) and then to his eldest brother, the aforementioned John Savile, who was created Baron Savile the following year.

The peerage was created with remainder to Savile&#x27;s nephew John Lumley, who succeeded him as second Baron. In 1898 the latter assumed by Royal licence the surname of Savile in addition to that of Lumley. , the title is held by his grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his uncle in 2008.

From 1938 to 2008 (when the 3rd Baron Savile died), the family seat was Gryce Hall, near Shelley, West Yorkshire. The ancestral seat (sold in 1938) was Rufford Abbey, near Rufford, Nottinghamshire.

<text>Antiphon of [[Rhamnus (Greek archaeological site)|Rhamnus]] (; ; 480–411 BC) was the earliest of the ten Attic orators, and an important figure in fifth-century Athenian political and intellectual life. 

There is longstanding uncertainty and scholarly controversy over whether the Sophistic works of Antiphon and a treatise on the &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; were also written by Antiphon the Orator, or whether they were written by a separate man known as Antiphon the Sophist. This article only discusses Antiphon the Orator&#x27;s biography and oratorical works.

==Life==
Antiphon was a statesman who took up rhetoric as a profession. He was active in political affairs in Athens, and, as a zealous supporter of the oligarchical party, was largely responsible for the establishment of the Four Hundred in 411 (see Theramenes); upon restoration of the democracy shortly afterwards, he was accused of treason and condemned to death. Thucydides famously characterized Antiphon&#x27;s skills, influence, and reputation:

Antiphon may be regarded as the founder of political oratory, but he never addressed the people himself except on the occasion of his trial. Fragments of his speech then, delivered in defense of his policy (called ) have been edited by J. Nicole (1907) from an Egyptian papyrus.

His chief business was that of a logographer (), that is a professional speech-writer. He wrote for those who felt incompetent to conduct their own cases—all disputants were obliged to do so—without expert assistance. Fifteen of Antiphon&#x27;s speeches are extant: twelve are mere school exercises on fictitious cases, divided into tetralogies, each comprising two speeches for prosecution and defence—accusation, defence, reply, counter-reply; three refer to actual legal processes. All deal with cases of homicide (). Antiphon is also said to have composed a or art of Rhetoric.

==List of extant speeches==
This is a list of extant speeches by Antiphon:
#Against the Stepmother for Poisoning ()
#The First Tetralogy: Anonymous Prosecution For Murder ()
#The Second Tetralogy: Prosecution for Accidental Homicide ()
#The Third Tetralogy: Prosecution for Murder Of One Who Pleads Self-Defense ()
#On the Murder of Herodes ()
#On the Choreutes ()

<text>Baron Shuttleworth, of Gawthorpe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 15 July 1902 for the Liberal politician Sir Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth, 2nd Baronet. Both his sons were killed in the First World War and he was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron (eldest son of Hon. Lawrence Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth, eldest son of the first Baron). However, both he and his brother, the third Baron, were killed in action during the Second World War. On the death of the third Baron in 1942 the titles passed to his first cousin, the fourth Baron (eldest son of the Hon. Edward Kay-Shuttleworth, second son of the first Baron), who survived the Second World War although he was badly wounded. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 1975. He had been Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1997, to 2023.

The Kay-Shuttleworth Baronetcy, of Gawthorpe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1849 for the first Baronet, the physician, social reformer and educationalist James Kay-Shuttleworth. Born James Kay, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Shuttleworth on his marriage in 1842 to Janet Shuttleworth, only child and heiress of Robert Shuttleworth of Gawthorpe Hall.

Two of the first Baronet&#x27;s brothers also gained distinction. Joseph Kay was a noted economist while Sir Edward Kay was a Lord Justice of Appeal.

The family seat was Gawthorpe Hall at Padiham near Burnley, Lancashire. The house was sold by the family in 1970. It is now financed and run by the National Trust in partnership with Lancashire County Council. The present Baron lives at Leck Hall near Kirkby Lonsdale in north Lancashire.

<text>Dallas College El Centro Campus (El Centro or ECC) is a public community college in Dallas, Texas. It is part of Dallas College.

The campus is located at 801 Main Street in downtown Dallas, in the former Sanger Harris department store building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dallas College El Centro Campus became the flagship campus of Dallas College in 1966, when it first opened. Its Spanish name reflects the center of the downtown area and it is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and a member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).

El Centro&#x27;s location allows students from all parts of Dallas County to take advantage of core educational courses transferable to four-year institutions, as well as career training in more than 50 fields and a variety of continuing education and workforce education courses. Many of the degree plans offered at El Centro specialize in the medical and technological fields including nursing, culinary/pastry/hospitality, and fashion design and marketing.

== Campuses ==
El Centro has grown from just one campus in downtown Dallas to three campuses in the central section of the city: El Centro main downtown campus, Bill J. Priest campus and West Dallas campus. Two additional buildings are now part of the downtown campus – the R building, which once was home to DCCCD district offices, and the Paramount building, where El Centro&#x27;s Center for Allied Health and Nursing is located. The Paramount building is located in the West End.

The Downtown campus also houses the Dr. Wright L. Lassiter Jr. Early College High School.

In 2016, El Centro leased over 50,000 square feet on the 10th and 11th floors of nearby One Main Place (Dallas) for the college&#x27;s growing architecture, digital art, engineering, fashion design, fashion marketing, and interior design programs.

The West Dallas Campus is a one-stop location close to home to register for classes. Students can meet with an adviser, register for classes, and speak to a financial-aid adviser all at the West Campus. El Centro’s West Campus is the only college presence in West Dallas.

The Bill J. Priest campus offers a variety of programs, such as welding courses, workplace skills, job search assistance, career exploration, and industrial maintenance.

== 2016 shooting ==

On July 7–8, 2016, the college was affected by a mass shooting targeting police officers. The gunman, Micah Xavier Johnson, who by that point had killed four officers, fled inside the college. Two police officers working with the school were wounded while Johnson attempted to make entry inside a school building. After gaining entry through another route, Johnson stationed himself in an elevated position and was able to kill a fifth officer standing outside the college. After evacuating the building, police officers engaged Johnson in an hours-long standoff. Johnson was eventually killed by a robot-delivered bomb, which also damaged the school&#x27;s servers. The college cancelled all classes on July 8 and became a crime scene for investigators until July 20 and 21, when it partially reopened to faculty and students.

<text>Baron Shaughnessy, of the City of Montreal in the Dominion of Canada and of Ashford in the County of Limerick, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1916 for the Milwaukee born businessman Thomas Shaughnessy, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron, a Director of the CPR and of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. His son, the third Baron, was a businessman and was also active in the House of Lords. However, he lost his hereditary seat in parliament after the House of Lords Act 1999.

The heir presumptive to the title is David Shaughnessy, younger brother of the fifth Baron, an actor and producer. No other heir exists, and the fifth baron and his younger brother only have daughters who are not eligible for succession to the title.

<doc id="507020" wikidata="Q905532" url="?curid=507020" title="Prince of Wales tea blend">
<text>Prince of Wales tea blend is a blend of Keemun tea, gunpowder green tea, and a dash of currant juice or infused with dried currants. This produces a full-bodied cup with a bright liquor and strong aroma. It was named after Edward, Prince of Wales, who held that title from 1911 until 1936.

Typically served in the afternoon with scones in Britain, the blend was originally devised for Edward, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII and after his abdication the Duke of Windsor.

==History==
Prince Edward first granted Twinings permission to sell his personal blend using his royal title in 1921. Although Twinings has largely withdrawn its Prince of Wales tea from the United Kingdom market, it is still offered abroad, according to Twinings&#x27;s official regional websites. On its American packaging Twinings stated that

Prince of Wales is a pure China black tea sourced from regions including the Yunnan province and other southern regions of China. This blend is light in color and has a smooth and mild taste, with a well-rounded character. Great in the late morning or in the afternoon, it is perfect with or without milk and can be sweetened to taste.

As with many tea blends, such as Earl Grey and English breakfast, there is no set formula for what teas go into a Prince of Wales blend. Many tea companies now produce blends with this name. In Germany the Paul Schrader GmbH &amp; Co. KG Bremen (founded in 1921) has offered a version since 1958 consisting of Chinese black teas and Darjeeling with a pinch of Lapsang souchong.

From west of Jackson Park Golf Course in Shoreline, from Sunny Walter-Pillings Pond in Licton Springs–North College Park, and north Northgate Thornton Creek flows through Maple Leaf and Lake City, including the Victory Heights, Meadowbrook, and Matthews Beach neighborhoods, and empties into the lake at Matthews Beach Park.

== Habitat and stewardship ==
Thornton Creek flows through Meadowbrook Pond, known for its birdwatching and resident beavers. The Thornton creek watershed is land formerly inhabited by the Duwamish tribe. One of the Duwamish&#x27;s historic longhouse sites was located near the mouth of Thornton Creek at Mathews beach.
Early in the 1900s, the creek contained dense runs of at least five species of Pacific salmon and trout, today only a few Kokanee still travel up stream. The areas surrounding the creek were developed without regard for that habitat and the riparian corridor; species&#x27; diversity declined, and the creek became a typical degraded urban watershed. Storm water retention, sites restoration, an Environmental Learning Center next to a school, and a fish ladder contributed to restoration and the return of native plants and wildlife. Thornton creek is home to many native species, muskrats, beavers, otters, bats, crayfish and coyotes, and in addition is an important breeding ground for great blue herons. Common for urban creeks, there are also many problematic invasive species like Japanese knotweed, black rats and New Zealand mud snails.

== Thornton Creek Water Quality Channel ==
For many decades, much of the stream has run through culverts, notably under the parking lot of Northgate Mall. Building on gradual successes in restoration, activist neighbors began working with the City of Seattle and developers toward daylighting parts of the buried creek.

In 2004, the City of Seattle purchased the parking lot from Northgate Mall and began building the Thornton Creek Water Quality Channel. Opened in 2009, it achieved several community goals in limited space: integrating a water-quality facility, providing a diverse housing mix, and allowing public open space. It receives and treats runoff from by providing a multilayered landscape of native plants that also serves as an amenity for surrounding private development.

Organizations of citizens have cleaned up nearby wetlands, educated the public about stream health and quality of neighborhood life, and rallied to bring more of the creek to daylight. Many restoration projects in Seattle have been in some way connected to or inspired by Thornton Creek.

<text>William Webster Hansen (May 27, 1909 – May 23, 1949) was an American physicist and professor. He was one of the founders of the technology of microwave electronics.

==Biography==
Hansen&#x27;s father William G Hansen, who was a son of immigrants from Denmark, was a hardware store owner in Fresno, California. He encouraged his son&#x27;s early talent in mathematics and enthusiasm for electronics. He entered Stanford University at the age of 16, earning his B.A. in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1933.

Hansen went on to become interested in the problem of accelerating electrons for X-ray experiments, using oscillating fields, rather than large static voltages. At the University of California, Berkeley, Ernest Lawrence and his assistant David H. Sloan, had worked on an accelerator driven by a resonant coil. Hansen proposed replacing the coil with a cavity resonator. In 1937, brothers Russel H. Varian and Sigurd F. Varian came to Stanford to work on the foundations of what was to become radar. Hansen exploited some of the Varian&#x27;s work to develop the klystron and during the years 1937 to 1940, along with collaborators such as John R. Woodyard, founded the field of microwave electronics.
In 1941, he moved his team to the Sperry Gyroscope Company where they spent the war years employing their expertise in radar applications and in other problems.

Returning to Stanford in 1945 as a full professor, he embarked on the construction of a series of linear accelerators based on klystron technology and of GeV performance. Along with the Varian brothers and Edward Ginzton, he co-founded Varian Associates in 1948. Sadly, he was never to see the completion of the klystron project. He died at age 39 in Palo Alto, California of berylliosis and fibrosis of the lungs, caused by inhaling the beryllium used in his research. In 1947, the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory (HEPL) was founded as a facility at Stanford University. The facility is designed to promote interdisciplinary enterprises across different branches of science and was named in his honor.
==Personal life==
In October 1938, William Webster Hansen married Betsy Ross, who was the younger daughter of Perley Ason Ross, professor of physics at Stanford. Shortly after his death Betsy committed suicide. Their only child had died six months after his birth during the fall of 1947.

==Honors==
*IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award of the Institute of Radio Engineers (1944)
*President&#x27;s Certificate of Merit (1948)
*Member of the National Academy of Sciences (1949)

In 2005 the college purchased a tract of land in Coppell, Texas as the site of a satellite campus, which opened in 2008 as North Lake - North Campus. The North Campus location in far northwestern Dallas County pulls students not only from Dallas County, but also from neighboring Tarrant County and Denton County. The North Campus is also home to the college&#x27;s logistics technology program.

North Lake - South Campus was opened in fall 2009 and is located on the northeast corner of Shady Grove and MacArthur Boulevard in Irving, with the primary purpose of providing educational opportunities for those in need of basic academic skills, language acquisition, and job competencies in the under-served areas of South Irving.

In 2019 the Dallas Independent School District (DISD) opened North Lake Early College High School, which has a campus for students in grades 9–10 at North Lake South and will have a grade 11-12 campus at North Lake North. The school is not within DISD&#x27;s boundaries but DISD is allowed to operate it as such under Texas law.

== Athletics ==
The Dallas College North Lake Campus Blazers compete within the Metro Athletic Conference, a National Junior College Athletic Association Division III non-scholarship conference. Sports at North Lake include men&#x27;s basketball, baseball, and women&#x27;s soccer and volleyball.

In 2006, the North Lake Campus men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Rowan College of South Jersey (located in Sewell, New Jersey) team to claim the 2006 National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Division III Championship. The NL men&#x27;s team won the NJCAA Men&#x27;s Division III Basketball Championship in 2008 and 2017.

<doc id="507035" wikidata="Q5220109" url="?curid=507035" title="Danny Baker">
<text>Danny Baker (born 22 June 1957) is an English comedy writer, journalist, radio DJ and screenwriter. Throughout his career he has largely presented for London&#x27;s regional radio and television.

Baker was born in Deptford to a working-class family and raised in Bermondsey. From 1977 he wrote for the punk zine &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot;, and from there was hired by the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, where he worked as a writer, reviewer, and interviewer. Moving into television in 1980, he began presenting London Weekend Television&#x27;s &quot;Twentieth Century Box&quot; and reporting for &quot;The Six O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;. In 1989 he began radio presenting for BBC Radio London and in 1990 joined the newly established BBC Radio 5. In 1997 he was dismissed from the latter, accused of inciting threatening behaviour toward a football referee. That decade, he also began writing for television.

From 2002 to 2012 Baker presented the daily morning radio show on BBC Radio London and in 2007 also presented the channel&#x27;s all-day podcast, the &quot;All Day Breakfast Show&quot;. Between 2012 and 2017 he published a three-volume autobiography, which was used as the basis for the 2015 BBC sitcom &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot;. 

In 2019, the BBC dismissed Baker after he posted a tweet that featured a vintage photograph of a couple holding hands with a costumed chimpanzee. His accompanying text, &quot;Royal baby leaves hospital,&quot; referred to the (at the time) recent announcement of the birth of Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, but was interpreted by many as Baker mocking The Duchess of Sussex&#x27;s racial heritage. Baker denied any racial motivation for the tweet.

== Early life ==
Baker was born in Deptford in south-east London to Fred &quot;Spud&quot; Baker, a dockworker, and Betty, a factory worker. He grew up in Bermondsey and attended Rotherhithe Primary School and then, instead of taking up a grammar school place, went to the nearby West Greenwich Secondary Boys&#x27; School, Deptford. After leaving school at 14, he worked in One Stop Records, a small but fashionable record shop in South Molton Street in the West End of London. The youngest of three children, he has an older sister, Sharon, and had an older brother, Michael, who died aged 29 when Danny was 24.

==Career==

===Print journalism===
In 1977, Baker started writing for the punk fanzine &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; which was founded by his old schoolfriend Mark Perry which in turn led to an offer from the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, then edited by Nick Logan. Baker began working as the office receptionist, but was soon contributing regular articles and reviews before progressing to interviews. He often refers to these times during his radio shows, regularly citing examples of the ridiculous behaviour exhibited by his rock star interviewees.

In the later 1990s, Baker wrote a weekly sports column for &quot;The Times&quot; and was briefly a columnist for early issues of film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;.

===Television===
====Reporting for LWT (1980s)====
Baker started his TV career in 1980 at London Weekend Television (LWT), as the presenter of &quot;Twentieth Century Box&quot; – a series of regional documentaries on elements of youth culture in London, produced by Janet Street-Porter. One edition in the first series documented the burgeoning new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) scene, including an early TV appearance of Iron Maiden performing at The Marquee Club and interviews with &quot;air guitarists&quot;. Other editions also featured early appearances from the likes of Spandau Ballet and Depeche Mode.

Baker&#x27;s first mainstream break was as reporter-presenter on the Michael Aspel LWT regional magazine &quot;The Six O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; alongside former &quot;Mastermind&quot; winner and former London black cab driver Fred Housego. Paul Ross (brother of Jonathan Ross whom Baker had as his best man) was his researcher. During his stint on &quot;The Six O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, Baker was filmed having an altercation with a British Rail press officer. This clip is often resurrected for clip shows and can be seen on YouTube.

====Writing and presenting (early–late 1990s)====
Baker appeared regularly on LWT&#x27;s regional output during the 1980s and early 1990s – working on such programmes as &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;, &quot;Danny Baker&#x27;s Londoners&quot;, and in 1991, &quot;The Game&quot; – a six-part series which featured coverage of teams involved in the fourth division of the East London Sunday Football League. The series was later released on DVD.

Baker began writing for television programmes in 1992 after being asked to prepare a piece for one of the first archive clip shows: &quot;TV Hell&quot;, which was a collection of the worst TV programmes ever. Since then he has presented television shows such as &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, &quot;Pets Win Prizes&quot; and &quot;TV Heroes&quot;, which was a series of 10-minute homages to some of Baker&#x27;s entertainment idols including Fanny Cradock, Peter Glaze (from &quot;Crackerjack&quot;) and the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; audience. The episode on the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; audience includes a clip of Baker leaping around to a performance of &quot;Ooh What A Life&quot; by the Gibson Brothers in 1979, captioned as &quot;Danny Baker&#x27;s first TV appearance&quot;.

Baker also began a BBC Saturday night chat show, called &quot;Danny Baker After All&quot; which borrowed its style from &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, but his style and guests (Rick Wakeman of prog rock band Yes was a regular) did not attract the mainstream audience the slot demanded. Film critic Mark Kermode&#x27;s band the Railtown Bottlers were the show&#x27;s house band.

Later he fronted television adverts for Daz washing powder and Mars bar confectionery. Baker parodied his Daz ads by appearing as himself on the sitcom &quot;Me, You and Him&quot;.

During this period, Baker began presenting on BBC Radio 5&#x27;s &quot;606&quot; football-related phone-in programme as well as the job of presenting &quot;Match of the Eighties&quot;, a six-part BBC series of football during the 1980/81 and 1985/86 seasons.

Baker was a writer on Chris Evans&#x27; &quot;TFI Friday&quot; show, as well as contributing material for presenters such as Angus Deayton and Jonathan Ross.

====Guest appearances (late 1990s–2000s)====
During the late 1990s he made guest appearances on comedy shows including &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; and &quot;Room 101&quot;. During this period he appeared in the press as a result of nights out with friends Chris Evans and England footballer Paul Gascoigne. Gascoigne was under media scrutiny for drinking and socialising while preparing for tournaments. After Gascoigne was left out of the 1998 World Cup squad, Baker went on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; to defend his friend and criticise the omission.

He also appeared on &quot;The Terry and Gaby Show&quot; from 2003 to 2004 (where he burnt his hand trying to perform a trick with a microwave and a piece of soap) and has appeared on BBC Two quiz show &quot;QI&quot;, becoming the show&#x27;s first ever winner. Baker worked again with Charles Shaar Murray on the Ramones documentary &quot;End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones&quot;, providing an audio commentary.

More recent TV projects include &quot;The Sitcom Showdown&quot; which began on UKTV Gold in April 2006, a 2014 show featuring archived television footage for BBC4 named &quot;Brushing Up On...&quot; and a music discussion show for BBC4 named &quot;Danny Baker&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Decades&quot;. He also did &quot;Comic Relief Does The Apprentice&quot; in 2007 for Comic Relief. He also performed in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, as the narrator, at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley and the New Wimbledon Theatre.

Baker was announced as part of BT Sport&#x27;s football coverage in 2013, hosting a Friday evening show with Danny Kelly. In 2016, Chris Evans hired Baker to work as a writer on the 2016 series of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. In November 2016, he entered as a latecomer in reality television show, &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here&quot;. Baker was the first person to be voted off in the series.

===Radio career===
====BBC Radio London/5 Live/BBC Radio 1 (19891997)====
Baker began his radio career on BBC Radio London in 1989, presenting &quot;Weekend Breakfast&quot; from 6 to 9am on Saturdays and Sundays. The show was produced by Chris Evans, who became a good friend to Baker. With GLR eventually opting for a more orthodox breakfast show at weekends, Baker moved to the 10am to 1pm slot on Sundays.

In 1990, Baker joined the newly launched BBC Radio 5, presenting &quot;Sportscall&quot;, a phone-in sports quiz broadcast every Saturday lunchtime.

From October 1991 to October 1992 he presented &quot;606&quot; and, from February 1992 until October 1993, he presented &quot;Morning Edition&quot; every weekday morning. The show blended Baker&#x27;s love of unusual trivia with &quot;grown-up&quot; music. This was where Baker first teamed up with Danny Kelly and Allis Moss. Mark Kermode added weekly film reviews, and would later appear with his band the Railtown Bottlers every week on the first series of Baker&#x27;s TV show.

Baker joined BBC Radio 1 in October 1993, taking over the weekend mid-morning show from 10am to 1pm from Dave Lee Travis who had resigned on air following the sackings instigated by Matthew Bannister and Trevor Dann during the early 1990s. However, due to poor ratings, from November 1994 he was heard on Saturdays only from 10am to 12 noon. Simon Mayo took over Sunday mornings.

Baker&#x27;s style led to a fall in listeners at Radio 1 but despite his tendering his resignation on at least two occasions, management added extensions to his contract. From October 1995, his Saturday show went out from 12:30 to 2:30pm. He left the station in September 1996. His co-hosts during this period included BBC continuity announcer Danny Kelly.

While continuing with his Saturday morning show on Radio 1, in 1996 Baker joined BBC Radio 5 Live to present a Sunday lunchtime show with Danny Kelly, &quot;Baker &amp; Kelly Upfront&quot;.

On leaving Radio 1, Baker returned to Radio London to present a three-hour Sunday show from 10am to 1pm. &quot;Baker and Kelly Upfront&quot; also returned, now at Saturday lunchtime, while Baker also took on a new show, &quot;The Baker Line&quot;, a Wednesday evening version of the &quot;606&quot; phone-in show.

While &quot;Baker and Kelly Upfront&quot; was light-hearted, &quot;The Baker Line&quot; was darker and emotionally charged. Baker was at his most outspoken, and in early 1997 he was dismissed from Radio 5 Live when station bosses alleged that he had incited threatening behaviour during an angry outburst about a referee.

====Talk Radio/Virgin Radio (19982000)====
Baker joined Talk Radio UK to present a similar football phone-in with Kelly each Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30pm. A pre-match show was added from 11:30am to 1pm. After moving to the Saturday breakfast slot (8am to 12 noon), he engineered his own dismissal after a matter of weeks by refusing to centre the show on football, preferring to intersperse chat with his own music selections.

After leaving Talk Radio UK, he joined Virgin Radio in early 1999, taking over from Jonathan Ross on Sundays from 10am to 1pm.

Not long after, Baker was approached by the BBC and was asked whether he wanted to present a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2, which at the time was being hosted by Steve Wright. (Wright was being promoted to the station&#x27;s Weekday Afternoon slot). Baker turned down the offer by saying &quot;the time wasn&#x27;t right&quot;, and the show was given to Jonathan Ross. Baker also deputised on Virgin&#x27;s Saturday lunchtime football show from 12 noon to 2pm for a handful of shows alongside Danny Kelly until he left the station in 2000.

====BBC London 94.9 (Sep 2001 – May 2005 and Oct 2005 – Nov 2012)====
In September 2001, Baker joined BBC London 94.9 presenting a Saturday morning show from 8 to 11am. Just six months later, in March 2002, and with a new co-presenting team which included Amy Lamé, Mark O&#x27;Donnell and David Kuo, he took over the breakfast show from 6 to 9am, with a new theme tune in the form of the Anthony Newley song &quot;The Candy Man&quot;.

Although not drawing a large listenership, Baker won &quot;Sony Radio DJ of the year&quot; for the show. However, the day after winning the award, he announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the month. The last show was on Friday 27 May 2005. On Monday 17 October 2005, after a sabbatical at home, Baker rejoined BBC London 94.9, where he took over the weekday 3 to 5pm show from Jono Coleman, who had moved to co-present the breakfast show with former actress JoAnne Good.

His BBC London 94.9 shows tended to feature off-the-wall phone-ins, toast and discussions with his on-air team, Amy Lamé and Baylen Leonard, often regarding music and entertainment nostalgia of the 1960s and 1970s. His interviews focused on offbeat trivia rather than the guests&#x27; latest or most famous work, and shows would be interspersed with relatively obscure rock tracks from bands such as Yes, Todd Rundgren, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart.

The programme was axed in November 2012 as part of a programme of cuts at the station. Although due to continue its run until the end of the year, Baker announced on air on the day of the announcement that that day&#x27;s show would be his last, branding his BBC London employers as &quot;pinheaded weasels&quot; for the way in which they cancelled the programme.

====&quot;All Day Breakfast Show&quot; podcasts (2007)====
On 15 March 2007 until September the same year, Baker hosted the &quot;All Day Breakfast Show&quot;, a podcast to reach listeners beyond BBC London&#x27;s FM radio reach. Regulars Amy Lamé, Baylen Leonard and David Kuo all contributed and the first show featured an appearance by comedian and actor Peter Kay.

Created by and starring Danny Baker, the show also featured Amy Lamé, Baylen Leonard and David Kuo. It followed a similar format to Baker&#x27;s radio show on BBC London, where the listeners and presenters share humorous anecdotes, interspersed with obscure recordings.

Originally launched in March 2007, the &quot;All Day Breakfast Show&quot; was rebranded in September that year as the &quot;All Day Breakfast Show in Colour&quot;, and a weekly download fee of £2 was applied to the podcast. The full-length podcast was made available solely through Wippit and edited highlights were made available as a teaser through iTunes.

The podcast went into hiatus after one week, numerous downloaders from Wippit being unable to access the material due to restrictions on available bandwidth. No official announcement was made for the cause of the hiatus, or whether the podcast would return. However, after several weeks of silence, the &quot;All Day Breakfast Show&quot; officially announced its return to the air on the 19 October 2007. No announcement on the main website was given, but in a five-minute mini-show downloadable initially only to paid subscribers, Baker and Leonard announced the return of the show. They confirmed that from &quot;next week&quot; they would be broadcasting three times a week. They also suggested (possibly only partially in jest) that due to BBC cuts announced the previous day, that they may be planning to end their official BBC London show and move to being an &quot;internet only&quot; show. The mini show also introduced a new recording of the Candyman theme tune.

On Saturday 15 December 2007 Baker posted an open letter on both the ADBS and Baker and Kelly sites, saying that &quot;there will be no more &quot;All Day Breakfast Show&quot;s nor Baker &amp; Kelly&#x27;s. There has now been an irreversible and utter breakdown between the on-air team and the company who have, with varying degrees of success, provided it to you online.&quot;

Wippit responded on 17 December 2007 saying that the show&#x27;s cancellation was due to &quot;a breakdown in contract negotiations between our company and Danny Baker&quot;, alleging that Baker &quot;did not wish to meet his agreed obligations regarding exclusivity&quot;, and Wippit rejected the terms proposed by his agent. Wippit offered Baker 100% of the programme&#x27;s revenues and declared no further interest in the podcast, but this offer was rejected by Baker&#x27;s agent.

====Return to &quot;606&quot;, BBC Radio 2 and Saturday show (20082019)====

Having announced on his BBC London radio show on 21 May 2008 that he would be returning to present Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;606&quot; football phone-in for a limited period that summer, Baker hosted six shows during Euro 2008. He made a long-term return to &quot;606&quot; in September 2008, hosting a Tuesday night show for the duration of the 200809 football season. He also had a short stint with Zoe Ball on Radio 2 on Saturday mornings after Jonathan Ross had been suspended for three months by the BBC. At the end of the 200809 season, Baker&#x27;s &quot;606&quot; Tuesday night show that he co-hosted with Issy Clarke shifted to an expanded Saturday morning slot, starting in September 2009 on 5 Live. The show returned in September 2010 after the summer break with Lynsey Hipgrave replacing Clarke as co-host. The Saturday morning show gained critical acclaim, winning the Gold Sony Radio Award in the Speech Radio Personality of the Year award for 2011, 2012 and 2014, and the Gold Award for the Entertainment Show of the Year in 2013.

====Lineker &amp; Baker: Behind Closed Doors (2018–2020)====
Between November 2018 and March 2020 Baker co-hosted 35 episodes of a podcast titled &quot;Lineker &amp; Baker: Behind Closed Doors&quot; with Gary Lineker and described as &quot;a regular show full of the intimate details of life in and around the game&quot;.

====Sacking by the BBC (2019)====
In May 2019, Baker posted an image on Twitter of a couple holding hands with a chimpanzee dressed in clothes. He had added the caption: &quot;Royal Baby leaves hospital,&quot; referring to the recent birth of Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, son of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Baker was subject to a backlash on social media, accused of mocking the Duchess of Sussex&#x27;s African-American heritage with the tweet. Baker deleted the tweet and apologised, stating that he had made a &quot;naive and catastrophic mistake&quot; with his choice of image, but denied racist intent. He stated that the choice of a chimpanzee &quot;dressed as a Lord&quot; had been made &quot;to lampoon privilege&quot;. The BBC sacked Baker, maintaining that he had made a &quot;serious error in judgement&quot; that went against the values of the station. Baker expressed disagreement with the BBC&#x27;s decision to fire him, receiving support from several media figures.

====The Treehouse (since 2019)====
In November 2019 Baker launched a twice-weekly podcast entitled &quot;The Treehouse&quot; co-hosted by Louise Pepper. The format is a continuation of previous non-football radio shows being based upon humorous stories from listeners, often relating to pop culture. From August 2020, the podcast moved to a paid-only subscription model on Patreon.

==Other ventures==
===Football videos===
Baker has presented a number of popular football videos and DVDs including &quot;Own Goals and Gaffs&quot; (1992), &quot;Right Hammerings&quot;, &quot;Whose Season Was It Anyway?&quot; (both 1993), &quot;Own Goals and Gaffs 2&quot;, &quot;Best Short Corners&quot; (both 1994), &quot;Fabulous World Of Freak Football&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Glorious Return Of Own Goals And Gaffs&quot; (2009).

&quot;The Game&quot; (1990), a television show presented by Baker, following bottom-division East London Sunday League football teams, was released on DVD through Revelation Films on 24 May 2010.

===Books===
====Football====
In 2009, he released a book co-written with Danny Kelly entitled &quot;Classic Football Debates Settled Once and for All, Vol. 1&quot;. Despite the title, the book itself makes clear that a sequel is not planned, though some extra material was written for the paperback edition, released to coincide with the 2010 World Cup.

In 2019, he released a book co-written with Gary Lineker based on their podcast &quot;Lineker &amp; Baker: Behind Closed Doors&quot;.

====Autobiography====
On 6 November 2012, Baker released an autobiography, &quot;Going to Sea in a Sieve&quot;. which was first published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. A second volume entitled &quot;Going Off Alarming&quot; was published on 25 September 2014. A third volume entitled &quot;Going on the Turn&quot; was published on 5 October 2017.

The sitcom &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot; was based on &quot;Going to Sea in a Sieve&quot;, and was released in September 2015.

==Personal life==

Baker married his wife Wendy in 1988. They have three children. They live in Blackheath, south east London.

On 1 November 2010, Baker announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer and would start chemotherapy instantly and radiotherapy in January. On 14 June 2011 he announced that he had been given the all clear.

Janet Street-Porter described Baker as &quot;over-hasty, excitable, [and] a blabbermouth&quot;, whose &quot;motor mouth was legendary, even back in the 1980s.&quot; She noted that his &quot;pet obsessions&quot; were &quot;working class humour&quot; and football.

Baker is a supporter of his local football club, Millwall.

==Politics==
Baker has been a lifelong Labour Party voter. In May 2017, he endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the upcoming general election.

==Reception==
In 2019 after the BBC dismissed Baker, the corporation issued a statement describing him as &quot;a brilliant broadcaster&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that he was a &quot;pioneer of the inclusive, personable, and at times eccentric, broadcasting style that has since become the norm,&quot; and that he &quot;has the knack of effortlessly making both the phone-in caller and the listener feel as if they are in his studio.&quot;

Janet Street-Porter stated that Baker&#x27;s pride in his working-class London identity proved popular among a &quot;large section of the population who feel they don&#x27;t get a voice on &#x27;posh&#x27; channels&quot;. She added that he stood out while working for the BBC, a corporation where &quot;the over-educated and middle class dominates&quot; and where, despite attempts to increase ethnic minority and LGBT representation, &quot;white working-class people&quot; remained &quot;conspicuously absent&quot;.

<text>Leor Dimant (, , ; born December 18, 1972), better known as DJ Lethal, is a Latvian-American turntablist and producer and is best known as a member of the groups House of Pain and Limp Bizkit.

== Early life ==
Leor Dimant was born to a Latvian-Jewish family in Riga, when it was part of the Soviet Union. His first contact with music was through his father Grisha Dimant (1951–2007), who performed in a rock band with his friends as a guitarist.

In 1976 when Dimant was four, he and his family emigrated to Italy, where they remained for a year until they obtained a visa. His parents chose to move to the New York area. There, his father performed in various Russian clubs and restaurants, mostly in Brighton Beach.

Dimant and his parents lived in Jersey City, New Jersey for some time. They moved to Los Angeles in 1987, where his father got a job at a new Russian restaurant. His first introduction to hip-hop was in Jersey City, when his school held a talent show with several students performing a rap song, and Dimant was amazed. Once he moved to Los Angeles, he quickly became interested in hip hop culture, including breakdancing and graffiti. Before learning to DJ, he started off as a beatboxer. He later practiced DJing using his friend&#x27;s turntables and mixer.

== Career ==

=== Everlast and House of Pain ===
In the late 1980s, Dimant became friends with a rapper who, at that time, dated rapper Everlast. When Everlast was about to go on a European tour with Ice-T and Rhyme Syndicate, he mentioned that he would like to hear Dimant beatbox, and they met. Everlast was impressed by his beatboxing skills, and he invited Dimant to be his DJ on the upcoming tour. Dimant, who was only 16 at the time, decided to do so and dropped out of school.

After the tour, in 1990, Everlast&#x27;s first solo album, including a track featuring scratching by Dimant, was released to both critical and commercial failure.

Following that, Everlast and Dimant, now known as DJ Lethal, decided to start a group, and with the addition of Everlast&#x27;s high school friend Danny Boy, House of Pain was formed. The group&#x27;s 1992 self-titled debut album went multi-platinum and is best known for the DJ Muggs-produced hit single &quot;Jump Around&quot; and the DJ Lethal-produced &quot;Shamrocks and Shenanigans&quot;. A second album was released in 1994.

In 1996, on the eve of the release of the group&#x27;s third album, produced by Everlast and DJ Lethal, things began to go sour. DJ Lethal claims it started to become a hassle, and simply was not fun anymore. The day the album was released, the group broke up.

=== Limp Bizkit ===
On House of Pain&#x27;s final tour, Limp Bizkit, an up-and-coming band from Jacksonville, Florida was hired as a supporting act. DJ Lethal and the band became friends, and later, Limp Bizkit hired him to do some work on their recordings, eventually asking him if he wanted to join them. DJ Lethal accepted the offer, and the band became one of the most popular nu metal groups during the late 90s and early 2000s, selling more than 40 million records worldwide.

DJ Lethal wanted his contributions to the band recordings to be more original than typical DJs in bands at the time. &quot;There are a couple of other rock bands that have DJs and they&#x27;re just like, [mimics a chirp scratch] &#x27;Hey, what&#x27;s going on? Let me spin around a couple of times and show off that I can spin two records.&#x27; So I definitely knew I didn&#x27;t want to be just another DJ in a rock band. I wanted to be another instrument—a part of the band, like another guitar player.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In a 2009 interview with the Latvian newspaper &quot;Diena&quot;, Dimant professed to still feeling &quot;Latvian&quot; despite his many years in the USA. This connection stems from the fact that he was born there, and has a grandmother, other relatives, and many friends of the family there. He mentions Laima Vaikule as an important family friend who encouraged him to maintain contacts with the country of his birth.

During his early years growing up in Riga, Dimant spoke mainly Russian at home and at school. He says his parents could speak Latvian, but did not want their son to learn it, so that they could have private conversations without him being able to understand. Nevertheless, Dimant can still recall several phrases in Latvian, such as &quot;&quot;Nevajag viņam!&quot; (&#x27;He doesn&#x27;t need [it] !&#x27;).

<doc id="507038" wikidata="Q305362" url="?curid=507038" title="Carl Macek">
<text>Carl Frank Macek (September 21, 1951 – April 17, 2010) was an American screenwriter and producer. Noted for his work on English-language adaptations of anime during the 1980s and 1990s, he was the creator of the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise and the co-founder of Streamline Pictures. His work is considered to have been instrumental in creating mainstream awareness of Japanese animation in the United States.

==Career==
===&quot;Robotech&quot; and Harmony Gold USA===
Macek came to public attention in 1985 as the producer and story editor of the influential animated television series &quot;Robotech&quot;, which he produced for Harmony Gold USA. &quot;Robotech&quot; is considered one of the titles most responsible for igniting anime fandom in North America and internationally. Macek intended to produce a sequel to &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot;, but this project was canceled. While at Harmony Gold, Macek also produced the little-known, rarely-seen &quot;Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years&quot; (which combines the almost-unrelated stories of &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; and &quot;Queen Millennia&quot;).

===Streamline Pictures===
Macek went on to co-found (with Jerry Beck) Streamline Pictures in 1988. Joining him were writers who had worked with him on &quot;Robotech&quot;, most notably, Steve Kramer, Tom Wyner, Gregory Snegoff, and Ardwight Chamberlain, each of whom are also experienced voice actors. Streamline Pictures was one of the first American companies to successfully deal in the regular production of imported Japanese animation. Among the titles released by Streamline are &quot;Lensman&quot;, &quot;Robot Carnival&quot;, &quot;Doomed Megalopolis&quot;, &quot;Twilight of the Cockroaches&quot;, &quot;Crying Freeman&quot;, &quot;Wicked City&quot;, the &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; film, &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Lupin III: Mystery of Mamo&quot; as well as the original English dub versions of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;. As of 1993, Streamline Pictures distributed their anime through Orion Home Video and was eventually purchased by Orion in 1996.

===Later career and other works===
Before his death, Macek was working as a scriptwriter for the English dub of &quot;Naruto&quot; and &quot;Bleach&quot; for Viz Media, and consulting for Harmony Gold on &quot;&quot;.

Macek was a co-editor of &quot;Film Noir – An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style&quot; (1979) and a contributor to &quot;McGill&#x27;s Survey of the Cinema&quot;. He authored &quot;The Art of Heavy Metal: Animation for the Eighties&quot; and &quot;Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels&quot; in which he chronicles in detail the conception and what went wrong during the production of the latter aborted animated series. He also worked as a scriptwriter for the animated series &quot;C.O.P.S.&quot;, was the executive consultant for the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;, and wrote the animated adaptation of Brian Pulido&#x27;s &quot;Lady Death&quot;.

Macek adapted the treatment by Merian C. Cooper (the producer of &quot;King Kong&quot;) for the unproduced film project &quot;War Eagles&quot; into a novel and screenplay in 2008. The book was published in the summer of 2008 by Angelgate Press.

==Legacy in anime==
Macek became one of the most controversial figures amongst English anime fandom. Streamline Pictures-dubbed anime were among the first to be available on home video as well as broadcast on cable. Over the years, he has seen his share of detractors and proponents, for while he did help to bring Japanese animation titles and series to the United States, his edits, re-rewrites and mash-ups (particularly &quot;The Robotech Saga&quot;) angered many fans of the original titles and series. To this day, anime fans still remain divided between appreciation and scorn for his work.

==Death==
Jerry Beck, one of Macek&#x27;s former business partners, revealed that Macek died of a heart attack on Saturday, April 17, 2010. Barely three months before his sudden death, Macek recorded a lengthy two-and-a-half-hour podcast interview with Anime News Network, offering an extensive retrospective on his entire career.

His obituary in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the place of death as Topanga Canyon. The obituary shows a picture of him surrounded by several &quot;Robotech&quot; characters from all three series. 

After Macek&#x27;s death, a short documentary, &quot;Carl Macek&#x27;s Robotech Universe&quot;, was produced.

<doc id="507041" wikidata="Q808667" url="?curid=507041" title="Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal">
<text>Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, of Mount Royal in the Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada, and of Glencoe in the County of Argyll, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1900 for the Scottish-born Canadian financier and politician Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, with remainder in default of legitimate male issue to his only daughter, Margaret Charlotte. Smith had already been created Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, of Glencoe in the County of Argyll, and of Mount Royal in the Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada, in 1897, with remainder to the legitimate male issue of his body. This title was also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Upon his death in 1914, the barony of 1897 became extinct, while he was succeeded according to the special remainder in the barony of 1900 by his daughter, who became the second Baroness. She was the wife of Robert Jared Bliss Howard, a surgeon. Their eldest son, the third Baron, represented North Cumberland in the British House of Commons as a Unionist from 1922 to 1926. He also served in the National Government as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1931 to 1934 and as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1934 to 1939. The latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Baron, succeeded in 1959 and served under Margaret Thatcher as a Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence from 1979 to 1981. His son, the fifth Baron, succeeded in 2018.

Through his estate, the first Baron bequeathed nearly $2 million to educational institutions, including $500,000 to Yale University. Accordingly, Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall, a classroom and administration building on Yale&#x27;s campus, is partially named in his honour.

The family seat is Colonsay House on the Isle of Colonsay, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.

<text>The University of California College of the Law, San Francisco (abbreviated as UC Law SF or UC Law) is a public law school in San Francisco, California, United States. It was known as the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (abbreviated as UC Hastings) from 1878 to 2023. 

Founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton Hastings, UC Law SF was the first law school of the University of California as well as one of the first law schools established in California. Although part of the University of California, UC Law SF is not directly governed by the Regents of the University of California. UC Law SF is also one of the few prominent university-affiliated law schools in the United States that does not share a campus with the university&#x27;s undergraduates or other postgraduate programs.

==History==
===Founding of the law school===
In 1878, Serranus Clinton Hastings, the first chief justice of California, gave $100,000 to be used to create the law school that once bore his name. He arranged for the enactment of a legislative act on March 26, 1878, to create the Hastings College of the Law as a separate legal entity affiliated with the University of California. This was apparently intended for compatibility with Section 8 of the university&#x27;s Organic Act, which authorized the board of regents to affiliate with independent self-sustaining professional colleges. Another reason for making the gift in this fashion was that Hastings desired to impose certain conditions on his gift, while &quot;policy and law dictated that a free-gift could not be hedged by power of reversion.&quot;

According to the Hastings College of the Law&#x27;s official centennial history, its founder, &quot;whether from arrogance, oversight, ignorance, or a combination of all three, was the author of his own troubles.&quot; Although the founder had selected the original Hastings board of directors from among his professional acquaintances, he failed to adequately verify their concurrence with his beliefs that a proper legal education must include a course in legal ethics and must also be hybridized with elements of a liberal arts education. To his horror, it turned out they all believed that the only purpose of a law school was to provide vocational education in how to practice law. This latter belief was shared by the first professor hired, John Norton Pomeroy, who personally taught the vast majority of courses during the law school&#x27;s early years. The founder hoped to educate cultured intellectuals who also happened to be lawyers; the board simply wanted to produce lawyers. It was impossible to reconcile these fundamentally different visions, and by September 1882, the founder had become estranged from his own handpicked board. By that point in time, he had come to see the UC Board of Regents as a superior vehicle for infusing liberal arts and legal ethics into his law school, and in March 1883 arranged for another legislative act that purported to transfer the Hastings College of the Law directly to the University of California and vested responsibility for its governance in the regents. This was in facial conflict with the &quot;affiliate&quot; language in Section 8 of the Organic Act, so in March 1885, another act was passed to create a &quot;pro forma&quot; board of trustees for the sole purpose of holding title to the law school&#x27;s assets at arm&#x27;s length from the regents (but under which the regents would continue to have the right to manage such assets).

In deference to the 1883 act, the Hastings board of directors ceased to meet. But because the regents chose to remain neutral in the long-simmering dispute between board and founder—and did not attempt to exercise any control under the 1883 or 1885 acts—Hastings went through a strange period from September 1882 to April 1885 where it operated with no actual supervision from any governing board.

On April 25, 1885, the Hastings board of directors convened to appoint Perrie Kewen as the new registrar, because the previous registrar had died. At the request of Serranus Clinton Hastings, Attorney General Edward C. Marshall challenged Kewen&#x27;s appointment by initiating a proceeding for a writ of &quot;quo warranto&quot; in San Francisco County Superior Court. On March 30, 1886, in what became known as &quot;Kewen&#x27;s Case&quot;, the Supreme Court of California upheld Kewen&#x27;s appointment by declaring the 1883 and 1885 acts to be unconstitutional on the basis of a provision of the 1879 state constitution guaranteeing the legislative independence of the University of California. In other words, the 1879 ratification of the state&#x27;s second constitution (which remains in effect today) effectively stripped the California State Legislature of the power to amend preexisting statutes governing the University of California, including the 1878 act. This was the last time that Serranus Clinton Hastings would try to shape the future of the law school that he had founded; the Hastings College of the Law has maintained its hard-fought independence from the Regents ever since. The irony of &quot;Kewen&#x27;s Case&quot; is that a constitutional provision intended to protect the University of California was applied in such a way as to prevent the university from taking control of its first law school.

In contrast, the &quot;Affiliated Colleges&quot; — the medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools in San Francisco — were affiliated with the University of California through written agreements, and not statutes invested with constitutional importance by court decisions. In the early 20th century, the Affiliated Colleges agreed to voluntarily submit to the regents&#x27; governance during the term of UC President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, as the UC Board of Regents had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC brand but over which the university had no real control. While Hastings remained independent, the Affiliated Colleges began to increasingly coordinate with each other and the rest of the UC bureaucracy in Berkeley under the supervision of the president and the regents, and evolved into the health sciences campus known today as the University of California, San Francisco.

===The part-time law school===

In 1899, the Hastings board of directors declined an invitation from the regents to join the Affiliated Colleges at their new campus at Parnassus Heights. The board was reluctant to move the law school from its traditional Civic Center location, but this doomed the law school to five more decades of wandering from one temporary site to the next, for a total of 16 different locations between its founding and the opening of a permanent campus in 1953.

In 1900, Hastings College of the Law became one of 27 charter members of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS).

The Hastings College of the Law was for many years considered the primary law school of the University of California with the purpose of preparing lawyers for the practice of law in the state, whereas the Department of Jurisprudence on the Berkeley campus—which later became the School of Jurisprudence, then Boalt Hall School of Law, and now Berkeley Law—was intended for the study of law as an academic discipline. Both schools were launched with one professor assisted by part-time instructors who also happened to be practicing lawyers. During the early 20th century, Berkeley initiated a rapid transition to hiring full-time lecturers and professors to teach the majority of its law courses, but Hastings did not. After Berkeley started to award law degrees in May 1903, Berkeley swiftly eclipsed Hastings and pushed the older law school into a long period of severe decline. Enrollment at Hastings plunged from 100 students in 1912 to only 76 by 1915. 

During this difficult era, Hastings was widely seen as a homeless, &quot;peripatetic law school&quot; with part-time faculty teaching part-time working students whom for whatever reason were unable to attend a full-time law school program. With no permanent campus, Hastings could not build its own academic law library, then regarded as an essential component of a law school (before the invention of computer-assisted legal research), and was forced to rely on the city&#x27;s public law library. As a result, Hastings was involuntarily ejected from AALS twice, in 1916 and 1927. 

Even the deanship was a part-time job before 1933. This explains how Edward Robeson Taylor could simultaneously serve as dean of Hastings, dean of a medical college, chairman of the board of trustees of the San Francisco Public Library, poet laureate of San Francisco, and Mayor of San Francisco. His successor, Maurice E. Harrison, simultaneously served as dean of Hastings, regent of the University of California, and partner at a predecessor of the modern Morrison &amp; Foerster law firm (he later co-founded Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison). It was not until William M. Simmons served as dean from 1925 to 1940 that the deanship was converted to a full-time position. 

The same statute that affiliated Hastings with the University of California also designated the Hastings College of the Law as the University of California&#x27;s &quot;law department.&quot; According to the University of California, Los Angeles political science professor J.A.C. Grant, it was believed there could only be one &quot;law department&quot; (i.e., only one official UC law school), which is why the Department of Jurisprudence at Berkeley retained its name even after it began to award law degrees. The University of California, Berkeley did not rename its School of Jurisprudence to a School of Law until the state legislature passed a bill in 1947 authorizing UCLA to create a &quot;school of law.&quot; Boalt Hall&#x27;s newly-hired dean, William Lloyd Prosser, got wind of this in 1948 while visiting UCLA to help plan the new law school and decided that Berkeley could get away with the same thing.

===Transformation===

After decades of dreary mediocrity, the Hastings College of the Law underwent a dramatic transformation under the leadership of David E. Snodgrass, who served as dean from 1940 to 1963. Snodgrass was a &quot;feisty, outspoken advocate&quot; who fought fiercely as dean to elevate the law school&#x27;s profile both within California and at the national level. The only reason why Hastings and Berkeley&#x27;s coldly distant relationship remained collegial during most of his deanship—to the extent that Snodgrass openly supported the name change of the School of Jurisprudence and Prosser agreed to not challenge legislative appropriations for Hastings—was that he and Prosser had been friends since their days as classmates at Harvard College. 

During the post–World War II economic expansion, Snodgrass was able to capitalize on a massive surge of interest in legal careers among G.I. Bill veterans and baby boomers. With its flexible part-time program, its heavy reliance on part-time instructors who made up the majority of its faculty, its habit of holding classes in any space it could scrounge up (including courtrooms and the city&#x27;s public library), and its lenient admission requirement of only two years of college-level work (increased to three in 1950), Hastings could expand very quickly in a way that elitist, bureaucratic Boalt Hall could not. Enrollment at Hastings exploded from 300 in 1941 to 496 in 1946 and to 917 in 1949. It was the rapid postwar expansion of Hastings which enabled Boalt Hall to vault into the top tier of American law schools by the 1990s, by relieving political pressure on the law faculty at Berkeley to compromise on their strict standards for student admissions and faculty hiring. 

It was Snodgrass who finally found Hastings a permanent home. He obtained an appropriation of $1.45 million from the state legislature and additional funding in the amount of $300,000 from the UC Board of Regents towards the construction of the law school&#x27;s first permanent building, which opened on March 26, 1953. The building was later renamed Snodgrass Hall in honor of the man who had brought it into existence, and was the center of academic life at Hastings for over six decades before its demolition in October 2020.

===The 65 Club===

Snodgrass exploited the law school&#x27;s independence from the University of California and its mandatory retirement policies to begin the &quot;65 Club&quot;, the practice of hiring faculty who had been forced into mandatory retirement at age 65 from Ivy League and other elite institutions. The very first appointment in 1940 was Orrin Kip McMurray, a Hastings graduate who had served as Boalt Hall&#x27;s second dean. Other American law schools competed aggressively after World War II to hire young up-and-coming law professors, but by focusing his efforts on hiring elderly ones, Snodgrass was able to bring many distinguished law professors to Hastings for &quot;very reasonable salaries&quot;. This strategy was so successful at bringing high-quality faculty to Hastings that by 1948, 60 percent of the full-time faculty were professors who had retired from other law schools. In the mid-1950s, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a story in which former Harvard Law School dean and jurist Roscoe Pound praised Hastings: &quot;Indeed, on the whole, I am inclined to think you have the strongest law faculty in the nation.&quot; 

Despite the difficult history between Berkeley and Hastings, Berkeley supplied more members of the 65 Club than any other law school, including Prosser himself, which led to a more amicable relationship between the two law schools. The 65 Club looked to Berkeley as their model and insisted on raising standards to match their previous institutions. By the 1990s, the Hastings student body was &quot;full-time, college educated, and highly qualified&quot;. After laws were enacted to prohibit age discrimination in the United States, however, the 65 Club was gradually phased out, and Hastings hired its last 65 Club professor in 1998.

===Renaming===
Adjunct professor John Briscoe outlined a &quot;Moral Case for Renaming Hastings College of the Law&quot; in a 2017 opinion essay, explaining the school&#x27;s founder, Serranus Clinton Hastings, &quot;was promoter and financier of Indian-hunting expeditions in the 1850s&quot; and his acquisition of land titles &quot;was facilitated by the massacre of the rightful claimants.&quot;

The specific charges against Hastings are that he organized militias led by his employees to massacre the Yuki people who lived on or near his extensive land-holdings in Mendocino County, California, in the late 1850s during the California genocide. Hundreds of Yuki, including women and children, were killed in what are called the Round Valley Settler Massacres of 1856–1859.

In 2020, after studying the matter for three years, a commission established by the school confirmed that its founder had managed a forced labor camp, organized murderous &quot;Indian hunts&quot;, and otherwise participated actively in the genocide that killed most of the Native American population of Mendocino County, California. However, the commission – which was led by chancellor David L. Faigman – recommended against a proposal to rename the school &quot;as it could lead to public confusion&quot; and &quot;result in a decline in applications and perhaps a loss of philanthropic and alumni support.&quot; On October 27, 2021, Faigman clarified his position: &quot;There is no effort from me or the college to oppose a name change ... Such a change would require action from the California State Legislature and Governor&#x27;s office... If changing the name is something the College needs to do to bring restorative action and there is legislative action to facilitate that change, I will engage with that process.&quot;

In late October 2021 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article about S.C. Hastings&#x27;s involvement in genocide against the Yuki and advocating for a name change. The article galvanized alumni, including former San Francisco mayor and Democratic Party power broker Willie Brown, to support a name change. On November 2, 2021, the board of directors for the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, voted unanimously to remove Serranus Clinton Hastings from the name of the law school. On July 27, 2022, the board of directors voted unanimously to rename the law school the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco (UC Law SF). The name change bill was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 23, 2022, and took effect January 1, 2023.

On October 4, 2022, descendants of Serranus Clinton Hastings filed suit against the UC Law SF directors and the state to block the name change. The plaintiffs were represented by lawyers Harmeet Dhillon, Gregory Michael and Dorothy Yamamoto. The suit claims that the California act of 1878 contains the terms of a contract with Serranus Hastings. Interviewed in the San Francisco Chronicle, David Carrillo (a member of the law faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, and not involved in the suit) said that there is a distinction between a signed agreement between Serranus Clinton Hastings and the state (which could be a binding contract that the legislature cannot repudiate by enactment) and a legislative act (which cannot prevent the legislature from later amending or repealing it). The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2024 following a ruling that the 1878 act was not a binding contract.

==Location==
UC Law SF campus spreads among four main buildings located near San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center: 200 McAllister Street houses academic space and administrative offices, 333 Golden Gate Avenue contains mainly classrooms and faculty offices, 198 McAllister is a 14-story residence complex with 657 units of housing, and 100 McAllister, known casually as &quot;The Tower&quot;, contains university office and further student housing, as well as the Art Deco &quot;Sky Room&quot; on the 24th floor.

The campus is within walking distance of the Muni Metro and Bay Area Rapid Transit Civic Center/UN Plaza station. Located within a two-block radius of the campus is the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the California Supreme Court, the California Court of Appeal for the First District, San Francisco Superior Court, San Francisco City Hall, United Nations Plaza (and Federal Building Annex), the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, and the Main Library of the San Francisco Public Library system.

Historically, UC Law SF had operated its own Public Safety Department, but in June 2016, UC Law SF entered into a contract with UCSF under which the UCSF Police Department assumed responsibility for patrolling the UC Law SF campus. 

==Organization and structure==
UC Law SF is managed by a nine-member board of directors. The UC Law SF&#x27;s board of directors exists independently of, and is not controlled by, the Regents of the University of California. Pursuant to California law, eight of the directors are appointed by the governor of California. Pursuant to the UC Law SF constitutive documents, the ninth director must be a direct lineal descendant of UC Law SF founder Serranus Clinton Hastings. The Hastings family member now serving on the board is Claes H. Lewenhaupt.

UC Law SF&#x27;s detachment from the UC Regents gives it a broad degree of independence in shaping educational and fiscal policies; however, due to a shrinking California education budget, UC Law SF must also compete for limited educational funds against its fellow UC campuses. Despite the apparent competition among the UC law schools, UC Law SF was able to maintain its traditionally high standards without having to decrease class size or raise tuition to higher levels than fellow UC law schools, until the California budget crisis in June 2009, first raised the possibility of slashing $10 million in state funding.

A few days later, however, lawmakers rejected the harsh budget cut, agreeing to cut only $1 million and apparently preventing dramatic tuition hikes.

Under California law, if the government ever cuts funding to UC Law SF to below the 19th-century figure of $7,000 a year, the state must return the $100,000, plus interest, to the Hastings family. State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) has argued that the rejected $10 million budget cut, in abandoning state financial support for the school, would have allowed the Hastings family to launch an expensive court fight to reclaim the $100,000 plus hefty interest.

==Academics==
===Admissions===
For the class entering in 2023, UC Law SF accepted 30.91% of applicants, with 29.54% of those accepted enrolling. The average enrollee had a 160 LSAT score and 3.59 undergraduate GPA.

===Rankings===

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks UC Law SF tied at 82nd among law schools in the US and, in 2015, as the most diverse of the five law schools in the UC system. In 2022, UC Law SF was ranked 2nd for Asian students, and ranked 22nd for Hispanic students, by &quot;The National Jurist: The Magazine for Law Students&quot;. 

In 2023, UC Law SF received an &quot;A-&quot; rating by &quot;The National Jurist&quot;&#x27;s &quot;preLaw&quot; magazine, and was one of the four top-ranked UC law schools, in the &quot;Best Schools for Law Firm Employment&quot; listing.

In 2023, &quot;preLaw&quot; magazine ranked UC Law SF ninth for public interest law and first for criminal defense and prosecution.

For 2022-23 UC Law SF had the No.2 moot court program in the country, and placed first the prior two years, according to &quot;The National Jurist&quot;. The Web site &quot;Law School Advocacy&quot; also ranked UC Law SF as the top moot court program in the country in 2021, with Top 5 rankings in each of the previous five years.

===Degree programs===

UC Law SF offers a three-year Juris Doctor program with concentrated studies available in seven areas: civil litigation, criminal law, international law, public interest law, taxation, family law, and recently, a new concentration in intellectual property law. Most J.D. students follow a traditional three-year plan. During the first year, students take required courses as well as one elective course. In the second and third years, students may take any course or substitute or supplement their courses with judicial externships or internships, judicial clinics, or study abroad. The college also offers a one-year LL.M. degree in U.S. legal studies for students holding law degrees from foreign law programs. It is an American Bar Association (ABA) accredited law school since 1939.

UC Law SF participates in the Concurrent Degree Program with UC Santa Cruz&#x27;s Masters of Science in Applied Economics and Finance. In this 3+3 program, students may concurrently earn a JD from UC Law SF and a master&#x27;s degree in applied economics and finance from Santa Cruz, by pursuing the two degrees concurrently, eligible students can earn both degrees in less time than it would take to earn them serially. UC Law SF also participates in the Concurrent Degree Program with U.C. Berkeley&#x27;s Haas Graduate School of Business. Upon completion of a four-year program, the student earns a Berkeley M.B.A. degree and a J.D. degree from UC Law SF College of the Law.

UC Law SF College of the Law and the UCSF School of Medicine of the University of California, San Francisco have commenced a joint degree program, and in 2011 began enrolling their first class of graduate students in the Master of Studies in Law (MSL) and LL.M. in Law, Science and Health Policy programs. Students have coursework available at each institution for fulfillment of the degrees. This program is a component of the UCSF/UC Law SF Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy.

UC Law SF has a chapter of the Order of the Coif, a national law school honorary society founded for the purposes of encouraging legal scholarship and advancing the ethical standards of the legal profession. It joined the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) as a charter member in 1900; it renewed its membership in 1949.

==Post-graduation employment==
According to UC Law SF official 2019 ABA-required disclosures, 70.6% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment (i.e. as attorneys) nine months after graduation, excluding solo-practitioners. UC Law SF Law School Transparency 2019 under-employment score is 19.7%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2019 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.
==Bar examination passage rates==
For the 2023 Bar Examinations, 72.14% of UC Law SF Law graduates taking the exam for the first time passed. Within two years 93.95% passed.

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at UC Law SF for the 2024–2025 academic year is $57,215 for California residents and $64,703 for non-residents. UC Law SF does not offer full-tuition scholarships.

<doc id="507053" wikidata="Q7330615" url="?curid=507053" title="Dallas College Richland">
<text>Dallas College Richland Campus (often stylized as Richland or RLC) is a public community college in Dallas, Texas. The school was founded in 1972 and is part of Dallas College. It is the largest campus in the college, featuring about 20,000 students. Located on the old Jackson farm, the campus comprises including Thunderduck Lake.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2005, the Richland Campus became the first community college to receive the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.

It has been designated as the first two-year institution in Texas as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE2Y) for academic years 2011-2016. CAE2Ys receive formal recognition from the U.S. government, as well as opportunities for prestige and publicity for their role in securing our nation’s information systems.

In 2013, Dallas College Richland Campus developed a skill standard for Digital Forensic Technician. Its Cyber Security program was recognized by the Texas Skills Standard Board (TSSB) as the first and only institution in Texas to meet this statewide standard.

==Athletics==

Dallas College Richland Campus fields teams in basketball, baseball, wrestling, soccer, and volleyball that compete in the Dallas-area Metro Athletic Conference. They also compete for national championships within the National Junior College Athletic Association, Division III. Many athletes have gone on to play for four-year university programs and professional teams.

The men&#x27;s basketball team won the NJCAA Division III championship in 1999, 2009, and 2015.

The baseball team won the NJCAA Division III World Series championship in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2009.

The men&#x27;s soccer team won the NJCAA Division III championship in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2016, 2018 and 2019.

The women&#x27;s soccer team won the NJCAA Division III championship in 2004, 2006, and 2009.

===Wrestling===
From 1972-1984, Richland won 7 out of 8 Texas state wrestling championships while competing against four-year universities with wrestlers on scholarships. In 1984, all Texas colleges dropped wrestling, and the team was forced to travel as far as Kansas every weekend for meets. The lack of local competition and extensive travel caused Richland to shut down their program in 1987. The program was resurrected in 2016, competing in the NCWA Southwest Conference. 

Coach Bill Neal was named NCWA Coach of the Year in 2017 and 2018. Coach Neal retired in 2020 after 48 years at Richland.

COVID-19 and other concerns, including the sport having club status rather than falling under the NJCAA, caused the college to cancel the program shortly after Coach Neal’s retirement.

==Building names==
Some buildings at Dallas College Richland Campus are named for heroes of the Texas Revolution, with the first letter of the name corresponding to the use of the building. For example, Bonham Hall, where the Business department is located, is named for James Butler Bonham, who died at the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. Crockett Hall, named for Alamo hero David Crockett, is the Campus Center. Fannin Hall, where Fine Art classes are held, is named for Col. James W. Fannin, who led the ill-fated Texas rebels at Goliad.

Other building names are Spanish words or names. Lavaca (&quot;the cow&quot;) Hall houses the Library. Alamito (&quot;little cottonwood&quot;) Hall is the original Administration Building. El Paso (&quot;the Pass&quot;) Hall is the interior lower level of a bridge that connects the east and west sides of the campus, which are separated by a shallow but picturesque creek originally known as Jackson Branch. Del Rio (&quot;of the river&quot;) Hall is where the school&#x27;s data center or computer lab is located.

Sabine Hall, named for the river that separates Texas and Louisiana, is the Science Building. Neches and Pecos Halls are also named for rivers. The previous Science building is now called Wichita Hall, which is named after a Texas Indian tribe. Thunderduck Hall, named after the school athletic team cartoon mascot, is the new Administration Building.

<text>&quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; is a poem by the Irish poet Thomas Moore. He wrote it in 1805, while staying at Jenkinstown Castle in County Kilkenny, Ireland, where he was said to have been inspired by a specimen of Rosa &#x27;Old Blush&#x27;.

The poem is set to a traditional tune called &quot;Aisling an Óigfhear&quot;, or &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which was transcribed by Edward Bunting in 1792, based on a performance by harper Denis Hempson (Donnchadh Ó hAmhsaigh) at the Belfast Harp Festival. The poem and the tune together were published in December 1813 in volume 5 of Thomas Moore&#x27;s &quot;A Selection of Irish Melodies&quot;. The original piano accompaniment was written by John Andrew Stevenson, several other arrangements followed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The poem is now probably at least as well known in its song form as in the original.

Deanna Durbin sings the song in the 1939 film, &quot;Three Smart Girls Grow Up&quot;.

In the 1941 film &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, it is the character Joe Pendelton&#x27;s inability to play &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; on his saxophone in any way other than badly that allows him to prove that he is alive in another man&#x27;s body; all the other characters think he is the dead man from whom he got the body, but when he plays the sax for his old boxing manager, he uses the same wrong note in the melody as he always did, and which thus confirms his story of coming back from the after-life.

In the 1944 film &quot;Gaslight&quot;, the melody is associated with the opera singer Alice Alquist, the murdered aunt of the protagonist, Paula (Ingrid Bergman).

<doc id="507063" wikidata="Q159534" url="?curid=507063" title="Hibiscus × rosa-sinensis">
<text>Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis, known colloquially as Chinese hibiscus, China rose, Hawaiian hibiscus, rose mallow and shoeblack plant, is a cultigen of tropical hibiscus, a flowering plant in the Hibisceae tribe of the family Malvaceae. It is an artificial hybrid created in cultivation in pre-European times by Polynesians in the west Pacific from the species &quot;Hibiscus cooperi&quot; and &quot;H. kaute&quot;. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in the tropics and subtropics. 
== Description ==
=== Tree and leaves ===
&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is a bushy, evergreen shrub or small tree growing tall and wide. The plant has a branched taproot. Its stem is aerial, erect, green, cylindrical, and branched.

Its leaves are simple and petiolate, with alternate phyllotaxy. The leaf shape is ovate while the tip is acute, and the margin is serrated. Venation is unicostate reticulate, meaning the leaves&#x27; veins are branched or divergent. Their surfaces are glossy. Free lateral stipules are present.

=== Flowers ===
Its flowers bloom in summer and autumn. They are solitary (axillary) and symmetrical. They are typically red, with five petals in diameter, with prominent orange-tipped red anthers. Cultivars and hybrids have flowers in a variety of colors as well as red: white, pink, orange, peach, yellow, blue, and purple. Some plants have double flowers.
At the bottom of every hibiscus bud is the calyx, which is green in color. The pointed ends of the calyx are called the sepals. When the hibiscus begins to bloom, the flower&#x27;s petals begin to grow. 

Each hibiscus flower has both male and female parts. The ovary and other female parts of the flower lie in the main structure of the hibiscus: the pistil, which is long and tubular. The five &quot;hairy&quot; spots at the top of the pistil make up the stigma, which is where pollen is collected. In the middle of the pistil is the style, which is the tube down which pollen travels to the ovary. The ovary lies at the bottom of the blossom, and each hibiscus has only one superior ovary. The male part of the flower, called the stamen, consists of stem-like filaments and anthers. Each filament ends with the pollen-producing anther.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; was first described as a species in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. His description was based on specimens with double bright red flowers in cultivation in the Indian subcontinent and Indonesia. The specific epithet &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; literally means &quot;rose of China&quot;, although the plant is not closely related to true roses, nor is it from China. The genus &quot;Hibiscus&quot; is in the tribe Hibisceae and the subfamily Malvoideae of the family Malvaceae. The origin of the species has long been unknown; it has never been found out of cultivation. A study in 2024 based on molecular and morphological data showed that it is a hybrid created in cultivation by Polynesians through a cross between &quot;Hibiscus cooperi&quot; and &quot;Hibiscus kaute&quot;. The parent species were originally from Vanuatu and Tahiti respectively. The natural distributions of the parents are more than apart. &quot;H. kaute&quot; was important in Polynesian culture and medicine, which appears to have led to it being taken across the south Pacific, where it eventually hybridized with &quot;H. cooperi&quot;.

=== Genetics ===
&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is one of many plants with a genetic characteristic known as polyploidy, a condition in which there are more than two complete sets of chromosomes. A result of polyploidy is that the phenotype of a plant&#x27;s offspring may be quite different from the parent plant, or indeed any ancestor, essentially allowing possibly random expression of any (or all) of the characteristics of previous generations. Because of this characteristic, &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; has become popular with hobbyists who cross and recross varieties, creating new varieties. Competitions are held to exhibit and judge the many resulting new seedlings and often strikingly unique flowers.

== Ecology ==
Despite its size and colorful hues which are typically attractive to nectarivore birds, the flowers of &quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; are not visited regularly by hummingbirds when grown in the Neotropics. Generalist species, like the sapphire-spangled emerald (&quot;Amazilia lactea),&quot; or long-billed species, like the stripe-breasted starthroat (&quot;Heliomaster squamosus&quot;) are occasionally seen to visit the flowers. In the subtropical and temperate Americas, hummingbirds are regularly attracted to hibiscus.

The endangered &quot;Papilio homerus&quot; butterfly, the largest in the western hemisphere, is known to feed on the nectar of &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot;. 
== Cultivation ==
&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is widely grown as an ornamental plant throughout the tropics and subtropics. As it does not tolerate temperatures below , in temperate regions it is best grown under glass. Plants grown in containers may be placed outside during the summer months and moved into shelter during the winter months.

Numerous cultivars exist, with flower colors ranging from white through yellow and orange to scarlet and shades of pink, with both single and double sets of petals. The cultivar &#x27;Cooperi&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==

The flowers of &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; are edible and are used in salads in the Pacific Islands. The flower is used as an accessory, particularly as a hairpiece. It is also used to shine shoes in certain parts of India, hence the common name &quot;shoeblack plant&quot;. In Indonesia and Malaysia, these flowers are called &quot;kembang sepatu&quot; or &quot;bunga sepatu&quot;, which literally means &quot;shoe flower&quot;. The flower can also be used as a pH indicator; when used, the flower turns acidic solutions to a dark pink or magenta color and turns basic solutions to green. In several countries the flowers are dried to use in a beverage, usually tea.

&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is considered to have a number of medical uses in Chinese herbology. Traditional uses in China have been to make a black shoe-polish from its flower petals, or to make a woman&#x27;s black hair dye. The flowers are also used in parts of China to color various intoxicating liquors. The plant may have some potential in cosmetic skin care; for example, an extract from the flowers of &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; has been shown to function as an anti-solar agent by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.

== In culture ==

&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is the national flower of Malaysia, called &quot;bunga raya&quot; in Malay. This can be translated in a number of ways, including &quot;great flower&quot; or &quot;celebratory flower.&quot; Introduced into the Malay Peninsula in the 12th century, it was nominated as the national flower in the year 1958 by the Ministry of Agriculture amongst a few other flowers, namely ylang ylang, jasmine, lotus, rose, magnolia, and medlar. On July 28, 1960, it was declared by the government of Malaysia that &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; would be the national flower. The red of the petals symbolizes the courage, life, and rapid growth of the Malaysian people, and the five petals represent the five &quot;Rukun Negara&quot; of Malaysia. The flower can be found imprinted on the notes and coins of the Malaysian ringgit.

&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is an unofficial national flower in Haiti, where it has been used as a symbol for the promotion of tourism. The flower is also the symbol of the Fusion of Haitian Social Democrats political party. It is known in Haitian Creole language as &quot;choeblack&quot; or &quot;rose kayenn&quot;. 

Red hibiscus flowers are also used for worship; in Hinduism, they are used for the worship of Devi, and in the Bengal area of eastern India, they are used to worship Kali. The hibiscus also has an important part in tantra. 

=== Stamps ===
*In March 1987, DPR Korea issued a postage stamp depicting &quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot;.
*On October 7, 2012, Sri Lanka issued a stamp set of four, one of which depicted a &quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; flower.

<doc id="507070" wikidata="Q593068" url="?curid=507070" title="Head voice">
<text>Head voice is a term used within vocal music. The use of this term varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regard to this term. Head voice can be used in relation to the following:
* A particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register
* A vocal resonance area 
* A specific vocal timbre

==History==
The term goes back at least as far as the Roman tradition of rhetorical instruction. Quintilian (ca. AD 95) recommends teaching students &quot;ut quotiens exclamandum erit lateris conatus sit ille, non capitis&quot; (&quot;that when the voice has to be raised the effort comes from the lungs and not from the head,&quot; &quot;Inst.&quot; 1.11.8, transl. Russell). The first recorded mention of the term in a musical context was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the throat and the chest voice (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely head voice referred to the falsetto register) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia. The term was later adopted within bel canto, the Italian opera singing method, where it was identified as the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passaggio and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal instructors today.

However, as knowledge of human physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal instructors have redefined or even abandoned the use of the term head voice. In particular, the use of the term head register has become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function. For this reason, many vocal instructors argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the head. The vibratory sensations that are felt in the head are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal instructors prefer the term &quot;head voice&quot; over the term &quot;head register.&quot; These vocal instructors also hold that many of the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the controversy over this terminology. Also, the term head register is not used within speech pathology and is not one of the four main vocal registers identified by speech pathologists.
The following is an overview of the two predominant views on head voice within vocal pedagogy.

==Differing views on head voice==

===Head voice and vocal registration===
One prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women&#x27;s voices into three registers. Men&#x27;s voices are divided into &quot;chest register&quot;, &quot;head register&quot;, and &quot;falsetto register&quot; and women&#x27;s voices into &quot;chest register&quot;, &quot;middle register&quot;, and &quot;head register&quot;. According to this practice, singing in the head register feels to the singer as if the tone is resonating in their head (rather than primarily in the chest or throat). According to an early 20th-century book written by David Clippinger, all voices have a head register, whether bass or soprano.

Clippinger claims that males and females switch registers at the same absolute pitches. He also states that at about E or E above middle C, the tenor passes from what is usually called open to covered tone, but which might better be called from chest to head voice. At the same absolute pitches, the alto or soprano passes from the chest to the middle register. According to Clippinger, there is every reason to believe that the change in the mechanism for male voices into head register is the same as that which occurs in the female voice as it goes into the middle register at the same pitches.

The contemporary vocal pedagogy instructor Bill Martin seconds the view that the change from chest voice to head voice occurs at around E4 in all voices, including the bass, but Martin states that in the coloratura soprano, it is more likely to occur at F4. A recent book by a former teacher at Oberlin College Conservatory of Music and a vocal pedagogy teacher, Richard Miller, states that in the &quot;tenore lirico,&quot; the higher part of the singing voice above the secondo passaggio at G4 extending upwards is referred to as &quot;full voice in head,&quot; or &quot;voce piena in testa&quot;, effectively stating the head register begins at G4 in the &quot;tenore lirico,&quot; not at E4. According to Singing For Dummies, the bass changes from chest voice into middle voice around A3 or A3 below Middle C and changes into his head voice around D4 or C4 above Middle C.

In the head register (which is above the chest register), some of the bottom end leaves the voice, but it&#x27;s still, according to Martin, a voice capable of much power.

Explanations for the physiological mechanisms behind the head voice can alter from voice teacher to voice teacher. This is because, according to Clippinger, &quot;In discussing the head voice it is the purpose to avoid as much as possible the mechanical construction of the instrument&quot;.

However, not all vocal teachers agree with this view. Thomas Appell&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Can You Sing a HIGH C Without Straining?&quot; aimed to refute the theory that all singers switch registers at the same absolute pitch. Appell defined chest voice as resonance below the vocal folds and head voice as resonance above the vocal folds. He recorded examples of male and female singers changing from chest voice to head voice at different pitches in an attempt to prove that the transition pitch is a function of the intensity of the vocal tone and is not absolute. At higher vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be higher. At lower vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be lower.

===Head voice and vocal resonation===

This view is that since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in the head are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal instructors prefer the term &quot;head voice&quot; over the term register and divide the human voice into four registers: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is more consistent with modern understandings of human physiology and in keeping with stroboscope videos of laryngeal function during vocal phonation.
Tarneaud says, &quot;during singing, the vibration of the vocal folds impresses periodic shakes on the laryngeal cartilage which transmits them to the bones in the thorax via the laryngeal depressors, and to the bony structures in the head via the laryngeal elevators. Singers feel these shakes in the form of thoracic and facial vibrations&quot;. These internal phonatory sensations produced by laryngeal vibrations are called &quot;resonance&quot; by singers and teachers of singing.
There are seven parts of the human body that act as resonators, and of those seven, the three most effective resonators that help amplify and create the most pleasing sounds are all located in the head: the pharynx, the oral cavity, and the nasal cavity.

===Not falsetto===
Resonances and registration aside, the term &quot;head voice&quot; is commonly used to mean &quot;high notes that are not falsetto or strained&quot;. For example, when Pavarotti, Stevie Wonder or Bill Withers slide from chest voice to a tenor high C (C5) in full, balanced voice, this is referred to as &quot;head voice&quot;. (Pavarotti&#x27;s range was C♯3 to F5, but beyond D5 (E♭5 to F5) he sang in a strong or reinforced falsetto.)

Beginning singers who have difficulty controlling their vocal break need to be taught to eliminate or control the physiological conditions associated with falsetto or strain in a process called &quot;head voice.&quot; A strong falsetto is called a reinforced falsetto and a very light head voice is called &quot;voce di testa bianca&quot; or &quot;white head voice.&quot;

High notes that are sung with balanced physiology do tend to have better resonance than falsetto or strained notes, so this definition doesn&#x27;t usually contradict the other two.

<doc id="507071" wikidata="Q13561011" url="?curid=507071" title="Leave of absence">
<text>The labour law concept of leave, specifically paid leave or, in some countries&#x27; long-form, a leave of absence, is an authorised prolonged absence from work, for any reason authorised by the workplace. When people &quot;take leave&quot; in this way, they are usually taking days off from their work that have been pre-approved by their employer in their contracts of employment. Labour laws normally mandate that these paid-leave days be compensated at either 100% of normal pay, or at a very high percentage of normal days&#x27; pay, such as 75% or 80%. A furlough is a type of leave.

There are many subcategories of paid leave, usually dependent on the reasons why the leave is being taken. Sick leave is normally compensated at 100% of pay, while other types of leave are often more restrictive, such as only compensating a certain percentage of normal pay, or as regards paid holidays, which in some countries are granted automatically by national governments, such as in most European Union countries, and in others, such as the United States, are a matter of employment contracts or labor union agreements, as well as state or local law.

The internationally acknowledged definition of paid leave, in international labour law as observed by the International Labour Organisation and others, is one that restricts itself only to pre-approved labour agreements in the workplace.

==India==
In India, a Government service holder under the Union Government or any Provincial (State) Government can avail the following types of leave of absence during the service period:
* Earned leave: Leave of absence which is earned by the employee by dint of period of duty in service but usually credited in advance to the leave account in two installments per year at a rate 2.5 days per month (30 days per year) . The leaves, if not availed, get accumulated up to 300 days, but no more and also the employee remains entitled to a cash equivalent of the 80 days of such leaves not availed on the day of retirement from service.
* Half pay leave: All Government servants are entitled to 20 days of HPL for every completed year of service with all kinds of availed leaves included in the concerned year. These leaves get accumulated, if not availed without limit and credited in advance in two installments every year. They are the basis of calculation of commuted leave available to the employee after completion of one year of service.
* Commuted leave: Two half pay leaves due can be commuted to one fully paid commuted leave. Commuted leave not exceeding half the amount of half-pay leave due at any point of time can be taken on certified medical ground. Whereas 90 days of commuted leave can be availed during the entire service period without any certified medical ground.
* Leave not due: This leave of absence can be availed by an employee in the same manner as that of commuted leave but in advance under good faith on the part of the sanctioning authority that the employee shall clear the debt by accumulation of half pay leave through subsequent years of service till his retirement. Such leave is limited up to a maximum of 180 days at a stretch and 360 days in the entire service life.
* Parental leave (maternity leave, paternity leave)
* Study leave: Maximum three years available after completion of at least five years of service.
* Extra ordinary leave: Leave when no salary is to be given to the employee because he will be or was absent. This leave is granted to regularize unexplained absence resulting into discontinuation of service or can be opted by an employee when he needs a break and takes time off from duty.
* Casual leave: This leave is not strictly a leave because the employee is considered to be on duty and responsible.
* Child care leave
* Hospital leave
* Vacation department staff leave: Employees who work in departments where yearly seasonal vacation is admissible cannot earn leave. Other leaves are applicable.
* Special disability leave
* Child adoption leave
* Educational leave of absence: Leave of absence to continue schooling or complete a degree.

==Unpaid leave==
Unpaid leave is leave that is granted exceptionally by the workplace and that is given permission to occur by the workplace, but is not compensated.

<text>Ardwight Chamberlain (sometimes credited as R.D. Chamberlain or R. Dwight; born February 16, 1957) is an American voice actor and screen writer currently living in Los Angeles, California. He is best known as the voice of Vorlon Ambassador Kosh on the science-fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He has also written a number of episodes for the animated TV show &quot;Digimon: Digital Monsters&quot;, has appeared on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, and has written and provided voices for the English dubbed versions of several Japanese anime.

Chamberlain did the voice for both Kosh (a main cast member of the series) and Ulkesh in the Babylon 5 series starting in 1994 until 1997, totaling 20 episodes. Although he has been &quot;the voice&quot; of Kosh, the man underneath the encounter suit was Jeffrey Willerth.

He provides the voice for the character of Nicolai (Nicolas) Conrad in the English language version of the video game &quot;Shadow Hearts: Covenant&quot; (2004).

<text>Baron Sandford is a title that has been created twice, both times in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in 1891 when Sir Francis Sandford, a civil servant who played an important role in the implementation of the Elementary Education Act 1870, was made Baron Sandford, of Sandford in the County of Salop. He was the son of Sir Daniel Sandford, politician and Greek scholar, the grandson of the Right Reverend Daniel Sandford, Bishop of Edinburgh, the brother of Daniel Sandford, Bishop of Tasmania, and the first cousin of the Right Reverend Charles Sandford, Bishop of Gibraltar. He was childless and the title became extinct on his death in 1893.

The second creation came in 1945 when the Conservative politician Sir James Edmondson was created Baron Sandford, of Banbury in the County of Oxford. Lord Sandford was son of James Edmondson who amassed a fortune building new communities in the London commuter belt. The family had originally been farmers in Cumbria. Lord Sandford had previously represented Banbury in the House of Commons and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 1939 to 1942 and as Treasurer of the Household from 1942 to 1945. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He at first served in the Royal Navy but later became a priest. Lord Sandford also served in minor positions in the Conservative government of Edward Heath. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the third Baron, who succeeded in 2009.

==Barons Sandford; First Creation (1891)==
*Francis Richard John Sandford, 1st Baron Sandford (1824–1893)

==Barons Sandford; Second Creation (1945)==
*(Albert) James Edmondson, 1st Baron Sandford (1886–1959)
*John Cyril Edmondson, 2nd Baron Sandford (1920–2009)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son the Hon. Devon John Edmondson (b. 1986)

<text>Baron Silkin, of Dulwich in the County of London, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 4 July 1950 for the solicitor and Labour politician Lewis Silkin. The peerage was disclaimed by both his eldest son, the second Baron, and the latter&#x27;s nephew, the third Baron. When the third Baron disclaimed the title in 2002, the barony of Silkin became the first peerage ever to be disclaimed twice; and the only disclaimer since the House of Lords Act 1999 (which excluded hereditary peers from automatically sitting in the House of Lords and thereby made such peers eligible to sit in the Commons, the main purpose for the 1963 Act.)

Samuel Silkin, Baron Silkin of Dulwich and John Silkin, younger sons of the first Baron, were also prominent Labour politicians. Lord Silkin of Dulwich was the father of Christopher Silkin, disclaimed third Baron Silkin.

<text>Khan Market is a shopping district and retail market in New Delhi, India. It was established in 1951 by the newly constituted Republic of India&#x27;s Rehabilitation Ministry to give economic opportunities to refugees of the Partition of India, especially those from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province in Pakistan. Many such refugees had arrived in the Delhi region. It is named after Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, also known as Dr. Khan Sahib, who was the Chief Minister of NWFP from 1945 to 1947, and who had helped many refugees to escape without harm. Khan was the elder brother of the Pashtun- and Indian-freedom activist Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan (&quot;Frontier Gandhi&quot;). In 2019, Khan Market was rated as the world&#x27;s 20th most expensive commercial street by Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

==History==

Established in 1951, the U-shaped, double-storey market complex originally had 154 shops and 74 flats on the first floor for shopkeepers. Many of these shops were allocated as seed land to immigrants from the North-West Frontier Province after the partition of India, Khan Market is named in honor of Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, a Pashtun political and spiritual leader.

Nearby is Sujan Singh Park, New Delhi&#x27;s first apartment complex, built in 1945, and designed by Walter Sykes George and named after the grandfather of this enclave&#x27;s most famous resident, writer Khushwant Singh. George also designed, the Ambassador Hotel next door, built in 1945 in a mix of British and Art Deco style. The building is now a heritage property and the hotel has been taken over by the Taj Vivanta chain.

Until the 1980s, all the flats on the first floor continued to serve as homes. Neighbourhood grocery stores and middle-class shops existed in the middle lane, despite the fact it catered most up to upmarket Golf Links, Sundar Nagar, and diplomatic crowd from Chanakyapuri. Gradually, the real estate boom and expanding families of the first generation of occupants forced many families to move out. Thus these homes were sold and started being converted into shops. By the 2010s, only a few families were living in these two-room flats.

A 2011 Cushman &amp; Wakefield survey ranked Khan Market as the world&#x27;s 21st most expensive shopping street.

==Overview==
Today it has grown to become one of the most expensive commercial real estate locations in the city. It has a wide variety of stores, including modern showrooms of most of well-known brands, silver jewellery stores, delicatessens, bookstores, paints and hardware stores, electronics, kitchenware, and fabric stores mingle with some of the better restaurants.

It is also famous for food including kebabs and gol guppe (a type of popular street food) and a retail market for lighting fixtures on the ground floor. There are several bookstores in the market

==Location==

Khan Market is almost in the heart of the city, close to India Gate. It is surrounded by residential complexes — government owned and private — including Golf Links, Lodi Estate, Shahjahan Road, Pandara Road, Rabindra Nagar and Sujan Singh Park. Its environs are home to a significant number of bureaucrats from the central government (including some MPs from both the houses), and famous people like the satirist Khushwant Singh. It is one of the greenest pockets of the city, very close to the famed Lodi Gardens. Also in proximity are the India International Centre, the India Habitat Centre, offices of the World Wide Fund for Nature, and other organizations. Nearby the Khan Market are popular schools such as Sardar Patel Vidyalaya and The Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School.

==Transport==
It is serviced by the Khan Market underground station of the Delhi Metro (Violet Line), which lies in front of the Taj Vivanta Hotel. There are four exits of the metro station namely Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3 and Gate 4. The exit at Gate 4 leads to Khan Market.

<doc id="507092" wikidata="Q1507644" url="?curid=507092" title="South of Market, San Francisco">
<text>South of Market (SoMa) is a neighborhood in San Francisco, California, situated just south of Market Street. It contains several sub-neighborhoods including South Beach, Yerba Buena, and Rincon Hill.

SoMa is home to many of the city&#x27;s museums, to the headquarters of several major software and Internet companies, and to the Moscone Conference Center.

==Name and location==
The area&#x27;s boundaries are Market Street to the northwest, San Francisco Bay to the northeast, Mission Creek to the southeast, and Division Street, 13th Street and U.S. Route 101 (Central Freeway) to the southwest. It is the part of the city in which the street grid runs parallel and perpendicular to Market Street. The neighborhood includes many smaller sub-neighborhoods such as: South Park, Yerba Buena, South Beach, and Financial District South (part of the Financial District), and overlaps with several others, notably Mission Bay, and the Mission District.

As with many neighborhoods, the precise boundaries of the South of Market area are fuzzy and can vary widely depending on the authority cited. From 1848 until the construction of the Central Freeway in the 1950s, 9th Street (formerly known as Johnston Street) was the official (and generally recognized) boundary between SoMa and the Mission District. Since the 1950s, the boundary has been either 10th Street, 11th Street, or the Central Freeway. Similarly, the entire Mission Bay neighborhood may or may not be counted as part of SoMa, Excluding the entire Mission Bay neighborhood puts the southeastern boundary at Townsend. Redevelopment agencies, social service agencies, and community activists frequently exclude the more prosperous areas between the waterfront and 3rd Street. Some social service agencies and nonprofits count the economically distressed area around 6th, 7th, and 8th streets as part of the Mid-Market Corridor. 

The terms &quot;South of Market&quot; and &quot;SoMa&quot; refer to both a comparatively large district of the city as well as a much smaller neighborhood.

While many San Franciscans refer to the neighborhood by its full name, South of Market, there is a trend to shorten the name to SOMA or SoMa, probably in reference to SoHo (South of Houston) in New York City, and, in turn, Soho in London.

Before being called South of Market this area was called &quot;South of the Slot&quot;, a reference to the cable cars that ran up and down Market along the slots through which they gripped cables. While the cable cars have long since disappeared from Market Street, some &quot;old timers&quot; still refer to this area as &quot;South of the Slot&quot;.

Since 1847, the official name of the South of Market area has been the &quot;100 Vara Survey&quot; (alternately &quot;100 Vara District&quot;) or simply &quot;100 Vara&quot; for short (with &quot;100&quot; sometimes spelled out). The &quot;100 Vara Survey&quot; derived its name from the surface area of the single lots which comprised 100 by 100 varas (275 square feet).

According to city documents from 1945, the &quot;100 Vara District&quot; goes from the south side of Market Street to the Ferry. The name is found mainly in history books, legal documents, title deeds, and civil engineering reports.

==History==
In 1847, Washington A. Bartlett, alcalde (magistrate) of the pueblo (village) of San Francisco, commissioned surveyor Jasper O&#x27;Farrell to extend the boundaries of the pueblo in a southerly direction by creating a new subdivision. At the time, the streets of San Francisco were aligned approximately with the compass points, running north to south, or east to west. Each block was divided into six lots 50 varas on a side. (A vara is about .) O&#x27;Farrell decided that the streets in the new subdivision should run parallel with or perpendicular to the only existing road in the area, Mission Road (later Mission Street), and thus be aligned with the half-points of the compass, i.e., northeast to southwest, and northwest to southeast. He also decided to make the new blocks twice as long and twice as wide, with each lot 100 varas on a side. Finally, O&#x27;Farrell created &quot;a grand promenade&quot; linking the old pueblo with the new subdivision, Market Street. Since then, downtown San Francisco north of Lower Market Street has been officially known as 50 Vara, while the South of Market area is officially known as 100 Vara.

During the mid-19th century, SOMA became a burgeoning pioneer community, consisting largely of low-density residential buildings, except for a business district that developed along 2nd and 3rd streets, and emerging industrial areas near the waterfront. Rincon Hill became an enclave for the wealthy, while nearby South Park became an enclave for the upper middle class. By the early 20th century, heavy industrial development due to its proximity to the docks of San Francisco Bay, coupled with the advent of cable cars, had driven the wealthy over to Nob Hill and points west. The neighborhood became a largely working-class and lower-middle-class community of recent European immigrants, sweatshops, power stations, flophouses, and factories.

The 1906 earthquake completely destroyed the area, and many of the quake&#x27;s fatalities occurred there. Following the quake, the area was rebuilt with wider than usual streets, as the focus was on the development of light to heavy industry. The construction of the Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 101 during the 1930s saw large swaths of the area demolished, including most of the original Rincon Hill.

From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, the South of Market area was served by several streetcar lines owned by the Market Street Railway Company, including the No. 14 Mission Street electric railway line, the No. 27 Bryant Street line, the 28 Harrison, 35 Howard, 36 Folsom, 41 Second and Market, and the No. 42 First and Fifth Street line.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, South of Market was home not only to warehousing and light industry, but also to a sizable population of transients, seamen, other working men living in hotels, and a working-class residential population in old Victorian buildings on smaller side streets and alleyways giving it a &quot;skid row&quot; reputation.

The waterfront redevelopment of the Embarcadero in the 1950s pushed a new population into this area in the 1960s, the incipient gay community, and the leather community in particular. The Tool Box at 399 Forth Street was the first leather bar in South of Market, opening in 1962. From 1962 until 1982, the gay leather community grew and thrived throughout South of Market, most visibly along Folsom Street, since it was a warehouse area that was largely deserted at night. Site of various sex clubs and bars, such as the Caldron and the Slot, it was the sexual center of San Francisco during this period. This community had been active in resisting the city&#x27;s ambitious redevelopment program for the area throughout the 1970s. But as the AIDS epidemic unfolded in the 1980s, the ability of this community to stand up to downtown and City Hall was dramatically weakened. The crisis became an opportunity for the city (in the name of public health) to close bathhouses and regulate bars - businesses that had been the cornerstone of the community&#x27;s efforts to maintain a gay space in the South of Market neighborhood.

In 1984, as these spaces for the gay community were rapidly closing, a coalition of housing activists and community organizers started the Folsom Street Fair, in order to enhance the visibility of the community at a time when people in City Hall and elsewhere were apt to think it had gone away. The fair also provided a means for much-needed fundraising, and created opportunities for members of the leather community to connect to services and vital information (e.g., regarding safer sex) which bathhouses and bars might otherwise have been ideally situated to distribute.

Redevelopment plans were first outlined in 1953. These plans began to be realized in the late 1970s and in the early 1980s with the construction of the conference center, Moscone Center, which occupies three blocks and hosts many major trade shows. Moscone South opened its doors in December 1981. Moscone North opened in May 1992, and most recently Moscone West in June 2003.

With the opening of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1995, the Mission and Howard Street area of the South of Market has become a hub for museums and performances spaces. Intersection for the Arts is also based in the neighborhood, a non-profit which supports local Bay Area artists. The San Francisco institution was founded in 1965 in the Tenderloin, but has moved within the city to its current location in SoMa. Intersection supports the arts by offering local artists resources, fiscal sponsorship, and exhibition and performance spaces.

The area has long been home to bars and nightclubs. During the 1980s and 1990s, some of the warehouses there served as the home to the city&#x27;s budding underground rave, punk, and independent music scene. However, in recent decades, and mostly due to gentrification and rising rents, these establishments have begun to cater to an upscale and mainstream clientele that subsequently pushed out the underground musicians and their scene. Beginning in the 1990s, older housing stock has been joined by loft-style condominiums. Many of these were built under the cover of &quot;live-work&quot; development ostensibly meant to maintain a studio arts community in San Francisco. During the late 1990s, the occupant of the &quot;live-work&quot; loft was more likely to be a &quot;dot-commie&quot;, as South of Market became a local center of the dot-com boom, due to its central location, space for infill housing development, and spaces readily converted into offices.


A major transformation of the neighborhood was conceived during the 2000s with the Transbay Terminal Replacement Project, which broke ground in August 2010 and opened in August 2018. In addition, new high rise residential projects like One Rincon Hill, 300 Spear Street, and Millennium Tower are transforming the San Francisco skyline. In 2005, the Transbay Joint Powers Authority proposed to raise height limits around the new Transbay Terminal. This led to proposals for more supertall buildings, such as Renzo Piano&#x27;s proposal for a group of towers that includes two 1,200-foot. (366 m) towers, two 900-foot (274 m) towers, and a 600-foot (183 m) tower. The 1,200-foot (366 m) towers would have been the tallest buildings in the United States outside of New York City and Chicago. Renzo Piano&#x27;s complex has since been canceled, and replaced by a newer project entitled 50 First Street, to be designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM). In addition, the Cesar Pelli and Hines Group have also proposed another 1,070-foot (366 m), 61-story office tower. The Salesforce Tower, formerly named the Transbay Tower, was completed May 2018.

==Economy==
The neighborhood consists of warehouses, auto repair shops, nightclubs, residential hotels, art spaces, loft apartments, furniture showrooms, condominiums and technology companies. A major children&#x27;s park was also built for the area on top of Moscone South. The park features a large play area, an ice skating rink, a bowling alley, a restaurant, the Children&#x27;s Creativity Museum and the restored carousel from Playland-At-the-Beach. The children&#x27;s park and Children&#x27;s Creativity Museum are joined to the Yerba Buena Gardens by a footbridge.

===Businesses===
Many major software and technology companies have headquarters and offices here, including Ustream, Planet Labs, Foursquare, Cloudflare, Wikia, Wired, GitHub, Pinterest, CBS Interactive, LinkedIn, Trulia, Dropbox, IGN, Salesforce, BitTorrent Inc., Yelp, Zynga, Airbnb, Uber, Advent Software, Pac-12 Networks, and Yeti. The area is also home to the few big-box stores within San Francisco.

===Public health===
The South of Market Health Center ensured health care access to comprehensive care by providing mental and physical health problem services to close the gap on health disparities. It provides agencies with programs including finances, health care, food assistance or job training. In terms of sexual health, the district&#x27;s San Francisco City Clinic offers sexually transmitted disease (STD) tests and treatment, in addition to counseling and condoms.

211 United Way Bay Area is a service that connects callers with services and programs: including basic needs, physical and mental health, employment assistance, and seniors support.

===Miscellaneous attractions===
The local Academy of Art University owns several buildings in the neighborhood, primarily for academic and administrative purposes.

SOMA is home to many of San Francisco&#x27;s museums, including San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the Museum of the African Diaspora, the American Bookbinders Museum, the California Historical Society, the Zeum, and the Contemporary Jewish Museum. The Old Mint, which served as the San Francisco Mint from 1874 to 1937, was restored over an eight-year period and reopened to the public in 2012. The Center for the Arts, along with Yerba Buena Gardens and the Metreon, is built on top of Moscone North.

SOMArts, one of four cultural center facilities owned by the City and County of San Francisco, is located on Brannan Street between 8th and 9th streets.

Many small theater companies and venues are situated in the SOMA, including the Lamplighters, The Garage, Theatre Rhinoceros, Boxcar Theater, Crowded Fire Theater, and FoolsFURY Theater.

===Events===
Due to the area&#x27;s gay rights history, the Folsom Street Fair is held on Folsom St between 7th and 12th Streets (now between 8th and 13th Streets). The smaller and less-commercialized leather subculture-oriented Up Your Alley Fair (commonly referred to as the Dore Alley Fair) is held in late July on and around Folsom St. Also home to the annual How Weird Street Faire featuring dancing and costumes, held in early May along seven city blocks including Howard and Second streets.

Several Filipino cultural events are held such as Filipino American History Month Celebration at the Asian Art Museum in October and Pistahan Parade and Festival in August.

Undiscovered SF, held monthly, promotes economic activity and awareness of SoMa Pilipinas. It supports retail concepts, restaurants, and businesses by giving skill-set building workshops and professional services like accounting and crowdfunding to prepare businesses for growth and sustainability.

===Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District===
The Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District was created in SoMa in 2018. The area is bounded approximately by Howard St. on the northwest, 7th St. on the northeast, I-80 on the east and US 101 on the south. There is also an exclave between 5th and 6th streets, Harrison and Bryant. It includes the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, which opened in 2017.

===SoMa Pilipinas===
In April 2016, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution that established the SOMA Pilipinas Filipino Cultural Heritage District. The relationship between SOMA Pilipinas and the Philippines is established in the resolution: &quot;Whereas, Filipino immigration patterns to San Francisco are rooted in the conquest and subsequent colonization of the Philippines by the United States in 1898, the American colonial regime in the Philippines from 1899-1946, and ongoing, often unequal and imperialist US-Philippines relations from 1946 to present.&quot; The City of San Francisco certified Tagalog as its third official language in 2014, and a 2010 Census illustrated the Filipino population to reach 36,347 Filipino in the city which 5,106 live in South of Market District. Within the SOMA Pilipinas&#x27; official borders—Market to the north, Brannan to the south, 2nd the east, and 11th to the west—are several streets named after Filipino historical figures, including Rizal, Lapu-Lapu, and Mabini, and are located between Folsom and Harrison Streets. A former Filipino district existed near North Beach, prior to its gentrification, called Manilatown.

<text>Baie-Saint-Paul (; 2021 Population 7,371; UA population 4,308) is a city in the Province of Quebec, Canada, on the northern shore of the St. Lawrence River. Baie-Saint-Paul is the seat of Charlevoix Regional County Municipality. The city is situated at the mouth of the Gouffre River.

The place gained some prominence in the 1770s when Doctor Philippe-Louis-François Badelard named a disease he was researching the &quot;Baie-Saint-Paul maladie&quot;. This illness was the subject of one of the first medical publications done in Lower Canada. It is also where Cirque du Soleil originated back in the early 1980s and the location of the first show using the name Cirque du Soleil during &quot;La Fete Foraine de Baie-Saint-Paul&quot; in 1984.

==History==
The bay was first called &quot;Baie de l&#x27;Ilet&quot; on a map by Pierre Desceliers circa 1550, then &quot;Baie du Gouffre&quot; by Samuel de Champlain in 1632, referring to a whirlpool at the mouth of the Gouffre River at the St. Lawrence. By 1641, the name Baie Saint Paul came in use, and this name appeared in the report of Pierre Boucher to the King of France about the great earthquake of 1663.

The current area of the city was divided between the seigneuries of Côte-de-Beaupré (to the west of the Gouffre River), granted in 1636, and Rivière-du-Gouffre (to the east of the Gouffre River), granted to Pierre Dupré in 1682. Around 1650, the first settlers arrived, making the area one of the first in New France to be colonized. In 1681, the Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul parish was founded, but its canonical erection dates from September 21, 1715.

A visitor in the early 1800s noticed mineral springs and mineral resources in the area.

In 1845, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Pierre et Saint-Paul de la Baie-Saint-Paul was created, but dissolved two years later. It was reestablished in 1855 (its name shortened to Baie-Saint-Paul in 1964). On March 25, 1893, the village itself separated from the parish municipality to form the Village Municipality of Baie Saint-Paul, which changed status to &quot;ville&quot; in 1913, reverted back to village status in 1922, but regained city status in 1961. In 1921, the parish municipality lost more territory when the newly-founded Municipality of Rivière-du-Gouffre was split off.

On January 3, 1996, the Parish Municipality and the City of Baie-Saint-Paul, along with the Municipality of Rivière-du-Gouffre, were joined again into the new City of Baie-Saint-Paul.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the wide and deep valley of the Gouffre River, surrounded by the high peaks of Cap aux Corbeaux, Cap aux Rets, Cran Suzette, and Hospice. Its landscape is characterized by sandbanks, striated mountain slopes, waterfalls, streams, fertile meadows, and sandy terraces.

In addition to the main namesake population centre, the city also contains the hamlets of Saint-Placide-de-Charlevoix (), Saint-Placide-Nord (), and La Mare ().

===Climate===
Baie-Saint Paul has a humid continental climate with vast seasonal differences. Summers are mild and moderated by its proximity to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. In winter, interior Canada influences the climate with frequent cold waves.

<text>Sano Shōichi (佐野 昌一, December 26, 1897 - May 17, 1949), know by his pen name , was a Japanese novelist who was the founding father of Japanese science fiction.

== Biography ==
Unno was born on December 26, 1897, in Tokushima, Tokushima Prefecture, to a family of medical doctors. He studied at the Waseda University.

In 1928 he debuted as a writer with the novel &quot;The case of the mysterious death in the electric bath&quot; (&quot;Denkifuro no kaishijiken&quot;).

During the Pacific War he wrote a great number of science-fiction novels, remaining in Tokyo throughout the air raids. Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II was for him a hard blow, and Unno spent the last years in his life in a state of deep depression. 

His scientific work was influenced by that of Nikola Tesla.

Unno died on May 17, 1949, aged 51.

== Legacy ==
Captain Jūzō Okita of Space Battleship Yamato was named as a tribute to Unno.

<text>Dalnegorsk (, lit. &quot;far in the mountains&quot;) is a town in Primorsky Krai, Russia. Population: 

==Name==
It was formerly known from its founding in 1897 as Tetyukhe (; ; literally meaning &quot;river of wild boars&quot;), until it was renamed in 1973 as part of a campaign to change any Chinese-derived place names in Primorsky Krai.

==History==
The settlement of Tetyukhe was founded in 1897, with the founding of a lead and zinc mine by Swiss immigrant Julius Brynner. Brynner&#x27;s son Boris maintained the right to mine on the site until 1931, one of the longest-running private enterprises in the Soviet Union. Boris Brynner&#x27;s son Yul Brynner later became a famous actor in the United States.
In 1930, Tetyukhe was granted urban-type settlement status. The settlement was renamed in 1973, along with the Tetyukhe River which was renamed Rudnaya, from the Russian word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;ore&quot;. Town status was granted to Dalnegorsk on August 31, 1989.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with seven rural localities, incorporated as Dalnegorsk Town Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Dalnegorsk Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Dalnegorsky Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Most population of the town is employed by two industrial enterprises: JSC &quot;Bor&quot; and JSC &quot;Dalpolimetal&quot;.

Established in 1965, &quot;Bor&quot; is the world&#x27;s largest specialized chemical enterprise. Due to the unique deposits of commercial minerals found in the district, and the high technologies applied, &quot;Bor&quot; successfully operates in the world market and is included in the list of Russia&#x27;s forty most prospective enterprises. Three-quarters of its production is exported to the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, Australia, South Korea, China, and other countries in Europe and Asia.

&quot;Dalpolimetal&quot;, established in 1897, produces 58% of Russia&#x27;s lead. Two-thirds of its production is exported to Japan, China, and South Korea.

Despite the highly developed industrialization of Dalnegorsk, over 90% of the territory under its jurisdiction is covered with Korean Pine and mixed broadleaf forests, both of which attract nature tourism enthusiasts. However, Dalnegorsk residents suffer from serious lead poisoning from an old lead smelter and the unsafe transport of lead concentrate from the local lead mining site. This led the Blacksmith Institute to declare Dalnegorsk and neighboring Rudnaya Pristan in the top ten of worst polluted places on earth. However, according to Anatoly Lebedev, leader of the ecological NGO &quot;BROK&quot;, this inclusion is questionable.

===Transportation===
Dalnegorsk is connected by road to Vladivostok (517 km). The nearest railway station (in Chuguyevka) is located from Dalnegorsk. The nearest sea port is from the town at Rudnaya Pristan.

==Politics==
On October 19, 2006, three days before the elections, Dmitry Fotyanov, the mayoral candidate from the United Russia party who came second in the initial round of elections, was gunned down from fire of a Kalashnikov assault rifle fire. The weapons were located by the police in a minivan that was blown up near the offices of the local newspaper soon after the murder. The run-off election was called off as both remaining candidates agreed to stand down. The United Russia party called Fotyanov&#x27;s death a &quot;political murder&quot;.

<doc id="507100" wikidata="Q531706" url="?curid=507100" title="Fipple">
<text>The term fipple specifies a variety of end-blown flute that includes the flageolet, recorder, and tin whistle. The Hornbostel–Sachs system for classifying musical instruments places this group under the heading &quot;Flutes with duct or duct flutes.&quot; The label &quot;fipple flute&quot; is frequently applied to members of the subgroup but there is no general agreement about the structural detail of the sound-producing mechanism that constitutes the fipple, itself.

==Nomenclature==

The accompanying illustration of the mouthpiece of a recorder shows a wooden block (A) with a channel carved into the body of the instrument (B), together forming a duct that directs a ribbon of air across an opening toward a sharp edge (C). The edge splits the air in a manner that alternately directs it into and outside of the tube, setting the contained column of air into periodic vibration. This flow-controlled &quot;air reed&quot; is a definitive characteristic of all flutes, which therefore all have an edge or equivalent air-splitting device.

As is clear from the Hornbostel-Sachs heading, there are several ways in which a duct can be formed. These include the player&#x27;s lips controlling the stream of air as it is directed to the edge, without mechanical assistance. Common examples of this are the end-blown ney and the side-blown concert flute. The first attested use of the term fipple is in a comparison between the recorder and the transverse flute by Francis Bacon, published in 1626.
By this description, the fipple is a plug that nearly closes one end of the pipe, open only for the duct that &quot;straightens” the channel of air blown axially into the instrument. The solid &quot;stop” near the mouth hole or embouchure on a pipe that is blown transversely is analogous to it. This provides historical justification for using the term &quot;fipple flute&quot; to designate a recorder (cf. the German term &quot;Blockflöte&quot;). Subsequent authors have used the term in that sense but differ in the element of the mechanical aggregate illustrated above that they regard specifically as the fipple. That word is used variously to designate the block, the edge, the full block-duct-edge structure, and the entire instrument. This ambiguity is detailed in the article headed Fipple in &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, which concludes, &quot;Since nobody can agree what the term means, to avoid further confusion its use should be abandoned.&quot; In the text below, what might otherwise be termed a fipple flute is referred to as a duct flute.

==Sound production==
A whistle sound is produced by the interaction between the air reed and the air column in the segment of the instrument that projects just beyond the edge. The dimensions of the entire body of the instrument determine its timbre and pitch. Various additional structural details permit the player to alter both these factors. One example of this is the set of finger holes that laterally pierce the body of a recorder and are opened or closed to change the length of the vibrating air column.

The recorder can be used to illustrate further nuance in the design of duct flutes. By definition, the duct is formed by a channel carved into the body of the instrument, and the block. This passage is alternately termed a windway and ends at an opening referred to as a window, bounded by the edge on the opposite side. This rigid structure affords intrinsically less dynamic and intonational flexibility than does, for example, a transverse flute embouchure. This can be offset by other structural details. In the case of the recorder, their presence or absence often differentiates between mass-produced and artisan-built instruments. In a broader context, the difference between one type of duct flute and another is determined both by gross and finer structural detail.

==History==

Duct flutes have a long history: an example of an Iron Age specimen, made from a sheep bone, exists in Leeds City Museum.

L.E. McCullough notes that the oldest surviving whistles date from the 12th century, but that, &quot;Players of the &quot;feadan&quot; are also mentioned in the description of the King of Ireland&#x27;s court found in Early Irish law dating from the 7th and 8th centuries A.D.&quot;

The Tusculum whistle is a 14-cm whistle with six finger holes, made of brass or bronze, found with pottery dating to the 14th and 15th centuries; it is currently in the collections of the National Museums Scotland.

One of the earliest surviving recorders was discovered in a castle moat in Dordrecht, the Netherlands in 1940, and has been dated to the 14th century. It is largely intact, though not playable. A second more or less intact 14th century recorder was found in a latrine in northern Germany (in Göttingen): other 14th-century examples survive from Esslingen (Germany) and Tartu (Estonia). There is a fragment of a possible 14th-15th-century bone recorder in Rhodes (Greece); and there is an intact 15th-century example from Elblag (Poland).

==Duct flutes==

The following flutes have a duct structure:
*Bangsi Alas
*Diple (or dvojnice)
*Flabiol 
*Flageolet (forerunner of the tin whistle)
*Fujara
*Hydraulophone
*Khloy
*Khlui
*Kuisi
*Several Indigenous American flutes, including the double chamber instrument commonly known as the Native American Flute, the latter usually have an edge slanted toward the inside of the instrument, and a primary air chamber before the constricted air canal or windway, created with a separate mobile piece tied to the instrument&#x27;s body, an external block, making a roof instead of a floor for the windway.
*Ocarinas, and among them the Gemshorn 
*Flue pipes of the pipe organ
*Pipe (as with tabor)
*Recorder
*Salamuri 
*Shvi
*Slide whistle (aka swanee or swannee whistle, piston flute, jazz flute)
*Sopilka, Ukrainian folk instruments with several variants, including twin-piped instruments (superficially resembling the aulos) and modern &quot;chromatic&quot; instruments with 10 holes
*Souravli
*Spilåpipa
*Stabule
*Telenka, Ukrainian overtone flute
*Tin whistle (or penny whistle)
*Txistu
*Frula

<doc id="507103" wikidata="Q984441" url="?curid=507103" title="Bochō Yamamura">
<text>was a Japanese writer, poet and songwriter.

Bochō was born Tsuchida Hakkujū to a peasant family in present-day Takasaki, Gunma and struggled to become educated; his family&#x27;s poverty prevented him from finishing elementary school. Nevertheless, he continued to study and educate himself to the point where he was hired to teaching at his former primary school as the age of fifteen. In 1902 he converted to Anglicanism, though some scholars have suggested he did so in order to gain access to a university education. He gained the public&#x27;s attention thanks to his acutely sensitive poetry. Suffering from tuberculosis, out of work, and living a sad vagabond life, he kept writing poetry, fairy tales and songs for children with a humanity-filled, warm style. In his last years, he composed a number of simply-worded and yet highly inspirational odes to nature.

Bochō was one of the earliest Japanese writers to be described as a Futurist in a 1916 article by Sakutarō Hagiwara.

<doc id="507106" wikidata="Q8060499" url="?curid=507106" title="Yuji Hayami">
<text>is a Japanese science fiction and fantasy writer.

==Life==
Born in Aomori Prefecture, he started writing in 1982 for &quot;SF Izumu&quot; magazine. Afterwards he collaborated on a number of published works. In 1988 he published his first novel, &quot;Summer Road&quot; (Natsukaidô-Samârôdo), followed by various other fantasy books, often set in large cities or characterized by a surreal streak.

Hayami also worked on a number of novelizations of science fiction or horror manga and anime. In the latter field, his work on the tie-ins for the anime series &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; became so popular that the original characters and situations were in later entries of the series modified to account for his personal additions to the canon.

<doc id="507108" wikidata="Q2289728" url="?curid=507108" title="Royal Crescent">
<text>The Royal Crescent is a row of 30 terraced houses laid out in a sweeping crescent in the city of Bath, England. Designed by the architect John Wood, the Younger, and built between 1767 and 1774, it is among the greatest examples of Georgian architecture to be found in the United Kingdom and is a Grade I listed building. Although some changes have been made to the various interiors over the years, the Georgian stone facade remains much as it was when first built.

The crescent has 114 Ionic columns on the first floor with an entablature in a Palladian style above. It was the first crescent of terraced houses to be built and an example of &quot;&quot; (the country in the city) with its views over the parkland opposite.

Many notable people have either lived or stayed in the Royal Crescent since it was built over 240 years ago, and some are commemorated on special plaques attached to the relevant buildings. Of the crescent&#x27;s 30 townhouses, 10 are still full-size townhouses; 18 have been split into flats of various sizes; One is the No. 1 Royal Crescent museum, and The Royal Crescent Hotel &amp; Spa, at the centre of the crescent, is made up of No. 16 and No.15.

==Design and construction==

The street that is known today as &quot;the Royal Crescent&quot; was originally named &quot;The Crescent.&quot; It is claimed that the adjective &quot;Royal&quot; was added at the end of the 18th century after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany had stayed there. He initially rented number one and later bought number 16. The Royal Crescent is close to Victoria Park and linked via Brock Street to The Circus which had been designed by John Wood, the Elder.

The land on which the Royal Crescent stands was bought from Sir Benet Garrard of the Garrard baronets, who were the landlords, in December 1766. Between 1767 and 1775 John Wood designed the great curved facade with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor. Each original purchaser bought a length of the façade, and then employed their own architect to build a house behind the facade to their own specifications; hence what can appear to be two houses is occasionally just one. This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear and can be seen from the road behind the Crescent: while the front is uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. This architecture, described as &quot;Queen Anne fronts and Mary-Anne backs&quot;, occurs repeatedly in Bath. It was the first crescent of terraced houses to be built and an example of &quot;&quot; (the country in the city) with its views over the parkland opposite.

In front of the Royal Crescent is a ha-ha, a ditch on which the inner side is vertical and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making an effective but invisible partition between the lower and upper lawns. The ha-ha is designed so as not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by. It is not known whether it was contemporary with the building of the Royal Crescent, however it is known that when it was first created it was deeper than it is at present. The railings between the crescent and the lawn were included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage but have been restored and removed from the register.

In 2003, the archaeological television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; dug the Royal Crescent in search of a Roman cemetery and the Fosse Way. The remains of a Roman wall were found behind the crescent and evidence of possible Iron and Bronze Age settlement on the lawn in front.

==History==
In the late 19th century five cast iron lamp columns with decorative scrollwork were added. In 1921, architect Robert Tor Russell used the Crescent as a source of inspiration to design the central business district of Connaught Place, New Delhi, India.

During the Bath Blitz of World War II, known as the Baedecker Raids or Baedeker Blitz, some bomb damage occurred, the most serious being the gutting of numbers 2 and 17 by incendiaries. After World War II, during a period of redevelopment which is described as the &quot;Sack of Bath&quot;, the City Council considered plans that would have seen the Crescent transformed into Council offices. These were unsuccessful.

During the 20th century many of the houses which had formerly been the residences of single families with maids or other staff were divided into flats and offices. However, the tradition of distinguished gentlefolk retiring to the crescent continued. The whole crescent was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1950. Number 16 became a guest house in 1950. In 1971 it was combined with number 15 to become the &quot;Royal Crescent Hotel&quot; occupying the central properties of the Crescent, which were renovated and additional rooms in pavilions and coach houses within the gardens included in the accommodation. It was sold in 1978 to John Tham, the chairman of the London Sloane Club, and restored. It was later purchased by Von Essen Hotels, which became insolvent in 2011. In September 2011 it was expected that London &amp; Regional Properties would purchase the hotel, but negotiations ended in January 2012 without a deal. On 2 April 2012, investment company the Topland Group announced that it had purchased the Royal Crescent Hotel.

In the 1970s the resident of No 22, Miss Amabel Wellesley-Colley, painted her front door yellow instead of the traditional white. Bath City Council issued a notice insisting it should be repainted. A court case ensued which resulted in the Secretary of State for the Environment declaring that the door could remain yellow. Other proposals for alteration and development including floodlighting and a swimming pool have been defeated.

==Notable residents==
The first resident of Number 1 was Thomas Brock, Town Clerk of Chester, for whom Brock Street was named. His sister Elizabeth had married the architect of the Crescent, John Wood, the Younger. Brock&#x27;s first tenant at No. 1 was Henry Sandford, a retired Irish MP who rented the house from 1776 until his death in Bath in 1796. Sandford was described as a &#x27;gentleman of the most benevolent disposition&#x27;. William Wilberforce stayed at Number 2 in 1798. Christopher Anstey, a well-known writer of the time, was resident in number 4 from 1770 until 1805, although the plaque to him is placed on number 5. Jean Baptiste, Vicomte du Barre took over number 8 in 1778 and hosted parties and gambling. He died in a duel on Claverton Down and is buried in the churchyard at the Church of St Nicholas in Bathampton. From 1768 to 1774 number 9 was home to Philip Thicknesse, a soldier of fortune. Number 11 was home to the family of Thomas Linley, a singing-master and conductor of the concerts from 1771. His eldest daughter Elizabeth Ann Linley, a singer in her own right, eloped with the playwright and poet Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The centre house of the crescent (#16) was used as a residence and to host blue stocking events by Elizabeth Montagu.

In the nineteenth century the popularity of the Crescent and &#x27;taking the waters&#x27; at the Roman Baths diminished somewhat. Amongst the residents of Royal Crescent during this time were the electoral reformer Francis Burdett who lived at number 16 from 1814 to 1822 and his daughter Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts. The retired Admiral William Hargood lived at number 9 from 1834 until 1839 and in 1866 the same house was home to Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The jurist and explorer Thomas Falconer briefly lived at number 18 before his death in 1882. A few years later the house next door at number 17 became home to Isaac Pitman who developed the most widely used system of shorthand, now known as Pitman shorthand. English professor George Saintsbury took up residence at number 1A in 1916.

==Current use==
The houses and flats in the Crescent are a mixture of tenures. After World War II when there was a shortage of housing and the city council bought up older properties, including some in Royal Crescent, as public housing to rent out. The Housing Act 1985 changed the succession of Council Houses and facilitated the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit housing associations. Several were subsequently sold into private ownership, however one remains in council ownership.

No. 1 Royal Crescent is a historic house museum, owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through its membership to illustrate how wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have furnished and occupied such a house. It was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, a member of the family that made its fortune through the Clan shipping line. He donated it to the Trust with an amount of money for its restoration and furnishing. The restoration was led by Philip Jebb. The Bath Preservation Trust was working during 2012–13 to re-unite Number One with its original servants&#x27; wing at Number 1A Royal Crescent, which has been in use as a separate dwelling for many years. No. 1 serves as the Trust&#x27;s headquarters. Number 15 and 16 are still used as a hotel.

Bath and North East Somerset council made an order banning coaches and buses from the crescent, after many years of complaints by residents that the tours given to tourists were disruptive, particularly because of the amplified commentary given by tour guides on open top buses.

==Architecture==

The crescent is long and each building is almost high, including small rooms with dormer windows in the attic. The ground floor is plain emphasising the columns and windows of the first floor. The 114 columns are in diameter reaching , each with an entablature deep in a Palladian style. The central house (now the Royal Crescent Hotel) boasts two sets of coupled columns with a single window between them which is the middle of the crescent.

They are built of Bath stone. They have slate roofs but were originally stone tiled. The appearance of each house is very similar with only minor variations between them, for example, some have small balconettes on the first floor. Many of the windows have been restored to their original style with glazing bars rather than the horned plate glass sash windows which had been installed in the 19th or early 20th centuries. Some of the window sills had also been lowered. This has been reversed at Number 1 but policy has since changed with a decision to keep the alterations which were made in the 19th century. In front of the houses are cast iron railings which are mirrored by those on the opposite side of the road at the top of Victoria Park. The road is surfaced with pennant stone laid when the crescent was constructed.

==Film and television==
In 1965, the black comedy &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; (1966) used the Crescent extensively as a location, standing in for London. 

The 1965 film &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; had a sequence filmed outside the Crescent, and in one of its houses.

In 2007, a TV edition of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot; included many scenes shot at the Crescent, where the Elliot family was supposedly living while in Bath. 

The Crescent featured in the 2008 film &quot;The Duchess&quot;, starring Keira Knightley.

The fictional heroine of 2008 BBC1 archaeology thriller &quot;Bonekickers&quot; was depicted as living in the Crescent. 

In 2014, the hotel in the Crescent was a location for BBC1 series &quot;Our Girl&quot;.

In 2020, the Crescent was first used in the Netflix series &quot;Bridgerton&quot; and continued to be used in later seasons.

The ITV television series &quot;McDonald &amp; Dodds&quot; is set in Bath and makes frequent use of the Crescent as interstitial scenery as well as a shooting location.

<text>The Palace of Fine Arts is a monumental structure located in the Marina District of San Francisco, California, originally built for the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition to exhibit works of art. It was constructed of plaster and wood and later replicated and replaced with a concrete and steel version we see today; the building was claimed to be fireproof. According to a metal plate at the rotunda, it was rebuilt under B.F. Modglin, local manager of MacDonald &amp; Kahn, between 1964 and 1967. In the years 1973 and 1974, the columniated pylons were added. It is one of only 3 remaining structures from the exposition that survives.

The most prominent building of the complex, a open rotunda, is enclosed by a lagoon on one side and adjoins a large, curved exhibition center on the other side, separated from the lagoon by colonnades. As of 2019, the exhibition center (one of San Francisco&#x27;s largest single-story buildings) is used as a venue for events such as weddings or trade fairs.

Conceived to evoke a decaying ruin of ancient Rome, the Palace of Fine Arts became one of San Francisco&#x27;s most recognizable landmarks. Early 2009 marked the completion of a renovation of the lagoons and walkways and a seismic retrofit.

== History ==
The Palace of Fine Arts was one of ten palaces at the heart of the Panama-Pacific Exhibition. The exhibition also included the exhibit palaces of Education, Liberal Arts, Manufactures, Varied Industries, Agriculture, Food Products, Transportation, Mines, and Metallurgy, and the Palace of Machinery. The Palace of Fine Arts was designed by Bernard Maybeck. He was tasked with creating a building that would serve as a quiet zone where exhibition attendees could pass through between visiting the crowded fairgrounds and viewing the paintings and sculptures displayed in the building behind the rotunda. Maybeck designed what was essentially a fictional ruin from another time. He took his inspiration from Roman and Ancient Greek architecture (specifically Piranesi&#x27;s etching of the remnants of the so-called Temple of Minerva Medica in Rome), and also from Böcklin&#x27;s symbolism painting Isle of the Dead.

While most of the exposition was demolished when the exposition ended, the Palace was so beloved that a Palace Preservation League, founded by Phoebe Apperson Hearst, was founded while the fair was still in progress.

For a time the Palace housed a continuous art exhibit, and during the Great Depression, W.P.A. artists were commissioned to replace the decayed Robert Reid murals on the ceiling of the rotunda. From 1934 to 1942 the exhibition hall was home to eighteen lighted tennis courts. During World War II, it was requisitioned by the military for the storage of trucks and jeeps. At the end of the war, when the United Nations was created in San Francisco, limousines used by the world&#x27;s statesmen came from a motor pool there. From 1947 on, the hall was put to various uses: as a city Park Department warehouse; as a telephone book distribution center; as a flag and tent storage depot; and even as temporary Fire Department headquarters.

While the Palace had been saved from demolition, its structure was not stable. Originally intended to only stand for the duration of the Exhibition, the colonnade and rotunda were not built of durable materials, and thus framed in wood and then covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber. As a result of the construction and vandalism, by the 1950s the simulated ruin was a crumbling ruin.

In 1964, the original Palace was completely demolished, with only the steel structure of the exhibit hall left standing. The buildings were then reconstructed until 1974 in permanent, light-weight, poured-in-place concrete, and steel I-beams were hoisted into place for the dome of the rotunda. All the decorations and sculptures were constructed anew. The only changes were the absence of the murals in the dome, two end pylons of the colonnade, and the original ornamentation of the exhibit hall.

In 1969, the former Exhibit Hall became home to the Exploratorium interactive museum, and, in 1970, also became the home of the 966-seat Palace of Fine Arts Theater. On October 6, 1976, the Palace of Fine Arts hosted the second presidential debate between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. In 2003, the City of San Francisco along with the Maybeck Foundation created a public-private partnership to restore the Palace and by 2010 work was done to restore and seismically retrofit the dome, rotunda, colonnades, and lagoon. Within January 2013, the Exploratorium closed in preparation for its permanent move to the Embarcadero.

In 1992 and 1996, the popular U.S. game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; taped shows at the Palace for broadcast in November.

In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, plans were announced to convert the Palace of Fine Arts into a temporary shelter for 162 homeless people. The decision was reversed shortly afterward, following protests by local residents and concerns that the lodging conditions would be inadequate.

== Design ==

Built around a small artificial lagoon, the Palace of Fine Arts is composed of a wide, pergola around a central rotunda situated by the water. The lagoon was intended to echo those found in classical settings in Europe, where the expanse of water provides a mirror surface to reflect the grand buildings and an undisturbed vista to appreciate them from a distance.

Ornamentation includes Bruno Zimm&#x27;s three repeating panels around the entablature of the rotunda, representing &quot;The Struggle for the Beautiful&quot;, symbolizing Greek culture. While Ulric Ellerhusen supplied the weeping women atop the colonnade and the sculptured frieze and allegorical figures representing &quot;Contemplation, Wonderment&quot;, and &quot;Meditation&quot;.

The underside of the Palace rotunda&#x27;s dome features eight large insets, which originally contained murals by Robert Reid. Four depicted the conception and birth of Art, &quot;its commitment to the Earth, its progress and acceptance by the human intellect,&quot; and the four &quot;golds&quot; of California (poppies, citrus fruits, metallic gold, and wheat).

== In popular culture ==
The Palace of Fine Arts has been seen in films such as &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979), &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999), &quot;The Room&quot; (2003), and &quot;Twisted&quot; (2004). It also served as the backdrop for set pieces in &quot;So I Married An Axe Murderer&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996). Additionally, the Palace has appeared in the Indian films &quot;My Name is Khan&quot; (2010) and &quot;Vaaranam Aayiram&quot; (2008).
It also appears in Season 7, Episode 2 of &quot;&quot;, and in Season 8, Episode 7 of Mannix. It was incorporated into the imagery of the Sept of Baelor in Season 1, Episode 9 of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

Lucasfilm headquarters was constructed near the Palace of Fine Arts, which has been noted for its similarity to the city of Theed on Naboo as it appears in the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999).

In the 2000s, a smaller replica of the rotunda of the Palace of Fine Arts was built in Disney&#x27;s California Adventure in Anaheim, serving as the entrance to a theater showing the film Golden Dreams about the history of California. The attraction closed on September 7, 2008, and was demolished in 2009 to make way for The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure dark ride. The rotunda entrance remained, but it was repainted and serves as an entrance to the ride.

<text>The Albert Einstein Award was an award in theoretical physics, given periodically from 1951 to 1979, that was established to recognize high achievement in the natural sciences. It was endowed by the Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund in honor of Albert Einstein&#x27;s 70th birthday. It was first awarded in 1951 and, in addition to a gold medal of Einstein by sculptor Gilroy Roberts, it also included a prize money of $15,000, which was later reduced to $5,000. The winner was selected by a committee (the first of which consisted of Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neumann, and Weyl) of the Institute for Advanced Study, which administered the award. Lewis L. Strauss used to be one of the trustees of the institute.

This award should not be confused with many others named after the famous physicist, such as the Albert Einstein World Award of Science given by the World Cultural Council (since 1984), the Albert Einstein Medal given by the Albert Einstein Society (since 1979), nor with the Hans Albert Einstein Award, named after his son and given by the American Society of Civil Engineers (since 1988). It was established much earlier than these, while Einstein was still alive and was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study. It has been called &quot;the highest of its kind in the United States&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Some considered it as &quot;the prestigious equivalent of a Nobel Prize&quot;.

<doc id="507125" wikidata="Q18162235" url="?curid=507125" title="The Children Act (novel)">
<text>The Children Act is a novel by the English writer Ian McEwan. It was published on 2 September 2014. The title is a reference to the Children Act 1989, a UK Act of Parliament. The book has been compared to Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Bleak House&quot;, with its similar settings, and opening lines.

== Plot ==
Fiona Maye is a respected High Court Judge specialising in Family Law and living in Gray&#x27;s Inn Square. While reviewing a case, she is approached by her husband, Jack, who tells her that because of their lack of physical intimacy he would like to embark on a sexual affair, with her permission, with a 28 year old statistician. Fiona is horrified and refuses to agree to Jack&#x27;s terms. Fiona had developed a horror of the body after presiding over a case in which she ruled that conjoined twins should be separated despite the fact that one twin would immediately die due to her verdict. Though her peers lauded her elegant solution to the case, Fiona is privately troubled by it but nevertheless refuses to share this detail with Jack. In the middle of their fight, Fiona receives a call about an emergency case of a young teenager with leukemia who refuses a blood transfusion as a member of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Jack leaves the apartment.

Going to work Fiona finds herself pondering her marriage, her childlessness (in part due to her dedication to her career). Impulsively she decides to change the locks to her home despite knowing that this is illegal. Returning home she realizes that Jack has not returned or tried to contact her.

The following day Fiona hears arguments for the case involving Adam, the young Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. As he is only three months shy of his 18th birthday Fiona decides to visit him in the hospital to try to ascertain whether he is capable of denying treatment or not. She finds him a precocious and kind boy and he reads her poetry and plays a tune on his violin with her, with Fiona joining him by singing to his playing in an encore. Returning to court she rules that the hospital be allowed to give him the blood transfusion. Feeling elated with her decision she walks home and, upon returning, discovers that Jack has returned feeling foolish about his attempts to leave her. Fiona realizes that everything will eventually go back to normal and is ultimately disappointed that he returned at a time when she was happy and actually anticipating being alone.

Months later Fiona&#x27;s marriage is still tense. She begins to receive letters, at first at her work, and later at her apartment, from Adam Henry, telling her he is now grateful for her ruling and that he sees the hypocrisy in his parents and has become disillusioned with religion. Fiona decides to ignore the letters. Travelling to Newcastle to oversee local cases, she is surprised to find that Adam has followed her there, desperate to talk to her. Adam eventually confesses that he has left home and wants to live with Fiona. She refuses his request and tells him to call his mother. Arranging for a taxi and a train ticket she goes to kiss him on the cheek goodbye, but the two end up kissing on the lips. Panicked after the kiss, Fiona calls her husband to arrange for dinner when she returns and the two begin to reconcile.

Returning home Fiona and Jack slowly grow closer to one another. Fiona receives another letter from Adam, a religious poem, which implies that he thinks of her as Satan for tempting him away from religion and has returned to the faith. Like his other letters, Fiona ignores it.

Fiona prepares for a Christmas concert to be performed before her colleagues. The night before the concert she and Jack reconcile with a kiss and promise to dedicate themselves to each other anew. Going to the concert, before she performs, Fiona is informed that Adam has died after his leukemia returned and he refused treatment, now being of the age of majority. Fiona performs at the concert and then runs home. When Jack returns she tells him of the case, the kiss, and his death, feeling guilty for kissing Adam and then turning him away causing him to go back to his religious convictions. She falls asleep crying in her own bed, but when she wakes up Jack has followed her and he promises to love her as she reveals further details about her guilt.

== Inspiration ==
McEwan explains his inspiration in an essay he wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; which begins, &quot;Some years ago I found myself at dinner with a handful of judges – a bench is the collective noun. They were talking shop, and I was politely resisting the urge to take notes... How easily, I thought at the time, this bench could be mistaken for a group of novelists discussing each other&#x27;s work, reserving harsher strictures for those foolish enough to be absent. At one point, our host, Sir Alan Ward, an appeal court judge, wanting to settle some mild disagreement, got up and reached from a shelf a bound volume of his own judgments. An hour later, when we had left the table for coffee, that book lay open on my lap. It was the prose that struck me first. Clean, precise, delicious. Serious, of course, compassionate at points, but lurking within its intelligence was something like humour, or wit, derived perhaps from its godly distance, which in turn reminded me of a novelist&#x27;s omniscience.&quot;

== Reception ==
On &quot;The Omnivore&quot;, based on British press reviews, the book received an &quot;omniscore&quot; of 3 out of 5. On Bookmarks November/December 2014 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (3.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a critical summary saying, &quot;The critics were sharply divided over McEwan&#x27;s latest: &quot;USA Today&quot; praised it as a &quot;smart and elegant novel,&quot; while the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; complained that its &quot;chief selling point is its merciful brevity&quot;. Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;No consensus at all -- with those that think it&#x27;s more about Fiona preferring it to those who think its about the legal/moral case at hand&quot;. 

Reviews for the novel are mixed:
*&quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Kate Kellaway believes this to be &quot;the best novel he has written since &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot;&quot; and goes on to say, &quot;He leads us in one direction, then points us in another. And what one especially prizes is this ability to turn on his heel, change everything within a sentence or a well-placed word. From the start of this masterly novel, there is a larger sense, as Fiona lies on her chaise longue, that an elegantly established equilibrium is about to be rocked&quot; and concludes &quot;He keeps us tensely guessing – everything hingeing on Fiona&#x27;s decision about the boy. And it will not spoil the plot to say that this is a novel which, above all, considers what it might mean to be saved – and not in the sense in which Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses have claimed the word.&quot;
*Tessa Hadley, also writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, enjoys the novel&#x27;s presentation of &quot;a succession of particular cases from the family division in all their fascinating detail, along with the legal precedents and the issues they raise.&quot; but complains that &quot;the digressions make the flow of life in The Children Act feel oddly halting, and, although the plotting is intricate, there&#x27;s nothing in the writing of Fiona&#x27;s private life that is as interesting as the legal arguments...The problem is the novel&#x27;s prose seems not so much to imitate the flow of Fiona&#x27;s experience, as to offer a fairly pedestrian summary.&quot;
*James Walton in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; criticizes the McEwan, concluding that, &quot;By my reckoning, there are at least three highly implausible twists as he strives, with diminishing returns, to push &quot;The Children Act&quot; into a novel. None is justified either by his obvious desire to remind us of religion&#x27;s annoying persistence, or by Fiona&#x27;s childlessness, often a sign of human incompleteness in his work. The book still contains plenty of good, typically precise writing...Yet, in the end – especially given the choice of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses as the chief target – the feeling persists that McEwan&#x27;s considerable intellectual and literary firepower is here being used for little more than shooting fish in a barrel.&quot;
*Sam Leith in &quot;Literary Review&quot; writes &quot;The writer&#x27;s hand is always there: you&#x27;re aware of McEwan&#x27;s workmanlike crisscrossing of his themes – parenting, moral responsibility, the austerity of law and messiness of life, the moving power of art (the boy&#x27;s poetry; Fiona&#x27;s piano-playing) and so on. It never descends to being a thesis novel, but you&#x27;re definitely conscious of McEwan moving the pieces around on the chessboard. Scene by scene, &quot;The Children Act&quot; is grounded and plausible. McEwan&#x27;s prose has all the quiet mastery to which his readers have become accustomed. Fiona herself is completely realised, and the description of the fissure in her marriage entirely convincing and well developed. But Adam – at least to my mind – is less well rounded and the connection between the two sides of the story seems willed rather than organic. The whole assemblage still feels, by Ian McEwan&#x27;s own highest standards, a little bit thin.&quot;
*Cressida Connoelly in &quot;The Spectator&quot; was even more negative, with the strapline &quot;Improbable, unconvincing and lazy – Ian McEwan&#x27;s latest is unforgivable...The characterisation is scant and the writing poor, and he never gives religion a chance&quot;
*Nick Romeo in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; was also negative: &quot;He seems to behold his characters more than inhabit them, and this creates a sterile distance, a sense of reading a summary of others&#x27; misfortune. Her case just feels like one of many, not fundamentally different than the ones she considers. The story is schematic and contrived rather than palpable and lived.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation of the novel was released in 2017. It is directed by Richard Eyre and stars Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci.

<doc id="507128" wikidata="Q1227748" url="?curid=507128" title="Louis Racine">
<text>Louis Racine (born 6 November 1692, Paris; died 29 January 1763, Paris) was a French poet of the Age of the Enlightenment.

The second son and the seventh and last child of the celebrated tragic dramatist Jean Racine, he was interested in poetry from childhood but was dissuaded from trying to make it his career by the poet Boileau on the grounds that the gift never existed in two successive generations. However, in 1719 Racine became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions and published his first major poem, &quot;La Grâce&quot;, in 1722. But, because of the poem&#x27;s Jansenist inspiration, Cardinal de Fleury, chief minister of Louis XV, blocked the poet&#x27;s admission to the Académie Française, and instead Racine was induced to accept the post of inspector-general of taxes at Marseille in Provence.

For the next 24 years, although he continued to write poetry, Racine worked as a tax inspector in various provincial towns and cities, marrying in 1728. His most important poem, &quot;La Religion&quot;, in which he was careful to avoid further accusations of Jansenism, was published in 1742. He eventually retired from government service in 1746, aged 54, and returned to Paris where he devoted himself to his writing.

In November 1755, he lost his only son and his daughter-in-law when they were swept away by the tsunami from the Lisbon earthquake while on honeymoon at Cadiz in Spain. This tragedy, commemorated by the French poet Écouchard-Lebrun, is said to have broken Racine&#x27;s spirit. He sold his large library, gave up writing, and devoted himself now to the practice of religion. It was around this time that Racine wrote his last published work, an essay on the famous feral child of 18th-century France Marie-Angélique Memmie Le Blanc whom he had interviewed and written of in his philosophical poem &quot;L&#x27;Épître II sur l&#x27;homme&quot; (1747) (&quot;Second Epistle on Man&quot;).

Louis Racine was characterised by Voltaire, the leading French intellectual of his day, as &quot;le bon versificateur Racine, fils du grand Racine&quot; (&quot;the good versifier Racine, son of the great Racine&quot;). His &quot;Oeuvres complètes&quot; (complete works) were collected in six volumes and published in Paris in 1808. He was said by his contemporaries to have been a very personable, humble man who was sincerely pious and fluent in seven languages.

<text>Jonah Jacob Goldberg (born March 21, 1969) is an American conservative syndicated columnist, author, political analyst, and commentator. The founding editor of &quot;National Review Online&quot;, from 1998 until 2019, he was an editor at &quot;National Review&quot;. Goldberg writes a weekly column about politics and culture for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In October 2019, Goldberg became the founding editor of the online opinion and news publication &quot;The Dispatch.&quot; Goldberg has authored the No. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;Liberal Fascism&quot;, released in January 2008; &quot;The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas&quot;, released in 2012; and &quot;Suicide of the West&quot;, which was published in April 2018 and also became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, reaching No. 5 on the list the following month.

Goldberg is also a regular contributor on news networks such as CNN and MSNBC, appearing on various television programs including &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot;, the &quot;Glenn Beck Program,&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. Goldberg was an occasional guest on a number of Fox News shows such as &quot;The Five&quot;, &quot;The Greg Gutfeld Show&quot;, and &quot;Outnumbered&quot;. He was also a frequent panelist on &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier.&quot; From 2006 to 2010, Goldberg was a frequent participant on bloggingheads.tv. Goldberg has been a noted critic of President Donald Trump, fellow Republicans, and the conservative media complex during and after the Trump presidency. In November 2021, Goldberg and his colleague Steve Hayes resigned from Fox News in protest over Tucker Carlson&#x27;s documentary &quot;Patriot Purge.&quot; Goldberg described the documentary as &quot;a collection of incoherent conspiracy-mongering, riddled with factual inaccuracies, half-truths, deceptive imagery, and damning omissions.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Goldberg was born on the Upper West Side of New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough to Lucianne Goldberg (née Steinberger), a literary agent who died in 2022, and Sidney Goldberg, an editor and media executive who died in 2005. In speaking about his upbringing, Goldberg has said that his mother was an Episcopalian and that his father was Jewish and that he was raised Jewish. After graduating from high school in 1987, Goldberg left New York City to attend Goucher College in Towson, Maryland, from which he earned his bachelor&#x27;s in 1991, majoring in political science. Goldberg&#x27;s class at Goucher, which was a women&#x27;s college until 1986, was the second to admit men. While at Goucher, Goldberg was active in student politics and served as the co-editor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Quindecim&quot;, for two years. Goldberg and Andreas Benno Kollegger were the first men to run the paper. He later interned for Scripps Howard News Service, United Press International, and other news organizations. He also worked for Delilah Communications, a publishing house in New York.

==Career==
After graduating, Goldberg taught English in Prague for less than a year before moving to Washington D.C. in 1992 to take a job at the American Enterprise Institute. While at AEI he worked for Ben J. Wattenberg. He was the researcher for Wattenberg&#x27;s nationally syndicated column and for Wattenberg&#x27;s book, &quot;Values Matter Most&quot;. He also worked on several PBS public affairs documentaries, including a two-hour special hosted by David Gergen and Wattenberg. Goldberg was also invited to serve on Goucher College&#x27;s Board of Trustees immediately after graduating in 1991, a position he held for three years.

In 1994, Goldberg became a founding producer for Wattenberg&#x27;s &quot;Think Tank with Ben Wattenberg&quot;. That same year he moved to New River Media, an independent television production company, which produced &quot;Think Tank&quot; as well as numerous other television programs and projects. Goldberg worked on a large number of television projects across the United States, as well as in Europe and Japan. He wrote, produced, and edited two documentaries for New River Media, &quot;Gargoyles: Guardians of the Gate&quot; and &quot;Notre Dame: Witness to History&quot;.

He joined &quot;National Review&quot; as a contributing editor in 1998. By the end of that year, he was asked to launch &quot;National Review Online&quot; (NRO) as a sister publication to &quot;National Review&quot;. He served as editor of NRO for several years and later became editor-at-large. 

===Clinton–Lewinsky scandal===
Goldberg&#x27;s mother Lucianne Goldberg was involved in the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal as detailed in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Goldberg has spoken of his mother and the Lewinsky scandal:

My mother was the one who advised Linda Tripp to record her conversations with Monica Lewinsky and to save the dress. I was privy to some of that stuff, and when the administration set about to destroy Lewinsky, Tripp, and my mom, I defended my mom and by extension Tripp ... I have zero desire to have those arguments again. I did my bit in the trenches of Clinton&#x27;s trousers.

These tapes became the focal point of the Lewinsky scandal.

===Current work===
==== Writing for &quot;National Review&quot; and other publications ====
Beginning in 1998, Goldberg was an editor and wrote a twice-weekly column at &quot;National Review&quot;, which is syndicated to numerous papers across the United States, and at Townhall.com. &quot;National Review&quot; consists of fellow contributors such as Ramesh Ponnuru, Richard Brookhiser, and Kevin D. Williamson.

Goldberg also wrote the &quot;Goldberg File&quot; at &quot;National Review,&quot; a column that was generally lighter and more focused on humor and cultural commentary. Goldberg&#x27;s column often made pop-culture references to works including &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, of which he has said he is a fan. Goldberg was also a frequent contributor at the &quot;National Review&quot; blog &quot;The Corner&quot;, often authoring posts with light-hearted, comedic and pop-culture references.

Goldberg left &quot;National Review&quot; in May 2019.

Aside from being a member of the &quot;USA Today&quot; Board of Contributors, he has written for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The Public Interest&quot;, &quot;The Wilson Quarterly&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;The New York Post&quot;, and &quot;Slate&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; added Goldberg to its editorial lineup in 2005.

In 2020, Goldberg co-founded &quot;The Dispatch,&quot; an online news publication aimed at offering political, social and cultural analysis from a center-right perspective.

==== Online media ====
Goldberg is the host of &quot;The Remnant with Jonah Goldberg&quot;, an interview podcast that covers a variety of topics in the spheres of politics, conservative theory, and current events. Goldberg is a frequent participant in programs produced by Ricochet, including the podcast &quot;GLoP Culture&quot; which features Goldberg, John Podhoretz, and Ricochet co-founder Rob Long. From 2006 to 2010, he was a frequent participant on Bloggingheads.tv.

==== Books ====
Goldberg&#x27;s first book, &quot;Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, from Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning&quot;, was published in January 2008. It reached No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list of hardcover nonfiction in its seventh week on the list. Some historians have denounced the book as being &quot;poor scholarship&quot;, &quot;propaganda&quot;, and not scholarly. Other reviewers described the book as &quot;provocative&quot;. The audiobook version of &quot;Liberal Fascism&quot; was narrated by Johnny Heller. Goldberg followed the book with &quot;The Tyranny of Clichés: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas&quot; in 2012. The paperback edition of &quot;Tyranny of Cliches&quot; came out on April 30, 2013. Goldberg himself narrated the audiobook version. His most recent work, &quot;Suicide of the West&quot;, was released in 2018.

==== Pulitzer claim controversy ====
In May 2012, Goldberg was touted as a &quot;two-time Pulitzer prize nominee&quot; in the book jacket of his second book, &quot;The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas.&quot; NBC News reporter Bill Dedman pointed this out as misleading because Goldberg had in fact only been an entrant in the Pulitzer contest and had never been nominated as a finalist, as the moniker &quot;Pulitzer nominee&quot; claimed. Becoming an entrant in the Pulitzer contest requires only that either the author of a written work submit an entry form along with a small fee or that someone else do so on their behalf. Following Dedman&#x27;s reporting, Goldberg and his publishing company acknowledged the false claim and subsequently removed the line from the book jacket.

===Media appearances and commentary===

====Frequent topics====
Some frequent topics of his articles include censorship, meritocracy, liberty, federalism and interpretation of the Constitution. He has attacked the ethics and morals of liberals and Democrats, and his disagreements with libertarians also appear often in his writings. In the years of the Trump presidency, his writings turned critical of the Trump movement and the moral rot within the Republican Party. He was a supporter of the Iraq War and has advocated American military intervention elsewhere in the world. He has defended historical colonialism in places such as Africa as more beneficial than it is generally given credit for; in one column, he suggested that U.S. imperialism on the continent could help solve its persistent problems. When he wrote in October 2006 that invading Iraq was a mistake, he called it a &quot;noble&quot; mistake and still maintained that liberal opponents of the war policy wanted America to fail: &quot;In other words, their objection isn&#x27;t to war per se; it&#x27;s to wars that advance U.S. interests. ... I must confess, one of the things that made me reluctant to conclude that the Iraq war was a mistake was my distaste for the shabbiness of the arguments on the antiwar side.&quot;

He popularized and expanded on a commentary by the late &quot;Time&quot; writer William Henry III. Henry had written on the subject of multiculturalism and cultural equality, stating that &quot;it is scarcely the same thing to put a man on the moon as to put a bone in your nose&quot;. Goldberg stated that &quot;[m]ulticulturalism—which is simply egalitarianism wrapped in rainbow-colored paper—has elevated the notion that all ideas are equal, all systems equivalent, all cultures of comparable worth.&quot;

He has criticized the idea of &quot;social justice&quot; as meaning &quot;anything its champions want it to mean&quot; or &quot;&#x27;good things&#x27; no one needs to argue for and no one dare be against&quot;.

====Relations with other writers and public figures====
Goldberg has publicly feuded with people on the political left, like Juan Cole, over U.S. Iraq policy, and Air America Radio commentators such as Janeane Garofalo, who has accused him of being a chickenhawk on the Iraq War. On February 8, 2005, Goldberg offered Cole a wager of $1,000 &quot;that Iraq won&#x27;t have a civil war, that it will have a viable constitution, and that a majority of Iraqis and Americans will, in two years&#x27; time, agree that the war was worth it&quot;. Cole refused to accept and the wager was never made. Goldberg later conceded that if Cole had accepted the bet, Cole would have won.
Goldberg and Peter Beinart of &quot;The New Republic&quot; hosted a conservative vs. liberal WebTV show, &quot;What&#x27;s your Problem?&quot;, from 2007 to 2010. It originally could be found on &quot;National Review Online&quot; and later moved to Bloggingheads.tv.

====Relations with Fox News====
Regarding Fox News, Goldberg said, &quot;Look, I think liberals have reasonable gripes with Fox News. It does lean to the right, primarily in its opinion programming but also in its story selection (which is fine by me) and elsewhere. But it&#x27;s worth remembering that Fox is less a bastion of ideological conservatism and more a populist, tabloidy network.&quot; Goldberg has criticized liberals for applying a double standard to Fox News, arguing they have no &quot;problem with the editorializing of MSNBC&#x27;s Keith Olbermann or Chris Matthews, they think it&#x27;s just plain wrong for conservatives to play that game&quot;. 

During the Trump years and beyond, while Goldberg defended certain news hosts and shows on Fox News, he became more sympathetic towards critiques of Fox News, especially regarding their opinion hosts, including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Mark Levin. On November 21, 2021, Goldberg and colleague Steve Hayes announced that they were severing their ties to Fox News in protest of its support for Tucker Carlson&#x27;s &quot;Patriot Purge&quot;, which they described as &quot;a collection of incoherent conspiracy-mongering, riddled with factual inaccuracies, half-truths, deceptive imagery, and damning omissions.&quot;

====Donald Trump====
During the years of the Trump Presidency, Goldberg remained very critical of conservative media&#x27;s embrace of him. On Trump&#x27;s defenders in the media, Goldberg said this:

For nearly five years now, it has been obvious that Trump was unfit for the job and the arguments marshaled in his defense were cynical rationalizations that, for some, eventually mutated into sincerely held delusions. Sure, some deluded themselves from the beginning, but I’ve talked to too many Republican politicians and conservative media darlings who admitted it in private.

During the Trump Presidency, Goldberg became increasingly critical of both the Republican Party&#x27;s embrace of President Trump and their abandonment of pre-Trump principles.

==Personal life==
Goldberg is married to Jessica Gavora, chief speechwriter and former senior policy adviser to former Attorney General John Ashcroft. They have one daughter, and they live in the Palisades, Washington, D.C. neighborhood.

Goldberg&#x27;s brother, Joshua, died in 2011 from accidental injuries. Goldberg&#x27;s father, Sidney, died in 2005, and was survived by his wife, Jonah&#x27;s mother, Lucianne. Lucianne Goldberg died on October 26, 2022.

<text>Slot time is a concept in computer networking. It is at least twice the time it takes for an electronic pulse (OSI Layer 1 - Physical) to travel the length of the maximum theoretical distance between two nodes. In CSMA/CD networks such as Ethernet, the slot time is an upper limit on the acquisition of the medium, a limit on the length of a packet fragment generated by a collision, and the scheduling quantum for retransmission.

Since a pulse&#x27;s runtime will never exceed slot time (the maximum theoretical time for a frame to travel a network), the network interface controller, or NIC waits a minimum of slot time before retransmitting after a collision happened, in order to allow any pulse that was initiated at the time that the waiting NIC was requested to send, to reach all other nodes. By allowing the pulse to reach the waiting NIC, a local collision occurs (i.e. while still sending) rather than a late collision occurring (after sending may or may not have ended). By having the collision occur at the NIC (local) and not on the wire (late) CSMA/CD implementation recover the situation by retransmitting later.

Some times for Ethernet slot time include:

<doc id="507139" wikidata="Q710804" url="?curid=507139" title="Eusèbe Renaudot">
<text>Eusèbe Renaudot (; 20 July 16461 September 1720) was a French theologian and Orientalist.

==Biography==
Renaudot was born in Paris, and brought up and educated for a career in the church. After being educated by the Jesuits, and joining the Oratorians in 1666, he was in poor health, left his order, and never took more than minor orders. Despite his interest in theology and his title of &quot;abbé&quot;, much of his life was spent at the French court, where he attracted the notice of Colbert and was often employed in confidential affairs.

He was a prominent supporter of Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, in the controversies with Richard Simon, François Fénelon and the Jesuits. In later life his attitudes became Gallican and Jansenist. He became a member of the Académie française (1689), the Academy of Inscriptions (1691), and the Accademia della Crusca of Florence.

==Works==
The learning in Eastern languages which he acquired in his youth and maintained amid the distractions of court life did not bear fruit until he was sixty-two.

Renaudot&#x27;s best-known books are &quot;Historia Patriarcharum Alexandrinorum&quot; (Paris, 1713 which is translation of original work by Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa) and &quot;Liturgiarum orientalium collectio&quot; (2 vols., 1715–16). The latter argued for continuous Christian belief in the sacraments, the topic on which most of his theological writings turned, and which was then, in consequence of the controversies attaching to Antoine Arnauld&#x27;s &quot;Perpétuité de la foy de l&#x27;Église&quot;, a major matter of debate between French Catholics and Protestants.

Other works were &quot;Gennadii Patriarchae Constantinopolitani Homiliae de Eucharistia&quot; (Paris, 1709) and &quot;Anciennes relations des Indes et de la Chine&quot; (Paris, 1718, ).

<doc id="507143" wikidata="Q920419" url="?curid=507143" title="Upgrade">
<text>Upgrading is the process of replacing a product with a newer version of the same product. In computing and consumer electronics, an upgrade is generally a replacement of hardware, software or firmware with a newer or better version, in order to bring the system up to date or to improve its characteristics.

==Computing and consumer electronics==
Examples of common hardware upgrades include installing additional memory (RAM), adding larger hard disks, replacing microprocessor cards or graphics cards, and installing new versions of software. Other upgrades are possible as well.

Common software upgrades include changing the version of an operating system, an office suite, of an anti-virus program, or of various other tools.

Common firmware upgrades include the updating of the iPod control menus, the Xbox 360 dashboard, or the non-volatile flash memory that contains the embedded operating system for a consumer electronics device.

Users can often download software and firmware upgrades from the Internet. Often the download is a patch—it does not contain the new version of the software in its entirety, just the changes that need to be made. Software patches usually aim to improve functionality or solve problems with security. Rushed patches can cause more harm than good and are therefore sometimes regarded with skepticism for a short time after release. Patches are generally free.

A software or firmware upgrade can be major or minor and the release version code-number increases accordingly. A major upgrade will change the version number, whereas a minor update will often append a &quot;.01&quot;, &quot;.02&quot;, &quot;.03&quot;, etc. For example, &quot;version 10.03&quot; might designate the third minor upgrade of version 10. In commercial software, the minor upgrades (or updates) are generally free, but the major versions must be purchased.

Companies usually make software upgrades for the following reasons: 1.) to support industry regulatory requirements 2.) to access emerging technologies with new features, and tools 3.) to meet the demands of changing markets 4.) to continue to receive comprehensive product support.

==Risks==
Although developers usually produce upgrades to improve a product, there are risks involved—including the possibility that the upgrade will worsen the product.

Upgrades of hardware involve a risk that new hardware will not be compatible with other pieces of hardware in a system. For example, an upgrade of RAM may not be compatible with existing RAM in a computer. Other hardware components may not be compatible after either an upgrade or downgrade, due to the non-availability of compatible drivers for the hardware with a specific operating system. Conversely, there is the same risk of non-compatibility when software is upgraded or downgraded for previously functioning hardware to no longer function.

Upgrades of software introduce the risk that the new version (or patch) will contain a bug, causing the program to malfunction in some way or not to function at all. For example, in October 2005, a glitch in a software upgrade caused trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to shut down for most of the day. Similar have occurred: from important government systems
to freeware on the internet.

Upgrades can also worsen a product subjectively. A user may prefer an older version even if a newer version functions perfectly as designed. This may happen for a variety of reasons, including the user is already accustomed to the behavior of the old version or because the upgrade removed some features (see iPhone jack removal controversy or OtherOS).

A further risk of software upgrades is that they can brick the device being upgraded, such as if power fails while the upgrade is in the middle of being installed. This is an especially big concern for embedded devices, in which upgrades are typically all-or-nothing (the upgrade is a firmware or filesystem image, which isn&#x27;t usable if it&#x27;s only partially written), and which have limited ability to recover from a failed upgrade. Solutions to this generally involve keeping multiple copies of firmware, so that one can be upgraded while the other remains intact as a backup, but there are still holes which can cause this to fail. Tools such as Mender.io, Sysup, SWUpdate, RAUC, and OSTree provide more complete solutions that implement upgrades in a safe atomic way, and reduce or eliminate the need to customize bootloaders and other components. Desktop systems are more likely to use something like snapshots or restore points; these are more efficient as they only require a small fraction of space to store the changes from the old system to the new one, but the lack of a turnkey implementation for embedded systems makes this impractical.

<doc id="507144" wikidata="Q367204" url="?curid=507144" title="Address space">
<text>In computing, an address space defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a network host, peripheral device, disk sector, a memory cell or other logical or physical entity.

For software programs to save and retrieve stored data, each datum must have an address where it can be located. The number of address spaces available depends on the underlying address structure, which is usually limited by the computer architecture being used. Often an address space in a system with virtual memory corresponds to a highest level translation table, e.g., a segment table in IBM System/370.

Address spaces are created by combining enough uniquely identified qualifiers to make an address unambiguous within the address space. For a person&#x27;s physical address, the &quot;address space&quot; would be a combination of locations, such as a neighborhood, town, city, or country. Some elements of a data address space may be the same, but if any element in the address is different, addresses in said space will reference different entities. For example, there could be multiple buildings at the same address of &quot;32 Main Street&quot; but in different towns, demonstrating that different towns have different, although similarly arranged, street address spaces.

An address space usually provides (or allows) a partitioning to several regions according to the mathematical structure it has. In the case of total order, as for memory addresses, these are simply chunks. Like the hierarchical design of postal addresses, some nested domain hierarchies appear as a directed ordered tree, such as with the Domain Name System or a directory structure. In the Internet, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates ranges of IP addresses to various registries so each can manage their parts of the global Internet address space.

==Examples==
Uses of addresses include, but are not limited to the following:
* Memory addresses for main memory, memory-mapped I/O, as well as for virtual memory;
* Device addresses on an expansion bus;
* Sector addressing for disk drives;
* File names on a particular volume;
* Various kinds of network host addresses in computer networks;
* Uniform resource locators in the Internet.

== Address mapping and translation ==

Another common feature of address spaces are mappings and translations, often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. 
For example, a file system on a logical disk operates using linear sector numbers, which have to be translated to &quot;absolute&quot; LBA sector addresses, in simple cases, via addition of the partition&#x27;s first sector address. Then, for a disk drive connected via Parallel ATA, each of them must be converted to &quot;logical&quot; cylinder-head-sector address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the disk controller, then, finally, to &quot;physical&quot; cylinder, head and sector numbers.

The Domain Name System maps its names to and from network-specific addresses (usually IP addresses), which in turn may be mapped to link layer network addresses via Address Resolution Protocol. Network address translation may also occur on the edge of &quot;different&quot; IP spaces, such as a local area network and the Internet.
An iconic example of virtual-to-physical address translation is virtual memory, where different pages of virtual address space map either to page file or to main memory physical address space. It is possible that several numerically different virtual addresses all refer to one physical address and hence to the same physical byte of RAM. It is also possible that a single virtual address maps to zero, one, or more than one physical address.

<text>The VI Corps was activated as VI Army Corps in August 1918 at Neufchâteau, France, serving in the Lorraine Campaign. Constituted in the Organized Reserves in 1921, it was allotted to the Regular Army in 1933 and activated on 1 August 1940 at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. VI Corps took part in some of the most high-profile operations in World War II.

By war&#x27;s end it was part of the Seventh Army of the 6th Army Group. In early May 1945 its 103d Infantry Division, which had raced south through Bavaria into Innsbruck, Austria, met up with troops of the 349th Infantry, 88th Division in Vipiteno in the Italian Alps.

== History ==

=== World War I ===
The VI Corps was activated as VI Army Corps on 1 August 1918 at Neufchâteau, France. It served in the Lorraine Campaign (campaign streamer awarded). VI Corps commanders during World War I were Major General Omar Bundy, from 26 August through 12 September 1918; Major General Charles C. Ballou, from 23 October 1918 through 10 November 1918; Major General Charles T. Menoher, from 10 November 1918 (commanding corps at termination of hostilities). Major General Adelbert Cronkhite commanded from January to April, 1919. The corps was demobilized on 11 April 1919, at Villerupt, France. (Army Almanac, Stackpole, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, 1958, p. 645)

=== Inter-War Period ===
The VI Corps was reconstituted in the Organized Reserves on 29 July 1921, and was organized in March 1922 at Chicago, Illinois, in the Sixth Corps Area, responsible for the 6th, 32nd, and 33rd Divisions. It was withdrawn from the Organized Reserves on 1 October 1933 and allotted to the Regular Army. The corps was activated on 1 August 1940 at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. The future-Abwehr agent Oscar C. Pfaus served in VI corps during the 1920s.

=== World War II ===
==== Italy ====
The VI Corps took part in some of the most high-profile operations in World War II. The corps, commanded by Major General Ernest J. Dawley, first saw combat during the Allied invasion of Italy when it landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, along with the British X Corps, under the command of the U.S. Fifth Army as part of Operation Avalanche. The stiffness of the German defences sorely tested the VI Corps and it suffered heavy casualties before German attempts to throw the Americans back into the sea were thwarted by the artillery of the 45th &quot;Thunderbird&quot; and 36th&quot; Arrowhead&quot; Infantry Divisions, strongly supported by naval gunfire, bombing and the approach of British Eighth Army from the south. Major General Dawley was replaced after the battle, as he was judged to be worn out. He was replaced by Major General John Lucas.

From October to December 1943 VI Corps was involved in a bruising and bloody slog advancing from Naples up the Italian peninsula against the determined rearguard defence of the German 10th Army which skillfully took great advantage of the favorable terrain in organising successive lines of prepared defenses (Volturno Line, Barbara Line and Bernhardt Line). At the end of December, after heavy fighting on the Bernhardt Line (the forward defenses of the formidable Winter Line defenses) without a breakthrough, VI Corps was taken out of the line in an attempt to find a solution to the problem. In its second amphibious assault of the war, it came ashore at Anzio, south of Rome in Operation Shingle in January 1944 which was planned to threaten the rear lines of supply and communication of the German 10th Army. At first German resistance was negligible. However, Major General Lucas felt he needed to consolidate his beachhead before breaking out. This gave the Germans critical time to concentrate forces against him. Another bloody stalemate ensued, with the corps almost being driven back into the sea for the second time in Italy, again being rescued by naval and air power. When the stalemate was finally broken in the spring of 1944, the corps had lost another commander; Lucas was sacked for his poor performance and replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott, previously the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division. VI Corps also commanded units of the British Army during its time at Anzio, the British 1st Infantry Division, from 20 January until 21 May, and the British 2nd Commando Brigade and later, in mid-February, the British 56th Infantry Division and, from late March until 22 May, the British 5th Infantry Division.

When the corps broke out during Operation Diadem, it was ordered by the Fifth Army commander, Lieutenant General Mark Clark, northwest up the coast towards Rome instead of advancing northeast to block the German line of retreat from Cassino on the Gustav Line, leading to prolonged and bloody combat before it was taken by a combination of American, British, Canadian, French, and Polish troops. By disobeying his orders Clark received the glory of capturing the vacant Italian capital–abandoned without resistance by the Germans and left an open city–but was castigated by his peers and superiors for failing to trap and destroy the German forces. This, along with the poor performance at Anzio, would cast a shadow over the reputation of the corps.

==== Southern France ====
Following the capture of Rome, VI Corps again left the line, and again prepared for an amphibious assault, its third and last of the war. Operation Dragoon was aimed at capturing southern France, and VI Corps provided the assault troops, coming under Seventh Army. The landing, on 15 August 1944, was not opposed with much fervor, with allied casualties estimated at 95 killed and 385 wounded for the first day. German forces, by comparison, lost over 2,000 men, with the bulk taken prisoner. Fearing their forces in southern France would be caught in a squeeze between the U.S. Seventh Army and allied forces advancing eastward from Normandy, the Germans began a strategic retreat toward the north.

Wishing to avoid a repeat of the Anzio landings, elements of VI Corps moved north rapidly while the beachhead was consolidated. These units established a commanding position over the main route of German retreat near the town of Montelimar. Combat raged for a week over control of the main road through Montelimar with the Germans bent on escape but taking significant losses from U.S. artillery fire. When the Battle of Montelimar ended on 28 August 1944, the Germans had suffered 2,100 battle casualties plus 8,000 POWs, while the Americans had 1,575 casualties.

==== Vosges Mountains ====
The liberation of southern France occurred rapidly, with the corps taking Besançon on 7 September 1944, and fighting its way into Vesoul less than one week later. In mid-September, the character of the fighting changed from the pursuit operations of southern France to a grinding advance against firm German resistance in the Vosges Mountains of eastern France. VI Corps liberated Epinal on 25 September 1944 and pushed on to Bruyères in mid-October 1944. The drive on Saint-Dié ensued but required a month of agonizingly slow advances in the rough terrain of the Vosges. On 25 October 1944, Major General Edward H. Brooks assumed command of the corps when Truscott was promoted to take command of U.S. 5th Army in Italy. VI Corps completed its fight through the Vosges at the end of November, 1944, and moved onto the plains of Alsace.

==== Alsace ====
In the first two weeks of December, 1944, the corps liberated Sélestat and Hagenau and advanced to the German border. The German offensive into the Ardennes on 16 December 1944, forced a major redeployment of allied armies south of the Ardennes, and like the rest of the U.S. Seventh Army, the VI Corps assumed a defensive stance. At this time, the corps held the front between Bitche and the Rhine River.

During the German&#x27;s Operation Nordwind (&quot;Unternehmen Nordwind&quot;), VI Corps was assaulted by elements of four German corps in the first week of January 1945, and the corps was forced to give ground in bitter winter fighting until 25 January 1945. While fighting was heavy all through the corps&#x27; front, the units of the corps took especially heavy losses in and around the Bas-Rhin towns of Herrlisheim and Drusenheim. The U.S. Seventh Army counter-attacked in the last week of January, 1945, and VI Corps recaptured lost ground north of Strasbourg until its attacks were halted by flooded ground near the Rhine River in mid-February, 1945.

==== Germany and Austria ====
The VI Corps resumed its advance in mid-March, 1945, reaching the German border for the second time. By the end of March, 1945, the corps had assaulted and pierced the Siegfried Line in the Wissembourg Gap and the Bienwald Forest, and driven to the Rhine River north of Karlsruhe. After crossing the Rhine, the corps moved toward Heilbronn in early April, 1945. Bitter resistance by Waffen SS troops, Nazi party auxiliary forces, and other German troops forced a harsh nine-day house-to-house battle, with Heilbronn being taken by the corps on 12 April 1945. Concurrently, armored units of the VI Corps were stopped and almost cut off during a heavily-fought four-day battle against SS Troops for Crailsheim that ended in a minor defeat for elements of the corps on 10 April 1945.

On 17 April 1945, the corps was ordered to move SE to the border of Switzerland. Within ten days, the corps had conquered Schwäbisch Hall, Kirchheim unter Teck, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Ulm (crossing the Danube River there), Memmingen, and Kempten. On 28 April 1945, the corps crossed into Austria near Füssen. Despite the obvious collapse of Nazi Germany, German forces continued to oppose the corps, forcing it to fight for the Fern Pass during 1–2 May 1945. On 4 May 1945, the corps occupied Innsbruck, crossed the Brenner Pass into Italy, and made contact with its old comrades of the U.S. Fifth Army. Within two days, all German forces in the region surrendered unconditionally, ending the war for VI Corps.

==== Campaign credits ====
VI Corps is credited with service in the Lorraine campaign (World War I) and with service in the Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead), Anzio (with arrowhead), Rome-Arno, Southern France (with arrowhead), Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe campaigns of World War II.

==== Inactivation ====
Headquarters, VI Corps, was redesignated Headquarters, United States Constabulary, on 1 May 1946. The corps was inactivated on 24 November 1950 in Germany. It was activated and redesignated VI Corps at Camp Atterbury, Indiana on 22 January 1951. It was inactivated on 1 April 1953 at Camp Atterbury, Indiana. Activated 22 November 1957 at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, part of the U.S. Army Reserve. Moved to Battle Creek in July 1962. The last inactivation occurred on 29 February 1968 at Battle Creek, Michigan.

<text>Sir Charles Wilkins (1749 – 13 May 1836) was an English typographer and Orientalist, and founding member of the Asiatic Society. He is notable as the first translator of the Bhagavad Gita into English. He supervised Panchanan Karmakar to create one of the first Bengali typefaces. In 1788, Wilkins was elected a member of the Royal Society.

==Birth and childhood==
He was born at Frome in Somerset in 1749. He trained as a printer. In 1770, he went to India as a printer and writer in the East India Company&#x27;s service. His facility with language allowed him to quickly learn Persian and Bengali. He created with his own hands the first type for printing Bengali. He published the first typeset book in the language, earning himself the name &quot;the Caxton of India&quot;. He also designed type for publications of books in Persian. In 1781, he was appointed as translator of Persian and Bengali to the Commissioner of Revenue and as superintendent of the company&#x27;s press. He successfully translated a Royal inscription in Kutila characters, which were thitherto indecipherable.

In 1784, Wilkins helped William Jones establish the Asiatic Society of Bengal.


==Work==
Wilkins moved to Benares (Varanasi), where he studied Sanskrit under Kalinatha, a Brahmin pandit. At this period he began work on his translation of the Mahabharata, securing strong support for his activities from the governor of British India, Warren Hastings. Though he never completed the translation, portions were later published. The most important was his version of the Gita, published in 1785 as &#x27;Bhagvat-geeta&#x27;, or &quot;Dialogues of Krishna and Arjun&quot; (London: Nourse, 1785). In his preface Wilkins argued that the Gita was written to encourage a form of monotheist &quot;unitarianism&quot; and to draw Hinduism away from the polytheism he ascribed to the Vedas. He had a hobby to learn about other religions. He was also a scholar of Islam. He stayed in India for 16 years (1770–1786). He also made visits to holy shrines of other religions to learn about their customs. During a visit to Varanasi, he made a stop at Patna, and visited Patna Sahib Gurudwara, the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He wrote his account of this visit titled as &#x27;Sikhs and their College at Patna&#x27;. He writes about Dasam Granth there and notes in this article. Meanwhile, inscriptions of the 6th century CE in late Brahmi script were deciphered in 1785 by Charles Wilkins, who published an essentially correct translation of the Gopika Cave Inscription written by the Maukhari king Anantavarman. Wilkins seems to have relied essentially on the similarities with later Brahmic scripts, such as the script of the Pala period and early forms of Devanagari.

==Translation to other languages==
His translation of the Gita was itself soon translated into French (1787) and German (1802). It proved to be a major influence on Romantic literature and on European perception of Hindu philosophy. William Blake later celebrated the publication in his picture &quot;The Bramins&quot;, exhibited in 1809, which depicted Wilkins and Brahmin scholars working on the translation.

With Hastings&#x27; departure from India, Wilkins lost his main patron. He returned to England in 1786, where he married Elizabeth Keeble. In 1787 Wilkins followed the Gita with his translation of &quot;The Heetopades of Veeshnoo-Sarma, in a Series of Connected Fables, Interspersed with Moral, Prudential and Political Maxims&quot; (Bath: 1787). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1788. In 1800, he was invited to take up the post of the first director of the India House Library, which became over time the world-famous &#x27;India Office Library&#x27; (now British Library – Oriental Collections). In 1801 he became librarian to the East India Company, He was named examiner at Haileybury when a college was established there in 1805. During these years he devoted himself to the creation of a font for Devanagari, the &quot;divine script&quot;. In 1808 he published his &quot;Grammar of the Sanskrita Language&quot;. King George IV gave him the badge of the Royal Guelphic Order and he was knighted in recognition of his services to Oriental scholarship in 1833. He died in London at the age of 86.

In addition to his own translations and type designs, Wilkins published a new edition of John Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Persian and Arabic dictionary&quot; – &quot;A Vocabulary Persian, Arabic, and English; Abridged from the Quarto Edition of Richardson&#x27;s Dictionary as Edited by Charles Wilkins, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S. – By David Hopkins, Esq., Assistant Surgeon on the Bengal Establishment&quot; in 1810. He also published a catalogue of the manuscripts collected by Sir William Jones, who acknowledged his indebtedness to Wilkins.

<doc id="507154" wikidata="Q235555" url="?curid=507154" title="Nancy Meyers">
<text>Nancy Jane Meyers (born December 8, 1949) is an American filmmaker. She has written, produced, and directed many critically and commercially successful films. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; (1980). Her film &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987) was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. She co-wrote &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991), &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot; (1995), and both wrote and directed &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998), &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000), &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; (2003), &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006), &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Intern&quot; (2015).

Meyers was married to filmmaker Charles Shyer, with whom she had two children, including filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer.

==Early life and education==
Meyers was born in Philadelphia. Her father, Irving Meyers, was an executive at a voting machines manufacturer. Her mother, Patricia Meyers (née Lemisch), was an interior designer who also worked as a volunteer with the Head Start Program and the Home for the Blind. The younger of two daughters, Meyers was raised in a Jewish household in the Drexel Hill area.

After reading playwright Moss Hart&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Act One&quot; at the age of twelve, Meyers became interested in theater and started to act in local stage productions. Her interest in screenwriting did not emerge until she saw Mike Nichols&#x27; film &quot;The Graduate&quot; in 1967. Meyers attended Lower Merion High School in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. In 1970, Meyers graduated from American University with a degree in journalism.

== Career ==
After graduating from college, Meyers spent a year working in public television in Philadelphia. When she was 22 years old, Meyers moved to Los Angeles, living with her sister, Sally, in the Coldwater Canyon area. She quickly got a job as a production assistant on the CBS game show &quot;The Price Is Right.&quot;

Inspired by the popular TV show, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&quot; Meyers decided she wanted to write. She eventually got work as a story editor where she read scripts, wrote coverage, and worked with screenwriters on projects that the producers were developing. One of the companies she worked at was producer Ray Stark&#x27;s company, Rastar. She worked her way up from there to writing her own scripts. Two years after coming to Los Angeles, Meyers was able to quit her job to focus on a career in screenwriting and took film-making classes where she connected with directors such as Martin Scorsese. To support herself, she started a small cheesecake business after positive reactions to a cake she made for a dinner party. Meyers was eventually hired as a story editor by film producer Ray Stark, who later fired her after Meyers objected to having two writers working on the same script without the other knowing.

===1980s===
In the late 1970s, Meyers started work with Charles Shyer when she was a story editor in the film division at Motown. The pair became friends and, along with Harvey Miller, created the script for the comedy &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; (1980) together, a film about a spoiled young woman who joins the U.S. Army after her husband dies on their wedding night during sex. The film starred actress Goldie Hawn, who along with Meyers and Shyer executive produced the project. It was Hawn&#x27;s agent who made Warner Brothers executive Robert Shapiro buy the script after practically &quot;everybody [had] turned it down. Everybody. More than once,&quot; according to Meyers. Meyers described how hard it was to get the film made, noting, &quot;Every single studio in Hollywood read it and passed on it... One studio called Goldie and said &#x27;if you make this movie it&#x27;s a career ender.&#x27;” Contrary to the conventional wisdom at the time, that a female lead with no male star was box office poison, &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; became one of the biggest box office hits of the year 1980, grossing nearly $70 million in total. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, as were Hawn and her co-star, Eileen Brennan, for their performances, and won the team a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay. In addition, the film spawned a same-titled short-lived but Golden Globe-winning television series that aired from 1981 until 1983.

Meyers and Shyer&#x27;s next project, &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; (1984), marked Shyer&#x27;s directorial debut. Shelley Long and Ryan O&#x27;Neal played a Hollywood couple whose obsession with success destroys their relationship with their daughter, played by eight-year-old Drew Barrymore. Released to a mixed reception by critics, the collaboration became a moderate box office with a gross of $12.4 million, but received multiple Golden Globe nominations, including Best Actress nods for Long and Barrymore. Also in 1984, Meyers, Shyer and Miller penned &quot;Protocol&quot;, another comedy starring Goldie Hawn, in which she portrayed a cocktail waitress who prevents the assassination of a visiting Arab Emir, and thus is offered a job with the United States Department of State as a protocol official. Hawn reportedly disliked their screenplay and hired Buck Henry for a major overhaul, prompting the trio to go into arbitration to settle their differences. While neither Meyers nor Shyer became involved in producing or directing the film, it fared slightly better at the box office than &quot; Irreconcilable Differences&quot;, garnering $26.3 million in total.

Meyers eventually returned to producing with &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987), a film about a New York City female executive, who out of the blue becomes the guardian of her distant cousin&#x27;s 14-month-old daughter. The film marked her debut collaboration with Diane Keaton. The catalyst for the project was a series of situations that Meyers and Shyer and their friends had experienced while managing a life with a successful career and a growing family. &quot;Baby Boom&quot; was favorably received by critics and audiences alike. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and earned a respectable $1.6 million in its opening weekend in the US, and approximately $26.7 million in its entire run. As with &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; the film was followed by a short-lived television series starring Kate Jackson.

===1990s===
In 1990, Meyers and Shyer, working from earlier material for the first time, re-teamed with Keaton to remake the 1950 Vincente Minnelli film &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. Starring Steve Martin as a father losing his daughter and his bank account at the same time, their 1991 version was released to generally positive reception. It became a hit among audiences, resulting in the pair&#x27;s biggest financial success yet at a worldwide gross of $90 million. A sequel to the film which centered around the expansion of the family, entitled &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot;, was produced in 1995. Loosely based on the original&#x27;s 1951 sequel &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot;, it largely reprised the success of its predecessor at the box office. A third installment, also penned by Meyers and Shyer, failed to materialize.

Also in 1991, Meyers contributed to the script for the ensemble comedy &quot;Once Upon a Crime&quot; (1992), directed by Eugene Levy, and became one out of several script doctors consulted to work on the Whoopi Goldberg comedy &quot;Sister Act&quot; (1992). Her next project with Shyer was &quot;I Love Trouble&quot; (1994), a comedy thriller about a cub reporter and a seasoned columnist who go after the same story, that was inspired by screwball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s such as &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; and &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. Written for and starring Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte, the film was not well received by critics but grossed over $30 million in box-office receipts in the United States. While the script for &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, another Meyers/Shyer collaboration, that Meyers described as &quot;a Depression-era comedy about a small-town girl who comes to the big city, loses her values and then finds them again,&quot; found no buyers, another project called &quot;Love Crazy&quot; failed to materialize after lead actor Hugh Grant dropped out of the project after months of negotiations.

Having turned down Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing&#x27;s offer to direct the 1996 comedy blockbuster &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, Meyers eventually agreed on making her directorial debut with &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998), following the signing of a development deal with Walt Disney Pictures in 1997. A remake of the same-titled 1961 original based on Erich Kästner&#x27;s novel &quot;Lottie and Lisa&quot;, it starred Lindsay Lohan in her motion picture debut, in a dual role of estranged twin sisters who try to reunite their long-divorced parents, played by Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson. Lohan&#x27;s casting as twins forced Meyers to shoot the film in motion control, a requirement she considered rather complicated. &quot;I really didn&#x27;t know how to do it,&quot; she said. &quot;We had a prep day to go over the process, and by the end of the day I had a little better understanding. But I approached the movie like it wasn&#x27;t an effects film; I just tried to make it authentic.&quot; Released to positive reviews from critics, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; brought in $92 million worldwide.

===2000s===
In 1998, following the success of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; and her separation from Shyer, Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures chairman Joe Roth asked Meyers to reconstruct an original script named &quot;Head Games&quot; about a man who gains the power to hear everything women are thinking, an idea originally conceived by &quot;The King of Queens&quot; producers Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith. Subsequently, Meyers penned two drafts of the script before agreeing to direct, but as Roth left the studio in January 2000, Disney dismissed the film and the project eventually went to Paramount. By the following year, Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt had signed on to star in leading roles and the project had been retitled &quot;What Women Want&quot;. Released in 2000 to mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.

Following her divorce, Meyers wrote and directed the post-divorce comedy &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; (2003), starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson as a successful 60-something and 50-something, who find love for each other at a different time of life, despite being complete opposites. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 63 and 57 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy, and 20th Century Fox, the film&#x27;s original distributor, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. As a result, the film ended up as a co-production between Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures. While critical reaction to the film as a whole was more measured, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; received generally favorable notice and became a surprise box-office hit following its North American release, eventually grossing US$266.6 million worldwide, mostly from its international run. In 2005, her Waverly Films production company signed a deal with Sony.

Meyer&#x27;s next film was &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006), a romantic comedy starring Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet as two lovelorn women from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean who arrange a home exchange to escape heartbreak during the Christmas and holiday season. Jude Law and Jack Black co-starred as their love interests. Released to mixed reviews from critics, the film became a global box office success, grossing $205 million worldwide, mostly from its international run. The film won the 2007 Teen Choice Award in the Chick Flick category.

In 2009, Meyers&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; was released. It starred Meryl Streep as a successful bakery owner and single mother of three who starts a secret affair with her ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, ten years after their divorce – only to find herself drawn to another man: her architect Adam (portrayed by Steve Martin). The film was met with mixed reviews from critics, who declared it rather predictable despite fine work by an appealing cast, but became another commercial hit for Meyers upon its Christmas Day opening release in the United States. It played well through the holidays and into January 2010, ultimately closing on April 1 with $112.7 million. Worldwide, &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; eventually grossed $219.1 million, and surpassed &quot;The Holiday&quot; to become Meyer&#x27;s third highest-grossing project to date. &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; earned Meyers two Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay.

===2010s===
In 2012, it was announced that Meyers was planning to direct &quot;The Chelsea&quot;, an ensemble dramedy set in the Chelsea Apartments in New York. Based on a screenplay by daughter Hallie Meyers-Shyer, it was set to star Felicity Jones; the project failed to materialize however as Meyers was also finishing her own screenplay for &quot;The Intern&quot; (2015), a comedy about the founder of a fashion based e-commerce company who agrees to a community outreach program where seniors will intern at the firm. Originally set up at Paramount Pictures, the latter was expected to feature Tina Fey and Michael Caine in the lead roles. When a budget could not be settled, Meyers decided to pre-package before going out to other studios and was able to start negotiations for both actors. Handed over to Warner Bros, Fey was replaced by Reese Witherspoon as the attached star, though Witherspoon later left the film due to scheduling conflicts. In 2014, Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro replaced her and Caine.

In September 2015, Meyers announced that her next self-directed project would see her reteaming with Steve Martin. She also served as a producer on &quot;Home Again&quot; (2017), the directorial debut of her daughter Hallie Meyers-Shyer, starring Reese Witherspoon.

===2020s===
In September 2020, Nancy Meyers announced a follow-up to the first two &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; films was coming. The first teaser trailer was released on September 23, with an official preview released the following day. The &quot;mini-sequel&quot; was written and directed by Meyers, with the plot including a family reunion over Zoom at the request of Matty Banks, and depicted George Banks&#x27; reaction to 2020. Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Kieran Culkin, George Newbern, and Martin Short reprised their respective roles, with Alexandra Shipp and Robert De Niro joining. The film will benefit World Central Kitchen charity, supporting families and children who suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. &quot;Father of the Bride Part 3(ish)&quot; was released on September 25, 2020, exclusively through Netflix, while also streaming on the service&#x27;s YouTube and Facebook pages.

In April 2022, Netflix announced Meyers would write, direct and produce a new feature film for the streaming service, an untitled ensemble comedy. In March 2023, it was reported that the film, under the working title &quot;Paris Paramount&quot;, would not move forward at Netflix after the studio had declined to approve a requested production budget of $150 million; a few days later, Warner Bros. Pictures entered talks to acquire the project, with the possibility that the film could have begun production that summer if picked up.

== Directorial style and influences ==
Meyers attributes her major influences to the screwball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. Her films frequently center the experiences of middle-aged women facing conflict between the personal and the professional. Meyers&#x27; films are known to redirect the male gaze and instead take a critical view of male leads through the female gaze.

Meyers generally spends a year writing, followed by six months of filming and another six months of editing. She has final cut privilege on her films, which is uncommon for directors working with major American studios. Meyers is known as a detail-oriented director, who shoots many takes of scenes and is meticulously involved in designing her films&#x27; aesthetic details. Meyers considers her film set to function as a character in her films.

Meyers&#x27; protagonists are often affluent and live in luxurious homes, which she says is meant to emphasize that they are successful women who can afford to create beautiful, comfortable spaces for themselves. The extravagant design and decoration of the kitchens in her films have received particular media attention.

==Reception==
The academic and writer Deborah Jermyn has dubbed Nancy Meyers &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s reigning &#x27;romcom queen.&#x27;&quot; Scholarship and criticism of Meyers&#x27; oeuvre has discussed the postfeminist aesthetics and ideologies that her films embody, in which wealthy, successful, and independent women often play the protagonists. In a 2020 article for &quot;Bustle&quot;, Dana Schwartz writes in praise of this, saying, &quot;Where Hollywood desexualizes and disposes of women over 40, Nancy Meyers celebrates them, showing them as women who have crushed their careers and become financially stable enough to buy objectively stunning pieces of property&quot;. Film scholar Michele Schreiber argues that the fantasy of romance itself becomes a &quot;fulfilling and desirable commodity&quot;, but says there is a question of whether the power of her films derives from the emotional terrain and romances of her characters, or from her seductive, pleasurable mise-en-scène and the upwardly mobile desires it generates.

In a 2009 &quot;New York Times&quot; profile of Meyers, writer Daphne Merkin points out that her films sometimes have the quality of &quot;tidy unreality,&quot; which is the aspect of her filmmaking that often draws harsh criticism. Some criticism has taken note of how the &quot;independent woman&quot; figure in Nancy Meyers film always appears as heterosexual, upper-class, and white, leveling charges of white feminism on her work.

Katarzyna Paszkiewicz asserts that Meyers&#x27; ability to simultaneously carve out a particular, feminized niche in her work, while still providing mainstream (and even male) audiences with &quot;what they want,&quot; has made her the most successful commercial female filmmaker. Paszkiewicz contends that Meyers&#x27; reliance on the rom-com genre may be more complex and self-reflexive than it appears. In &quot;The Intern&quot; (2015), for example, many traditional rom-com tropes are recast and reimagined by making the focal relationship, between Jules and Ben, a non-romantic, intergenerational one. The film also highlights disenchantment with the &quot;independent woman&quot; ideal, and foregrounds the problems that plague professional women in heteronormative relationships. Thus, against contemporary charges that the rom-com genre is tired and overdone, Meyers has the ability to use the genre’s tropes in a regenerative, original manner. In Paszkiewicz&#x27;s words, &quot;If postfeminist values marked the decades of the 1990s and 2000s, Meyers seems to ask: what is next?&quot;

== Influence on industry ==
Meyers has had a significant impact on the filmmaking industry as a female filmmaker, gaining her the reputation as one of the most influential women filmmakers in the romantic-comedy genre and in the Hollywood industry. This is due to her recognizable directorial style with notable sets and the limited number of female directors in the space. She is one of only 36 female filmmakers to be on Disney+ out of their catalogue of over 500 films going back to the 1930s.

Meyers&#x27; overall popularity in the romantic-comedy genre has allowed her work to become cited many times as a filmmaker important to audience nostalgia.

In her later works, her depictions of older women on screen created more popularity within the genre. In addition to her popularity with audiences, Meyers has been said to have left an impact on the actors she has worked with. Reese Witherspoon even identifies Meyers as a resource in Witherspoon’s own creative endeavors.

==Personal life==
In 1980, Meyers and Charles Shyer married in Rome. They had been in a relationship since 1976. The pair separated in 1999 and eventually divorced. They have two daughters, Annie Meyers-Shyer and Hallie Meyers-Shyer, both of whom have had minor roles in their films. On February 28, 2020, Meyers published her post-divorce story as part of the &quot;New York Times&quot; column called &quot;Modern Love&quot;.

Meyers resides in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

<text>Radio Havana Cuba (, RHC) is the official government-run international broadcasting station of Cuba. It can be heard in many parts of the world, including the United States, on shortwave frequencies. Radio Havana Cuba, along with Radio Rebelde, Cubavision Television, and other Cuban radio and television, broadcasts to North, Central and South America via free-to-air programming from the Hispasat 30W-6 satellite over the Atlantic Ocean and worldwide via Internet streaming.

==Early history (1960s–1980s)==
Although RHC was officially inaugurated in May 1961, the idea of an international Cuban radio station was born in the Sierra Maestra mountains during the final stage of the fight against Fulgencio Batista. After the creation of Radio Rebelde by Ernesto &#x27;Che&#x27; Guevara in February 1958, the leadership of the guerrilla movement began to analyze the possibility of creating a radio station after achieving final victory. This station would be able to communicate news about the Cuban Revolution to countries around the world.

The station unofficially began broadcasting during the Bay of Pigs Invasion in order to spread news of the attack, and the Cuban defence against it, internationally. The existence of the as-of-yet unnamed station was announced by Fidel Castro in a speech the next day on 17 April 1961, celebrating the invasion&#x27;s defeat, with Castro announcing that Cuba had already in operation a shortwave radio station, able to carry the truth about Cuba beyond its borders. The station was officially launched a few days later on 1 May 1961, with its name proclaimed as Radio Havana Cuba, during a mass rally at Plaza de la Revolución in Havana held to celebrate Cuba&#x27;s victory over the US-sponsored invasion attempt.

During the Cold War, RHC relayed propaganda broadcasts from North Vietnam and North Korea, and the USSR, as well as its original programming. The North Vietnamese programming from the Voice of Vietnam was received by teleprinter and read by Radio Havana Cuba announcers. In the 1960s, Radio Havana Cuba broadcast &quot;Radio Free Dixie&quot; aimed at African-Americans struggling against segregation and Jim Crow in the southern United States.

At times in the 1980s, in order to protest the Reagan administration&#x27;s Cuba policy and its instigation of the anti-Castro Radio Martí program from the Voice of America, Radio Havana Cuba broadcast briefly on mediumwave frequencies at a greatly boosted power allowing the station to be heard on American AM radios and overwhelming local American AM stations broadcasting on that frequency, including clear channel station WHO in Des Moines, Iowa on 1040 kHz. RHC no longer transmits on mediumwave, even though Radio Martí still transmits from the United States to Cuba on 1180 kHz.

==Current broadcasting==
Located on Havana&#x27;s Avenida Infanta, the offices of Radio Havana Cuba share a facility with two other renowned national stations that have contributed greatly to the history of Cuban radio broadcasting: Radio Progreso and CMBF, Radio Musical Nacional. Currently, RHC broadcasts in nine languages: Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, Arabic, Quechua, Guarani, Creole and Esperanto, 24 hours a day, with a varied programming that includes news, music and features. RHC&#x27;s English-language broadcasts are heavily centered on the United States and feature news items that uniformly adversely reflect upon the U.S. government and the current administration, especially its foreign policies.

In 2004, RHC and related mediumwave transmitters, such as Radio Rebelde, broadcast speeches by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez as well as Castro.

RHC was off the air temporarily in late August 2004 due to damage caused by Hurricane Charley.

The English-language service of the station broadcasts an hour-long program which is repeated throughout the day at different times and frequencies (AM and international shortwave as well as FM in Havana). The program consists of a mix of news, commentary, history, music (both traditional and contemporary Cuban music) as well as a series of rotating special programs including the &quot;Mailbag Show&quot; (in which listener mail is read over the air), &quot;Music with a Message&quot; (normally featuring an internationally-known musician whose music touches on social justice themes), &quot;World of Stamps&quot;, the sports program with Eduardo Gonzalez, and &quot;DXers Unlimited&quot;, a program on the technical aspects of amateur radio and shortwave listening from announcer Arnie Coro (Ham radio call sign CO2KK). The current lead announcers are Ed Newman and Lena Valverde. Arts and Culture segments are normally by Gerwin Jones, a Canadian journalist. Most of the commentary viewpoint segments are by Juan Jacomino.

The shortwave numbers station nicknamed &quot;Atencion&quot;, or HM01, by independent shortwave listeners has been linked to RHC radio transmissions equipment. In numbers station transmissions, a series of random numbers are read out over the air in multiple languages, or in digital modes or morse code. These audible transmission of numbers are believed to be one-time encrypted messages to espionage agents residing in the targeted country. Numbers station monitors have noted that on occasion RHC interval signals have been heard at the beginning or end of intelligence-related transmissions. The United States Government convicted the Cuban Five with evidence that was intercepted and decoded from HM01.

==Interval signal==
The station&#x27;s interval signal is &quot;La Marcha del 26 de Julio&quot; (The 26th of July March), written by Agustín Díaz Cartaya.

Sometime during the interval, Thelma Rodriguez gives out the radio identifier details in the Spanish and English languages. &quot;This is/You&#x27;re listening to Radio Habana Cuba, broadcasting from Cuba, free territory in Americas&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Este es/Estás escuchando Radio Habana Cuba, transmitiendo desde Cuba, territorio libre en America&quot;).

<text>Jean Marie Napoléon Désiré Nisard (20 March 1806 – 27 March 1888) was a French writer and literary critic. He was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine.

==Career==
In 1826 he joined the staff of the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;, but subsequently transferred his pen to the &quot;National&quot;. Under the empire he was inspector-general of education (1852) and director of the École normal (1857–1867).

Nisard&#x27;s literary reputation was established by his &quot;Histoire de la littérature française&quot; (1844–1861). This work helped to secure his election to the Académie Française in 1850 as seat 39. His other works include &quot;Études d&#x27;histoire et de littérature&quot; (1859–1864), and &quot;Les Quatres grands historiens latins&quot; (1875).

In all his books Nisard vigorously supported the claims of classicism against romanticism. He is the object of the loathing of the narrator in the postmodern book &quot;Démolir Nisard&quot;, by the French writer Eric Chevillard.

==Death==
Nisard died at San Remo in 1888.

==Memorials==
The school Lycée polyvalent Désiré Nisard in Châtillon-sur-Seine was named after Nisard.

<doc id="507168" wikidata="Q1054730" url="?curid=507168" title="Close-in weapon system">
<text>A close-in weapon system (CIWS ) is a point-defense weapon system for detecting and destroying short-range incoming missiles and enemy aircraft which have penetrated the outer defenses, typically mounted on a naval ship. Nearly all classes of larger modern warships are equipped with some kind of CIWS device.

There are two types of CIWS systems. A gun-based CIWS usually consists of a combination of radars, computers, and rapid-firing multiple-barrel rotary cannons placed on a rotating turret. Missile-based CIWSs use either infra-red, passive radar/ESM, or semi-active radar terminal guidance to guide missiles to the targeted enemy aircraft or other threats. In some cases, CIWS are used on land to protect military bases. In this case, the CIWS can also protect the base from shell and rocket fire.

==Gun systems==
A gun-based CIWS usually consists of a combination of radars, computers and rotary or revolver cannon placed on a rotating, automatically aimed gun mount. Examples of gun-based CIWS products in operation are:
* AK-630, 630M, 306, 630M1-2, and 630M2 - 30×165mm caliber
* Aselsan GOKDENIZ and GOKDENIZ ER - 35×228mm
* DARDO and Fast Forty - 40×365mmR
* Denel 35mm Dual Purpose Gun - 35×228mm
* Goalkeeper CIWS - 30×173mm
* Kashtan CIWS and M variant - 30×165mm
* Mauser BK-27 - 27×145mm
* Meroka CIWS - 20×128mm
* Myriad CIWS - 25×184mm
* PIT-Radwar OSU-35K - 35×228mm
* Rheinmetall Oerlikon Millennium Gun - 35×228mm
* Rheinmetall Sea Snake 30 mm - 30×173mm
* Phalanx CIWS Block 0, 1, 1A, and 1B - 20×102mm
* Sea Zenith - 25×184mm
* H/PJ-76A - 37×240mm
* Type 730 and Type 1130 CIWS - 30×165mm
* Pantsir-M - 30×165mm

===Limitations of gun systems===
Short range: the maximum effective range of gun systems is about ; systems with lighter projectiles have even shorter range. The expected real-world kill-distance of an incoming anti-ship missile is about or less, still close enough to cause damage to the ship&#x27;s sensor or communication arrays, or to wound or kill exposed personnel. Thus some CIWS like Russian Kashtan and Pantsir systems are augmented by installing the close range surface-to-air missiles on the same mounting for increased tactical flexibility.

Limited kill probability: even if the missile is hit and damaged, this may not be enough to destroy it entirely or to alter its course. Even in the case of a direct hit, the missile or fragments from it may still impact the intended target, particularly if the final interception distance is short. This is especially true if the gun fires kinetic-energy-only projectiles.

===Comparison table===
==Missile systems==

A missile-based CIWS comprises a combination of radars and computers connected to either a rotating, automatically aimed launcher mount or vertical launching system. Examples of missile-based CIWS in operational service are:

* 9M337 Sosna-R
* HQ-10 / FL-3000N
* Pantsir-M missile system
* RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile
* Sea Oryx
* Tor missile system

==Land-based==
CIWS are also used on land in the form of Pantsir and C-RAM. On a smaller scale, &quot;active protection systems&quot; are used in some tanks (to destroy rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), and several are in development. The Drozd system was deployed on Soviet Naval Infantry tanks in the early 1980s, but later replaced by explosive reactive armour. Other systems that are available or under development are the Russian Arena, Israeli Trophy, American Quick Kill and South African-Swedish LEDS-150.

==Laser systems==
Laser-based CIWS systems are being researched. In August 2014 an operational prototype was deployed to the Persian Gulf aboard . The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Turkish: &quot;Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu&quot;, TÜBİTAK) is the second organisation after the US to have developed and tested a High Power Laser CIWS prototype System which is intended to be used on the TF-2000 class frigate and on Turkish airborne systems.

<doc id="507169" wikidata="Q1192541" url="?curid=507169" title="The Boscombe Valley Mystery">
<text>&quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, one of the fifty-six short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the fourth of the twelve stories in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1891.

==Plot==
John Turner, a widower and a major landowner who has a daughter named Alice, lives in Herefordshire with a fellow expatriate from Australia, Charles McCarthy, a widower who has a son named James. Charles has been found dead near Boscombe Pool; it was reported that he was there to meet someone. Two witnesses testify that they saw Charles walking into the woods followed by James, who was carrying a gun. Patience Moran, daughter of a lodgekeeper, says that she saw the two arguing and that, when James raised his hand as if to hit his father, she ran to her mother; and while she was telling her mother what she saw, James rushed to their house seeking help. The Morans followed James back to the Pool, where they found his father dead. James was arrested and charged with murder. Alice believes that James is innocent and has contacted Inspector Lestrade, who in turn seeks help from Sherlock Holmes.

James confirms the testimonies of the witnesses but explains that he was going into the woods to hunt, not to follow his father. He later heard his father calling &quot;Cooee&quot; and found him standing by the pool, surprised to see him. They argued heatedly, and James decided to return to their farm. Shortly after that he heard his father cry out and returned to find him lying on the ground. James insists that he tried to help him, but his father died in his arms. James refuses to give the cause of their argument, despite the coroner&#x27;s warning that it could be damaging to his case if he does not reveal it. James also remembers that his father&#x27;s last words were something about &quot;a rat&quot;, but James is uncertain of their meaning in the situation. He also thinks he saw a cloak on the ground, which vanished while he was helping his father.

Alice meets Holmes, Lestrade and Dr. Watson in a hotel, and hopes that Holmes has found a way to prove James&#x27;s innocence. She also believes that she was the subject of the argument between the McCarthys – Charles wanted his son to marry her, but James had refused. Alice had taken James&#x27; side out of respect for him, and her father was also against the union. Holmes asks Alice if he could meet her father, but she says his health worsened after the death of Charles, whom he had known since they were in Victoria. Holmes decides to see James.

Holmes mistakenly surmises that James knows who killed his father and is protecting someone. It emerges that Alice is right about the cause of the argument between James and Charles. What she does not know is that James actually loves her but could not follow his father&#x27;s demand because he had married a barmaid before Alice had returned from boarding school. This burdened him, but he could not tell his father about his marriage because he would have been kicked out of the house and left unable to support himself. When his wife heard of his troubles, however, she confessed that she was already married before they met, and therefore their marriage is invalid.

Holmes, Watson and Lestrade go to the farm, and examine Charles&#x27;s and James&#x27;s boots. They then head to Boscombe Pool, following the track from the courtyard. After examining the ground, Holmes finds evidence of the presence of another man, besides Charles and James, whom he believes to be the murderer. Holmes deduces that the killer is left-handed (because Charles was struck neatly on the left side of his head from behind, where a right-handed man would have struck him on the other side), and that the stranger is tall, has a limp and smokes cigars. Lestrade is not convinced.

At the hotel, Holmes explains to Watson that &quot;Cooee&quot; is an Australian cry and that the apparent reference to &quot;a rat&quot;, overheard by James, in fact comprised the last syllables of &quot;Ballarat&quot;, a place in Australia. The person Charles was meeting was, therefore, someone he knew from Australia. John Turner, Alice&#x27;s father, then comes to their room (coincidentally being announced by a hotel employee right as Watson is about to name him as the killer, after correctly interpreting the hints Holmes has offered him), entering with a limp, and, realising that Holmes has deduced the crime, confesses.

In his confession, John explains that he was a member of the Ballarat Gang, a group of bushrangers in Australia. They robbed a gold convoy in which Charles was the wagon driver, and John spared his life despite knowing that Charles could later identify him. The loot made the surviving gang members rich, and they moved to England. Resolved to change, John parted ways with his friends. He bought land and got married, and then Alice was born. Some time later, Charles tracked down John and threatened to blackmail him unless he and his son were provided for. In response, John gave Charles the farm and money, hoping this would satisfy him. However, this was not enough, and Charles eventually demanded the marriage of James and Alice. Although he liked James, John did not want Charles&#x27; &quot;cursed blood&quot; mixed with his family&#x27;s, so he resisted the union. After much pressure, John agreed to meet Charles secretly at the Pool to resolve the matter. Seeing Charles and James there arguing, John hid, intending to wait until James left. However, he became angry when he heard the nature of the argument and killed Charles to preserve his freedom and spare his daughter. James heard his father&#x27;s death cry and returned, but John was able to hide in the woods. He had to return later to retrieve the cloak that he had dropped in his haste.

John signs his statement, and Holmes vows to keep it secret unless it is needed to free James. In the end, Holmes&#x27;s objections are sufficient to acquit James, and John dies seven months after the meeting with Holmes and Watson. Meanwhile, Watson surmises that James and Alice will likely marry and live in happiness without ever discovering the true history of their fathers.

==Possible basis for Boscombe Valley==
En route to the murder scene Holmes tells Watson that &quot;Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire.&quot; There is no real location matching this description. Leslie S. Klinger, in his &quot;The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot;, calls it &quot;a disguised name&quot; and lists possible locations for the setting of the story as posited by other researchers.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in November 1891. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
One of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes Éclair film series (1912) was based on the story. In the short film, Georges Tréville played Sherlock Holmes and Mr Moyse played Dr. Watson. Another short film based on the story was released in 1922 as part of the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.

The 1968 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Peter Cushing as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Dr. Watson, dramatised this story for its sixth episode. Lestrade is replaced by a local policeman, Inspector Lanner, and Charles McCarthy&#x27;s first name has been changed to Bill. John Turner dies immediately after confessing to Holmes.

In the 1991 TV adaption starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, Boscombe Valley is in Cheshire in the northwest of England. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard does not appear; instead Holmes cooperates with one Inspector Summerby. A young James Purefoy stars as James McCarthy.

===Radio===

&quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Meiser also adapted the story for &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; for a 1940 episode with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.

In 1943, the BBC Home Service dramatised the story with Arthur Wontner as Holmes and Carleton Hobbs as Watson. A different radio adaptation aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1966, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; was adapted as an episode of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; titled &quot;The Boscombe Pool Mystery&quot;. The episode, which featured Kevin McCarthy as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson, first aired in May 1977.

&quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; was adapted in 1990 for BBC Radio 4 by Bert Coules, as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It also featured Samuel West as James McCarthy and Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade.

A 2011 episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<text>François Guillaume Jean Stanislaus Andrieux (6 May 17599 May 1833) was a French man of letters and playwright.

== Life ==
Born and educated at Strasbourg, Andrieux proceeded to Paris to study law. There he became a close friend of Collin d&#x27;Harleville. He became secretary to the duke of Uzès, and practised at the bar, but his attention was divided between his profession and literature.

He died on 9 May 1833 in Paris.

His plays are of the 18th century style, comedies of intrigue, but they rank with those of Collin d&#x27;Harleville among the best of the period next to those of Pierre Beaumarchais. &quot;Les Étourdis&quot; is probably his best comedy.

<text>Scott Elliott Fahlman (born March 21, 1948) is an American computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Language Technologies Institute and Computer Science Department. He is notable for early work on automated planning and scheduling in a blocks world, on semantic networks, on neural networks (especially the cascade correlation algorithm), on the programming languages Dylan, and Common Lisp (especially CMU Common Lisp), and he was one of the founders of Lucid Inc. During the period when it was standardized, he was recognized as &quot;the leader of Common Lisp.&quot; From 2006 to 2015, Fahlman was engaged in developing a knowledge base named &quot;Scone&quot;, based in part on his thesis work on the NETL Semantic Network. He also is credited with coining the use of the emoticon.

==Life and career==
Fahlman was born in Medina, Ohio, the son of Lorna May (Dean) and John Emil Fahlman. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Master of Science (M.S.) degree in electrical engineering and computer science in 1973, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in artificial intelligence in 1977. He has noted that his doctoral diploma says the degree was awarded for &quot;original research as demonstrated by a thesis in the field of Artificial Intelligence&quot; and suggested that it may be the first doctorate to use that term. He is a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.

Fahlman acted as thesis advisor for Donald Cohen, David B. McDonald, David S. Touretzky, Skef , Justin Boyan, Michael Witbrock, and Alicia Tribble Sagae.

From May 1996 to July 2001, Fahlman directed the Justsystem Pittsburgh Research Center.

=== Boltzmann Machine (1983) ===
In 1983, Fahlman, Geoffrey Hinton and Terrence Sejnowski published a paper in Proceedings of the AAAI-83 Conference, Washington DC, August 1983. The paper was titled as &quot;Massively Parallel Architectures for AI: NETL, Thistle and Boltzmann Machines&quot;. 

===Emoticons===
Fahlman was not the first to suggest the concept of the emoticon – a similar concept for a marker appeared in an article of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in May 1967, although that idea was never put into practice.

In an interview printed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1969, Vladimir Nabokov noted: &quot;I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile –
 some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket.&quot;

Fahlman is credited with originating the first smiley emoticon, which he thought would help people on a message board at Carnegie Mellon to distinguish serious posts from jokes. He proposed the use of codice_1 and codice_2 for this purpose, and the symbols caught on. The original message from which these symbols originated was posted on 19 September 1982. The message was recovered by Jeff Baird on 10 September 2002 and read:

<doc id="507174" wikidata="Q92894" url="?curid=507174" title="Geoffrey Hinton">
<text>Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian computer scientist, cognitive scientist, cognitive psychologist, and Nobel Prize winner in Physics, known for his work on artificial neural networks which earned him the title as the &quot;Godfather of AI&quot;.

Hinton is University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto. From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto, before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023, citing concerns about the many risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.

With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularised the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, although they were not the first to propose the approach. Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.

Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, often referred to as the &quot;Nobel Prize of Computing&quot;, together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. They are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Godfathers of Deep Learning&quot;, and have continued to give public talks together. He was also awarded with John Hopfield the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for .

In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to &quot;freely speak out about the risks of A.I.&quot; He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors, technological unemployment, and existential risk from artificial general intelligence. He noted that establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI in order to avoid the worst outcomes. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he called for urgent research into AI safety to figure out how to control AI systems smarter than humans.

== Education ==
Hinton was educated at Clifton College in Bristol and the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After repeatedly changing his degree between different subjects like natural sciences, history of art, and philosophy, he eventually graduated with a BA degree in experimental psychology in 1970. He continued his study at the University of Edinburgh where he was awarded a PhD in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by Christopher Longuet-Higgins.

== Career and research ==
After his PhD, Hinton initially worked at the University of Sussex and at the MRC Applied Psychology Unit. After having difficulty getting funding in Britain, he worked in the U.S. at the University of California, San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University. He was the founding director of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London. He University Professor Emeritus in the computer science department at the University of Toronto, where he has been affiliated since 1987.

Upon arrival in Canada, Geoffrey Hinton was appointed at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in 1987 as a Fellow in CIFAR&#x27;s first research program, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics &amp; Society. In 2004, Hinton and collaborators successfully proposed the launch of a new program at CIFAR, Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception (or NCAP, which today is named Learning in Machines &amp; Brains). Hinton would go on to lead NCAP for ten years. Among the members of the program are Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, with whom Hinton would go on to win the ACM A.M. Turing Award in 2018. All three Turing winners continue to be members of the CIFAR Learning in Machines and Brains program.

Hinton taught a free online course on Neural Networks on the education platform Coursera in 2012. He co-founded DNNresearch Inc. in 2012 with his two graduate students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever at the University of Toronto’s department of computer science. In March 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch Inc., and he planned to &quot;divide his time between his university research and his work at Google&quot;.

Hinton&#x27;s research concerns ways of using neural networks for machine learning, memory, perception, and symbol processing. He has written or co-written more than 200 peer reviewed publications.

While Hinton was a postdoc at UC San Diego, David E. Rumelhart and Hinton and Ronald J. Williams applied the backpropagation algorithm to multi-layer neural networks. Their experiments showed that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data. In a 2018 interview, Hinton said that &quot;David E. Rumelhart came up with the basic idea of backpropagation, so it&#x27;s his invention&quot;. Although this work was important in popularising backpropagation, it was not the first to suggest the approach. Reverse-mode automatic differentiation, of which backpropagation is a special case, was proposed by Seppo Linnainmaa in 1970, and Paul Werbos proposed to use it to train neural networks in 1974.

In 1985, Hinton co-invented Boltzmann machines with David Ackley and Terry Sejnowski. His other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations, time delay neural network, mixtures of experts, Helmholtz machines and product of experts. An accessible introduction to Geoffrey Hinton&#x27;s research can be found in his articles in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in September 1992 and October 1993. In 2007, Hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled &quot;Unsupervised learning of image transformations&quot;. In 2008, he developed the visualization method t-SNE with Laurens van der Maaten.

In October and November 2017, Hinton published two open access research papers on the theme of capsule neural networks, which according to Hinton, are &quot;finally something that works well&quot;.

At the 2022 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) he introduced a new learning algorithm for neural networks that he calls the &quot;Forward-Forward&quot; algorithm. The idea of the new algorithm is to replace the traditional forward-backward passes of backpropagation with two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data that could be generated solely by the network.

In May 2023, Hinton publicly announced his resignation from Google. He explained his decision by saying that he wanted to &quot;freely speak out about the risks of A.I.&quot; and added that a part of him now regrets his life&#x27;s work.

Notable former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from his group include Peter Dayan, Sam Roweis, Max Welling, Richard Zemel, Brendan Frey, Radford M. Neal, Yee Whye Teh, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Ilya Sutskever, Yann LeCun, Alex Graves, Zoubin Ghahramani, and Peter Fitzhugh Brown.

=== Honours and awards ===

Hinton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1998. He was the first winner of the Rumelhart Prize in 2001. His certificate of election for the Royal Society reads: 

In 2001, Hinton was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. He was the 2005 recipient of the IJCAI Award for Research Excellence lifetime-achievement award. He was awarded the 2011 Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering. In 2012, he received the Canada Council Killam Prize in Engineering. In 2013, Hinton was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Université de Sherbrooke.

In 2016, he was elected a foreign member of National Academy of Engineering &quot;for contributions to the theory and practice of artificial neural networks and their application to speech recognition and computer vision&quot;. He received the 2016 IEEE/RSE Wolfson James Clerk Maxwell Award.

He won the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2016) in the Information and Communication Technologies category, &quot;for his pioneering and highly influential work&quot; to endow machines with the ability to learn.

Together with Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, Hinton won the 2018 Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.

In 2018, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada.
In 2021, he received the Dickson Prize in Science from the Carnegie Mellon University and in 2022 the Princess of Asturias Award in the Scientific Research category, along with Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Demis Hassabis. In 2023, he was named an ACM Fellow. In 2023, he was named a Highly Ranked Scholar by ScholarGPS for both lifetime and prior five years.

In 2024, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics with John Hopfield &quot;for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.&quot; His development of the Boltzmann machine was explicitly mentioned in the citation. When the &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Cade Metz asked Hinton to explain in simpler terms how the Boltzmann machine could &quot;pretrain&quot; backpropagation networks, Hinton quipped that Richard Feynman reportedly said: &quot;Listen, buddy, if I could explain it in a couple of minutes, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the Nobel Prize.&quot;. That same year, he received the VinFuture Prize grand award alongside Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, Jen-Hsun Huang, and Fei-Fei Li for groundbreaking contributions to neural networks and deep learning algorithms.

In 2025 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering jointly with Yoshua Bengio, Bill Dally, John Hopfield, Yann LeCun, Jen-Hsun Huang and Fei-Fei Li.

== Views ==
=== Risks of artificial intelligence ===
In 2023, Hinton expressed concerns about the rapid progress of AI. He had previously believed that artificial general intelligence (AGI) was &quot;30 to 50 years or even longer away.&quot; However, in a March 2023 interview with CBS, he said that &quot;general-purpose AI&quot; might be fewer than 20 years away and could bring about changes &quot;comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; published on 1 May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google so he could &quot;talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google.&quot; He noted that &quot;a part of him now regrets his life&#x27;s work&quot;.

In early May 2023, Hinton said in an interview with BBC that AI might soon surpass the information capacity of the human brain. He described some of the risks posed by these chatbots as &quot;quite scary&quot;. Hinton explained that chatbots have the ability to learn independently and share knowledge, so that whenever one copy acquires new information, it is automatically disseminated to the entire group, allowing AI chatbots to have the capability to accumulate knowledge far beyond the capacity of any individual.

==== Existential risk from AGI ====
Hinton has expressed concerns about the possibility of an AI takeover, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s not inconceivable&quot; that AI could &quot;wipe out humanity&quot;. Hinton said in 2023 that AI systems capable of intelligent agency would be useful for military or economic purposes. He worries that generally intelligent AI systems could &quot;create sub-goals&quot; that are unaligned with their programmers&#x27; interests. He says that AI systems may become power-seeking or prevent themselves from being shut off, not because programmers intended them to, but because those sub-goals are useful for achieving later goals. In particular, Hinton says &quot;we have to think hard about how to control&quot; AI systems capable of self-improvement.

==== Catastrophic misuse ====
Hinton reports concerns about deliberate misuse of AI by malicious actors, stating that &quot;it is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using [AI] for bad things.&quot; In 2017, Hinton called for an international ban on lethal autonomous weapons.

==== Economic impacts ====
Hinton was previously optimistic about the economic effects of AI, noting in 2018 that: &quot;The phrase &#x27;artificial general intelligence&#x27; carries with it the implication that this sort of single robot is suddenly going to be smarter than you. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be that. I think more and more of the routine things we do are going to be replaced by AI systems.&quot; Hinton had also argued that AGI would not make humans redundant: &quot;[AI in the future is] going to know a lot about what you&#x27;re probably going to want to do... But it&#x27;s not going to replace you.&quot;

In 2023, however, Hinton became &quot;worried that AI technologies will in time upend the job market&quot; and take away more than just &quot;drudge work&quot;. He said in 2024 that the British government would have to establish a universal basic income to deal with the impact of AI on inequality. In Hinton&#x27;s view, AI will boost productivity and generate more wealth. But unless the government intervenes, it will only make the rich richer and hurt the people who might lose their jobs. &quot;That&#x27;s going to be very bad for society,&quot; he said.

At Christmas 2024 he had become somewhat more pessimistic, saying that there was a &quot;10 to 20 per cent chance&quot; that AI would be the cause of human extinction within the following three decades (he had previously suggested a 10% chance, without a timescale). He expressed surprise at the speed with which AI was advancing, and said that most experts expected AI to advance, probably in the next 20 years, to be &quot;smarter than people ... a scary thought. ... So just leaving it to the profit motive of large companies is not going to be sufficient to make sure they develop it safely. The only thing that can force those big companies to do more research on safety is government regulation.&quot; Another &quot;godfather of AI&quot;, Yann LeCun, disagreed, saying AI &quot;could actually save humanity from extinction&quot;.

=== Politics ===
Hinton moved from the U.S. to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Ronald Reagan-era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence.

In August 2024, Hinton co-authored a letter with Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, and Lawrence Lessig in support of SB 1047, a California AI safety bill that would require companies training models which cost more than US$100 million to perform risk assessments before deployment. They said the legislation was the &quot;bare minimum for effective regulation of this technology.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Hinton&#x27;s first wife, Rosalind Zalin, died of ovarian cancer in 1994; his second wife, Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Ford, died of pancreatic cancer in 2018.

Hinton is the great-great-grandson of the mathematician and educator Mary Everest Boole and her husband, the logician George Boole. George Boole&#x27;s work eventually became one of the foundations of modern computer science. Another great-great-grandfather of his was the surgeon and author James Hinton, who was the father of the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton.

Hinton&#x27;s father was the entomologist Howard Hinton. His middle name comes from another relative, George Everest, the Surveyor General of India after whom the mountain is named. He is the nephew of the economist Colin Clark.

<text>STS-113 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. During the 14-day mission in late 2002, &quot;Endeavour&quot; and its crew extended the ISS backbone with the P1 truss and exchanged the Expedition 5 and Expedition 6 crews aboard the station. With commander Jim Wetherbee and pilot Paul Lockhart at the controls, &quot;Endeavour&quot; docked with the station on 25 November 2002 to begin seven days of station assembly, spacewalks, and crew and equipment transfers. This was the last flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot; before entering its Orbiter Major Modification period until STS-118 in 2007, which included modernizing the cockpit, and also the final shuttle mission before the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==

STS-113 was an Assembly Mission (11A) to the International Space Station, delivering the P1 Truss segment, which provides structural support for the Space Station radiators. Mission Specialists John Herrington and Michael López-Alegría performed three spacewalks to activate and outfit the P1. The STS-113 crew and both Expedition crews transferred about 1,969 kilograms (4,340 pounds) of cargo between the shuttle and station.

STS-113 delivered the Expedition 6 crew to the station for a four-month increment. The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-113, ending a 185-day stay in space.

STS-113 came to a close when &quot;Endeavour&quot; glided in to a landing at Kennedy Space Center on 7 December. It was the 19th flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the 112th shuttle mission, and the 16th shuttle mission to the station. The landing was the first (and only) time a mission ended on the fourth day of landing attempts.

Also carried aboard STS-113 was the Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) based Pico Satellite Inspector (MEPSI). This payload deployed two small satellites which are connected via a tether.

STS-113 was the last successful mission before STS-107. Gus Loria was originally scheduled to fly as the pilot for this mission, but was replaced due to an injury. His replacement was Paul S. Lockhart. John Herrington, a member of the Chickasaw Nation, became the first enrolled member of a Native American tribe to fly in space.

STS-113 was the final mission during which Russian cosmonauts flew on the Space Shuttle.

Because &quot;Endeavour&quot; entered its Orbiter Major Modification period after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, this was the last shuttle mission to fly with an analog-style cockpit.

<text>Robert Charles Winthrop (May 12, 1809 – November 16, 1894) was an American lawyer, philanthropist, and Whig Party politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States House and Senate from 1840 to 1851. He served as the 18th speaker of the United States House of Representatives and was a political ally and colleague of Daniel Webster. After a rapid rise in Massachusetts and national politics and one term as speaker, Winthrop succeeded Webster in the Senate. His re-election campaign resulted in a long, sharply contested defeat by Charles Sumner. He ran for Governor of Massachusetts in 1851 but lost due to the state&#x27;s majority requirement, marking the end of his political career and signaling the decline of the Massachusetts Whig Party.

Winthrop was born into a prominent Boston political family, descended from colonial governors Thomas Dudley and John Winthrop and commonwealth governor James Bowdoin, his great-grandfather. After an education at Boston Latin School and Harvard College, he studied law with Webster and was admitted to the bar in 1831. In 1835, at the age of twenty-four, he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives and served five one-year terms. From 1838 to 1840, he served as speaker of the Massachusetts House.

In 1840, Winthrop won a special election to succeed Abbott Lawrence in the United States House of Representatives, representing Boston. He was re-elected to a full term but resigned early in 1842 to mourn the death of his young wife. After only six months out of office, his successor Nathan Appleton resigned, and he was elected to succeed him. Winthrop served out the remainder of the term and was elected three more times. In 1847, he was elected Speaker of the House at the start the 30th Congress. However, he lost re-election in 1849 to Howell Cobb of Georgia after a protracted sixty-six ballot contest.

In July 1850, Daniel Webster resigned from the United States Senate to become Secretary of State amid outrage over his support for the Compromise of 1850. Governor George Briggs appointed Winthrop to succeed him, but the 1850 Massachusetts elections resulted in a three-way split of the legislature between Whigs and the Democratic and Free Soil parties, which joined in an anti-Whig coalition. After a divisive fifty-one ballot election, Free Soilers and anti-slavery Democrats united to elect Charles Sumner, an abolitionist lawyer, to the seat. Winthrop made a final run for public office in November of that year when he stood for governor but was again defeated by the Free Soil-Democratic coalition. Though he received a plurality of all votes cast, the majority rule in place at the time sent the election to the Massachusetts General Court, where the coalition legislators again denied Winthrop by re-electing Governor George S. Boutwell. For the remainder of his life, Winthrop remained publicly involved as a Christian conservative and unionist but never again ran for public office.

==Early life==
Robert Charles Winthrop was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Thomas Lindall Winthrop (1760–1841), the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, and Elizabeth Bowdoin Temple (1769–1825), who were married on July 25, 1786. He was the youngest of 13 children.

His maternal grandparents were Sir John Temple, 8th Baronet (1731–1798), the first British envoy to the United States, and Elizabeth Bowdoin, the daughter of James Bowdoin (1726–1790), the governor of Massachusetts. His paternal great-great-grandfathers were Joseph Dudley (1647–1720) and Wait Still Winthrop (1641/2–1717).

Winthrop attended the prestigious Boston Latin School, and graduated from Harvard University in 1828, which he attended with Dr. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, George Stillman Hillard, Judge John Gilchrist, Edward Sprague Rand, and others of note.

==Career==
After studying law with Daniel Webster he was admitted to the bar in 1831 and practiced in Boston. At 24, he served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1835 to 1840, and served as Speaker of the House of that body from 1838 to 1840. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838.

Winthrop was elected US Representative from Massachusetts as a Whig to the 26th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Abbott Lawrence; he was reelected to the 27th Congress and served from November 9, 1840, to May 25, 1842, when he resigned due to the death of his wife.

He was subsequently elected to the 27th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of his successor, Nathan Appleton; he was reelected to the 28th and to the three succeeding Congresses and served from November 29, 1842, until July 30, 1850. He served as the speaker of the House during the 30th Congress (1847–1849), but could not secure a second term, losing the 1849 speakership election to Howell Cobb in a protracted 63-ballot contest. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.

After Daniel Webster resigned from the United States Senate to become Secretary of State in 1850, Winthrop resigned from the House and, at 41, was appointed by fellow Whig governor George Briggs to fill the remainder of Webster&#x27;s Senate term. Winthrop&#x27;s views proved no more palatable to abolitionists than did Webster&#x27;s, and he failed to win reelection by the state legislature to either of Massachusetts&#x27; Senate seats in 1851. He resigned without completing his term immediately following his election loss. Later that year, Winthrop actually won a popular plurality in the race for Massachusetts governor but as the state Constitution required a majority, the election was thrown into the legislature. The same coalition of Democrats and Free Soilers defeated him again. His final venture into elected political office was as a presidential elector on the Whig ticket in 1852. Afterwards, Winthrop became an independent, unsuccessfully supporting Millard Fillmore, John Bell, and George McClellan.

===Later career===
With his political career over at the young age of 43, Winthrop spent the remainder of his life in literary, historical, and philanthropic pursuits. He was a major early patron of the Boston Public Library and president of the Massachusetts Historical Society from 1855 to 1885, during which time he wrote a biography of his ancestor John Winthrop. In 1880, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. He served as the president of the Massachusetts Bible Society for several years where he advocated that Christian morality was the necessary condition of a free society. His most notable Christian philosophy for governing men, was as follows:

Men, in a word, must necessarily be controlled either by a power within them or by a power without them; either by the Word of God or by the strong arm of man; either by the Bible or by the bayonet.

His most notable contributions came as permanent chairman and president of the Peabody Education Fund Trustees, which he served from 1867 to his death. As well as steering the contributions of the Peabody Trust, Winthrop gave his own money to various Southern schools, the most long lasting of which was the $1,500 of seed money provided to a teacher&#x27;s college that renamed itself Winthrop University in gratitude. He became a noted orator, delivering two speeches in 1870: the eulogy for George Peabody and on the celebration of the landing of the Pilgrims. He also spoke at the ceremony that opened the Washington Monument in 1848. Winthrop was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in October 1894.

In 1892, in a celebration of his birth, it was noted that he had the distinction of having known every President of the United States except Washington and Jefferson.

==Personal life==

On March 12, 1832, he married Elizabeth Cabot Blanchard (1809–1842), the daughter of Francis Blanchard (1784–1813) and Mary Ann Cabot (1784–1809), and the adopted daughter of Samuel P. Gardner. Elizabeth&#x27;s elder half-brother was banker John Clarke Lee, founder of Lee, Higginson &amp; Co. Before her death, Robert and Elizabeth had three children:

* Robert Charles Winthrop Jr. (1834–1905), who married Frances Pickering Adams (1836–1860). After her death, he married Elizabeth Mason (1844–1924), daughter of Robert Means Mason (1810–1879) and Sarah Ellen Francis (1819–1865) and granddaughter of Jeremiah Mason, on June 1, 1869.
* Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Cabot Winthrop (1838–1921)
* John Winthrop (b. 1841)

After Elizabeth&#x27;s death, he married his second wife, Laura (née Derby) Welles, widow of Arnold Francis Welles. Laura was the daughter of attorney John Derby and granddaughter of Elias Hasket Derby, on November 6, 1849. They remained married until her death in 1861.

On November 15, 1865, he married for the third and final time, to Adele (née Granger) Thayer (1820–1892), the widow of John E. Thayer. She was the daughter of Francis Granger, the postmaster general under President William Henry Harrison and Cornelia Rutsen Van Rensselaer.

Winthrop died in Boston in 1894, and is interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. In his will, he left bequests to the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Boston Provident Association, the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, the Library of the Boston Latin School, and the library of the Sunday school of Trinity Church, Boston.

===Descendants===
His granddaughter, Robert Jr.&#x27;s daughter Margaret Tyndal Winthrop (1880–1970), married James Grant Forbes on November 28, 1906. James and Margaret were the parents of Rosemary Isabel Forbes, who married Richard John Kerry and were the parents of John Forbes Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, U.S. senator and 2004 presidential candidate. James and Margaret also are the parents of Fiona Diedre Forbes (1924–2010), who married Alain Gauthier Lalonde (1913–1974), the parents of Brice Lalonde, French Minister of the Environment and 1981 French presidential candidate.

<text>The Atlanta Marriott Marquis is a 47-story, Marriott hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is the 15th tallest skyscraper in the city. The building was designed by Atlanta architect John C. Portman Jr. and supported by local engineer Blake Van Leer with construction completed in 1985, and because of its bulging base, it is often referred to as the &quot;Pregnant Building&quot; or the &quot;Coca Cola&quot; building as it looks like a bottle of Coke from the side elevation.

One of the defining features of the Marriott Marquis is its large atrium. It was the largest in the world upon its completion in 1985, at 470 feet (143 m) high. The atrium spans the entire height of the building and consists of two vertical chambers divided by elevator shafts and bridges. The record was later broken by the Burj Al Arab in Dubai.

The hotel would undergo its first renovation in 2007, costing $138 million and lasting for three years between 2005 and 2008. This included a Starbucks Coffee, new restaurants, a new pool, new meeting rooms, a new spa, refurbished guest rooms, and other updates. Then in 2015, it was once again remodeled with a cost of $78 million and featuring updates such as new guest rooms, Stay Well rooms, a concierge lounge and more.

The 42nd floor features a concierge lounge that is only open to guests staying on the 42nd through the 47th floors.

In the films &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot; and &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1&quot;, some scenes of the Capitol&#x27;s tribute center were filmed here. Some scenes of the 2012 movie &quot;Flight&quot; were shot in the hotel as well. The atrium is also seen briefly in the 1986 movie &quot;Manhunter,&quot; and the 2023 film &quot;Ghosted&quot;. It was also used as the Time Variance Authority headquarters in the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot;.

<text>Jean-François Collin d&#x27;Harleville (30 May 1755 – 24 February 1806) was a French dramatist.

He was born at Maintenon (Eure-et-Loir). His first dramatic success was &quot;L&#x27;Inconstant&quot;, a comedy accepted by the Comédie Française in 1780, but not produced there until six years later, though it was played elsewhere in 1784. This was followed by &quot;L&#x27;Optimiste, ou l&#x27;homme toujours content&quot; (1788), and &quot;Châteaux en Espagne&quot; (1789). His best play, &quot;Le vieux célibataire&quot;, appeared in 1793.

Among his other plays are the one-act comedy &quot;Monsieur de Crac dans son petit castel&quot; (1791), &quot;Les Artistes&quot; (1796), &quot;Les Mœurs du jour&quot; (1800) and &quot;Malice pour malice&quot; (1803).

Collin was one of the original members of the Institute of France, and died in Paris.

The 1822 edition of his &quot;Théâtre et poésies fugitives&quot; contains a notice by his friend the dramatist François Andrieux. His &quot;Théâtre&quot; was also edited by Louis Moland in 1876; and by Edouard Thierry in 1882.
