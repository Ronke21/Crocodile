<text>Soukous (from French &quot;&quot;, &quot;shock, jolt, jerk&quot;) is a genre of dance music originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) and the Republic of the Congo (formerly French Congo). It derived from Congolese rumba in the 1960s, with faster dance rhythms and bright, intricate guitar improvisation, and gained popularity in the 1980s in France. Although often used by journalists as a synonym for Congolese rumba, both the music and dance associated with soukous differ from more traditional rumba, especially in its higher tempo, song structures and longer dance sequences.

Soukous fuses traditional Congolese rhythms with contemporary instruments. It customarily incorporates electric guitars, double bass, congas, clips, and brass/woodwinds. Soukous lyrics often explore themes of love, social commentary, amorous narratives, philosophical musings, and ordinary struggles and successes. Singers occasionally sing and croon in Lingala, Kikongo, French and Swahili and bands often consist of a primary vocalist accompanied by several backing singers.

== Characteristics ==
The music typically utilizes a time signature and major chords articulated in arpeggiated forms. Soukous lead guitarists are renowned for their speed, precision, and nimble fingerwork, often navigating the higher registers of the fretboard. The bassline, inspired by hand-drum percussion patterns, is the genre&#x27;s rhythmic foundation and is typically characterized by a 16th-note cadence. Emerging prominently during Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s reign in Zaire, the assertive bass style of soukous emulated regimented motions of military marches (&quot;marche militaire&quot;). This distinctive bass approach involves toggling between lower and higher registers, achieved through a plucking method that employs both the thumb (&quot;p&quot;) and index finger (&quot;i&quot;). 

Tonally, soukous is shaped by specific configurations in the bass, midrange, and treble frequencies. The bass is generally accentuated by +3 dB to yield a deep, full-bodied low-end that supports the groove. The midrange, especially around the 700 Hz frequency, is often left flat or enhanced by as much as +6 dB. Meanwhile, the treble frequencies are either left flat or attenuated slightly by -3 dB. 

In Matonge, the rhythmic guitar typically accompanies mid-tempo vocal passages, with the bass and bass drums accentuating the dominant beats, while guitarists emphasize the offbeats (one &quot;and&quot; two &quot;and&quot; three &quot;and&quot; four &quot;and&quot;). During vocal performances, the lead guitarist lays down a groove that underpins harmonized call-and-response singing, often intensified by an echo effect, producing an auditory experience sometimes described as a hypnotic auditory experience. 

The percussion section is characterized by an unyielding, fast-paced beat, most commonly referred to as cavacha, with the drummer taking the lead in signaling shifts for the guitarists to match the lead player&#x27;s transitions. Soukous chord progressions mainly rely on the I, IV, and V chords. Common progressions include:

# I - I - IV - IV
# I - IV - V
# I -I - V-V
# I - IV/V
# V/IV - I
# I/IV - IV/I
# I - V- I - V
# V/IV - I

==History==
=== Origins ===

The origins of the genre can be traced back to Congolese rumba, which emerged in the early 20th century when urban residents of the French Congo and the Belgian Congo embraced the fusion of intertribal Kongolese &quot;maringa&quot; dance music near Pool Malebo, infused with guitar techniques from Liberia. The outflow of Kru merchants and sailors from Liberia to Brazzaville during the mid-19th century introduced distinctive guitar-playing techniques that ultimately influenced the use of the accordion to emulate local &quot;likembe&quot; (thumb piano, best known worldwide as a mbira) rhythms. As early as 1902, the accordion&#x27;s melodies resonated through the streets near Pool Malebo&#x27;s factories.

The outbreak of World War I introduced a new wave of music and dance across the Lower Congo (present-day Kongo Central) and the Pool Malebo region. Emerging from labor camp and conceivably associated with the return of Matadi–Kinshasa Railway construction workers, local dances such as agbaya and maringa gained prominence. The circular agbaya dance was soon replaced by partnered maringa dance music, becoming increasingly ubiquitous in Matadi, Boma, Brazzaville, and Léopoldville (now Kinshasa).
Initially, maringa bands featured the &quot;likembe&quot; for melody, a metal rod-struck bottle for rhythm, and a small skin-covered frame drum called &quot;patenge&quot; for counter-rhythms. However, by the 1920s, accordions and acoustic guitars progressively supplanted the &quot;likembe&quot; as melody instruments. The distinctive hip movements of &quot;maringa&quot; dancers, shifting their body weight between legs gained popularity. By 1935, partnered dancing&#x27;s popularity dispersed expeditiously across the Congo basin, reaching even remote villages. Dance halls emerged in towns and rural areas, while conventional dancing persisted in palm branch huts. 

In the early 1940s, Pool Malebo transformed from a barrier into a communication channel linking Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The Cuban son groups like Sexteto Habanero, Trio Matamoros, and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were broadcast on Radio Congo Belge, gaining popularity in the country. Due to influence of Cuban son, the maringa dance music—although unrelated to Cuban rumba—became known as &quot;rumba Congolaise&quot; as the imported records of Sexteto Habanero and Trio Matamoros were often mislabeled as &quot;rumba&quot;. Ethnomusicology Professor Kazadi wa Mukuna of Kent State University explicates that the term &quot;rumba&quot; persisted in the Congos due to recording industry interests. Recording studio proprietors reinterpreted the term rumba by attributing it new &quot;maringa&quot; rhythm while retaining the name. Consequently, their music became recognized as &quot;Congolese rumba&quot; or &quot;African rumba&quot;. Antoine Wendo Kolosoy became the first star of Congolese rumba touring Europe and North America with his band Victoria Bakolo Miziki. His 1948 hit &quot;Marie-Louise,&quot; co-written with guitarist Henri Bowane, gained popularity across West Africa. Congolese rumba gained prominence in Congolese music as early pioneers revolutionized their relationship with the instruments they held.

=== Formation and paternity debate ===
Etymologically, the term &quot;soukous&quot;, derived from the French verb &quot;secouer&quot;, denoting &quot;to shake,&quot; initially described a person who moved jerkily but evolved into a dance style synonymous with vitality and cadence. The term &quot;secousse&quot; evolved over time, transitioning to &quot;soucousses&quot; and eventually &quot;soucous&quot; in colloquial language and the media, until the &quot;&quot;c&quot; fell out of favor, replaced by a &quot;k&quot;&quot;.

During the early 1960s, a surge of young Congolese musicians sought to speed up the slow tempo of Congolese rumba, which precipitated the emergence of soukous. Artists began incorporating faster rhythms, and prominent guitar improvisation, often characterized by high-pitched, fast-paced lines imbued with more heightened African motif. The drummer shifts to the high-octane cadence, wherein the clave rhythm shifts to the snare drum, singers engage in rhythmic chanting (&quot;animation&quot;), and lead guitars take center stage.
The origins of soukous are a matter of dispute, with divergent attributions and viewpoints. Clément Ossinondé, a Congolese musicologist specializing in Congolese music, accredits Franco Luambo and TPOK Jazz with pioneering soukous, citing his &quot;odemba&quot;-inspired style, known for its fast tempo. Franco is also recognized for revolutionizing the genre&#x27;s themes by infusing significant social and political issues into the lyrics, making the music a platform for social consciousness. Conversely, British writer Gary Stewart suggests that soukous evolved into both a music genre and dance style in Brazzaville, stemming from the establishment of the Super Band in 1964 by up-and-coming guitarist Jacques Kimbembe. The ensemble, later rebranded as Sinza, meaning &quot;root stock,&quot; introduced soukous to Brazzaville&#x27;s nightlife in 1966, supplanting the traditional boucher style of Les Bantous de la Capitale. Stewart further notes that Orchestre Sinza innovated soukous in 1968 with a new wrinkle called &quot;mossaka&quot;, and soon thereafter, Nico Kasanda introduced the kiri-kiri, which was based in part on the &quot;jerk&quot; from Western rock. Meanwhile, Les Bantous de la Capitale developed a fusion with Pablito&#x27;s song &quot;Masuwa,&quot; billed as a &quot;soucous&quot;-&quot;kiri-kiri&quot;. The kiri-kiri, which, according to Stewart, became a defining piece of the genre as exemplified by Nico&#x27;s &quot;Kiri-Kiri Mabina Ya Sika,&quot; telling the story of a man&#x27;s quest through Kinshasa&#x27;s streets to reunite with his partner for a kiri-kiri session at Fiesta Sukisa, gaining widespread acclaim. Established artists rapidly embraced the dance and disseminated it across the continent.

===1960s and 1970s===

==== Europe and the United States ====

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, soukous became a predominant popular African dance style across Africa and into the continent&#x27;s diaspora in Belgium, France, the UK, and the United States. During this period, a surge of Zairean musicians moved to Belgium and France, primarily driven by the hegemony of the Mobutu Sese Seko regime, which propagated propaganda songs as part of the &quot;Authenticité&quot; campaign to foster a sense of national identity and pride through ideological slogans of the one-party state, the Movement Populaire de la Révolution (MPR). This state ideological shift gradually infiltrated Zairean popular music, with popular musicians embracing the regime&#x27;s ideology and documenting its achievements. Mobutu&#x27;s encouragement of urban musicians paralleled Mao Zedong&#x27;s approach in China, where music served the revolution. As a result, the globalization of Congolese urban music expanded, leading to a massive exodus of musicians to African and European countries, most notably Belgium and France. Many youths with limited employment options gravitated towards a music career, with Kinshasa&#x27;s soukous scene becoming an attractive choice. However, some faced obstacles in establishing themselves in France. Against this backdrop, Tabu Ley Rochereau made history as the first African artist invited to perform at Paris&#x27;s Olympia Hall in December 1970, where he attracted few connoisseurs and set a precedent for subsequent Zairean musicians. Abeti Masikini followed suit, becoming the second Zairean and the first female soukous artist to grace the Olympia stage alongside Mireille Mathieu and Hugues Aufray. This momentum continued with Masikini&#x27;s performance at Carnegie Hall in New York on 11 March 1974, setting the stage for burgeoning singers, griots, and other lesser-known divas from Africa.

Concurrently, the M&#x27;Bamina orchestra ventured to Paris before seeking audiences in Italy in 1972. Pablo &#x27;Porthos&#x27; Lubadika arrived in Paris in 1979 with singer Sam Mangwana through Lomé, Togo, after recording under the name the African All Stars. Mangwana, having collaborated with nearly every prominent figure in Congo, relocated to Abidjan in 1978 to pursue better opportunities. He formed a new band of Congolese economic exiles, who became regulars in Parisian session bands. The African All Stars&#x27; breakout hit, &quot;Suzana Coulibaly,&quot; released on 31 December 1979, featured &quot;simple, repetitive rhythms&quot; at a faster tempo than traditional Congolese rumba. Mangwana&#x27;s exclamation &quot;soukous sophistiqué&quot; as Lokassa Ya M&#x27;Bongo and Rigo Star crafted a &quot;rock-solid&quot; sebene solidified the record&#x27;s direction, initiating an independent musical movement targeting the international market. As their influence grew, the African All Stars adapted the fast, rough stylings of youth bands in Brazzaville and Kinshasa, introducing this new tempo globally.

==== Africa ====
Across Africa, soukous dominated East African nightclubs&#x27; dance floors and played a pivotal role in shaping virtually all the styles of contemporary African popular music, including benga music, muziki wa dansi, Kidandali, Igbo highlife, palm-wine music, taarab, and inspiring the establishment of approximately 350 youth orchestras in Kinshasa, paving the way for new traditional dances, rhythmic patterns, and bands.

As sociopolitical turmoil in Zaire deteriorated in the 1970s, a great number of musicians ventured to Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, where orchestras sustained themselves through record sales and consistent stage performances. By the early 1970s, several Congolese bands had taken up the soukous beat in Kenyan nightclubs. The vivacious cavacha dance craze, propagated by bands like Zaïko Langa Langa and Orchestra Shama Shama, swept across East and Central Africa, exert influence on Kenyan musicians. The utilization of the cavacha rhythm, typically played on the snare drum or high-hat, became emblematic of the Zairean sound in Nairobi and was frequently adopted by regional bands. Prominent Congolese rumba Swahili bands in Nairobi formed around Tanzanian groups like Simba Wanyika, giving rise to offshoots like Les Wanyika and Super Wanyika Stars. Maroon Commandos, a Nairobi-based ensemble, assimilated the soukous style while infusing their distinctive artistic imprint. Japanese students in Kenya, including Rio Nakagawa, developed a fondness for Congolese music, with Rio eventually spearheading Yoka Choc Nippon, a Japanese-conceived Congolese rumba band.
Virgin Records produced albums by the Tanzanian-Zairean Orchestra Makassy and the Kenya-based Orchestra Super Mazembe. The Swahili song &quot;Shauri Yako&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s your problem&quot;) gained widespread acclaim in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Another influential Zairean ensemble, Les Mangelepa, relocated to Kenya and achieved immense popularity across East Africa. Zairean singer Samba Mapangala and his band Orchestra Virunga, based in Nairobi, released the LP &quot;Malako&quot;, which became a pioneering release in Europe&#x27;s emerging world music scene. Meanwhile, between 1976 and 1977, Sam Mangwana and the African All Stars dominated the dance halls of Kinshasa with records produced in West Africa, which were different from the sounds produced in the two-track studios of Kinshasa. Following this, there was a migration to Lomé and Cotonou, followed by Franco Luambo&#x27;s departure to Belgium.

In Nigeria, soukous became widespread due to the transmission of Zairean music through Radio Brazzaville, where audiences were introduced to material from &quot;Zaire Vol. 6&quot; (Soundpoint SOP 044, 1978). Soukous catalyzed the emergence of a distinct genre of guitar-based Igbo highlife music, exemplified by musicians like Oliver De Coque, the Oriental Brothers International, and their various imitators and followers. The superabundance of Nigerian pressings of Zairean music featured the musicians who influenced this trend, as seen in the case of &quot;Music From Zaire Vol. 6&quot;, which showcased artists from Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta&#x27;s stable like Orchestre Kiam, Orchestre Lipua-Lipua, and the cavacha rhythm. There was a prevalent inclination to exclude the slower &quot;A&quot; sides of various recordings and instead focus on the climactic sebene, the faster and more improvisational second half. This structural paradigm became emblematic of Igbo guitar highlife recordings epitomized by the music style of Oliver De Coque and Oriental Brothers International.

Soukous experienced widespread diffusion across southern Africa, where it was both adopted and adapted into various offshoots, such as Zimbabwe&#x27;s immensely popular sungura genre.

==== Colombia ====
During this epoch, African music began procuring popularity globally due to the world music movement. In Colombia, soukous made inroads into the local culture, contributing to the development of champeta. In the third chapter of the documentary &quot;Pasos de la Cumbia&quot;, Lucas Silva, a DJ and cultural producer specializing in African music, recounts how Mobutu Sese Seko purchased a plane in Colombia. When it required maintenance, a Colombian mechanic traveled to Zaire, returning with a collection of 45 rpm records, including the iconic &quot;El Mambote&quot; by l&#x27;Orchestre Veve, which became a hit. Other 45 rpm records soon flooded Cartagena and Barranquilla. 

In the article &quot;Champeta is Liberation&quot;&quot;: The Indestructible Sound System Culture of Afro-Colombia&quot;, journalist April Clare Welsh observes, &quot;When &#x27;música Africana&#x27; swept the region during the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, sound systems were instrumental in forging a collective diasporic identity for Afro-Colombians in a society deeply divided by race and class&quot;. African musicians like Kanda Bongo Man, Nicolas Kasanda wa Mikalay, Diblo Dibala, Ikenga Super Stars of Africa, M&#x27;bilia Bel, and Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens became local celebrities, forging a &quot;pan-African connection that was, at the time, largely unknown to many Africans within the continent&quot;. Local musicians began replicating the arrangements of Congolese artists like Nicolas Kasanda wa Mikalay, Tabu Ley Rochereau, M&#x27;bilia Bel, Syran Mbenza, Lokassa Ya M&#x27;Bongo, Pépé Kallé, Rémy Sahlomon, and Kanda Bongo Man. Homegrown musicians such as Viviano Torres, Luis Towers, and Charles King became renowned for this. This movement led to the creation of champeta, a genre rooted in &quot;soukous guitars, bass, drumming, and dance&quot;. Due to its overtly sensual dance moves and its association with the &quot;Black Below&quot;, champeta was derided by the white upper classes. However, for Afro-Colombians, it was an assertion of their cultural identity and resilience. DJs often renamed African songs with Spanish titles, composed champetas in the Palenque language (a creole fusion of Spanish and Bantu languages such as Kikongo and Lingala), or phonetically distorted the original names. For instance, Mbilia Bel&#x27;s &quot;Mobali Na Ngai Wana&quot; became known in Colombia as &quot;La Bollona&quot;. Champeta emerged as a new marker of Black identity along Colombia&#x27;s western coast and evolved from a peripheral genre to a mainstream national phenomenon. During the Super Bowl LIV halftime show on 2 February 2020, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, Shakira danced to Syran Mbenza&#x27;s &quot;Icha&quot;, a song colloquially referred to as &quot;El Sebastián&quot; in Colombia, which spawned the #ChampetaChallenge on social media platforms worldwide.

===1980s and the Paris scene===

As sociopolitical unrest persisted in Zaire throughout the 1980s, numerous musicians sought refuge across Africa, with a considerable number relocating to Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Some traversed through Central and East Africa before ultimately establishing their operational bases in Europe. Soukous gained traction in Brussels, Paris, and London, emerging as the only sub-Saharan African genre universally embraced in Belgium and France. According to Congolese columnist Achille Ngoye, Belgium offered a significant permanent operational base for numerous Zairean artists. Orchestras such as Los Nickelos, Yéyé National, and Les Mongali, predominantly composed of students, garnered significant attention in Belgium. Uncle Yorgho, a former member of OK Jazz, established a distribution epicenter for Zairean musical repertoire in Brussels in July 1980 (Visa 80). Meanwhile, Dieudonné Kabongo, Dizzy Mandjeku, and Ntesa Dalienst rose to prominence due to the bankruptcy of Belgian record label Fonior!, which prompted many Zairean artists like Lita Bembo and Matima to seek reputable distribution entities in Belgium, while others found solace in performing in religious choirs, which frequently toured Holland.

Soukous was chosen by Island Records producer Ben Mandelson and Togolese entrepreneur Richard Dick as the title of a 1982 compilation, &quot;Sound D&#x27;Afrique II: Soukous&quot;. The compilation included music from Mali and Cameroon alongside &quot;Madeleina,&quot; a track from Pablo &#x27;Porthos&#x27; Lubadika&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Ma Coco&quot;, which gained significant attention in Europe. Zaïko Langa Langa introduced the role of a dedicated hypeman—known as &quot;atalaku&quot; or &quot;animateur&quot;—into the ensemble of singers, setting a trend that almost every band on the Congolese music scene adopted, making atalakus emblematic of soukous as well as Congolese rumba. Zaïko Langa Langa achieved significant success, becoming the third generation of Congolese music as many founding members split off to form their own groups, which in turn splintered into more groups: Isife Lokole, Grand Zaïko Wa Wa, Langa Langa Stars, Clan Langa Langa, Choc Stars, and Anti-Choc among them. Papa Wemba and Viva La Musica made the longest-lasting impact, partly due to Wemba&#x27;s ability to maintain a presence in both Paris and Kinshasa with dual bands, one focusing on soukous and another featuring French session players for international pop. In Parisian studios, the seben guitars blended with the tight drum machines and synths of zouk and funky disco makossa on numerous records. However, this fusion received criticism for deviating from authentic Congolese styles. Notable critics like Nyboma argued that the music had become commercialized and lacked emotional depth, calling for a return to the fundamentals of &quot;beautiful melodies and highly tuned voices.&quot;

The influx of Zairean artists to France catalyzed the proliferation of Parisian studios as epicenters for soukous production, with an increasing reliance on synthesizers and electronic instruments. Some artists continued to record for the Congolese market, but others abandoned the demands of the Kinshasa public and set out to pursue new audiences. A sizable Zairean community established itself in France and Switzerland, with Zairean artists conducting training programs in the country. Kanda Bongo Man, another Paris-based artist, pioneered fast, short tracks conducive for play on dance floors worldwide, popularly known as kwassa kwassa, after the dance moves popularized in his and other artists&#x27; music videos. This music appealed to Africans and to new audiences as well. Artists like Diblo Dibala, Aurlus Mabélé, Tchicl Tchicaya, Jeannot Bel Musumbu, M&#x27;bilia Bel, Yondo Sister, Tinderwet, Loketo, Rigo Star, Nyboma, Madilu System, Soukous Stars and veterans like Pépé Kallé and Koffi Olomidé followed suit. Soon Paris became home to talented studio musicians who recorded for the African and Caribbean markets and filled out bands for occasional tours. Diblo Dibala and Aurlus Mabélé dominated the clubs with &quot;Africa Moussou&quot;, creating a hyperactive style of super-speed soukous, dubbed &quot;TGV soukous&quot; by fans, alluding to France&#x27;s high-speed trains.

Swede-Swede, an ensemble exclusively employing traditional instruments, operates out of Belgium, while Les Malo, primarily comprising former instructors from the National Institute of Arts in Kinshasa, specializes in Afro-jazz in Lyon. Tshala Muana gained prominence in Africa and Europe for her Luba traditional hip-swaying dance known as &quot;mutuashi&quot;, which make waves across African stadiums and earned her the moniker of &quot;Queen of Mutuashi&quot;. Other female vocalists such as Déesse Mukangi, Djena Mandako, Faya Tess, Isa, and Abby Surya garnered widespread recognition.

==Ndombolo==
By the late 1990s, musicians such as Radja Kula, Wenge Musica, Koffi Olomidé, Général Defao, and Extra Musica metamorphosed soukous into raunchy, frenetic hip-swinging dance music, renaming it &quot;ndombolo&quot;. This style surged in popularity across Africa and into the continent&#x27;s diaspora in Belgium, France, the UK, Germany, Canada, and the United States. However, by the early 2000s, ndombolo faced scrutiny, with accusations of obscenity leading to attempts to prohibit it from state media in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, and Kenya. In February 2005, ndombolo music videos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underwent censorship for indecency, which resulted in the banning of videos by Koffi Olomidé, JB MPiana, and Werrason from airwaves. Despite the censure, ndombolo record sales surged, remaining popular with new releases dominating discos, bars, and clubs across Africa.

<doc id="500069" wikidata="Q60450" url="?curid=500069" title="Curtis Institute of Music">
<text>The Curtis Institute of Music is a private conservatory in Philadelphia. It offers a performance diploma, a Bachelor of Music, Master of Music in opera, and a Professional Studies Certificate in opera. All students attend on a full scholarship. The Institute also offers needs based financial aid to help cover living expenses.

==History==
===20th century===

The Curtis Institute of Music was founded in 1924, following the formation of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1900 and the Philadelphia Opera Company in 1908 and amidst industrial decline and political corruption in Philadelphia. The institute&#x27;s founder, Mary Louise Curtis Bok, a philanthropist, administrator, and major proponent of the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia, named the new school after her father, publishing magnate Cyrus Curtis.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania chartered the Curtis Institute on April 18, 1924, which opened in October 1925 on three mansions on 1727 and 1720 Locust Street and 235 South 18th Street. Both the Curtis Institute and the Settlement Music School shared a building at Queen Street in South Philadelphia for the first year.

Bok established the institute to train talented musicians for professional careers and to teach music for its own sake and not as a means to another end. In an official statement, Bok wrote about the goals and expectations of the institution: “It is my aim that earnest students shall acquire a thorough musical education not learning only to sing or play, but also the history of music, the laws of its making, languages, ear training and musical appreciation. They shall learn to think and to express their thoughts against a background of a quiet culture, with the stimulus of personal contact with artist teachers who represent the highest and finest in their art. The aim is for quality of the work rather than quick, showy results.”

When the institute opened, it included two distinct divisions: a preparatory division for 400 students and a conservatory for 200 students. Tuition was five hundred dollars, and the school opened with 357 students. Mary Bok became the conservatory’s first president, a position she would hold until 1969. Johann Grolle served as the first school director for one year, William E. Walter became director in 1925 and Josef Hofmann, head of the piano department, became director in 1927. The institute added a library in 1925 with over 5,000 volumes. Other notable original faculty included conductor Leopold Stokowski, violinist Carl Flesch, pianists David Saperton and Isabelle Vengerova, singers Marcella Sembrich and Andreas Dippel, cellist Michel Penha, and flutist William Kincaid.

Under Josef Hofmann as director, Curtis made several new changes to advance the school&#x27;s standards and publicize the school. Hofmann reduced enrollment to ensure that students would receive individualized attention. Curtis initiated weekly radio broadcasts through CBS in 1929. The Curtis String Quartet was established in 1928 and lasted until 1981. From 1931 to 1941, Fritz Reiner served as the conductor of the Curtis Orchestra, who toured with the orchestra throughout the country and broadcast the orchestra on the radio. The school held its first commencement a decade after opening, awarding Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees.

Starting in the late 1920s, Curtis made significant changes to fully support students financially. In 1928, Mrs. Louis Bok expanded the school&#x27;s first endowment of $500,000 to $12.5 million. The school started providing summer residency programs for advanced students in the United States or Europe. The new funds further allowed all students to study at Curtis at no cost. Since 1928, the institute has not charged tuition; it provides full scholarships to all admitted students. Instead, students pay comprehensive fees and other additional fees to cover the cost of maintaining buildings, health insurance, meal plans, a library fee, and a graduation fee. As of fall 2023, the comprehensive fee for Curtis is $3,500, and the health insurance fee, which can be waived if a parental health insurance plan provides adequate protection, of $2,500. With the new endowment, the school purchased several Steinway pianos and enough instruments for an orchestra so that students would not have to pay for instruments.

The school faced financial difficulties in the 1930s, decreased enrollment, and had to remove some departments and reduce salaries. Josef Hoffman resigned in 1938 and was succeeded by Randall Thompson, who became director in 1939 and held the post for two years. Thompson introduced mandatory weekly lectures providing an overview of music history. Violinist Efrem Zimbalist, who had become the head of the violin department in 1930 at Curtis, replaced Thompson as director in 1941. Under Zimbalist, the institute focused more on training soloists and cutting down on costs, which became especially necessary during the war years. This focus caused a shift away from orchestra, opera, and chamber music and a reduction of the instrumental faculty. Due to the war, enrollment decreased from 223 in 1937 to 100 in 1942. In 1944, the Curtis Alumni Association established a concert office to assist graduates in their professions.

===21st century===
In 2020, following credible allegations of abuse at the hands of past faculty, the school ended its practice of keeping students enrolled &quot;at the discretion of their major instrument teacher&quot;. In accepting the findings of an independent investigation of abuse allegations that found the practice was a &quot;real threat&quot; and a student &quot;could be dismissed for any reason at any time&quot;, Curtis pledged several other steps to ensure students&#x27; well-being, including providing them with access to counseling.

==Admission==
The institute formerly served as a training ground for orchestral musicians to fill the ranks of the Philadelphia Orchestra, although composers, organists, pianists, guitarists, and singers are offered courses of study as well.

With the exception of composers, conductors, pianists, organists, and guitarists, admission is granted only to the number of students to fill a single orchestra and opera company. Accordingly, enrollment is in the range of 150 to 175 students. According to statistics compiled by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the institute has the lowest acceptance rate of any college or university (4 percent), making it among the most selective institutions of higher education in the United States.

Nina Simone claimed her application for a scholarship was rejected because of her race, despite her excellent credentials and audition performance. Simone was one of 75 pianists to audition in 1951; only three were accepted. A short while before her death, Simone was awarded an honorary diploma by Curtis.

==Campus==
===Gould Rehearsal Hall===

Gould Rehearsal Hall A 2,850-square-foot, acoustically designed rehearsal hall accommodates a full orchestra, with state-of-the-art video and audio capabilities.

Field Concert Hall is a 240-seat auditorium with facilities for both video and audio recording. The venue is used for weekly student recitals, faculty and alumni concerts, master classes, and recording sessions. It also houses a 5-manual, 116-rank Aeolian-Skinner organ.

===Rock Resource Center===
The Rock Resource Center of the Curtis Institute of Music contains more than 100,000 music scores, books, and recordings for study and performance. Comprising the John de Lancie Library and the Curtis Archives, the Rock Resource Center’s mission is to: provide Curtis students, faculty, and staff with the best possible collection of printed music, books, periodicals, recordings, and electronic resources needed to fulfill the school&#x27;s mission; promote the Rock Resource Center&#x27;s holdings through forward thinking and open patron service; and preserve and make Curtis’s past accessible to the greater Curtis community. The Curtis Archives comprises largely unpublished materials whose value derives from its collection by, ownership of, or relation to, a Curtis-affiliated individual. Non-Curtis collections of published and unpublished materials, as well as published materials by anyone (Curtis-related or not), can be found in Special Collections. Official Curtis recordings are part of the library collection.

====Penelope P. Watkins Ensemble in Residence====
The Dover Quartet is the Penelope P. Watkins Ensemble in Residence at Curtis. Their faculty residency integrates teaching and mentorship, and the resident ensemble will recruit promising young string quartets to nurture a new generation of professional chamber ensembles.

<text>Chen Lili (or Lili Chen, ; born February, 1980) is a transgender singer, model, and actress from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. She became widely known in 2004 when she competed and attempted to compete in beauty pageants as a woman.
She was born into a peasant family at Yilong County, Nanchong City of Sichuan Province. She received sex reassignment surgery in Qingdao in November 2003. On February 11, 2004, she was issued an ID card establishing her female identity by the Public Security Bureau of Nanchong.

Chen attempted to compete in the Miss Universe contest in early 2004. Although the Miss Universe China committee initially announced, on February 23, that she would be allowed to participate, on February 25, they retracted their original decision, stating that she would not be allowed to participate because she was not a &quot;natural female.&quot; Despite being barred from the competition, Chen was nonetheless given the opportunity to perform at the event. It is believed that Lili is the first transsexual woman to attempt to compete in the Miss Universe contest.

In late 2004, Chen competed in China&#x27;s first Miss Artificial Beauty pageant. She finished as second runner up.

In 2005, she appeared in the motion picture &quot;The Secret&quot; ().

==Notes==
Newspaper sources are not clear whether Chen attempted to enter and was rejected by the Miss World pageant or the Miss Universe pageant.

<text>University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is a public historically black land-grant research university in Princess Anne, Maryland. It is part of the University System of Maryland. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It was established as Delaware Conference Academy. It has also been known as Princess Anne Academy and other names during its evolution.

==History==
The University of Maryland Eastern Shore has been known by a series of names reflective of its location, evolving role, and mission over a period spanning three centuries. It opened September 13, 1886, under the auspices of the Delaware Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Benjamin and Portia Bird welcomed nine students that first day to a converted farmhouse on 16 acres. The school was at first envisioned as a preparatory school for the private Centenary Biblical Institute in Baltimore, which was affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1890 it changed its name to Morgan College to honor the first chairman of its board of trustees; and is now the public Morgan State University. By the end of the first academic year, 37 students were enrolled in the Delaware Conference Academy in Princess Anne.

Because of segregation in the state, African-American students could not enroll in the Maryland Agriculture College in College Park, which offered advanced instruction in farming techniques and related trades commonplace in the late 19th century. Congress enacted the Second Morrill Act of 1890, which required states to establish colleges for African-American students in order to continue to receive gain land-grant funds. The state of Maryland formalized a partnership with Morgan to underwrite &quot;land-grant&quot; education for African-Americans on Maryland&#x27;s lower Eastern Shore.

By the turn of the 20th century, the school was known widely as Princess Anne Academy, although in some circles it was informally referred to as Morgan&#x27;s &quot;industrial branch.&quot; The public-private partnership between the state and Morgan inspired another alternative name, at least according to state government archives: the Eastern Shore Branch of Maryland Agriculture College.

In the midst of the Great Depression, Maryland courts directed the state to admit qualified African-American applicants to its publicly funded law school in Baltimore. Historians believe this ruling led the state to convert Princess Anne Academy to a public institution.

Fifty years after opening, the school formally passed from church control to state ownership with the first of four $25,000 installment payments – just as it was developing as a baccalaureate degree-granting college. Maryland&#x27;s public flagship campus in College Park was designated its administrative agency. In 1948, the Eastern Shore Branch of the University of Maryland, then alternately known as Princess Anne College, was renamed as Maryland State College, a division of the University of Maryland.

Maryland State College became the University of Maryland Eastern Shore on July 1, 1970. Today it is one of 12 University System of Maryland public institutions of higher education. In addition to 745 acres on its main campus in Princess Anne, UMES also operates a 385-acre research farm in southern Somerset County, and the Paul S. Sarbanes Coastal Ecology Center on eight acres near Assateague Island in neighboring Worcester County.

UMES offers instruction in 37 undergraduate areas of study, as well as 15 master&#x27;s degrees and eight doctoral-degree programs; 27 are peer-accredited.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to UMES. Her donation is the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history.

==Academics==
The university comprises five schools:
*School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences
*School of Education, Social Sciences, and the Arts
*School of Business and Technology
*School of Pharmacy and Health Professions
*School of Graduate Studies

==Student profile==
==Athletics==

UMES was one of the founding members of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference in 1970. The school left the MEAC in 1979 but re-joined in 1981 and has been a member ever since. The Hawks compete in 15 sports at the Division I level: seven men&#x27;s and eight women&#x27;s. Prior to 1970, the university was a member of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association in Division II.

The school was once a powerhouse in black college football, producing five undefeated seasons between 1947 and 1960. As at many smaller colleges, the high costs associated with operating an NCAA Division I football program and complying with the federal Title IX gender-equity law became too much of a burden. The team was disbanded following the 1979 season.

In 1948, Maryland State College and Albright College played one of the first intercollegiate football games between an historically black institution and a majority-white institution.

After a consultant produced a study in 2012 on the feasibility of reinstating football, President Dr. Juliette B. Bell put together a task force to assess whether football should be reinstated. On February 28, 2013, they decided to continue without football, but noted that the topic &quot;may be revisited&quot; in five years.
NFL player and coach Art Shell attended UMES.

UMES is tied with Florida State for the most alumni appearing in a single Super Bowl game. In the 1968 game (Super Bowl III) between the New York Jets and the Baltimore Colts, UMES was represented by four alumni: Earl Christy (1961–1964), Johnny Sample (1954–1957), Emerson Boozer (1962–1965), and Charlie Stukes (1963–1967).

The UMES women&#x27;s bowling team won the NCAA Bowling Championship in 2012 in Ohio against Fairleigh Dickinson University and in 2008 in Omaha, Nebraska against Arkansas State University. They won the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match). The team was led by All-Tournament players Jessica Worsley (who was named the tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez. With the series win, UMES became the first HBCU to win a women&#x27;s NCAA national championship. The UMES women won their second 2011 NCAA Bowling Championship in Taylor, Michigan against Vanderbilt University, also winning the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match). Kristina Frahm (named tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez were named to the All-Tournament team en route to their victory. That season, along with the NCAA Championship, UMES also won the USBC Team Championships over Lindenwood University, as well as the MEAC Championship. In 2007, the women&#x27;s bowling team came in second at the NCAA National Championship in Orlando, Florida and fell to Vanderbilt in a 4–3 series. The team was led by All-Tournament players Marion Singleton and Jessica Worsley. The UMES women&#x27;s bowling team won the MEAC Championship in 2000, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

UMES men&#x27;s basketball is coached by Jason Crafton. The school led the nation in scoring during the 1973–1974 season with 97.6 points per game, including future NBA picks Rubin Collins, Talvin Skinner, William Gordon and Joe Pace. The team defeated Manhattan College 84–81 in the first round of the 1974 NIT and fell to Jacksonville University 85–83 in the quarterfinals. The team has never played in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

During the 2010–11 season, UMES had a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball player surpass the 1,000-career point mark. Hillary Haley passed the mark on the men&#x27;s side with a 24-point performance against Coppin State on February 19, including his first season at St. Bonaventure. On the women&#x27;s side, Casey Morton scored 10 points against Savannah State to surpass the mark, finishing with 1,230 in four years with the Lady Hawks. The next season, Adobi Agbasi finished third in Division I in blocks per game with 3.72 per contest, becoming the all-time shot-blocker in UMES women&#x27;s basketball history with 239 total blocks, achieving that mark on March 1, 2012, against Savannah State.
In 2011, the Hawks men&#x27;s outdoor track team was ranked third in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the U.S. Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association, and subsequently was the highest ranked team in the state of Maryland. The following season, three UMES outdoor track athletes earned All-America status: Lénora Guion-Firmin earned First Team in the 400-meter dash, later earning a spot with the French 4x400-meter team in the 2012 Summer Olympics, while Andre Walsh and Vanessa Henry, in the men&#x27;s 400-meter hurdles and women&#x27;s shot put, earned Second Team.
In 2014, The men&#x27;s side won the MEAC Cross Country Championships.

The UMES women&#x27;s volleyball team won its first MEAC championship in the history of the school in November 2011 with a win over Florida A&amp;M in the title game, earning its first NCAA Tournament berth ever. The Hawks fell to eventual national champion UCLA in the first round. In 2012, the team repeated as MEAC champions with another five-set win over Florida A&amp;M to advance to the NCAAs again, falling to 4-seed Nebraska in its first match. The team has won the MEAC Northern Division each of the past six years, combining to go 61–3 in conference regular season matches in that time, and also holds the longest current home-winning streak in Division I, being victorious in its last 30 matches at home.

<doc id="500085" wikidata="Q452804" url="?curid=500085" title="U.S. Route 491">
<text>U.S. Route 491 (US 491) is a north–south U.S. Highway serving the Four Corners region of the United States. It was created in 2003 as a renumbering of U.S. Route 666 (US 666). With the US 666 designation, the road was nicknamed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Highway&quot; because of the significance of the number 666 to many Christian denominations as the Number of the Beast. This Satanic connotation, combined with a high fatality rate along the New Mexico portion, convinced some people the highway was cursed. The problem was compounded by persistent sign theft. These factors led to two efforts to renumber the highway, first by officials in Arizona, then by those in New Mexico. There have been safety improvement projects since the renumbering, and fatality rates have subsequently decreased.

The highway, now a spur route of US 91 via its connection to US 191, runs through New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, as well as the tribal nations of the Navajo Nation and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. The highway passes by two mountains considered sacred by Native Americans: Ute Mountain and an extinct volcanic core named Shiprock. Other features along the route include Mesa Verde National Park and Dove Creek, Colorado, the self-proclaimed pinto-bean capital of the world.

==Route description==
US 491 serves the states of New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. Before 1992, US 666 also served Arizona. The Arizona portion was renumbered separately and is now part of US 191. The former US 666 was the only highway to have passed through each of the Four Corners states, even though it never came near the Four Corners Monument, which is accessed via US 160. At several points along US 491, mountain ranges in all of the Four Corners states are visible from a single location. The alignment of the highway is mostly north–south, however the Utah portion was signed east–west.

===New Mexico===

US 491 begins at Gallup, at a junction with Interstate 40 (I-40), and currently runs north along Muñoz Drive. The routing has changed to bypass the downtown area. The original route used 9th Street, starting at US 66. US 491 leaves Gallup and passes north through the eastern half of the Navajo Nation. Along the way, the road passes through the small tribal communities and trading posts of Tohatchi, Buffalo Springs, Naschitti, Sheep Springs and Newcomb. The Navajo tribal capital at Window Rock, Arizona, is just west of the highway corridor, accessed by State Road 264 (NM 264). The largest city served by US 491 is Shiprock, which takes its name from one of several extinct volcano cores in the area. Shiprock is known as &quot;the winged rock&quot; in the Navajo language, and the mountain is considered sacred by the Navajo people.
Shiprock is where the US 491 crosses the San Juan River and is briefly concurrent with US 64. After passing Shiprock, the route continues north to the Colorado state line. The New Mexico portion has been designated the &quot;John Pinto Highway&quot; by the New Mexico state legislature.

It is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.

===Colorado===

The New Mexico-Colorado state line is where the highway passes from the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute tribal lands. The highway passes to the east of the tribe&#x27;s namesake, Ute Mountain, believed to belong to a great warrior god of the Ute People. US 491 proceeds diagonally to the northwest in the extreme southwestern corner of the state. The highway exits tribal lands near Cortez and Mesa Verde National Park. After leaving Cortez, the road gradually rises in elevation while proceeding towards Utah. Here, the route features large pinto bean farming regions including Dove Creek, which bills itself as the &quot;pinto bean capital of the world&quot;. Canyons of the Ancients National Monument is located along the ascent, just west of the highway. Along this ascent is an access road for Hovenweep National Monument at the state line. A portion of the road in Colorado has been designated the Trail of the Ancients, a National Scenic Byway, which uses US 491 as an access for these parks and monuments in southwest Colorado.

===Utah===
Once in Utah, US 491 gradually ascends to the Abajo Mountains. Still visible are large farming regions. Upon reaching an elevation of , the highway arrives at a weigh station and reaches the town of Monticello. US 491 enters the town on Central Street and terminates near the city park at an intersection with US 191, which runs along Main Street. All highways in Utah are codified into law; US 491 is defined at Utah Code Annotated §72-4-137(11).

==History==
===Pre-1926===
Before the Mexican–American War, when this area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail extended from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, one of the few places where the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US 491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.
Before 1926, all of modern US 491 existed as state routes. In New Mexico, US 666 absorbed a portion of State Road 32 (NM 32) from Gallup to Shiprock, and completely replaced NM 121 from Shiprock to the Colorado state line. The portion in Colorado was numbered State Highway 106 (SH 106) from the New Mexico state line to Cortez, and SH 10 from Cortez to Utah. At the time, SH 10 traversed the southern portion of Colorado. While most of this corridor today has a U.S. Highway designation, a portion of SH 10 still exists. In Utah, the route was originally numbered State Route 9 (SR 9), which also included what is now US 191 from Monticello to Crescent Junction. Utah has since re-used the SR 9 designation for a different road.

===U.S. Route 666===

The route was upgraded to a U.S. Highway in 1926, as U.S. Route 666. This number was appropriate and in accordance with the road numbering guidelines for U.S. Highways, being the sixth spur along the highway&#x27;s parent highway, the famed cross-continental highway U.S. Route 66, from which US 491 breaks around Gallup, New Mexico. This number was assigned by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), a coordinating body that created the U.S. Highway System. At that time, the northern terminus of the route was in Cortez, at an intersection with then US 450 (modern US 160).
Over time the route became known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Highway&quot;, a reference to the Number of the Beast. This nickname and association made some visitors uncomfortable, as well as making the signs targets for theft. Because of the highway&#x27;s number, accidents and other phenomena, this became repeated as legend. These legends convinced some people the highway was cursed. One unnamed highway patrol officer was quoted in &quot;USA Today&quot; as stating a drunk-driving suspect told him, &quot;Triple 6 is evil. Everyone dies on that highway.&quot; Skeptics point out that the highway has a lower than average fatality rate in Utah and Colorado; only the New Mexico portion is statistically a dangerous highway. Skeptics further state the high fatality rate in New Mexico can be explained by an inadequate design for the traffic loads at the time. During the renumbering debate, the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; opined that the planned highway improvements would do more to reduce fatalities than the renumbering itself.

The curse of US 666 is briefly discussed in Jonathan D. Rosenblum&#x27;s book, &quot;Copper Crucible&quot;, which investigates the Arizona Copper Mine Strike of 1983. This strike occurred along the highway near Morenci, Arizona. The highway was used as a plot element in films and television, including &quot;Route 666&quot;, &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, and &quot;Repo Man&quot;, as well as a two-part episode of the series &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, titled &quot;Route 666&quot;. These pieces are not accurate in portraying the route; for example, one depicts the route in Nevada.
===Extensions into Arizona and Utah===
On December 4, 1938, the southern terminus of the route was extended from Gallup across the Arizona state line to US 80 in Douglas, near the Mexican border. It ran concurrent with US 66 for 30 miles (48.3 km) before the turn south. Prior to the extension, the route between Douglas and Sanders was designated as SR 81. The Arizona portion of the highway is known as the Coronado Trail Scenic Byway, as it approximated the path of the Spanish explorer, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado. This portion is noted for mountainous terrain, with hairpin turns and steep grades, that reaches an altitude of over . The curves force a speed limit of in spots.

In 1970, several U.S. Highways in the Four Corners region were re-aligned. As part of this change, US 160 was rerouted west of Cortez to serve the Four Corners Monument and enter Arizona instead of Utah. US 666 was extended up part of the old route of US 160 to Monticello, Utah, at an intersection with then US 163 (now US 191).

In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned to extend US 666 northwest to Richfield, but the proposal was rejected. The proposed extension followed SR 95, SR 24, and SR 119. A concurrency with US 191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello to connect to the rest of the route. One of the reasons cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR 24 were not built to standards desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.
===Elimination and renumbering of US 666===

In 1985, the US 66 designation was eliminated, leaving US 666 (and other routes) as &quot;orphans&quot;. This fact would be used as a supporting factor in later petitions to renumber the highway. In 1992, the part in Arizona was renumbered as an extension of US 191. This truncated US 666 again at Gallup, New Mexico, now at I-40.

The route in the other three states became U.S. Route 491 in 2003, mainly through efforts of New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. He requested the change due to the &quot;infamy brought by the inopportune naming of the road&quot;. While campaigning for governor, Richardson promised to renumber the highway as part of a larger plan to improve the highway and build relations between New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. Although traditional Navajo culture does not share the belief of 666 being an evil number, some Navajos had attempted for years to change the number as a way to raise awareness about the dangerous highway. The highway had largely been ignored, with few improvements made since it was first paved. By 1997, US 666 was named one of the 20 most dangerous highways in the United States. Some Navajo leaders were concerned that efforts to reduce poverty on Navajo lands, via promoting tourism and outside investment, were being hampered by the Christian aversion to the number.

In New Mexico&#x27;s motion to renumber the highway, they selected U.S. Route 393. Since the route came nowhere near US 93, AASHTO instead suggested US 491, noting it as a branch of US 191 at Monticello, Utah. Although the next three-digit child of US 91 would have been U.S. Route 291, both the 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers in at least one of the affected states. At the news that the motion had passed, a New Mexico spokesperson stated, &quot;The devil&#x27;s out of here, and we say goodbye and good riddance.&quot; Referring to the motion passing with a different number from what New Mexico requested, another spokesperson responded, &quot;As long as it&#x27;s not 666 and it&#x27;s nothing satanic, that&#x27;s OK.&quot; US 666 officially ceased to exist on May 31, 2003, although temporary &quot;New 491 – Old 666&quot; signs were posted after the change to aid travelers using old maps.

Although sign theft had always been a problem along this highway, thefts reached epidemic proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US 666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.

The dedication of the &quot;new&quot; highway was postponed until July 30, 2003, to coincide with the start of construction projects to improve safety on the highway. At the dedication George Blue Horse, a Navajo medicine man, performed a ceremony to remove the curse from the highway. In the Navajo language he stated, &quot;The road itself never ends. It goes on generation to generation. The new number is a good one. The new road will be a medicine.&quot;

Newspapers and television stations interviewed people along the route about their opinions on the changing of the highway&#x27;s number. Even some people who believed in the 666 curse disagreed with the change. One went on record as stating highway officials, &quot;are messing with the wrong guy. They&#x27;re making the devil mad. They should have left the 666 alone.&quot; Others were more sarcastic. One Monticello resident stated, &quot;We&#x27;ll really miss all the potheads stopping and taking pictures of the Route 666 sign.&quot; Most residents took pride in living along the Devil&#x27;s Highway and opposed the change. Some commented that no matter the number they would still call the road the Devil&#x27;s Highway.

===Post-renumbering===
Since the renumbering in 2003, portions of US 491 in New Mexico have been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, with grade separations at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation has noted that, as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but remain high on the two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, the most dangerous portions of the highway have moved to points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This has caused the department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.

<text>Autun () is a subprefecture of the Saône-et-Loire department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of central-eastern France. It was founded during the Principate era of the early Roman Empire by Emperor Augustus as Augustodunum to give a Roman capital to the Gallic people Aedui, who had Bibracte as their political centre. In Roman times the city may have been home to 30,000 to 100,000 people, according to different estimates. Nowadays, the commune has a population of about 15,000.

Pioneer of the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth Century with the early exploitation of oil shale and fluorine, since the twentieth century, Autun has experienced a renewed dynamism that has made it the headquarters of several international companies (Dim, Nexans). It contains one of the six French military high schools (Lycée militaire d&#x27;Autun). The city, due to its ancient and medieval past, possesses a rich heritage that makes it one of the most important tourist sites in the heart of Burgundy.

Augustodunum was founded during the reign of the first Roman emperor, Augustus, after whom it was named. It was the civitas &quot;tribal capital&quot; of the Aedui, Continental Celts who had been allies and &quot;brothers&quot; (&quot;&quot;) of Rome since before Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars. Augustodunum was a planned foundation replacing the original oppidum Bibracte, located some away. Several elements of Roman architecture such as walls, gates, and a Roman theater are still visible in the town.

In AD 356, a force of Alemanni brought the siege of Autun. The disrepair of the walls left the city in danger of falling. Autun was saved by the arrival of the Emperor Julian in one of his early military successes. In Late Antiquity, Autun became famous for its schools of rhetoric. A world map based on the &quot;Geography&quot; of Ptolemy was famous for its size and was displayed in the portico of one of the schools. It may have survived until early modern times.

In 532, the Merovingian kings Childebert I and Chlothar I in Battle of Autun defeated the Burgundians led by king Godomar and took over the country of Burgundy. In 642 or 643, another battle was fought near Autun between feuding Frankish noblemen.

Leger (born circa 616- died 678), was bishop of Autun. He was tortured in Lucheux (Somme) on the orders of the mayor of the Ebroin Palace, who then murdered him. Around 670 he had presided over the second council of Autun (after that of 599, which was convened by Bishop Syagre).

In 880, Count Richard of Autun was made the first Duke of Burgundy.

In 1506, Barthélemy de Chasseneuz made his reputation as an attorney, defending the rats of Autun against the charge of eating the barley crop.

=== Modern times ===
In 1788, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord became bishop of Autun. He was elected member of the clergy for the Estates-General of 1789.

The High School plays an important role in the history of the city and even France since Napoleon, who gave it its current name and whose brothers Joseph and Lucien studied there. This school continues to operate today. The decorated wrought iron gates were erected in 1772; the subjects taught in the school are indicated by various representations of objects along the top of these grids.

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the leader of the Army of the Vosges, Giuseppe Garibaldi, chose the city as his headquarters.

In 1837, a commercial mining of oil shale deposit near Autun marked the beginning of the modern oil-shale industry.

In 1852, the uranium mineral autunite was first discovered near Autun, and named for the town.

==Geography==
The city rests on the southern edge of a depression called the Permian Autun Basin which includes the Autunian stratotype forming the Autunois. It is surrounded to the north by bocage meadows (bocage with wide mesh), to the west by the Morvan massif, and to the south by deciduous forests (domanial forest of Planoise) covering a sandstone plateau.

The Autunois region is composed of sixty-four communes grouped into seven cantons. In the cantons of Autun-Nord and Autun-Sud are the following municipalities: Antully, Auxy, Curgy, Dracy-Saint-Loup, Monthelon, Saint-Forgeot and Tavernay.
===Climate===
The commune lies in the northwest of the department.

==Sights==

The city boasts two ancient Roman gates (Porte Saint-André and Porte d&#x27;Arroux) and other ruins dating to the time of Augustus. One of the most impressive remains is that of the ancient theatre, which was one of the largest in the western part of the empire with a 17,000-seat capacity. To the northwest of the city is the so-called Temple of Janus, only two walls (faces) of which remain. To the southeast is the mysterious Pierre de Couhard, a rock pyramid of uncertain function which may date to Roman times.
Autun Cathedral, also known as &quot;Saint Lazare Cathedral&quot;, dates from the early twelfth century and is a major example of Romanesque architecture. It was formerly the chapel of the Dukes of Burgundy; their palace was the actual episcopal residence. The cathedral was originally built as a pilgrimage church for the veneration of the relic Saint Lazarus, mentioned in the Gospels, and considered the first bishop of Marseille, and who, always according to tradition, arrived in Provence with Mary Magdalen.

Autun&#x27;s 12th-century bishop, Étienne de Bâgé, probably built the church in response to the construction of Ste. Madeleine at nearby Vézelay, home to the French cult of Mary Magdalene. St. Lazare was only later elevated to the rank of cathedral, replacing the former cathedral dedicated to St. Nazaire.

The Autun Cathedral is famous for its architectural sculpture, particularly the tympanum of The Last Judgment above the west portal, surviving fragments from the lost portal of the north transept, and the capitals in the nave and choir. All of these are traditionally considered the work of Gislebertus, whose name is on the west tympanum. It is uncertain whether Gislebertus is the name of the sculptor or of a patron. If Gislebertus is in fact the artist, he is one of very few medieval artists whose name is known.

==Other notable connections==
* Bishop and Saint Leodegar (c. 615 – 679)
* Nivelon I (d. 768) was known as Count of Autun
* In the late 9th century, Charles Martel&#x27;s daughter (name listed as Auda, Alane, or Aldana) married Thierry IV (also called Theoderich or Theoderic), Count of Autun.
* In the late 9th century, the countship was vacant after the death of Robert the Strong, but was returned to Bernard Plantapilosa, son of Bernard of Septimania, and then later to Bernard of Gothia after Bernard fell out of favor.
* In 878, King Louis the Younger took the countship away and gave it to his chamberlain, Theodoric.

* Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of Burgundy under Philip the Good, came from Autun, where several examples of his artistic patronage can be seen. The &quot;Rolin Madonna&quot;, by Jan van Eyck, in the Louvre, shows what was probably at least intended as a view of Autun in the background.

<text>&quot;Home on the Range&quot; (Roud No. 3599) is an American folk song, sometimes called the &quot;unofficial anthem&quot; of the American West. Dr. Brewster M. Higley (also spelled Highley) of Smith County, Kansas, wrote the lyrics as the poem &quot;My Western Home&quot; in 1872 or 1873, with at least one source indicating it was written as early as 1871.

On June 30, 1947, &quot;Home on the Range&quot; became the Kansas state song. In 2010, members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 western songs of all time.

A rendition of the song is one of the seven fight songs of the University of Kansas, and is traditionally played by the Marching Jayhawks university band at the end of every home athletic event. 

==History==

In 1871, Higley moved from Indiana and acquired land in Smith County, Kansas under the Homestead Act, living in a small cabin near West Beaver Creek. Higley was inspired by his surroundings and wrote &quot;My Western Home&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Smith County Pioneer&quot; (KS) newspaper in 1873 or 1874 and republished March 21, 1874 in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Kirwin Chief&quot;. Higley&#x27;s cabin home is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Home on the Range Cabin.

Daniel E. Kelley (1843–1905), a friend of Higley and member of the Harlan Brothers Orchestra, developed a melody for the song on his guitar. Higley&#x27;s original lyrics are similar to those of the modern version of the song, but not identical. For instance, the original poem did not contain the words &quot;on the range&quot;. Ranchers, cowboys, and other western settlers adopted the song as a rural anthem and it spread throughout the United States in various forms. In 1925, Texas composer David W. Guion (1892–1981) arranged it as sheet music that was published by G. Schirmer. The song has since gone by a number of names, the most common being &quot;Home on the Range&quot; and &quot;Western Home&quot;. It was officially adopted as the state song of Kansas on June 30, 1947, and is commonly regarded as the unofficial anthem of the American West.

On September 27, 1933, Bing Crosby recorded &quot;Home on the Range&quot; with Lennie Hayton and his orchestra for Brunswick Records. At the time, the origins of &quot;Home on the Range&quot; were obscure and widely debated, although it had been published in 1910 in folklorist John Lomax&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads.&quot; Lomax reported that he had learned the song from a black saloon keeper in Texas who recalled learning it on the Chisholm Trail. Its popularity led to William and Mary Goodwin filing a suit for copyright infringement in 1934 for $500,000. In 1905 the couple had published &quot;An Arizona Home&quot;, similar to &quot;Home on the Range&quot;. The lawsuit initiated a search for the song&#x27;s background.

As it turned out, controversy and even outright plagiarism have followed the song&#x27;s lyrics since their publication. On Feb. 26, 1876, the &quot;Kirwin Chief&quot; published an article on the front page titled, &quot;PLAGIARISM,&quot; accusing &quot;The Stockton&quot; &quot;News&quot; of publishing a nearly identical poem credited to a Mrs. Emma Race of Raceburgh, KS. The &quot;Kirwin Chief&quot;, which had published the poem Mar. 26, 1874, reprinted the poem below the article. When Samuel Moanfeldt investigated the history of &quot;Home on the Range&quot; on behalf of the Music Publishers Protection Association in response to the Goodwins&#x27; 1934 lawsuit, he found another, similar song, &quot;Colorado Home&quot;. However, within a few months, Moanfeldt determined Higley had written the poem behind &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, and set to music by Kelley. It seemed likely that cowboys on the Chisholm Trail played a role in making the song known throughout several states.

==Modern usage==
Bing Crosby recorded the song again in 1938 and 1939. Frank Sinatra also recorded the song on March 10, 1946, and his version was released in Great Britain but was not available in the United States until 1993. Others who have recorded the song include John Charles Thomas, Connie Francis, Gene Autry, Boxcar Willie, Burl Ives, Pete Seeger, Johnnie Ray, Slim Whitman, Steve Lawrence and Tori Amos. &quot;Home on the Range&quot; is often performed in programs and concerts of American patriotic music and is frequently used in plays and films. The song is also the theme opening music for the early Western films starring Ray &quot;Crash&quot; Corrigan and his two co-stars in their movie roles as &quot;The Three Mesqueteers&quot;.

It is also featured in the 1937 screwball comedy &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (sung by Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy), the 1948 film &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (sung by both Cary Grant and Myrna Loy), the 1967 off-Broadway musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; (sung by the cast as a glee club rehearsal number), the 1980 film &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; (sung by Neil Young over the opening credits), the 2009 film &quot;The Messenger&quot; (sung by Willie Nelson over the closing credits), and the 1946 western film &quot;Colorado Serenade&quot; (sung by actor Roscoe Ates). Actor Harry Dean Stanton (as the angel &quot;Gideon&quot;) sings an excerpt from his mid-tree perch in the 1985 film &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot; as well as in the 1988 David Lynch short film, &quot;The Cowboy and the Frenchman&quot;. A parody version is sung by villain Percival McLeach in the 1990 animated film &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;.

The song has made its way into screen shorts for children and adults, as in the 1954 Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;Claws for Alarm&quot;, where it is sung by Porky Pig. Likewise, Bugs Bunny sings the song in both &quot;The Fair-Haired Hare&quot; (1951) and &quot;Oily Hare&quot; (1952), the latter containing original lyrics specific to Texas oilmen.

The song is used in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot; (1991) in which Lisa is inspired by a substitute teacher who dresses as a cowboy and sings the song with commentary. It was also used on the &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; episode &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Life.&quot;

It made an appearance on &quot;GLOW&quot; when Debbie Eagan (played by Betty Gilpin) sang a portion in the fourth episode of the second season.

Vikingarna recorded an instrumental version of the song on the 1981 album &quot;Kramgoa låtar 9&quot; , entitled &quot;Home on the Ranch&quot;.

An instrumental version of the song was used in the 2011 video game, &quot;Rage&quot;.

In 2016, the American progressive rock band Kansas released a version of the song as a bonus track on their album &quot;The Prelude Implicit&quot;.

In 2017, a docudrama was released that told the story of the song&#x27;s origins and the lawsuit from the 1930s that finally concluded the authorship of the song. The film was produced by the People&#x27;s Heartland Foundation and Lone Chimney Films and featured actors Buck Taylor, Rance Howard, Darby Hinton, and the voice of the Kansas City Chiefs, Mitch Holthus. The film also included music contributed by Kansas, Sons of the Pioneers, Michael Martin Murphey, and others. The film was directed by Ken Spurgeon and aired on regional PBS stations.

In 2020, the American show Better Call Saul refrenced the song when Kevin Wachtell, played by Rex Linn depicted the western lifestyle behind his father&#x27;s bank, Mesa Verde

In 2024, Filipino actor Derrick Monasterio released a version of the song as a track on their album &quot;Pulang Araw: Official Soundtrack.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The first and sixth verses of John A. Lomax&#x27;s 1910 version, &quot;A Home on the Range&quot;, are heard in the &quot;Glee Club Rehearsal&quot; sequence of the Broadway musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;.

The well-known first verse and chorus are covered in a season four episode of &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;. The first verse was also covered in an episode of another Disney Channel sitcom, &quot;Good Luck Charlie&quot;, at the end of the episode &quot;The Break Up&quot;.

An arrangement of the song is included in most Casio electronic keyboards.

<text>Bart Howard (born Howard Joseph Gustafson, June 1, 1915 – February 21, 2004) was an American composer and songwriter, most notably of the jazz standard &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, which has been performed by Kaye Ballard, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Nancy Wilson, Della Reese, Bobby Womack, Diana Krall, Paul Anka, June Christy, Brenda Lee, Astrud Gilberto, Nat King Cole, Peggy Lee, Sia and RAYE and Super Tough among others. It is played frequently by jazz and popular musicians around the world. It was also used as the outro for the popular anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Howard wrote the song for his partner of 58 years, Thomas Fowler.

==Biography==
Howard was born in Burlington, Iowa. He began his career as an accompanist at the age of 16 and played for Mabel Mercer, Johnny Mathis and Eartha Kitt, among others.

&quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; was first sung in 1954 by Felicia Sanders at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan, where the composer became M.C. and accompanist in 1951. The song received wide exposure when Peggy Lee sang it on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; several years later. Bart Howard &quot;lived off&quot; this song for the rest of his life, although he had 49 other songs to his credit. These include &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;, &quot;On the First Warm Day&quot;, &quot;One Love Affair&quot;, &quot;Be My All&quot;, &quot;The Man in the Looking Glass&quot;, &quot;My Love Is a Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Fall in Love&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream of Anybody But Me&quot;. 
Howard died February 21, 2004, at age 88, in Carmel, New York. He was survived by his partner of 58 years, Thomas Fowler and a sister Dorothy Lind of Burlington, Iowa.

==Notes==
The original title was &quot;In Other Words&quot;, but so many people referred to it by the first lyric line, (&quot;fly me to the moon&quot;) the publisher changed the title to &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;.

<text>Erol Otus is an American artist and game designer, who contributed art to the fantasy role-playing game (RPG) genre, especially early in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; franchise. He created art for the award winning &quot;Star Control II&quot; as well as providing the voice for one of the character races, the Chmmr, in the same game.

==Biography==
Otus graduated from high school in Berkeley, California. A self-taught artist since childhood, Otus developed an interest in role-playing games. His first professional artwork in the genre was for the &quot;Arduin Grimoire&quot; in 1977. He won an honorable mention in a fanart contest in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine No. 13, which also led to employment in the art department of game company TSR in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin in the 1970s. After leaving the company, he studied painting at UC Berkeley and also took classes at the Academy of Art in San Francisco. He has cited a wide range of influences on his work from Dr. Seuss and Frank Frazetta to modern artists such as Joan Miró, Willem de Kooning and Wassily Kandinsky.

==Role-playing games==
Erol Otus was a prolific contributor to the early &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) franchise, creating full covers as well as many interior illustrations for TSR materials. For example, he created the cover for the first version of the D&amp;D manual &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; and illustrated the Cthulhu pantheon within. According to fellow contributor Jeff Dee, many of the original versions of this work were lost during a later clean-out of the TSR offices.

Otus has also provided cover art and interior illustrations for Goodman Games, Oracle Games (in particular &quot;Alma Mater - The High School RPG&quot;) and the Arduin series. His art was featured on the covers of the new &quot;HackMaster&quot; edition and issue #8 of &quot;Fight On!&quot;

While working at TSR, Otus was a runner-up in TSR&#x27;s 4th Invitational AD&amp;D Masters Tournament at Gen Con XIII, a contest to choose the game&#x27;s best overall dungeon master. He competed against the likes of Lenard Lakofka and first place was taken by Frank Mentzer.

In 2014, Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot;, named Erol Otus as 9A in a list of The Top 10 RPG Artists of the Past 40 Years, saying &quot;I applaud Otus for keeping his style and staying true to his roots, so an inclusion on this list is a worthy honor.&quot;

==Video games==
Otus has also provided illustrations, production design and voice overs for computer games such as &quot;The Last Ninja&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Generations&quot;, &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot; and &quot;Star Control II&quot;. &quot;Star Control II&quot; was named by &quot;IGN&quot; as the 17th best game of all time, and by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as one of the greatest games of all time.

==Other work==
Otus provided the cover art for the album &quot;Down Among The Deadmen&quot; (2000) by American heavy metal band Slough Feg (then known as &quot;Lord Weird Slough Feg&quot;).

<doc id="500163" wikidata="Q898178" url="?curid=500163" title="Self-replicating spacecraft">
<text>The concept of self-replicating [[spacecraft]], as envisioned by mathematician John von Neumann, has been described by futurists and has been discussed across a wide breadth of hard science fiction novels and stories. Self-replicating probes are sometimes referred to as von Neumann probes. Self-replicating spacecraft would in some ways either mimic or echo the features of living organisms or viruses.

== Theory ==
Von Neumann argued that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighboring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from asteroids, moons, gas giants, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original &quot;parent&quot; probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story &quot;Lungfish&quot;, David Brin touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a Darwinistic fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of &quot;species&quot; they might even form a type of ecology, or – should they also have a form of artificial intelligence – a society. They may even mutate with thousands of &quot;generations&quot;.

The first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by Robert Freitas, in which the non-replicating Project Daedalus design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design&#x27;s strategy was to use the probe to deliver a &quot;seed&quot; factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory produce many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

It has been theorized that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic faster-than-light propulsion, and speeds limited to an &quot;average cruising speed&quot; of 0.1c.) could spread throughout a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in as little as half a million years.

==Debate on Fermi&#x27;s paradox ==
In 1981, Frank Tipler put forth an argument that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist, based on the fact that von Neumann probes have not been observed. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the Fermi paradox – that is, the question of why we have not &quot;already&quot; encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.

A response came from Carl Sagan and William Newman. Now known as &quot;Sagan&#x27;s Response&quot;, it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected. As Robert Freitas has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate is unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our solar system or the galaxy as a whole.

Another objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations that could potentially create such devices may have a high probability of self-destruction before being capable of producing such machines. This could be through events such as biological or nuclear warfare, nanoterrorism, resource exhaustion, ecological catastrophe, or pandemics. This obstacle to the creation of von Neumann probes is one potential candidate for the concept of a Great Filter.

Simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. Radio transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic parsec) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the Hayflick limit in cell reproduction. One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation). Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel. The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate. The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials. Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.

== Applications for self-replicating spacecraft ==
The details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself. It is a concatenation of two concepts: a Von Neumann universal constructor (self-replicating machine) and a probe (an instrument to explore or examine something). The concept is named after Hungarian American mathematician and physicist John von Neumann, who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called &quot;Universal Assemblers&quot; and which are often referred to as &quot;von Neumann machines&quot;. Such constructs could be theorised to comprise five basic components (variations of this template could create other machines such as Bracewell probes):

* &quot;Probe&quot;: which would contain the actual probing instruments &amp; goal-directed AI to guide the construct.
* &quot;Life-support systems&quot;: mechanisms to repair and maintain the construct.
* &quot;Factory&quot;: mechanisms to harvest resources &amp; replicate itself. 
* &quot;Memory banks&quot;: store programs for all its components &amp; information gained by the probe.
* &quot;Engine&quot;: motor to move the probe.

Andreas M. Hein and science fiction author Stephen Baxter proposed different types of von Neumann probes, termed &quot;Philosopher&quot; and &quot;Founder&quot;, where the purpose of the former is exploration and for the latter preparing future settlement.

A near-term concept of a self-replicating probe has been proposed by the Initiative for Interstellar Studies, achieving about 70% self-replication, based on current and near-term technologies.

If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a Bracewell probe), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.

Physicist Paul Davies of University of Adelaide has &quot;raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own Moon&quot;, having arrived at some point in Earth&#x27;s ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth, a concept that, per Michio Kaku, was what Stanley Kubrick used as the basis of his film, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (though the director cut the relevant monolith scene from the movie). Kubrick&#x27;s work was based on Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s story, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, expanded by the pair in the form of a novel that became the basis for the movie and so Davies&#x27; lunar probe/observatory concept is also considered reminiscent of Clarke.

A variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the &quot;Astrochicken&quot;, proposed by Freeman Dyson. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its &quot;home base&quot;, Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own planetary system, and not explore interstellar space.

Anders Sandberg and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a Dyson Swarm around the Sun.

=== Berserkers ===

A variant of the self-replicating starship is the &quot;Berserker&quot;. Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing exoplanets whenever they are encountered.

The name is derived from the &quot;Berserker&quot; series of novels by Fred Saberhagen which describes a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – &quot;do&quot; constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.

It is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a xenophobic civilization (see &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot;, by Greg Bear, in the section In fiction below) or could theoretically &quot;mutate&quot; from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for terraforming processes – mining a planet&#x27;s surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – could be interpreted as attacking previously inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicating to dispatch more ships to &quot;attack&quot; other planets.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===
Yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable exoplanet, or even one that might be terraformed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from stored embryos or from stored information using molecular nanotechnology to build zygotes with varying genetic information from local raw materials.

Such ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to generation ships as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.

==In fiction==
=== Von Neumann probes ===

* &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;: The monoliths in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s book and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; were intended to be self-replicating probes, though the artifacts in &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, Clarke&#x27;s original short story upon which &quot;2001&quot; was based, were not. The film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space. Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute, however, and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and Clarke&#x27;s novel.
* &quot;Cold As Ice&quot;: In the novel by Charles Sheffield, there is a segment where the author (a physicist) describes Von Neumann machines harvesting sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, helium-4, and various metals from the atmosphere of Jupiter.
* &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Road&quot;: Larry Niven frequently refers to Von Neumann probes in many of his works. In his 1998 book &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Road&quot;, Von Neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world Destiny and its moon Quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans&#x27; technical knowledge; the Von Neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a solar collector which serves as the humans&#x27; primary energy source. The Von Neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory work.
* &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Blind Spot&quot;: See also Alexander Kluge, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Blind Spot&quot; (New Directions; 2004.)
* &quot;Grey Goo&quot;: In the video game &quot;Grey Goo&quot;, the &quot;Goo&quot; faction is composed entirely of Von Neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the Milky Way Galaxy. The faction&#x27;s units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration, which have adapted to a combat role. The Goo starts as an antagonist to the Human and Beta factions, but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign. Related to, and inspired by, the Grey Goo doomsday scenario.
* &quot;Spin&quot;: In the novel by Robert Charles Wilson, Earth is veiled by a temporal field. Humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using Von Neumann probes. It is later revealed that the field itself was generated by Von Neumann probes from another civilization, and that a competition for resources had taken place between earth&#x27;s and the aliens&#x27; probes.
* &quot;The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000–3000&quot;: In the book by Brian Stableford and David Langford (published by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1985) humanity sends cycle-limited Von Neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanity&#x27;s existence to whoever might encounter them.
* &quot;Von Neumann&#x27;s War&quot;: In &quot;Von Neumann&#x27;s War&quot; by John Ringo and Travis S. Taylor (published by Baen Books in 2007) Von Neumann probes arrive in the solar system, moving in from the outer planets, and converting all metals into gigantic structures. Eventually, they arrive on Earth, wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity reverse engineers some of the probes.
* &quot;We Are Legion (We Are Bob)&quot; by Dennis E. Taylor: Bob Johansson, the former owner of a software company, dies in a car accident, only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of Bob. Given a Von Neumann probe by America&#x27;s religious government, he is sent out to explore, exploit, expand, and experiment for the good of the human race.
* &quot;ARMA 3&quot;: In the &quot;First Contact&quot; single-player campaign introduced in the &quot;Contact&quot; expansion, a series of extraterrestrial network structures are found in various locations on Earth, one being the fictional country of Livonia, the campaign&#x27;s setting. In the credits of the campaign, a radio broadcast reveals that a popular theory surrounding the networks is that they are a type of Von Neumann probe that arrived on Earth during the time of a supercontinent.
* &quot;Questionable Content&quot;: In Jeph Jacques&#x27; webcomic, Faye Whitaker refers to the &quot;Floating Black Slab Emitting A Low Hum&quot; as a possible Von Neumann probe in Episode 4645: Accessorized.
* In the third act of the incremental game &quot;Universal Paperclips&quot;, after all of Earth&#x27;s matter has been converted into paperclips, players are tasked with sending Von Neumann probes into the universe to find and consume all matter in service of making paperclips, eventually entering a war with another class of probes called &quot;drifters&quot; that are created as a result of random mutations.
* In the game &quot;Satisfactory&quot; developed by Coffee Stain Studios, the player arrives on a distant alien planet and is tasked with constructing another spaceship. The player is guided by an artificial intelligence which provides the instructions for creating the spaceship (specifically, which resources are required). When complete, it then leaves to presumably repeat the process on another planet. This is not explicitly explained by the game but lore suggests you are simply a clone created by the previous iteration of the process, and it has been going on for a long, long time.

=== Berserkers ===

* In the science fiction short story collection &quot;Berserker&quot; by Fred Saberhagen, a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive Berserker machines. This and subsequent books set in the same fictional universe are the origin of the term &quot;Berserker probe&quot;.
* In the 2003 miniseries reboot of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (and the subsequent 2004 series) the Cylons are similar to Berserkers in their wish to destroy human life. They were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the Twelve Colonies. The Cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later, the fleeing fleet of surviving humans.
* The Borg of &quot;Star Trek&quot; – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms. Their ships are massive mechanical cubes (a close step from the Berserker&#x27;s massive mechanical Spheres).
* Science fiction author Larry Niven later borrowed this notion in his short story &quot;A Teardrop Falls&quot;.
* In the computer game &quot;Star Control II&quot;, the Slylandro Probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks starships of other races. They were not originally intended to be a berserker probe; they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact, but due to a programming error, they would immediately switch to &quot;resource extraction&quot; mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials. While the plot claims that the probes reproduce &quot;at a geometric rate&quot;, the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes. It is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest, but this is not necessary to complete the game, as the probes only appear one at a time, and the player&#x27;s ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universe.
* In Iain Banks&#x27; novel &quot;Excession&quot;, hegemonising swarms are described as a form of Outside Context Problem. An example of an &quot;Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Object&quot; is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself. After causing great damage, they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the Zetetic Elench and become &quot;Evangelical Hegemonising Swarm Objects&quot;. Such swarms (referred to as &quot;smatter&quot;) reappear in the later novels &quot;Surface Detail&quot; (which features scenes of space combat against the swarms) and &quot;The Hydrogen Sonata&quot;.
* The Inhibitors from Alastair Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Revelation Space&quot; series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures. They are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets. They are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to &#x27;remember&#x27; the necessary counter-measures.
* Also from Alastair Reynolds&#x27; books, the &quot;Greenfly&quot; terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines. For unknown reasons, but probably an error in their programming, they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all, their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans, however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race. By 10,000, they have wiped out most of the Galaxy.
* The Reapers in the video game series &quot;Mass Effect&quot; are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy. They lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination. It is seen in &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; that they assimilate any advanced species.
* Mantrid Drones from the science fiction television series &quot;Lexx&quot; were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating Berserker machine, eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanity.
* The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Infection&quot; showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the Icarran War Machine. After being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction, the War Machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet Icarra VII because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a &#x27;Pure Icaran&#x27; based on religious teachings, which no actual Icaran could satisfy. Because the Icaran were pre-starflight, the War Machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading. One unit was reactivated on-board Babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist, but after being confronted with how they had rendered Icara VII a dead world, the simulated personality of the War Machine committed suicide. 
* The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;A Day in the Strife&quot; features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilization&#x27;s level of advancement are answered correctly. The commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonate.
* Greg Bear&#x27;s novel &quot;The Forge of God&quot; deals directly with the concept of &quot;Berserker&quot; von Neumann probes and their consequences. The idea is further explored in the novel&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot;, which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of Berserkers.
* In Gregory Benford&#x27;s &quot;Galactic Center Saga&quot; series, an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by Earth, first as a probe in &quot;In the Ocean of Night&quot;, and then in an attack in &quot;Across the Sea of Suns&quot;. The berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the EMs encountered in &quot;Across the Sea of Suns&quot;. The alien machine Watchers would not be considered von Neumann machines themselves, but the collective machine race could.
* On &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; the Replicators were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named Reese to serve as toys. They grew beyond her control and began evolving, eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies. In addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves, ultimately making them one of the most advanced &quot;races&quot; known. 
* On &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, a second race of replicators created by the Ancients were encountered in the Pegasus Galaxy. They were created as a means to defeat the Wraith. The Ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed. This failed, and an unspecified length of time after the Ancients retreated to the Milky Way Galaxy, the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the Wraith. The Wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive, at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the Atlantis Expedition. After the Atlantis Expedition reactivated this dormant directive, the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the Wraith by removing their food source, i.e. all humans in the Pegasus Galaxy.
* In &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; Season 2, a galaxy billions of light years distant from the Milky Way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology. The drone ships attack other space ships (including Destiny) as well as humans on planetary surfaces, but don&#x27;t bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technology.
* In the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;Dark Heart&quot;, an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on Earth.
* In the &quot;&quot; video game, a bio-mechanical virus called &quot;Beast&quot; has the ability to alter organic and mechanic material to suit its needs, and the ships infected become self-replicating hubs for the virus.
* In the SF MMO &quot;EVE Online&quot;, experiments to create more autonomous drones than the ones used by player&#x27;s ships accidentally created &#x27;rogue drones&#x27; which form hives in certain parts of space and are used extensively in missions as difficult opponents.
* In the computer game &quot;Sword of the Stars&quot;, the player may randomly encounter &quot;Von Neumann&quot;. A Von Neumann mothership appears along with smaller Von Neumann probes, which attack and consume the player&#x27;s ships. The probes then return to the mothership, returning the consumed material. If probes are destroyed, the mothership will create new ones. If all the player&#x27;s ships are destroyed, the Von Neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving. The probes appear as blue octahedrons, with small spheres attached to the apical points. The mothership is a larger version of the probes. In the 2008 expansion &quot;A Murder of Crows&quot;, Kerberos Productions also introduces the VN Berserker, a combat oriented ship, which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against VN Motherships. If the player destroys the Berserker things will escalate and a System Destroyer will attack.
* In the &quot;X Computer Game Series&quot;, the Xenon are a malevolent race of artificially intelligent machines descended from terraforming ships sent out by humans to prepare worlds for eventual colonization; the result caused by a bugged software update. They are continual antagonists in the X-Universe.
* In the comic &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; a character mentions &quot;Von Neumann rectal infestations&quot; which are apparently caused by &quot;Shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks&quot;.
* In the anime &quot;Vandread&quot;, harvester ships attack vessels from both male- and female-dominated factions and harvest hull, reactors, and computer components to make more of themselves. To this end, Harvester ships are built around mobile factories. Earth-born humans also view the inhabitants of the various colonies to be little more than spare parts.
* In &quot;Earth 2160&quot;, the Morphidian Aliens rely on strain aliens for colonization. Most -derived aliens can absorb water, then reproduce like a colony of cells. In this manner, even one Lady (or Princess, or Queen) can create enough clones to cover the map. Once they have significant numbers, they &quot;choose an evolutionary path&quot; and swarm the enemy, taking over their resources.
* In the European comic series &quot;Storm&quot;, numbers 20 &amp; 21, a kind of berserk von Neumann probe is set on a collision course with the Pandarve system.
* In PC role-playing game &quot;Space Rangers&quot; and its sequel &quot;Space Rangers 2: Dominators&quot;, a league of 5 nations battles three different types of Berserker robots. One that focuses on invading planets, another that battles normal space and third that lives in hyperspace.
* In the &quot;Star Wolves&quot; video game series, Berserkers are a self-replicating machine menace that threatens the known universe for purposes of destruction and/or assimilation of humanity.
* The &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe features the World Devastators, large ships designed and built by the Galactic Empire that tear apart planets to use its materials to build other ships or even upgrade or replicate themselves.
* The Tet in the 2013 film &quot;Oblivion&quot; is revealed to be a Berserker of sorts: a sentient machine that travels from planet to planet, exterminating the indigenous population using armies of robotic drones and cloned members of the target species. The Tet then proceeds to harvest the planet&#x27;s water in order to extract hydrogen for nuclear fusion.
* In &quot;Eclipse Phase&quot;, an ETI probe is believed to have infected the TITAN computer systems with the Exsurgent virus to cause them to go berserk and wage war on humanity. This would make ETI probes a form of berserker, albeit one that uses pre-existing computer systems as its key weapons.
* In &quot;Herr aller Dinge&quot; by Andreas Eschbach, an ancient nano machine complex is discovered buried in a glacier off the coast of Russia. When it comes in contact with materials it needs to fulfill its mission, it creates a launch facility and launches a space craft. It is later revealed that the nano machines were created by a pre-historic human race with the intention of destroying other interstellar civilizations (for an unknown reason). It is proposed that the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level. It is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time.

* In &quot;Dead Space&quot; brother moons could be considered as berserkers.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===

* &quot;Code of the Lifemaker&quot; by James P. Hogan describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. The sentient machines are descended from an uncrewed factory ship that was to be self replicating, but suffered radiation damage and went off course, eventually landing on Titan around 1,000,000 BC.
* &quot;&quot;, Stephen Baxter&#x27;s novel, starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the Solar system.
* In the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; subseries of games, the massive Leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet Phaaze to infect other planets with Phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of Phaaze, where the self-replication process can continue.
* In David Brin&#x27;s short story collection, &quot;The River of Time&quot; (1986), the short story &quot;Lungfish&quot; prominently features von Neumann probes. Not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves, but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes, evolution of von Neumann probes in the face of such competition, and the development of a type of ecology between von Neumann probes. One of the vessels mentioned is clearly a Seeder type.
* In &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke, humanity on a future Earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as fire and forget lifeboats aimed at distant, habitable worlds. Upon landing, the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information, and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants. The massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their &quot;children&quot;.
* On the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episode &quot;Remnants&quot;, the Atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct, technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species. The probe communicated with inhabitants of Atlantis by means of hallucinations.
* On the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;, a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an Artificial Intelligence.
* On &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, the human adventurers live on a ship called &quot;Destiny&quot;. Its mission was to connect a network of Stargates, placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between them.
* The trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series &quot;Storm&quot; by Don Lawrence (starting with &quot;Chronicles of Pandarve 11: The Von Neumann machine&quot;) is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on Earth. The probe malfunctions and although new probes are built, they do not separate from the motherprobe, which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moons.
* In the &quot;Xeno&quot; series, a rogue seeder ship (technically a berserker) known as &quot;Deus&quot; created humanity.

<text>The Finnish Democratic Republic ( or &quot;Suomen kansantasavalta&quot;, , Russian: &quot;Финляндская Демократическая Республика&quot;), also known as the Terijoki Government (), was a short-lived communist puppet state of the Soviet Union in occupied Finnish territory from December 1939 to March 1940.

The Finnish Democratic Republic was established by Joseph Stalin upon the outbreak of the Winter War and headed by Otto Wille Kuusinen to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. The Finnish Democratic Republic was only recognised by the Soviet Union and nominally operated in Soviet-occupied areas of Finnish Karelia from the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Terijoki. The Finnish Democratic Republic was portrayed by the Soviet Union as the official socialist government of Finland capable of restoring peace, but lost favor as the Soviets sought rapprochement with the Finnish Government. The Finnish Democratic Republic was dissolved and merged into the Karelo-Finnish SSR upon the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty.

== Creation ==

The Finnish Democratic Republic was established on 1 December 1939 in the Finnish border town of Terijoki (present-day Zelenogorsk, Saint Petersburg, Russia), a day after the beginning of the Winter War. Terijoki was the first town in Finland captured by the Red Army after the Soviet invasion, and the new government was seated there as its &quot;de facto&quot; capital. The Finnish Democratic Republic regime was commonly known by the colloquial name the Terijoki Government (, ), but officially the government was called the Finnish People&#x27;s Government ( ). In Finnish historiography, the government is also occasionally called the Kuusinen Government ( ).

Otto Wille Kuusinen was chosen as the prime minister and head of government. Kuusinen&#x27;s cabinet was made up of Soviet citizens and left-wing Finns who had fled to Soviet Russia after the Finnish Civil War. A declaration delivered via TASS on behalf of the Finnish Democratic Republic stated:

Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov spoke to the German ambassador to the Soviet Union on 30 November—a day before the proclamation of the Finnish Democratic Republic—saying, &quot;This government will not be Soviet but a democratic republic. Nobody will set up soviets there, but we hope that it will be a government that we can reach agreement with on safeguarding the security of Leningrad.&quot; Soviet leaflets dropped over Helsinki on the first day of the Winter War stated: &quot;Finnish Comrades! We come to you not as conquerors, but as liberators of the Finnish people from the oppression of the capitalists and the landlords&quot;.

== Relations with the Soviet Union ==
The Soviet government entered into diplomatic relations with the Finnish Democratic Republic&#x27;s government immediately after its creation. On the first day of its existence, the Kuusinen regime agreed to lease the Hanko Peninsula; to cede a slice of territory on the Karelian Isthmus; and to sell an island in the Gulf of Finland, along with sections of the Kalastajasaarento near the Arctic Ocean to the Soviet Union.

On 2 December 1939, Kuusinen and Molotov signed a mutual assistance agreement and a secret protocol in Moscow. The content of the agreement was very similar to what the Soviet foreign ministry had planned earlier in October 1939, though it never was presented to the Finnish government. According to the new agreement, the Soviet Union would cede a much larger area, Eastern Karelia, except for the Murmansk railroad, in exchange for the same territories that the Soviets had demanded in earlier negotiations from the Republic of Finland.

An earlier draft of the Moscow agreement was signed ten days earlier at Petrozavodsk by Andrei Zhdanov for the USSR and Kuusinen for the Republic. The Molotov–Kuusinen agreement mentioned leasing the Hanko Peninsula, and determining the number of troops to be appointed in a separate agreement. Before the 1990s, historians could only speculate about its existence and content. In 1997, during a joint Finnish-Russian project, Russian professor Oleg Rzesevski discovered the protocol in the Kremlin. The content is quite similar to protocols the Soviet Union signed with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in September–October 1939.

== Reaction in Finland and abroad ==
The Finnish Democratic Republic failed to gain support among Finnish workers as the Soviet Union had hoped. Instead, in the face of the invasion, Finnish society became strongly united in what is called the &quot;Spirit of the Winter War&quot;. The Democratic Republic also failed to gain any international recognition aside from the Soviet Union itself, although a number of prominent left-wing activists and writers such as Jawaharlal Nehru, George Bernard Shaw, Martin Andersen Nexø and John Steinbeck voiced their support for the government. In Nazi Germany, state newspapers gave their support for the Democratic Republic because of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

Joseph Stalin was well aware of the domestic political situation in Finland based on Soviet intelligence information, and thus did not anticipate that the establishment of the Democratic Republic would cause any revolutionary action or popular uprisings against the existing Finnish Government.

The Kuusinen Government was officially recognised by the Soviet Union and the Soviet satellite states of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic and the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic.

== Dissolution ==
The Soviets had increasingly began to seek rapprochement with the Finnish government during the course of the Winter War and the Kuusinen regime fell out of favor. Although the Soviets had captured two-thirds of the Karelian Isthmus, casualties were very high and the upcoming spring thaw threatened their offensive. Both sides were exhausted from the war, but the Soviets held the upper hand and successfully pressured the Finns into peace on Soviet terms. On 12 March 1940, the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed between Finland and the Soviet Union, ending hostilities the following morning. By the terms of the treaty, Finland ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union, though the Soviets&#x27; attempt to conquer Finland had failed. Subsequently, the Finnish Democratic Republic became obsolete and merged with the Karelian ASSR within the RSFSR to form the new Karelo-Finnish SSR, a Soviet republic in its own right, after Finland had ceded the areas specified in the treaty to the Soviet Union.

<text>Uist is a group of six islands that are part of the Outer Hebridean Archipelago, which is part of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

[[North Uist]] and [[South Uist]] ( or ; ) are two of the islands and are linked by causeways running via the isles of Benbecula and Grimsay.

From south to north, the inhabited islands in the island group are (Eriskay), (South Uist), Grimsay (South), (Benbecula), (Flodaigh), [ Grimsay (North) ], , (North Uist), (Baleshare) and (Berneray).

The islands, collectively, have a population of 4,723.

==16th century==

===Geography===
Writing in 1549, Sir Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles stated of &quot;Ywst&quot; that it was a fertile country full of high hills and forests on the east coast with five parish kirks. He also noted that in the north of &quot;Ywst ther is sundrie covis and holes in the earth, coverit with heddir above, quhilk fosters maney rebellis in the countrey&quot;.

===Fishing===
Monro referred to the &quot;infinite number of fresh water loches&quot;, including Loch Bì, which is South Uist&#x27;s largest loch and at long it all but cuts the island in two. Monro stated that &quot;the sea has gotten enteries to this fresche water loche&quot; and described the &quot;thicke dyke of rough staines&quot; that had been created to prevent salt water ingress. This apparently resulted in numerous fish being caught in the stones, including &quot;fluikes, podloches, skatts, and herings&quot; and he described another &quot;kynd of fishe, the quhantitie and shape of ane salmont, but it has na skaills at all; the under haffe, narrest his vombe is quhite, and the upmaist haffe narrest his back is als black as jett&quot;.

===Land tenure===
Monro&#x27;s description was:
This countrey is bruiked by sundrey captains; to witt, the south southwest end of it, callit Bayhastill, be M’Neill of Barray, the rest of the ile, namit Peiter’s parochin, the parochin of Howes, and the mayne land of the mid countrey callit Mackermeanache, perteins to Clanronald, halding of the Clandonald. At the end heirof the sea enters, and cuts the countrey be ebbing and flowing through it: and in the north syde of this there is ane parochin callit Buchagla, perteining to the said Clandonald. At the north end thereof the sea cuts the countrey againe, and that cutting of the sea is called Careynesse, and benorth this countrey is called Kenehnache of Ywst, that is in Englishe, the north head of Ywst, whilk term is twa paroche kirks, and is mair of profit than the rest of haill of Ywst, perteining to Donald Gormesone.

<doc id="500175" wikidata="Q2111163" url="?curid=500175" title="Low Mass">
<text>Low Mass (Latin &quot;Missa Privata&quot;) is a Catholic Mass celebrated by a priest without the assistance of sacred ministers (deacon and subdeacon). Before 1969 reforms, a sub-distinction was also made between the &quot;sung Mass&quot; (), when the celebrant still chants those parts which the rubrics require to be chanted, and the &quot;low Mass&quot; () where the liturgy is spoken. 

In a low Mass, the priest may be assisted by altar boys rather than deacons, and use appropriately simplified rubrics.

A full sung Mass celebrated with the assistance of sacred ministers is a High or Solemn Mass.

==History==
Low Mass originated in the early Middle Ages as a shortened or simplified form of Solemn Mass. In the early church, as in the Eastern Orthodox church today, all services were chanted, and there was no equivalent to the Roman Low Mass or to the Anglican &quot;said celebration&quot;.

===Masses without solemnity in early Christianity===
Alongside the public solemn Masses, the practice developed from the 4th century onwards, of smaller private Masses for smaller groups of believers. These masses were often celebrated in the catacombs, for the deceased or on a special anniversary. An example is provided by Saint Augustine:

===Medieval origins of the Low Mass===
Christian practice had been that there was, at most, one Mass in a monastery or parish church each day. At Cluny in the 11th century a lay-brother (conversus) was summoned to serve any priest-monk who wanted to celebrate; rules and obligations, as the reading of a Sequence, during the celebration of the private Masses gradually fell, for reasons of convenience. This history of liturgy shows how &quot;out of the private Mass grew the read Mass – the low Mass&quot;.

In the late Middle Ages, with a growing awareness of the infinite value of the Mass, came a growing desire to multiply its celebration. Spiritual, as well as material reasons were at hand. The most pronounced result of the multiplying of Masses was the increase in low Masses, since most of them were for private requests and had no public character. This trend to the private and the subjective, to an independence from the grand order of things was also displayed in another abuse, namely, setting aside the arrangement of the ecclesiastical year and confining oneself to Votive Masses either chosen at will or arranged according to the rules of the Mass series. Over time it became necessary for a variety of reasons to celebrate more than one on the same day. It also became customary for monasteries to ordain most of their monks, though originally monks were almost all laymen, and for every priest to say a daily Mass. For a while, concelebration, whereby several priests took a full priestly part in offering Mass, provided all with the possibility to celebrate Mass each day, but this custom died out. Low Mass is considered to be a necessity that falls short of the ideal, which is Solemn Mass.

&quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1913 describes the result as follows:
By the end of the Middle Ages, critics had grown more numerous, and mystics, such as Nicholas of Cusa, or bishops, attempted a spiritual and disciplinary reform, to avoid scandals of botched Masses and abuse of stipends. A special work of Martin Luther&#x27;s deals with &quot;the abomination of the low Mass called the canon&quot; (&quot;Von dem Greuel der Stillmesse so man Canon nennet&quot;, 1524). His criticisms were such that priests, who had been living on Mass stipends, could no longer do so as easily, even in staunchly Catholic areas as the Archbishopric of Salzburg.

===Tridentine Reform===
The Council of Trent was concerned above all with the &quot;Low Mass&quot; (that is, with a liturgy that was recited and not sung), which had become the ordinary form of the Eucharistic celebration in the parishes. The Roman Missal revised after the Council of Trent appears as a work that defines, above all, the rituals of &quot;Low Mass&quot; or the &quot;private Mass&quot;. Some have argued that in giving priority to the &quot;Low Mass&quot;, a practice developed of making the Eucharistic celebration an act of private devotion by the priest, whereas the faithful were simply invited to attend the Mass and to unite their prayers with it as sincerely as possible as a certain individualism developed alongside the &quot;devotio moderna&quot;.

Those who during the Counter-Reformation attempted to rebuild religious life had to look for different ways and means to enable the faithful to participate in a devout manner. One of the ways was to encourage vocal prayer during Mass, to meditate on the mysteries of the life of Christ by praying the Rosary, a practise which had existed locally since the Middle Ages, but which become popular under the influence of the popular missions organized by the Jesuits. The German &quot;Singmesse&quot;, which added sung hymns to the Low Mass, gradually won great popularity, to the place that it began to take over the Solemn Mass.

By the mid-20th century, a new form of the Low Mass, the &quot;missa dialogata&quot;, appeared as a new mode of encouraging the participation of the faithful. In the Low Mass, the alternation of functions between priest, lector, singing choir and people had been leveled off to a uniform speaking by the priest alone. However, the Low Mass had acquired such a great preponderance over the various forms of high Mass that without further ado it was used as the groundwork for the development of the dialogue Mass. In essentials nevertheless, the High Mass had to set the norm. Various local churches went in various directions and the so-called &quot;Betsingmesse&quot; (&quot;pray and sing mass&quot;) very quickly gained recognition since its first trial use at the Vienna Catholic Day in 1933. No changes affected the &quot;Missale Romanum&quot;, neither its texts nor its rubrics, as the changes concerned the participation of the faithful solely.

The Tridentine Mass defined officially in the Code of Rubrics included in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal is a Mass in which the priest does not chant the parts that the rubrics assign to him.&lt;refn&gt;&quot;Missarum species duae sunt: &quot;Missa in cantu&quot; et &quot;Missa lecta&quot;. Missa dicitur &quot;in cantu&quot;, si sacerdos celebrans partes ab ipso iuxta rubricas cantandas revera cantu profert: secus dicitur &quot;lecta&quot;; &quot;Masses are of two kinds: &quot;sung Masses (in cantu)&quot; and &quot;low Masses (Missa lecta)&quot;).&quot; &lt;/refn&gt;

=== Modern===
Catholic writer Stratford Caldecott has suggested that the Low Mass is so influential it may now be considered the real model of the post-Vatican II Mass.

In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI introduced an optional novelty into the traditional Low Mass: in Masses with a congregation celebrated according to the 1962 Missal, the vernacular language, and not Latin alone, may be used in proclaiming the Scripture readings, provided that the translation used comes from an edition approved by the Holy See.

== &quot;Private Mass&quot; ==

&quot;Private Mass&quot; (in Latin, &quot;Missa privata&quot; or &quot;secreta, familiaris, peculiaris&quot;), which is now understood as Mass celebrated without a congregation (&quot;sine populo&quot;), formerly meant any Low Mass, even with a large congregation. In editions of the Roman Missal earlier than that of 1962, &quot;Missa privata&quot; was still contrasted with &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;. In 1960 Pope John XXIII, who in 1962 removed from the Roman Missal the section headed &quot;Rubricae generales Missalis&quot;, replacing it with his Code of Rubrics, decried use of the term &quot;Missa privata&quot;: &quot;The most sacred Sacrifice of the Mass celebrated according to the rites and regulations is an act of public worship offered to God in the name of Christ and the Church. Therefore, the term &#x27;private Mass&#x27; should be avoided.&quot; When applied to Low Mass in general, the word &quot;privata&quot; indicated that that form of Mass was &quot;deprived&quot; of certain ceremonies.

==Structure of the Low Mass==
The Eucharistic celebration is &quot;one single act of worship&quot; but consists of different elements, which always include &quot;the proclamation of the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits, above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of bread and wine, which signifies also our own transformation into the body of Christ; and participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord&#x27;s body and blood&quot;.

Low Mass, celebrated in exactly the same way whether a congregation is present or not, was the most common form of Mass before 1969. In the 1970 edition of the Roman Missal a distinction was made between Mass celebrated with a congregation and Mass celebrated without a congregation. No such distinction was made in earlier (Tridentine) editions of the Roman Missal, which only distinguished between Solemn Mass and Low Mass (calling the latter &quot;Missa lecta&quot; or, as in the &quot;Rubricae generales Missalis&quot; included in pre-1962 editions, &quot;Missa privata&quot;).

The structure of the Tridentine Low Mass was generally the same as that of the Solemn High Mass. However, prayers after Mass, including the Leonine prayers, were added. The main celebrant is not assisted by a deacon nor subdeacon, nor is he answered by a choir, but one or two altar servers follow their duties as acolytes, and answer the responses in Latin. All prayers are recited and no singing is expected. The incensement rite is not included. The faithful were expected to kneel for most of the Mass, except for the proclamation of the Gospel.

==Variations==
===National variations===
Originally, Low Mass was sung in monotone. Thus we read of priests in the Middle Ages going to &quot;sing&quot; their &quot;Missa privata&quot; or &quot;Low Mass&quot;. This custom of singing died out in the 18th century. Much of the Tridentine Low Mass is said in a voice audible only to the celebrating priest and the server(s).

The French and Germans evolved the concept of accompanying Low Mass with music as an aid to the devotion of the faithful, thus giving rise to the French Organ Mass and the Deutsche Singmesse. Also Messe basse, the French translation of Low Mass, was used to indicate Mass compositions, e.g. Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Messe basse&quot;.

In 1922, the Holy See granted approval to the Dialogue Mass, which enabled the faithful to speak, with the server, the Latin responses of the Tridentine Mass and to recite the parts that they were permitted to sing at a &quot;Missa Cantata&quot;, as well as the triple &quot;Domine non sum dignus&quot; that the priest said as part of the rite of Communion of the faithful, which, though not envisaged in the Ordinary of the Mass until after the Second Vatican Council, could be inserted into the celebration of Mass.

===The three Masses of All Souls Day===
All Souls Day is the only non-Sunday, non-Holy Day in the Church Year on which a priest is permitted to celebrate three Masses. The Tridentine Missal contains three distinct sets of Mass Propers to be celebrated, should a priest be able to celebrate all three Masses. Note that no matter how many Masses are celebrated, the faithful may receive Holy Communion at no more than two Masses per day.

===Pontifical Low Mass===
At a Pontifical Low Mass, i.e. a Low Mass celebrated by a bishop, in addition to the two servers that you find at any typical low Mass, there are also two priest-attendants to the bishop that assist him, reminding us that a bishop retains the fullness of holy orders. Instead of a mitre, a biretta is used by the prelate.

Before the Second Vatican Council, at a Papal Low Mass (which was usually celebrated at a portable altar set up in one of the rooms of the Apostolic Palace and is distinct from the private Mass the Pope said in his private chapel), the Pope was assisted by two bishops and four papal Masters of Ceremonies. Chamberlains (&quot;cubicularii&quot;) served as torchbearers. The pontifical canon was used, as was the bugia. Vesting and unvesting at the altar is another peculiarity of Pontifical Low Mass.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Three Low Masses&quot; (&quot;Les Trois Messes basses&quot;) is a Christmas story by Alphonse Daudet, published in 1875 in the &quot;Tales of Monday&quot; and integrated in 1879 in the collection of the &quot;Letters from my Windmill&quot;. The story is at the end of the eighteenth century, in an imaginary Provençal castle. Pleasant and irreverent, tinged with fantasy, it depicts a priest guilty of the sin of gluttony. Tempted by the devil who, in the guise of his young sexton, has described to him in great detail the exquisite menu of New Year&#x27;s Eve, he sends off three Christmas Masses to rush more quickly to the table. God punishes his offense: before going to heaven, he will have to recite, for a century, in the company of his faithful culprits, a service of the Nativity, or three hundred low masses.

However, the Christmas Low Masses are a goof as the rubrics extended the privilege of three sung Masses from the Pope to all the clergy, and in no case applied to the Low Mass. The three stational Masses celebrated by the Pope in Rome extended to three Christmas Masses to be sung, not without interruption: that of the day, &quot;solemnissima,&quot;; that of the night, &quot;valde solemnis,&quot;; that of daybreak, &quot;minus solemnis&quot; and resulted of a duplicate of the feast of the Epiphanies in Jerusalem. The privilege of celebrating at night did not extend, except indult, to private Masses, i.e. low Masses; the contrary custom was an abuse and was condoned.

A French-language film with the same title was made in 1954 by Marcel Pagnol.

<text>Ingwavuma is a town in the Umkhanyakude District Municipality of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. It is unclear where the name of the town came from; one theory is that it was named after the Ngwavuma River while another is that there was a leader called Vuma, the name then meaning &quot;Vuma&#x27;s place&quot; in Zulu. Trees found on the river bank are also named Ngwavuma (&quot;Elaeodendron transvaalense&quot; or Bushveld Saffron) but it is unclear which entity was named after which (person, river, town or trees). It is over above sea level in the Lebombo Mountains and boasts several highly scenic spots. The town is from the country&#x27;s border with Eswatini and overlooks the plains of Maputaland to the East.

== History ==
Zulu king Dingane was assassinated and buried in the nearby Hlatikhulu Forest in 1840. Ingwavuma was founded by Sir Charles Saunders of Eshowe in 1895 as a magistracy for the Ngwavuma region. During the Second Boer War in 1899 the settlement was razed to the ground by a Boer commando under the command of Joachim Ferreira. The serving magistrate, B. Colenbrander, escaped with his staff to the flats below and eventually found his way to Ubombo. Ingwavuma remained desolate until 1900 when it was re-established and the magistrate returned.

In the 1980s the Apartheid government planned to transfer the town and surrounding magisterial district to Swaziland as part of a land deal to give Eswatini access to the sea. This move was opposed by the then KwaZulu government and the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini established a residence near the town. The transfer was never executed. The surviving historic buildings of the town include the residency (now the municipal buildings), the police station and the Old Gaol Building.

==Services and facilities==
* Mosvold Hospital is located within the centre of the town. The hospital was initially established by The Evangelical Alliance Mission as a mission hospital but has subsequently been taken over by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health.
* There are a number of schools in and around the town including Ingwavuma High School, Nansindlela School, Isicelosethu High School, Magugu Primary, Our Lady Primary, Lundini Primary, Mbalekelwa primary and Khethani Christian School.
* Local offices of the government departments of Social Development, Agriculture, Education and Home Affairs. There is also a police station, magistrate&#x27;s court and prison.
* Several NGOs provide essential services in the area, including the Zisize (Ingwavuma) Educational Trust, which oversees the Ekukhanyeni Cluster Foster Care Scheme; the Ingwavuma Women&#x27;s Centre and Embathisa, both of which offer income-generating activities for local women; Ingwavuma Orphan Care, which provides community hospice and orphan care; and Butterfly Palliative Home, a non-profit children&#x27;s hospice caring for orphaned and abandoned children with life-limiting conditions.
* There is a small shopping centre consisting of a Spar, PEP, Ellerines, Ithala Bank and a petrol garage along with some Chinese-owned shops.
* In 1962, the town was made the seat of the Apostolic Prefecture of Ingwavuma.
* Ingwavuma has an access road to the border with Swaziland, known as Cecil max pas border post which was closed due to stolen vehicles being smuggled through there. Later it was renamed to Freedom dots border post. The road to this border post to Swaziland lies between a Lebombo mountain hillside and the Ngwavuma river.

== Geography ==
Ingwavuma is located on top of a mountain in the Lebombo mountain range with several caves in its vicinity. To the west it overlooks the plains of Eswatini. East the hills drop towards the Maputaland while the Lebombo mountain range continues north towards Mozambique and south towards Jozini.

The Ngwavuma River, one of five major rivers in Eswatini originates in this area.

==HIV/AIDS==
The Ingwavuma Area has been decimated by HIV/AIDS since the 1990s. In 2002, in Jozini municipality, 57% of people were less than 19 years of age, one third of adults were thought to be HIV positive with uninfected adults having a 3% chance of contracting HIV in any particular year. Several Non-Governmental Organisations are addressing the problems caused by HIV/AIDS, led by Ingwavuma Orphan Care. A mobile voluntary counseling and testing unit (VCT) was started in 2008 by Ingwavuma Orphan Care. It tests around 5000 people a year, with its focus on youth. It found a prevalence rate of 8% among males and 18% among females. While antiretroviral treatment is now available through the government, there are already thousands of orphans who require support. The majority of these are cared for by their extended family with support from churches, NGOs and the government.

<doc id="500192" wikidata="Q4735037" url="?curid=500192" title="Alpha Gamma Delta">
<text>Alpha Gamma Delta (), also known as Alpha Gam, is an international women&#x27;s fraternity and social organization. It was founded on May 30, 1904, by eleven female students at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, and thus it is the youngest member of the Syracuse Triad of North American social sororities that also includes Gamma Phi Beta (1874) and Alpha Phi (1872). Since its founding, Alpha Gamma Delta has initiated over 201,000 members and installed 199 collegiate chapters and more than 250 alumnae groups.

The fraternity provides various social, academic, leadership, and community service opportunities for collegiate members and alumnae. Throughout the organization&#x27;s history, it has sponsored charities and causes via grants, scholarships, and volunteer hours. Its current philanthropic initiative is a fight against hunger partnered with the nonprofit organizations Feeding America and Meals on Wheels.

Alpha Gamma Delta is one of 26 North American fraternities that are members of the National Panhellenic Conference. The fraternity&#x27;s international headquarters is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

== History ==

=== Founding===
In 1904, efforts to introduce a new women&#x27;s fraternity at Syracuse University began from eleven women and Dr. Wellesley Perry Coddington, a professor at the university who encouraged his students to form new fraternities and was instrumental in the early development of Alpha Gamma Delta. In May of that year, the founding women chose the fraternity&#x27;s colors, motto, and badge.

Alpha Gamma Delta was officially founded on May 30, 1904, at Dr. Coddington&#x27;s home with eleven founders: 
At the founding, its constitution and bylaws were read and adopted and suggestions for a ritual were made. Jennie Titus was elected as the first president. Unlike many other groups founded at the time, Alpha Gamma Delta was founded as a US-wide women&#x27;s fraternity rather than a local fraternity or a literary or professional society, also refusing an offer to join one of the other two US-wide women&#x27;s fraternities on campus.

The organization&#x27;s official designation as a fraternity rather than a sorority derives from an early advisor who noted that &quot;soror&quot; is a Latin word with no connection to the Greek traditions cited by similar collegiate social groups. Many other Greek-letter organizations for women also refer to themselves as fraternities, although in the collective sense, they are generally called sororities.

=== Expansion and first philanthropies===
Alpha Gamma Delta expanded to an unusual extent during its early years; its &quot;Beta chapter&quot; was founded at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1905 and by 1909, its 9th chapter—&quot;Iota&quot;—was founded at the University of Washington. The fraternity&#x27;s first National Conference was held in 1907, and two years later it joined the National Panhellenic Conference.

Alpha Gamma Delta began international expansion in 1919 with the chartering of its &quot;Tau chapter&quot; at the University of Toronto. The fraternity held its annual meeting at the International Convention and adopted an international philanthropy project.

The 1910s and 1920s saw the beginning of the fraternity centralizing its philanthropic objectives toward single causes. Instead of hosting its sixth annual National Convention, the fraternity&#x27;s national president canceled the meeting and asked chapters to donate their $50 fees to war relief efforts. Many chapters adopted war orphans or made garments, beginning the fraternity&#x27;s timeline of organized charitable activity. During World War I, the fraternity supported the American Red Cross and various war relief efforts. This service continued during World War II. In 1920, the fraternity created its first official philanthropy by starting a summer camp for underprivileged children in Jackson, Michigan, which expanded into Wellington, Canada. These camps hosted more than 7,000 children and ran for 27 years.

In 1947, Alpha Gamma Delta&#x27;s primary philanthropic activities shifted from volunteering with underprivileged children to sponsoring counselors for the National Society for Crippled Children and Adults. That year, the fraternity held its first International Convention outside the United States, in Banff, Alberta. By 1949, the fraternity had installed 60 chapters and had initiated 20,840 members.

In 1959, at the organization&#x27;s 22nd International Convention, Theta Sigma Upsilon merged with Alpha Gamma Delta and added 19 chapters to the latter&#x27;s roster.

=== Organizational and philanthropic changes===

During and after the 1960s, the organization underwent restructuring, in which it created a separate branch to manage its philanthropic sponsorships and run programs for its members. A separate foundation, originally called the Founders Memorial Foundation, was established in 1962 to handle fundraising; it was later renamed the Alpha Gamma Delta Foundation. This Foundation managed the funds raised by collegiate and alumnae chapters via activities and by direct donations to the foundation. In 1979, the fraternity partnered with the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and again changed its primary philanthropic focus, which would later expand in 1991 to diabetes treatment and research.

Alpha Gamma Delta celebrated its centennial anniversary during its 2004 International Convention.

In the 2010s, Alpha Gamma Delta continued to change and restructure, creating a separate branch to manage its collegiate housing and again changing its service and philanthropy programs. The fraternity founded its Fraternity Housing Corporation in 2010 to provide local chapters with a national property management and funding option; in 2021, circa 100 out of 125 active chapters are managed under this corporation. The fraternity partnered with Feeding America and Meals on Wheels in 2017 and now focuses its community service and fundraising initiatives towards fighting hunger .

Alpha Gamma Delta gives back to the community through community service efforts. In 2016, they launched their first International Week of Service where members from all over North America participate in local community service initiatives. Members volunteer their time at humane societies, retirement communities, local clean-up services, and many more. By volunteering together during the Week of Service, they can impact their communities.

== Symbols ==
While Alpha Gamma Delta has no official symbols, it has official flowers, colors, and a jewel chosen by the founders. Alpha Gamma Delta&#x27;s flowers are red and buff roses, and green asparagus plusmosa ferns, matching the official colors red, buff, and green. The jewel is the pearl. The &quot;armorial bearings&quot; of the fraternity were designed by founding member Emily Helen Butterfield in 1906.

The fraternity&#x27;s vision is to &quot;Inspire the woman. Impact the world&quot;, while its motto is to &quot;Loving, Leading, Lasting&quot;

=== Mascot ===
In 1915, &quot;Gamma chapter&quot; at Wesleyan University chose the mascot, a squirrel, and named it Skiouros, with the following explanation: &quot;...[S]ome [members] sought a mascot to symbolize the characteristics of the colors and progress of Alpha Gamma Delta ... the little squirrel, a typical frequenter of autumn haunts, was chosen as the mascot. Our little friend, we find, is also nimble and agile—he leaps from branch to branch and [symbolizes] the spirit that never dies, the spirit of energetic alertness and progress.&quot;

=== Badge ===
The fraternity&#x27;s founders designed a badge; they decided on a new design submitted by Mr. J. F. Newman, a jeweler, in the following months: &quot;The second, and current, badge features a plain Delta (&#x27;), a chased Gamma (&#x27;), and an Alpha () set with pearls [the official jewel] or diamonds superimposed on the other two letters&quot;. Members may attach one of several honors chains to their badges if they have received the appropriate honor.

== Programs ==
=== Alpha Gamma Delta Foundation ===
Alpha Gamma Delta participates in philanthropy through donations made through a separate arm, the Alpha Gamma Delta Foundation. Created in 1962, the Foundation provides grants to organizations and individuals in the U.S. and Canada who are involved in fields related to certain causes. The Foundation currently and historically awards scholarships and grants, funds wellness programs, and provides leadership training and other courses.

Since 2017, the fraternity&#x27;s philanthropic objective has been to fight hunger, and it currently works with Feeding America and Meals on Wheels America. , its campaign, which is titled &quot;Full Plates. Hearts. Minds&quot;, provides meals for hungry people and creates awareness of food insecurity.

=== Local activities ===
Collegiate and alumnae members participate in fundraising activities for the Alpha Gamma Delta Foundation and volunteer with and raise funds for food-based organizations in local communities, including Feeding America and Meals on Wheels. Chapters plan their local events, which include fundraisers and galas.

Chapters also plan social events such as formals and mixers with fraternities, host sisterhood activities, and reunions, and participate in charity-related events. As for academics, each chapter must maintain a 2.9 average GPA to remain in good standing with the national organization. The fraternity has scholastic recognition and programs for individuals who maintain a GPA above 3.14 and for chapters averaging from 3.14 to 3.5 and higher.

Alpha Gamma Delta created an annual internal celebration called International Reunion Day in 1936, as many of its collegiate chapters could not celebrate the organization&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Day on May 30 due to university vacation closures or final exams held on that day. Collegiate and alumnae chapters were—and still are—encouraged to meet on the third Saturday of April instead.

== Membership ==
According to Alpha Gamma Delta, the fraternity has an initiated member base of over 201,000 and 119 active chapters. As with all National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, women may join Alpha Gamma Delta if they attend as an undergraduate a university with an active chapter from which they receive a membership offer. Prospective members must meet the fraternity&#x27;s national minimum GPA requirement (2.5/4.0) as well as the chapter&#x27;s requirement. Alternatively, women past college age may be invited or may apply to join via alumnae initiation if they are not already a member of another NPC sorority, a process which 20 of the 26 NPC members also participate in. Due to NPC agreements, no woman who has been initiated into another NPC sorority may join another one, although no NPC member is restricted from joining a professional or service Greek letter organization.

Collegiate members have chapter meetings, philanthropy events, and chapter leadership opportunities; according to the fraternity&#x27;s website, active membership involves programming with the Epsilon Pi Journey. Alumnae in good standing may join one of 250+ alumnae clubs in North America.

== Leadership ==
International Headquarters is the governing body for all members—undergraduate, and alumnae—and is headed by an International President. The International Headquarters calls an annual meeting of chapter presidents and any alumnae or collegiate members who wish to attend. As chapters expanded early in the 20th century, Alpha Gamma Delta established fraternity provinces organized by geographic region; these have directors who lead each province and represent them to the International Headquarters.

Individual collegiate chapters follow a standardized leadership structure; they have an elected executive board consisting of a president and several vice presidents with different responsibilities. Alumnae often act as advisors or volunteers for a nearby collegiate chapter.

In 1982, the fraternity launched an annual leadership program, The Leadership Conference, to provide its members with leadership education. However, after continual requests for the program to speak at conferences, present at events, or run corporate retreats, this program branched into an organization of its own, the Leadership Institute, which now runs around 60 programs to address women&#x27;s leadership, both inside and outside of workplaces and careers.

Today, Alpha Gam hosts an annual Academy for Collegiate Officers and biannual Academies for Chapter Officers and its Volunteer Service Team.

== Chapters ==

Alpha Gamma Delta has 199 collegiate chapters across North America; these are grouped and named by geographical region. The longest-running active collegiate chapter is &quot;Delta chapter&quot; at the University of Minnesota. Since its re-establishment in 2010, the oldest active collegiate chapter is the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at Syracuse University.

== Fraternity Housing Corporation ==
The Alpha Gamma Delta Fraternity Housing Corporation (FHC) is a 501(c)(7) organization formed in 2010 to provide student housing for the fraternity&#x27;s undergraduate members. Currently, the FHC provides property management services to about 100 collegiate chapters and about 100 staff members in the headquarters office and local US chapters. Outside of housing, the FHC manages meal services for the members of the fraternity. It reported assets of US$78 million in 2019.

== Notable members ==
== Local chapter and member misconduct ==
In 1970, at Eastern Illinois University, Donna Bedlinger died from head trauma after she was left in the woods with other pledges as part of hazing.

In 2000, a member at the University of Georgia filed a discrimination complaint against her chapter, alleging that members denied a black classmate a membership offer due to her race. The chapter was temporarily suspended and received racial sensitivity training. After this incident, the university Interfraternity Conference created a diversity improvement program.

In 2013 and 2014, sorority women from multiple chapters at the University of Alabama – including Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Phi Mu, Kappa Delta, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Delta Delta, and Chi Omega – alleged that either active members or some alumnae had prevented them from offering membership to black candidates because of their race. Alpha Gamma Delta member Melanie Gotz stated that the entire collegiate chapter had &quot;wanted this girl to be in Alpha Gam [but] were just powerless over the alums.&quot; An alum denied the allegations in the report, and the national headquarters issued a statement saying that the sorority &quot;prohibits discrimination based on race in all of its activities including recruitment.&quot; Gotz and fellow students held a campus march to integrate campus Greek life, and following media and national outcry, the university held a second round of recruitment to offer membership to more women, including black women. The Alabama chapter initiated its first black member that year.

<text>The Institute of Technology, Tralee (IT Tralee; ) was an institute of technology, located in Tralee, Ireland. It was established in 1977 as the Regional Technical College, Tralee. In January 2021, itself and the Cork Institute of Technology were dissolved to become the Munster Technological University, Ireland&#x27;s second technological university.

==History==
Tralee RTC was established in 1977 under the control of the Town of Tralee Vocational Education Committee (VEC). Dr. Seán McBride was appointed Principal in 1978. In 1984, work began on the South Campus. In 1992, Tralee RTC became an autonomous institution under the Regional Technical Colleges Act (1992). In 1997, Tralee RTC was renamed, along with the other RTCs, as the Institute of Technology, Tralee. In 2007, the title of the head of the institute changed from &quot;Director&quot; to &quot;President.&quot; Michael Carmody served as president until 2011. Dr. Oliver Murphy served as acting president until appointed to the post for a five-year term. Despite resigning, Dr. Murphy was reappointed to a second five-year term in 2017, and prior to the merger with MTU, retired in 2020.

==Schools and departments==

The institute has two campuses - the North campus (located in Dromtacker) and the South campus (located in Clash) - approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) apart. it has the following Schools and Departments:

*School of Business, Computing and Humanities &quot;located on the North campus&quot;:
**Creative Media and Information Technology Department
**Business Studies Department
**Hotel, Culinary Arts and Tourism Department
**Computing Department
*School of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics &quot;located on the South campus&quot;:
**Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Department
**Civil Engineering and Construction Studies Department
**Agriculture and Manufacturing Studies Department
**Biological and Pharmaceutical Science Department
**Apprentice Section
*School of Health and Social Sciences:
**Health and Leisure Studies Department &quot;located on the North campus&quot;
**Social Sciences Department &quot;located in the North Campus&quot;
**Nursing and Health Care Sciences Department &quot;located in the North campus&quot;

The South campus has been in operation since the opening of the Institute in 1977. The North campus opened in 2001. The continuing development of the North campus will eventually lead to the entire institute being relocated to Dromtacker.

==Merger to become Munster Technological University==

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the formal approval of Munster Technological University in May 2020, to begin operations in January 2021.

Munster TU is among a group of other possible Technological Universities to add to TU Dublin.

==Industry links==
The Tom Crean Business Incubation Centre opened in the north campus in January 2005. Situated on the same site in Dromtacker is the Kerry Technology Park, owned and operated by Shannon Development. The Park and the Institute often work closely together, developing curricula and providing an exchange of students to work in the Park. In September 2004, a new nursing complex opened on the North campus. The &quot;Solás building&quot;, as it is known, is where student nurses learn practical nursing skills.

The Shannon Applied Biotechnology Centre (SABC) is also based on the campus of IT Tralee and is a joint venture between IT Tralee and Limerick Institute of Technology.

==Sports==
In 1997, IT Tralee GAA became the first RTC team to win the Sigerson Cup. It was only Tralee&#x27;s second outing in this competition. However, the college created further history by winning the Sigerson three times in successive seasons to become the only RTC/Institute of Technology to do so in the competition&#x27;s history.

The men&#x27;s team won the Trench Cup (the second tier Gaelic football championship trophy for Third Level Education Colleges, Institutes of Technology and Universities in Ireland and England) in 2010.

The Ladies football team also won the O&#x27;Connor Cup back-to-back in 1998 and 1999. The hurlers also won the Ryan Cup in 1997 with the camogie team winning the Purcell Shield also in the same year.

<text>A thurible (via Old French from Medieval Latin ) is a metal incense burner suspended from chains, in which incense is burned during worship services. It is used in Christian churches, including those of the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Old Catholic denominations, as well as in some Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Methodist and Anglican churches (with its use almost universal amongst Anglican churches of Anglo Catholic churchmanship). The acolyte or altar server who carries the thurible is called the &quot;thurifer&quot;. The practice is rooted in the earlier traditions of Judaism dating from the time of the Second Jewish Temple. In Christianity, the use of incense is symbolic of &quot;cleansing and purification&quot;, as well as its fragrance suggesting &quot;Christ’s robe of righteousness&quot; that covers the sin of humankind.

Beyond its ecclesiastical use, the thurible is also employed in various other spiritual or ceremonial traditions, including some Gnostic Churches, Freemasonry (especially in the consecration of new lodges), and in Co-Freemasonry. Thuribles are sometimes employed in the practice of ceremonial magic.

The workings of a thurible are quite simple. Each thurible consists of a censer section, chains (typically three or four, although single-chain thuribles also exist), a metal ring around the chains (used to lock the lid of the censer section in place), and usually (although not always) a removable metal crucible in which the burning charcoals are placed. Many thuribles are supplied with a stand, allowing the thurible to be hung safely when still hot, but not in use. Burning charcoal is placed inside the metal censer, either directly into the bowl section, or into a removable crucible if supplied, and incense (of which there are many different varieties) is placed upon the charcoal, where it melts to produce a sweet smelling smoke. This may be done several times during the service as the incense burns quite quickly. Once the incense has been placed on the charcoal the thurible is then closed and used for censing.

A famous thurible is the huge &quot;Botafumeiro&quot; in Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, Spain.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;thurible&quot; comes from the Old French , which in turn is derived from the Latin term . The Latin is further formed from the root , meaning &#x27;incense&#x27;. is an alteration of the Ancient Greek word (), which is derived from () &quot;to sacrifice&quot;.

==Use in the Bible and Early Christianity==
The use of incense in Christianity is inspired by passages in the Bible; its use in prayer and worship carries with it a Christian symbolism:
== Use by Christian denomination ==
=== Roman Rite ===
The Roman Missal, as revised in 1969, allows the use of incense at any Mass: in the entrance procession; at the beginning of Mass to incense the cross and the altar; at the Gospel procession and proclamation; after the bread and the chalice have been placed upon the altar, to incense the offerings, the cross, and the altar, as well as the priest and the people; at the elevation of the host and the chalice after the consecration. In Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and Eucharistic Adoration in the Roman Rite, incense is also used, and is required if the Blessed Sacrament is exposed in a monstrance rather than being in a ciborium. Incense is also burnt on the altar during its consecration by a bishop in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church.

The number of swings of the thurible to be used when incensing persons or objects is specified in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal:
*Three double swings: the Most Blessed Sacrament, a relic of the Holy Cross and images of the Lord exposed for public veneration, the offerings for the sacrifice of the Mass, the altar cross, the &quot;Book of the Gospels&quot;, the Paschal Candle, the priest, and the people.

*Two double swings (and only at the beginning of the celebration, after the incensing of the altar): relics and images of the Saints exposed for public veneration.
*A series of single swings: the altar.
*The priest may incense the offerings for Mass by tracing a cross over them with the thurible instead of using three swings of the thurible.
The responsibilities of a thurifer include:
*Holding the thurible open to enable the priest to put incense in it, after which he blesses it with the Sign of the Cross without using any formula of words.
*Carrying the thurible in procession (gently swinging if needed to keep the charcoal burning).
*Presenting the thurible to the priest or deacon when they need to use it.
*Incensing (in the absence of a deacon) the priest after the priest has incensed the offering at Mass.

Another server, previously called a &quot;boat boy&quot; and now more commonly a &quot;boat bearer&quot;, may carry a boat or container of incense with a small spoon to add grains as the thurible burns low.

These rules, except for the manner of incensing the offerings at Mass, applied also before 1969. Earlier editions of the Roman Missal prescribe that the offerings be incensed by forming over them with the thurible three crosses and then three circles, the first two anticlockwise and last clockwise, while also saying a prescribed prayer with the words matching the strokes. They also direct that incensing the altar be done with single swings at 29 designated points of an altar attached to the rear wall of the sanctuary, and at 22 points of a freestanding altar.

The 1960 Code of Rubrics, incorporated into the 1962 Roman Missal, envisaged the use of incense at Solemn Mass and &quot;Missa cantata&quot;, but not at Low Mass.

=== Ambrosian Rite ===
In the Ambrosian Rite, the thurible has no top cover, and is swung clockwise before censing a person or object.

=== Lutheran Rite ===
In the Lutheran Churches, the thurible is carried by an acolyte known as the thurifer.

Its use is normative during the celebration of the Mass, during &quot;the entrance procession (marking the space and the gathered people of God), the gospel procession (marking the highpoint of the Word portion of the service), at the offertory to cense the bread and wine (marking the Meal portion), and at sending (heightening the importance of our ministry in the world).&quot; The Book of the Gospels, the altar, the Eucharistic elements, as well as the priest and faithful are incensed during various portions of the Divine Service.

It is additionally used during the praying of the canonical hours in Lutheran churches: &quot;During Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer the altar is often censed during the Gospel Canticle, connecting daily prayer with its central foundation, the weekly celebration of Holy Communion.&quot;

=== Anglican Rite ===

Use of incense was abandoned in the Church of England by the turn of the 19th century and was later thought to be illegal. Today, the use of incense in an Anglican church is a fairly reliable guide to churchmanship, that is, how &#x27;high&#x27; (more Catholic in liturgical style) or how &#x27;low&#x27; (more Reformed) the individual church is. Anglo-Catholic churches may use generous quantities of incense. In recent years, some middle-of-the-road Anglican churches have taken to using incense a few times a year for special occasions. The use of incense and chimes is colloquially called &quot;smells and bells&quot; by members of high church parishes, some as an inside joke, while others see it as a pejorative.
The number of points within the liturgy at which an Anglican church may use incense varies. If incense is used at the entrance procession, a thurifer holding the smoking thurible leads the procession and on arrival at the altar the bishop or priest presiding censes it either immediately after the introit or during the &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;, if this is sung. Incense may also be used at the reading of the gospel: after the announcement of the gospel, the book is censed left, centre and right.

If an Anglican church uses incense at only one point of the service, it does so at the offertory. The gifts and the altar are first censed; then follows censing of the priest (three swings of the thurible), of the other clergy (single swing to the gospel side and another to the epistle side), the choir (single or triple swing to either side) and the congregation (a swing to the gospel side, another to the epistle side and another to the middle).

Incense is also used at Solemn Evensong, which by definition is a sung celebration of vespers with use of incense.

=== Byzantine Rite ===
The Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Lutheran Churches, make frequent use of incense, not only at the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), but also at Vespers, Matins and a number of other occasional services (see Euchologion). During funeral services and memorial services (Panikhida), the censer is swung almost continuously.

Incense is understood as symbolizing the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit and the prayers of the Saints rising to heaven. Incense is offered by the priest or deacon during the services. In some traditions, the &quot;ecclesiarch&quot; (sacristan) and his assistant (&quot;paraecclesiarch&quot;) will perform the censing at specific moments of the service.

The thurible (, ; Church Slavonic: Кадило, Кадильница, ) is usually silver, brass or gold plated (combining in itself at the offering of incense the three gifts of the Biblical Magi: gold, frankincense, and myrrh). The thurible consists of a metal bowl (usually with a base so it can stand upright) into which the charcoal and incense are placed, and a lid (often topped with a cross), pierced by holes to allow the fragrance from the incense to escape. The censer will usually have three outer chains (for the Holy Trinity) attached to the bowl, and a fourth inner chain (for the Oneness of God) attached to the lid. The three outer chains are gathered together and attached to a round conical plate attached to a ring; the inner chain passes through a hole in the conical plate and is attached to another ring to make it easier to lift the lid. In the Greek and some Russian practice twelve bells will be attached to the chains (their ringing symbolizes the teaching of the twelve Apostles). Sometimes the bowl and lid of the thurible are decorated with crosses or icons in repousse, and may even be decorated with semi-precious stones. When not in use the thurible is usually hung from a hook in the sanctuary.

When censing, the priest or deacon holds the censer below the conical plate with only one hand (the right hand) allowing it to swing freely. He will make the Sign of the Cross with the censer by making two vertical swings and a third horizontal swing (the three swings together symbolizing the Holy Trinity).

When the temple (church building) is censed, the priest or deacon will move in a sunwise (clockwise) direction, moving to his right as he censes in order the Holy Table (altar), sanctuary, Iconostasis, walls of the temple, clergy and faithful. There are two types of censing: a Greater Censing (which encompasses the entire temple and all of the people therein), and a Lesser Censing (which, depending upon the liturgical context, consists of censing only a portion of the temple and the people).

During some censings, especially the Greater Censing, the clergyman who is performing the censing will often carry a candle in his left hand. During Bright Week (the week which begins on Easter Sunday) the priest and the deacon will carry special Paschal candles at every censing, even the Lesser Censing. While carrying the Paschal candles, the priest or deacon will greet the members of the congregation with the Paschal greeting while censing them. Simple tapers are carried while censing during funerals and memorial services.

During the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) the emperor used to be permitted to offer incense on the Feast of the Nativity (no doubt as a memorial of the gifts of the Magi), but was permitted to perform no other priestly function.

If no priest is available, incense may be offered by a reader or senior layman, but with a hand censer which has no chains on it, but rather a handle (it often has bells as well, suspended from the handle or around the rim). The hand censer is also used in some monasteries even when a priest is present for certain censings which are done by a monastic other than a vested priest or deacon.

During Holy Week it is customary in some places for even the priest and deacon to use the hand censer for all of the censings, as a sign of humility and mourning at the Passion of Christ.

The faithful will often burn incense, using a hand censer, in the home during Morning and Evening Prayers, and it is not unusual for the head of the household to bless the Holy Icons and all of the members of the household with a hand censer.

==Boat bearer==
The boat boy or boat bearer is a junior altar server position found in Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches. The role of a boat boy is to assist the thurifer, the senior altar server who carries the thurible. The boat bearer carries the , a small metal container, Latin , which holds the supplies of incense. The boat has a small spoon inside, Latin , which is used to transfer the grains of incense onto the red-hot charcoals in the thurible. Although at times the boat bearer transfers the incense himself, more usually he simply holds the boat open as the priest performs this task.

== References in culture and literature ==
In &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, it is noted that Absolon, &quot; [Middle English spelling of censer] &quot; (lines 3340–3342).

<doc id="500207" wikidata="Q111483" url="?curid=500207" title="El Nido, Palawan">
<text>El Nido, officially the Municipality of El Nido (, ), is a municipality in the province of Palawan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 50,494 people.

A managed resource protected area, it is known for its white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and limestone cliffs, as well as for being the gateway to the Bacuit archipelago.

==History==
El Nido, also known as Bacuit, has been inhabited by humans since at least 2680 BC, possibly as early as 22,000 years ago. This was confirmed by fossils and burial sites dating back to the Late Neolithic Age that can be found in many caves and excavation sites surrounding the municipality, particularly in Dewil Valley&#x27;s Ille Cave in New Ibajay. Chinese traders regularly visited the area of Palawan for its edible birds&#x27; nests during the Song dynasty (960–1279). The island was mentioned in Chinese records of 1225. Chau Ju-Kua, a trade commissioner of the port of Chuan, wrote about the island, &quot;Pa-Lao-Yu&quot; or &quot;Land of Beautiful Harbors&quot;, in his book &quot;Chu Fan Chi&quot;.

The town traces its roots from a small Tagbanwa village called &quot;Talindak&quot;. Sometime in the 16th century, waves of migrants from Cuyo Islands settled in the area. In the 1800s, the Spaniards arrived, and they moved to the area where the present-day Población and Mabini are located. The first Spanish families were the Canovas, Vázquez, Ríos, and Rey. In 1890, the Spaniards renamed it &quot;Bacuit&quot;. At the time, the center of the town was Cabigsing, then known as Inventario. Chinese families moved into the area about the same period, first settling in Langeblangeban. The first Chinese settlers were named Lim, Chin, Liao, Edsan, Ambao, Que-Ke, Lim Piao, Yu His, Pe Phan, and Pe Khen.

During the Spanish colonial era, the town was under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Taytay, which was the capital of the former &quot;Province of Calamianes&quot; from 1818, and the &quot;Province of Castilla&quot;, the area of what is now known as northern Palawan, from 1858. It remained part of Taytay until 1916, when it formally became an independent municipality. The new municipality was then known as Bacuit.

On June 17, 1954, Republic Act No. 1140 was approved, changing the name of the town from Bacuit to its present name, El Nido, after the edible nests of swiftlets (&quot;collocalia fuciphaga&quot;) found in the crevices of its limestone cliffs. These nests, &quot;nido&quot; in Spanish, the main ingredient for the gourmet nido soup, are being sold at approximately US$ 3,000 per kilogram.

In 1957, the following barrios were created:
* Villa Paz comprising the sitios of New Igabas, Candolay, Malapaho, Mabeñgeten, Dewel, Nalbekan, and Lapia;
* Bebeladan comprising the sitios of Mainlong, Bolabod, Balete, Culiong, Codongnon, Vigan, Pagawanen, Langeblangeban, Talulap, Bocboc, Miadiao, Avirawan, Pita, Deboluan, Balay-Bacaco, Kiminawit, Pamontonan, Simpian, Binabanan, Tegas, and Pinacpanacan;
* Bagong-Bayan comprising the sitios of Manogtog, Cadleman, Pinagtual, Omao, Nami, Tebey, Bato, Tuñgay, Cataaban, and Lomocob;
* Pasadeña comprising the sitios of Lamoro, Cagbatang, Bulalacao, Pinañganteñgan, Quinawañgan, Nagbaclao, Colantod, Loblob, and Badiang;
* Sibaltan comprising the sitios of Turatod, Buluang, Santa Monica, Senodioc, Laolao, Caboñgan, Tapic, Panian, Guitan, Loro, and Nagcalasag;
* Barotuan comprising the sitios of Taberna, Locaroc, Nagpan, Yocoton, Calitang, Wawa, Makinit, Canoling, Mabañgaon, and Mapeldeten;
* San Fernando comprising the sitios of Panian, Madorianen, Dipnay, Maubog, Guenleng, Palabuayan, Parañgaycayan, San Pablo, and Olac-olacan; and,
* Villa Libertad comprising the sitios of Calelenday, Taolili, Boloc, Inigtan, Mepague, Matolatolaon, Dao, Batbat, Madacotdacot, Nasigdan, Semenled, Bancalen, and Cagbanaba. In the same year, the barrio of Oton was renamed to Mabini.

==Geography==

El Nido is situated in Bacuit Bay and covers a land area of . It is in the northernmost tip of mainland Palawan and is bordered by the Linapacan Strait to the north, the Sulu Sea to the east, and the South China Sea to the west. El Nido includes 45 islands and islets, each with their own unique geological formations. The highest peak is at Cadlao Island, towering up to above sea level.

Together with Sulu Archipelago, Sabah, and the South China Sea, El Nido, being part of Palawan, is located in the tectonically active and seismically active Sunda Plate, a plate that is entirely separate from the Philippine Mobile Belt to which the rest of the Philippines belongs. The Permian to Paleogene rocks and limestone cliffs of El Nido are similar to those that can be found in Ha Long Bay in Vietnam, Guilin in China, as well as Krabi in Thailand, all of which are part of the Sunda Plate.

El Nido is about south-west of Manila, and north-east of Puerto Princesa, capital of Palawan. 

===Barangays===
El Nido is politically subdivided into eighteen barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

Four of these barangays are situated in the &quot;Población&quot; (town proper) and are also known by their respective zones.

* Bagong Bayan
* Buena Suerte (Zone II)
* Barotuan
* Bebeladan
* Corong-corong (Zone IV)
* Mabini (formerly Oton)
* Manlag
* Masagana (Zone III)
* New Ibajay
* Pasadeña
* Maligaya (Zone I)
* San Fernando
* Sibaltan
* Teneguiban
* Villa Libertad
* Villa Paz
* Bucana
* Aberawan
===Climate===

April and May are typically the driest, while the heaviest rainfall occurs around August. The northeast wind blows from December to March, occasionally interchanging with the north wind from December to February. The southwest wind is felt from June to October while the east wind, the mildest of all winds, blows during April and May.

The average temperature ranges from a low of to a high of . The coolest temperatures are usually experienced during January, while the hottest temperatures are felt in April and May. 

==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of El Nido was 50,494 people, with a density of .

The first town census of 1918 showed El Nido having a population of 1,789. In the period between 1980 and 1990, the population grew to 18,832. Based on the 2000 census, the annual growth rate is 3.58%. This is higher than the average annual population growth rate for the whole country for the periods 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2007, which were only 2.34% and 2.04% respectively.

According to the 2007 census, El Nido has a population of 30,249 people in 6,311 households in its eighteen barangays. Eighty-five percent of the population are living in the rural barangays, while only fifteen percent of them are in the Población area.
===Ethnic groups===
The original settlers of El Nido were the Tagbanwas and Cuyunons. Throughout the centuries, there has been a constant migration of Tagalogs, Hiligaynon, Bicolanos, Ilocanos, Chinese and Spaniards. There are also a small number of Japanese and Koreans. Intermarriage between ethnic and linguistic groups is not uncommon in El Nido.

===Languages===
The main language is Filipino (Tagalog). In addition, many people are very proficient in English, Hiligaynon, other Visayan languages, and Bicolano. A small but significant percentage of the population speaks or comprehends Cuyonon, the native language of the Cuyo Islands and most parts of Palawan.

==Economy==
The main industries of El Nido are fishing, agriculture and tourism, being a popular diving location. Edible nest-gathering is also an economic activity, although it is seasonal. Coconut, palay, cashew, banana, and mango are its major products.

As a tourist destination, El Nido has been included in &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;″s list of &quot;&quot;20 Most Beautiful Beaches in the World&quot;,&quot; and CNNgo has called it the best beach and island destination in the Philippines for its &quot;extraordinary natural splendor and ecosystem.&quot;
==Government==

El Nido is governed by a mayor and a vice mayor, who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the municipality&#x27;s departments to execute the municipal ordinances and improve public services. The vice mayor heads the legislative council consisting of eight councilors, more commonly known as Sangguniang Bayan members. The municipal council is in charge of creating the municipality&#x27;s policies in the form of ordinances and resolutions.

===Seal===
The municipality seal shows a silhouette of the territory of El Nido inside an armor-shaped picture. The famous marble and limestone cliffs represent the nesting ground of the swiftlets. Behind it is the oil rig, representing the areas within its administrative boundaries that are found to be rich in oil and natural gas such as the Malampaya Sound, which is 50 kilometers within its borders, and the Cadlao Oilfield in Bacuit Bay area. At the bottom of the picture is the rice field, with the carabao head superimposed at the center, and on the other side, the sea, with the fish and the squid in situated the middle, representing farming and fishing, the two main industries of its people.

==Protected area status==

===Establishment===
In 1984, the then Ministry of Natural Resources issued Administrative Order No. 518, establishing a maritime area in El Nido as a turtle sanctuary. In 1991, the rest of Bacuit Bay, including its island and islets, was proclaimed by the Philippine government as a marine reserve. A year later, by Administrative Order No. 14 Series of 1992 of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, this area was expanded even further. In 1998, its status was elevated to that of a protected area, including the terrestrial ecosystem of El Nido and portions of Taytay.

===Extent and scope===
The El Nido-Taytay Managed Resource Protected Area is the largest marine sanctuary in the Philippines. Its protected area status accords the areas of El Nido and portions of its neighboring town of Taytay a place among the eight priority sites in the country in need of conservation. The protected area covers a total of 903.21 square kilometers, of which 40% are terrestrial and 60% marine.

The provincial government has mobilized its citizenry to actively participate in various environmental conservation and protection programs, such as the &quot;Bantay Gubat&quot; for forest protection, and the &quot;Bantay Dagat&quot; for marine life preservation. Patrolling within the protected areas, especially in the marine zones is regularly conducted with the help of the World Wildlife Fund - Philippines that allocates funds to support said activity. Another logistic support is by the concerned municipal governments. The Palawan Council for Sustainable Management (PCSD) provides legal assistance during the litigation of cases filed by the Protected Area Office (PAO).

As a protected area, the Philippine government spends approximately US$ 180,000 annually to protect and manage its natural resources. Tourists are encouraged to pay US$ 0.50 per day as a conservation fee for the duration of their visit to the Municipal Tourism Office or the Office of the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB), which are housed in the Municipal Building in Calle Real. This was embodied in the PAMB Resolution No. 08 series 2000 from the National Integrated Protected Area Program (NIPAP) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

El Nido, one of the country&#x27;s most diverse ecosystems, is protected for its unique flora, fauna, and pristine geologic formations. These include:
* limestone cliffs, the home of the swiftlets
* 50 white sand beaches
* 5 types of forest (the lowland evergreen rainforests found in the mainland and islands such as Miniloc, Lagen, and Pangulasian; semi-deciduous forests; forests over limestone; beach forests; the mangrove forests found mostly around major rivers and creeks in the mainland)
* 3 major marine habitats
* 16 endemic and 10 threatened species of birds (including the Palawan hornbill, the Palawan shama, the Palawan tit, Palawan scops owl, and the Palawan peacock pheasant)
* 6 species of marine mammals endemic to Palawan (including dolphins and its native dugong)
* The Palawan tree shrew, the Palawan stink badger, the Palawan spiny rat, the Palawan anteater, and the northern Palawan tree squirrel
* 4 species of endangered marine turtles (hawksbill, olive ridley, leatherback and green sea turtles)
* 100 species of corals, 45 of which belong to the genera of hard corals
* 813 species of fish

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Air====

El Nido Airport, also known as Lio Airport, is the primary and sole airport serving the town of El Nido.

====Roads====
The main roads of El Nido are organized around a set of radial and circumferential roads that radiate and circle in and around the town proper and its rural barangays. Its interconnected roads are connected to the major highway that leads to Puerto Princesa, Palawan&#x27;s capital. Daily buses and jeepneys depart at San Jose Terminal in Puerto Princesa for El Nido. Tricycles are used for short-distance trips around the town proper.

The national road between Taytay and El Nido was rehabilitated, and this has helped boost tourism and business activity in the area.

====Seaports and piers====
The main port in El Nido, which is under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), is located in Buena Suerte (Zone II), although several small and accessible wharves, such as the San Fernando pier, are being used in other rural barangays. Several ferries and other sea vessels owned by Atienza Shipping Lines and San Nicholas Shipping Lines have regular trips from Manila to El Nido.

===Utilities===
The Población area is part of the service areas of electric utility, Palawan Electric Cooperative (PALECO), a division of the National Power Corporation operating with 0.423 megawatts of electricity. Other barangays use solar panels and electric generators. The island resorts generate their own electricity. Water services are accessible in protected water tables and facilities. Ten percent of the population can avail of the &#x27;Level II Water System&#x27;, or communal faucet, by the municipal government, while the majority of them are still dependent on deep wells and natural springs. Internet services are available in a few establishments with wireless broadband access.

==Education==
El Nido has more than ten public elementary and secondary schools located in most of its barangays. El Nido Central School and El Nido National High School, which are both located at the Poblacion, have the largest facilities and number of students, among these schools. Recently, the Palawan State University opened its El Nido campus in New Ibajay, offering extramural programs and studies. Some of the lower-grade schools are located in Calitang, such as Calitang Elementary School, Pasadeña Elementary School, Barutoan Elementary School, Bucana Elementary School, and Lamoro Elementary School.

<doc id="500210" wikidata="Q1018609" url="?curid=500210" title="Boss Johnson">
<text>Byron Ingemar &quot;Boss&quot; Johnson (born Björn Ingimar Jónsson; December 10, 1890 – January 12, 1964), served as the 24th premier of British Columbia, from 1947 to 1952. To his contemporaries he was often referred to by his nickname, &quot;Boss Johnson&quot;, which had nothing to do with his personality, but was an anglicization of the Icelandic &quot;Bjossi&quot;, which is a diminutive form of his birth-name of Bjorn, which was adapted into English as Byron.

==Early years==

Johnson was born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia. After overseas service in World War I, he and his brothers opened a building supplies business in Victoria, which proved to be successful. Johnson was first elected as one of four members of the Legislative Assembly from Victoria City to the BC Legislature as a Liberal in the 1933 election. He served four years in the caucus of Premier Duff Pattullo before being defeated in the 1937 election.

Johnson returned to his business and in World War II was put in charge of constructing Royal Canadian Air Force facilities throughout the province. In a 1945 provincial byelection, he returned to the legislature, this time as the member for New Westminster. Following John Hart&#x27;s resignation in 1947, Johnson succeeded him as Liberal leader and as the leader of the Coalition, and therefore also as Premier - becoming the first Premier of British Columbia born after confederation in the province.

==Johnson as Premier==

Johnson&#x27;s government introduced compulsory health insurance, and a 3% provincial sales tax to pay for it. It expanded the highway system, extended the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, and negotiated the Alcan Agreement, which facilitated construction of the Kenney Dam, the first major hydroelectric project in the province. The government also coped with the devastating 1948 flooding of the Fraser River, declaring a state of emergency and beginning a programme of diking the river&#x27;s banks through the Fraser Valley. Johnson is also noted for appointing Nancy Hodges as the second female Speaker in the British Commonwealth, Mary Ellen Smith being the first. It was also during Johnson&#x27;s tenure that the British Columbia Provincial Police were disbanded and replaced by the R.C.M.P.

The Liberal-Conservative Coalition government, with the Liberals led by Johnson and the Conservatives led by Herbert Anscomb, won a landslide victory in the 1949 election—at 61% the greatest percentage of the popular vote in BC history. Although Maitland&#x27;s caucus was crucial to the government&#x27;s parliamentary mandate, the larger Liberal caucus earned Johnson the Premier&#x27;s job. After the Conservatives withdrew from the coalition in 1952, Johnson&#x27;s government collapsed. In the subsequent 1952 election, the Liberals were defeated by W.A.C. Bennett&#x27;s Social Credit Party, and Johnson lost his own seat to Rae Eddie of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. With the defeat, a new era of a two-party system (CCF/New Democratic Party of Canada versus Social Credit) emerged.

Johnson returned to private life, and died in Victoria in 1964, aged 73 years. He is interred in the city&#x27;s Ross Bay Cemetery.

==Lacrosse goaltender==
Boss Johnson played parts of three seasons of professional lacrosse as a goalkeeper for the Vancouver Lacrosse Club. Prior to his pro career, he played lacrosse for various teams at the scholastic level; he then turned senior with Victoria Capitals in the Pacific Coast Amateur Lacrosse Association before then making the jump to the professional ranks in 1913.

He signed with the Vancouver Lacrosse Club late in the 1913 season as a replacement for future hall-of-famer Cory Hess. He then signed with the Vancouver Athletic Club when they joined as a replacement for the defunct Vancouver Lacrosse Club in 1914 - playing in all 6 of VAC&#x27;s matches. But during the 1915 season, back again with the revived Vancouver Lacrosse Club, he found himself replaced in late June 1915 by Dave Gibbons. Johnson&#x27;s final game for Vancouver, on June 26, 1915, ended on a sour note as he was ejected from the game during the second quarter with 50 minutes accumulated in penalties.

<doc id="500237" wikidata="Q862586" url="?curid=500237" title="September Massacres">
<text>The September Massacres were a series of killings and summary executions of prisoners in Paris that occurred in 1792, from Sunday, 2 September until Thursday, 6 September, during the French Revolution. Between 1,176 and 1,614 people were killed by &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, &quot;fédérés&quot;, and guardsmen, with the support of gendarmes responsible for guarding the tribunals and prisons, the Cordeliers, the Committee of Surveillance of the Commune, and the revolutionary sections of Paris.

With Prussian and royalist armies advancing on Paris, and widespread fear that prisoners in the city would be freed to join them, on 1 September the Legislative Assembly called for volunteers to gather the next day on the Champs de Mars. On 2 September, around 1:00 pm, Minister of Justice Georges Danton delivered a speech in the assembly, stating: &quot;We ask that anyone refusing to give personal service or to furnish arms shall be punished with death. The bell we are about to ring... sounds the charge on the enemies of our country.&quot; The massacres began around 2:30 pm in the middle of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and within the first 20 hours more than 1,000 prisoners were killed.

The next morning, the surveillance committees of the commune published a circular that called on provincial patriots to defend Paris by eliminating counter-revolutionaries, and the secretary, Jean-Lambert Tallien, called on other cities to follow suit. The massacres were repeated in a few other French cities; in total 65–75 incidents were reported. The exact number of victims is not known, as over 440 people had uncertain fates, including from 22 to 200 Swiss soldiers. The identity of the perpetrators, called &quot;&quot;, is poorly documented, but a large number were Parisian national guards and provincial federates who had remained in the city since their arrival in July. Of those killed, 72% were non-political prisoners including forgers of assignats (galley convicts), common criminals, women, and children, while 17% were Catholic priests.

The minister of the interior, Roland, accused the commune of the atrocities. Charlotte Corday held Jean-Paul Marat responsible, while Madame Roland blamed Georges Danton. Danton was also accused by later French historians Adolphe Thiers, Alphonse de Lamartine, Jules Michelet, Louis Blanc and Edgar Quinet of doing nothing to stop them. According to modern historian Georges Lefebvre, the &quot;collective mentality is a sufficient explanation for the killing&quot;. Historian Timothy Tackett deflected specific blame from individuals, stating: &quot;The obsession with a prison conspiracy, the desire for revenge, the fear of the advancing Prussians, the ambiguity over who was in control of a state that had always relied in the past on a centralized monarchy: all had come together in a volatile mixture of anger, fear, and uncertainty.&quot;

==Background==
===The Duke of Brunswick&#x27;s manifesto===
In April 1792 France declared war on the Habsburg monarchy, prompting the War of the First Coalition. In July, an army under the Duke of Brunswick, and composed mostly of Prussians, joined the Austrian side and invaded France. As the army advanced, Paris went into a state of hysteria, especially after the Duke issued the &quot;Brunswick Manifesto&quot; on 25 July. His avowed aim was
to put an end to the anarchy in the interior of France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the altar, to reestablish the legal power, to restore to the king the security and the liberty of which he is now deprived and to place him in a position to exercise once more the legitimate authority which belongs to him.

The manifesto threatened the French population with instant punishment should it resist the imperial and Prussian armies or the reinstatement of the monarchy. The manifesto was frequently described as unlawful and offensive to national sovereignty. Its authorship was frequently in doubt.

Revolutionaries like Marat and Hébert preferred to concentrate on the internal enemy. On 3 August Pétion and 47 sections demanded the deposition of the king.

===The insurrection of the Paris Commune===

On the evening of 9 August 1792, a Jacobin insurrection overthrew the leadership of the Paris municipality, proclaiming a new revolutionary commune headed by transitional authorities. The next day the insurrectionists stormed the Tuileries Palace. King Louis XVI was imprisoned with the royal family, and his authority as king was suspended by the Legislative Assembly. The following day the royalist press was silenced.

A provisional executive (&quot;conseil exécutif&quot;) was named and busied itself with reorganizing or solving questions concerning the police, justice, the army, navy, and paper money, but actual power now rested with the new revolutionary commune, whose strength resided in the mobilized and armed &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, the lower classes of Paris, and &quot;fédérés&quot;, armed volunteers from the provinces that had arrived at the end of July. The 48 sections of Paris were equipped with munitions from the plundered arsenals in the days before the assault.

Supported by a new armed force, the commune dominated the Legislative Assembly and its decisions. The commune pushed through several measures: universal suffrage was adopted, the civilian population was armed, all remnants of noble privileges were abolished and the properties of the &quot;émigrés&quot; were sold. These events meant a change of direction from the political and constitutional perspective of the Girondists to a more social approach given by the commune as expressed by Pierre-Joseph Cambon: &quot;To reject with more efficacy the defenders of despotism, we have to address the fortunes of the poor, we have to associate the Revolution with this multitude that possesses nothing, we have to convert the people to the cause.&quot;

Besides these measures, the commune engaged in a policy of political repression of all suspected counter-revolutionary activities. Beginning on 11 August, every Paris section named surveillance committees (committees of vigilance) for conducting searches and making arrests. It was mostly these decentralized committees, rather than the commune as a whole, which engaged in the repression of August and September 1792. Within a few days each section elected three commissioners to take seats in the insurrectionary commune; one of them was Maximilien Robespierre.

To ensure that there was some appropriate legal process for dealing with suspects accused of political crimes and treason, rather than arbitrary killing by local committees, a revolutionary tribunal, with extraordinary powers to impose the death sentence without any appeal, was installed on 17 August. Robespierre, who had proposed this measure, refused to preside over the tribunal, arguing that the same man ought not to be a denouncer, an accuser, and a judge.

Already, on 15 August, four sections called for all priests and imprisoned suspects to be put to death before the volunteers departed. Robespierre proposed to erect a pyramid on Place Vendôme to remember the victims of 10 August. On 19 August the nonjuring priests were ordered to leave the country within two weeks, which meant before 2 September 1792. In Paris, all monasteries were closed and would soon be in use as hospitals, etc. The remaining religious orders were banned by the law of 15 August. Marat left nothing in doubt when he urged &quot;good citizens to go to the Abbaye, to seize priests, and especially the officers of the Swiss Guards and their accomplices and run a sword through them&quot;. From 15 to 25 August, around 500 detentions were registered; some were sent to Orléans. Half the detentions were of nonjuring priests, but even priests who had sworn the required oath were caught in the wave.

===Prussian advance and Paris reaction===
Around 26 August, news reached Paris that the Prussian army had crossed the French border and occupied Longwy without a battle. Roland proposed that the government should leave Paris, whereas Robespierre suggested in a letter to the sections of the commune that they should defend liberty and equality and maintain their posts, and die if necessary. The assembly decreed that all the non-juring priests had to leave Paris within eight days and the country within two weeks. In the evening, in the presence of 350,000 people, a funeral ceremony was held in the gardens of the Tuileries for those killed while storming the Tuileries.

On 28 August, the assembly ordered a curfew for around two days.
 The city gates were closed; all communication with the country was stopped. At the behest of Justice Minister Danton, thirty commissioners from the sections were ordered to search in every (suspect) house for weapons, munition, swords, carriages and horses. &quot;They searched every drawer and every cupboard, sounded every panel, lifted every hearthstone, inquired into every correspondence in the capital. As a result of this inquisition, more than 1,000 &quot;suspects&quot; were added to the immense body of political prisoners already confined in the jails and convents of the city.&quot;

On 29 August, the Prussians attacked Verdun. When this news arrived it escalated panic in the capital; the situation was highly critical.

Throughout August, the Legislative Assembly, which had been greatly diminished as more than half of the deputies had fled since the storming of the Tuileries, had acquiesced to the activities of the commune and its sections. On 30 August, the Girondins Roland and Marguerite-Élie Guadet tried to suppress the influence of the commune, which they accused of exercising unlawful power. The assembly, tired of the pressures, declared the commune illegal and suggested the organization of communal elections and a doubling of the number of seats. However, the assembly canceled the decree the next day at the request of Jacques-Alexis Thuriot. The balance of power was disrupted and the conflict between the Girondins and the Montagnards would influence the progress of the French Revolution.

On 1 September the prisons were full. The citizens of Paris were told to prepare themselves for the defense of the country and gather immediately upon the sound of the tocsin. Their imminent departure from the capital provoked further concern about the crowded prisons, now full of counter-revolutionary suspects who might threaten a city deprived of so many of its defenders.

Marat called for a &quot;new blood-letting&quot;, larger than the one on 10 August. Marat and his Committee of Surveillance of the Commune organized the massacres, first voting to round up 4,000 mostly ordinary people, &quot;suspects&quot; of the committee, agreed to kill them in &quot;whole groups,&quot; voting down a Marat proposal to murder them by setting them on fire, then finally agreeing to a proposal by Billaud-Varennes to &quot;butcher them&quot;. The bulk of the butchers were made up of &quot;Marseilles,&quot; &quot;hired assassins&quot; from the prisons of Genoa and Sicily, paid twenty-four dollars, whose names were listed by &quot;M. Granier de Cassagnac.&quot; The rest were murderers and others previously imprisoned for violent crimes released ahead of time from the prisons they would soon be returning to for the massacres.

Earl Gower, the British ambassador reported:
On 1 September, the gates of the city closed the days before, were opened on the orders of Pétion, providing an opportunity for suspects to flee the capital. According to Louis-Marie Prudhomme people still profited from the opportunity on Sunday morning 2 September. (Verdun capitulated on 2 September gaining a clear westward path to Paris.) The Assembly decreed arming the volunteers; a third would stay in Paris and defend the city with pikes, the others were meant for the frontier and the trenches. It further decreed that traitors who refused to participate in the defense or hand over their arms deserved death. The sections, gathered in the town hall, decided to remain in Paris; Marat proposed to have Roland and his fellow Girondist Brissot arrested. The commune ordered the gates closed and an alarm gun fired. After the tocsin was rung around 2:00 pm, 50 or 60,000 men enrolled for the defense of the country on the Champs de Mars. 

On 2 September, around 13:00, Georges Danton, a member of the provisional government, delivered a speech in the assembly: &quot;We ask that anyone refusing to give personal service or to furnish arms shall be punished with death.&quot; &quot;The bell we are about to ring is not an alarm signal; it sounds the charge on the enemies of our country.&quot; After the applause, he continued, &quot;To conquer them we must dare, dare again, always dare, and France is saved.&quot; His speech acted as a call for direct action among the citizens, as well as a strike against the external enemy. Madame Roland and Hillary Mantel weren&#x27;t the only ones who thought his speech was responsible for inciting the September Massacres, also Louis Mortimer−Ternaux.

==Madame de Staël==
Around 4 in the afternoon Madame de Staël, as ambassadress of Sweden, who lived in Rue du Bac near Champ de Mars, tried to flee through crowded streets but her carriage was stopped and the crowd forced her to go to the Paris town hall, where Robespierre presided. (However, according to Maximilien&#x27;s sister Charlotte, he never presided over the insurrectionary commune. According to Louvet de Couvrai he &quot;governed&quot; the Paris &quot;Conseil Général&quot; of the département.) Late in the evening, she was conveyed home, escorted by the procurator Louis Pierre Manuel. The next day the secretary-general to the Commune of Paris, Tallien, arrived with a passport and accompanied her to the barrier.

==Massacres==

The first massacre began in the quartier Latin around 2:30 pm on Sunday when 24 non-juring priests were being transported to the prison de l&#x27;Abbaye near the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, after being interrogated by Billaud-Varenne in the town hall. One of the carriages, escorted by Fédérés, was attacked after an incident. The &quot;fédérés&quot; killed three men in the middle of the street, before the procession arrived at the prison. Eighteen of the arrested were taken inside. They then mutilated the bodies, &quot;with circumstances of barbarity too shocking to describe&quot; according to the British diplomatic dispatch. One of their victims was the former minister of foreign affairs Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin. Roch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard was recognized as a beneficent priest and released.

===Carmes prison===

In the late afternoon 115 priests in the former convent of Carmelites, detained with the message they would be deported to French Guiana, were massacred in the courtyard with axes, spikes, swords and pistols by people with a strong patois accent. They forced the priests one by one to take the oath on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and &quot;swear to be faithful to the nation and to maintain liberty and equality or die defending it&quot;.

Some priests hid in the choir and behind the altar. Several tried to get away by climbing in the trees and over the walls and making their escape through the Rue Cassette. Among the dead where Solomon Leclercq and Jacques Jules Bonnaud. 

At around 5:00 pm, a group of 200 &quot;Septembriseurs&quot; came to the house of Roland on Place Dauphine to arrest him, but, as he was at the ministry, they went there.

===Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye===


Between 7:00 and 8:00 pm, the group of &quot;fédérés&quot;, etc. was back at the Abbaye prison. The Abbaye prison was located in what is now the Boulevard Saint-Germain just west of the current Passage de la Petite Boucherie. The door was closed, but the killing was resumed after an intense discussion with Manuel, the procurator, on people&#x27;s justice and failing judges. Manuel and Jean Dussaulx belonged to a deputation sent by the &quot;Conseil Général&quot; of the commune to ask for compassion. They were insulted and escaped with their lives.

A tribunal composed of twelve people presided over by Stanislas-Marie Maillard, started the interrogation by asking the prisoner why he or she was arrested. A lie was fatal, and the prisoners were summarily judged and either freed or executed. Each prisoner was asked a handful of questions, after which the prisoner was either freed with the words &quot;Vive la nation&quot; and permitted to leave, or sentenced to death with the words &quot;Conduct him to the Abbaye&quot; or &quot;Let him go&quot;, after which the condemned was taken to a yard and was immediately killed by a waiting mob consisting of men, women, and children.

The massacres were opposed by the staff of the prison, who allowed many prisoners to escape, one example being Pauline de Tourzel. The Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye contained a number of prisoners formerly belonging to the royal household, as well as survivors of the Swiss Guards from the royal palace. Among them were the royal governesses Marie Angélique de Mackau and Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ de Tourzel; the ladies-in-waiting the Princess de Tarente and the Princess de Lamballe; the queen&#x27;s ladies-maids Marie-Élisabeth Thibault and Mme Bazile; the dauphin&#x27;s nurse St Brice; the Princesse de Lamballe&#x27;s lady&#x27;s maid Navarre; and the valets of the king, Chamilly and Hue. All ten former members of the royal household were placed before the tribunals and freed from charges, with the exception of the Princess de Lamballe, whose death would become one of the most publicized of the September Massacres. Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ de Tourzel was released on order of Manuel by the Commune.

Of the Swiss Guard prisoners 135 were killed, 27 were transferred, 86 were set free, and 22 had uncertain fates. According to George Long 122 died and 43 people were released. The victims had to leave behind money, jewelry, silver, gold, assignats, but also an Aeneid which is widely regarded as Virgil&#x27;s masterpiece. Most of the victims&#x27; clothes were pierced with spade marks and had bloodstains. According to Louvet four armed men came to the house of Roland to get paid. On Monday morning nine o&#x27;clock, Billaud-Varenne came to the Abbaye prison and declared that the tribunal should stop stealing and would get paid by the Commune. At ten Maillard and his twelve judges resumed their work. In three days 216 men, and only three women were massacred in the Abbey. De Virot, responsible for the safeguarding of large stocks of weapons stored in the Hotel des Invalides, and his daughter survived.

===Conciergerie, Saint Firmin and Bernardins===


Late in the afternoon, they went to Tour Saint-Bernard (belonging to a confiscated monastery Collège des Bernardins, located in the Sansculotte district) where forgers of assignats were jailed. (Almost all of them were locked up in the previous three months.) The pattern of semi-formal executions followed by the popular tribunals was for condemned prisoners to be ordered &quot;transferred&quot; and then taken into the prison courtyard where they would be cut down. One man was released after he was recognized as a thief. The participants in the killing received bread, wine and cheese, and some money. 

In the early evening, groups broke into another Paris prison, the Conciergerie, via an open door in a side stair. The massacre was more uncontrolled in the Conciergerie than in the Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye. In the Conciergerie, the staff did not cooperate by turning the prisoners to the mob; instead, the mob broke into the cells themselves. The massacre continued from late evening through the night until morning. Of 488 prisoners in the Conciergerie, 378 were killed during the massacre. One woman in the Conciergerie, Marie Gredeler, a bookseller who was accused of murder, was tied to a pole, killed, and mutilated.

According to Prudhomme people sat on the stairs of the Palace of Justice watching the butchery in the courtyard. Not far away Restif de la Bretonne saw bodies piled high on Pont au Change in front of the Châtelet, then thrown in the river. He recorded the atrocities he witnessed in &quot;Les Nuits de Paris&quot; (1794).

Before midnight the seminary Saint Firmin was visited by just four men, who killed all the seminarians. All of them were detained in August according to Cassagnac; the average age of the prisoners was 47. At 2.30 am, the Assembly was informed that most of the prisons were empty. The next morning the Assembly was still involved with the defense of the city; Hérault de Séchelles presided. It decided the other prisoners had to wait for their trial because of a temporary lack of judges.

===Bicêtre and Salpêtrière===
Bicêtre, a hospital for men and boys that also served as a prison for beggars and the homeless, was visited twice that day after a rumor that there were thousands of rifles stored there. The commander brought seven cannons. According to Cassagnac François Hanriot and his battalion were present; 56 prisoners were released. The average age of the 170 victims was 24–25 years, 41 were between 12 and 18 years old, and 58 were under 20. Mayor Pétion did not have much influence discussing humanity with them.

At dawn Salpêtrière, a hospice for women and girls to which a prison was attached, was visited. The number of victims is exactly known: 35 women, including 23 underaged. The average age of the 35 victims was 45 – only one of them, Marie Bertrand, a diocesan from Dyon, was 17 years old – and 52 were released according to Cassagnac.

===The end===
On Tuesday afternoon the killing in the Abbey finally stopped. Police commissioners Etienne-Jean Panis and Sergent-Marceau gave orders to wash away all the blood from the stairs and the courtyard, to spread straw, to count the corpses, and to dispose of them on carts to avoid infections. A contract was signed with the gravedigger of the nearby Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris, who also had to purchase quicklime. On 5 September, the day of the election, it was perfectly quiet in Paris according to Le Moniteur Universel. There were still 80 prisoners in &quot;La Force&quot;.

On 6 September the massacres finally ended. The next day the gates were opened, but it was impossible to travel to another department without a passport.

===Contemporary reports===
In a letter from 25 January 1793 Helen Maria Williams accused Robespierre and Danton, saying that Marat was only their instrument. Francois Buzot, a Girondin, mentions Camille Desmoulins and Fabre d&#x27;Eglantine.

According to Galart de Montjoie, a lawyer and royalist, in those days everyone believed the Fédérés from Marseille, Avignon and Brest were involved in the killing. About 800–1000 were staying in barrack, but moved supposedly to where events would take place. It seems around 300 Fédérés from Brest and 500 from Marseille were then lodged in Cordeliers Convent. Servan planned to give them military training before using them to supplement the army at the front.



===Numbers===
According to Pierre Caron there were almost 2,800 prisoners in early September. Between 1,250 and 1,450 prisoners were condemned and executed. According to Caron and Bluche 70% of the victims were killed in a 20-hour interval. Among the victims were 223 nonjuring Catholic priests and (arch)bishops who refused to submit to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, 81 Swiss guards, and 40–80 political suspects, mostly royalists, aristocrats, and some former judges and ministers including the queen&#x27;s best friend, the &quot;Princesse de Lamballe&quot;, the only political victim in &quot;La petite Force&quot;.

The lives of about 1,250–1,600 prisoners brought before the people&#x27;s courts were saved. In a few cases people were acclaimed as &quot;patriots&quot; by Robespierre, Tallien, Desmoulins, and Danton. Several prisoners for debts or alimony were released by Louis Pierre Manuel or by the police before 2 September.

A total of nine prisons were violently entered during the five days of the massacres before the killings concluded on the night of 6–7 September; four were not visited (Sainte-Pélagie Prison, Prison Saint-Lazare, Tour du Temple and palais Bourbon). About 700 surviving Swiss soldiers, locked up in Palais Bourbon, marched to the town hall to take the oath and joined the volunteers. After initially indiscriminate slayings, ad hoc popular tribunals were set up to distinguish between &quot;enemies of the people&quot; and those who were innocent, or at least were not perceived as counter-revolutionary threats. In spite of this attempted sifting, estimated three-quarters of the 1,250–1,450 killed were not counter-revolutionaries or &quot;villains&quot;, but included all the galley convicts, forgers of assignats, 37 women (including the Princess de Lamballe and Marie Gredeler) and 66 children. Some priests and women were of age, about prostitutes or insane not much is known.

==Killings outside Paris==
On 3 September the surveillance committees of the Commune, on which Marat now served, published a circular that called on provincial Patriots to defend Paris and asked that, before leaving their homes, they eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Marat advised the entire nation &quot;to adopt this necessary measure&quot;.

A circular letter was sent to regional authorities by Deforgues, an assistant of Danton, and Tallien, the secretary of the Paris Commune, advising that &quot;ferocious conspirators detained in the prisons had been put to death by the people&quot;.

The Girondins afterward made much of this circular, but there is no evidence that it had any influence. As before, murders in the provinces continued: the blood-letting did not cease until the countryside was purged. Smaller-scale executions took place in Reims, Meaux, and Lyon on 2, 4 and 9 September. Most notable was the killing of 44 political prisoners near Château de Versailles transported from the High Court in Orléans back to Paris, the 9 September massacres. The next day Brissot wrote in &quot;Le Patriote français&quot;, his newspaper: &quot;No doubt you will be told that it is a vengeance of the people; it will be a slander. The people were not involved in this event.&quot;

==Official role==
According to Timothy Tackett: &quot;For a period of some 48 hours between the 29th and 31 August, the whole of Paris was systematically searched by the national guard for lurking conspirators and hidden arms. By that time section assemblies were already passing motions demanding &quot;the death of conspirators before the departure of citizens&quot;.

On 31 August the Committee of Vigilance was created with Panis and Sergent-Marceau. According to Madame de Staël on 31 August &quot;it was already known, that only those who were destined to be massacred were sent to that prison [of the Abbey].&quot;

On 1 September the Commune declared a state of emergency by decreeing that on the following day the tocsin should be rung, all able-bodied citizens convened in the Champ de Mars.

On Sunday 2 September the 1792 French National Convention election started. Robespierre publicly accused Brissot and the Brissotins of plotting with the Duke of Brunswick. Marat was appointed as one of the six additional members of the Committee of Vigilance, but without the approval of the Executive Council.

According to Adolphe Thiers on Sunday morning 2 September: &quot;The keeper of the Abbaye sent away his children in the morning. Dinner was served to the prisoners two hours before the accustomed time, and the knives were taken from their plates.&quot;

Such municipal and central government as existed in Paris in September 1792 was preoccupied with organizing volunteers, supplies, and equipment for the armies on the threatened frontiers. Accordingly, there was no attempt to assuage popular fears that the understaffed and easily accessed prisons were full of royalists who would break out and seize the city when the national guards and other citizen volunteers had left for the war. According to Madame Roland Danton responded to an appeal to protect the prisoners with the comment: &quot;To hell with the prisoners! They must look after themselves.&quot; On 3 September Roland said: &quot;Yesterday was a day that we should perhaps throw a veil on.&quot; The other members of the provisional government – Clavière, Lebrun-Tondu, Monge and Servan, involved in organizing the country did not do much to stop the killing, or could not foresee or prevent these excesses. Mayor Pétion de Villeneuve turned a blind eye when he visited Bicêtre. Olympe de Gouges and Brissot&#x27;s newspaper were the only ones condemning the September murders.

==Debate in the Convention==
The Brissotins in the Convention first attacked Danton; he was asked to resign as minister on the 25th but forced to step down on 9 October. He kept his seat in the Convention as deputy. Then the Brissotins decided to attack Robespierre and Marat.

On 29 October 1792, the Convention reviewed these recent events. Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray accused Robespierre of creating a personality cult, governing the Paris &quot;Conseil General&quot; and paying the &quot;Septembriseurs&quot;. Marat was accused of being asocial and establishing a dictatorship. He was taken by surprise and had to be defended by Danton. Robespierre was given eight days to reply. On 5 November Robespierre stated that Marat had visited him only once since January. He insisted that most of the victims were aristocrats, which wasn&#x27;t the case. He admitted the arrests at the end of August were illegal, as illegal as the revolution, the fall of the monarchy and the Bastille. He asked the convention: &quot;Citizens, did you want a revolution without revolution?&quot; Robespierre, Danton, and Marat insisted that the &quot;new bloodletting&quot; had been a spontaneous popular movement. Their opponents, the Girondins, spoke of a systematically planned conspiracy. Louvet de Couvrai who published his speech was no longer admitted to the Jacobin Club.

==Political repercussions==
The massacres first damaged the political position of the Girondins, who seemed too moderate, and later the Jacobins, who seemed too bloodthirsty. A new mayor, Nicolas Chambon, was installed on 1 December 1792. On 4 February 1793 Robespierre defended the September massacres as necessary. On 13 February Pierre Gaspard Chaumette received a list of victims in the La Force Prison.

It was Servan&#x27;s proposal to bring armed volunteers from the provinces. He was arrested during the Terror, but released in February 1795. In 1796 24 or 39 craftsmen and small businessmen were accused; although only three were condemned. The vinegar maker Damiens was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment.

==Martyrs==

One hundred and fifteen churchmen killed in the Carmes Prison were beatified by Pope Pius XI on 17 October 1926. Among the martyrs were Pierre-Louis de la Rochefoucauld, bishop of Saintes; Jean-Marie du Lau d&#x27;Alleman, archbishop of Arles; François-Joseph de la Rochefoucauld, bishop of Beauvais; and Ambroise Chevreux, the last superior-general of the monastic Congregation of Saint Maur.

<text>Albemarle Sound () is a large estuary on the coast of North Carolina in the United States located at the confluence of a group of rivers, including the Chowan and Roanoke. It is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Currituck Banks, a barrier peninsula upon which the town of Kitty Hawk is located, at the eastern edge of the sound, and part of the greater Outer Banks region. Roanoke Island is situated at the southeastern corner of the sound, where it connects to Pamlico Sound. Much of the water in the Albemarle Sound is brackish or fresh, as opposed to the saltwater of the ocean, as a result of river water pouring into the sound.

Some small portions of the Albemarle have been given their own &quot;sound&quot; names to distinguish these bodies of water from other parts of the large estuary. The Croatan Sound, for instance, lies between mainland Dare County and Roanoke Island. The water bordering the eastern shore of the island to the Outer Banks is commonly referred to as Roanoke Sound (this is also a historical name for the entire body of water now known as Albemarle Sound). The long stretch of water from near the Virginia state line south to around the Currituck County southern boundary is known as the Currituck Sound.

Albemarle Sound forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. Early English colonists, mostly migrants from Virginia, settled along it in the first permanent European settlements in what became North Carolina; these were known as the English Albemarle Settlements. Many inland Tidewater communities along the Albemarle today are classified as part of the Inner Banks region of the state.

==History==
The indigenous Pamlico and their ancestors lived in the region for thousands of years. They traveled the sound in dugout canoes, and trapped fish. The Pamlico often set up seasonal fishing camps for this purpose, retreating inland in winter weather.

In 1586 the first European explorers sailed up the length of the Albemarle Sound. Half a century later, the first European settlers came south from Virginia, establishing agricultural and trading colonies along the shores of the Sound. The Albemarle Sound soon became an important thoroughfare: small trading ships called coasters carried cargo to and from other colonies, and larger merchant ships brought spices, silks, and sugars from the West Indies in exchange for products such as tobacco (a major export of the southern colonies), herring, and lumber.

In 1663, King Charles II of England designated Albemarle Sound as part of the Province of Carolina; it was assigned to eight Lords Proprietors. One of these royal beneficiaries was George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, for whom the sound is named.

Ferries were a common method of transportation through the swamps surrounding the Albemarle Sound throughout the history of the region. One ferry that linked the towns of Edenton and Mackeys, North Carolina, continued in service from 1734 to 1938, when a bridge was built across the Sound. Another, longer bridge of more than in length was built in 1990.

Fishing was a major industry in the Albemarle Sound from the colonial period. In late spring, when the fish runs started, planters set enslaved workers to fish for shad, striped bass, and herring. Fishermen sometimes had enormous nets, with some more than a mile (1600 m) long, and they were frequently staffed 24 hours a day. Herring was cut and salted for export to Europe, while shad was packed in ice and shipped up the Chowan River to be sold in northern colonies.

In more recent times of the twentieth century, regional striped bass tournaments attracted sports fishermen to the area. This was considered by many to be the greatest striped bass fishery in the world. But water pollution from industry, agriculture and other development in recent years has depleted the fisheries of the Albemarle Sound by seventy percent.

<text>A certified first responder is a person who has completed a course and received certification in providing pre-hospital care for medical emergencies. Certified individuals should have received much more instruction than someone who is trained in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but they are not necessarily a substitute for more advanced emergency medical care rendered by emergency medical technicians and paramedics. First responders typically provide advanced first aid level care, CPR, and automated external defibrillator (AED) usage. The term &quot;certified first responder&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;first responder&quot;, which is a term referring to the first medically trained responder to arrive on scene (EMS, police, fire) and medically trained telecommunication operators who provide pre-arrival medical instructions as trained Emergency Medical Dispatchers (EMD). Many police officers and firefighters are required to receive training as certified first responders. Advanced medical care is typically provided by EMS, although some police officers and firefighters also train to become emergency medical technicians or paramedics.

==Terminology==
Also called an Emergency Medical Responder, Emergency First Responder, Medical First Responder, or First Responder.

==Canada ==
Many options are available in order to become a certified First Responder in Canada. Courses are offered by many sources including the Canadian Red Cross, and St. John Ambulance, and the Department of National Defence. Certified First Responder courses in Canada are separated into either &quot;First Responder&quot; or &quot;Emergency Medical Responder&quot; level courses. &quot;First Responder&quot; level courses are between 40 and 60 hours in length and is considered the minimum level of training for crews providing medical standby at events, as well as for employment with some private stable transport companies that provide inter-hospital transfer for patients in need of a bed, but are stable and do not require advanced medical care. &quot;Emergency Medical Responder&quot; level courses meet the Paramedic Association of Canada&#x27;s National Occupational Competency Profile, and those who receive certification at this level can work for Emergency Medical Services in some provinces.

===Examples===
The Canadian Ski Patrol, St. John Ambulance Patient Care Divisions, Fire Departments, Campus Emergency Response Teams, few private medical services, and the Canadian Coast Guard all provide First Responder level emergency medical care, in some cases as a support to existing services, and in others as the primary emergency response organization.

=== Limitations on Certified First Responders ===

While all Certified First Responders in Canada are covered under Good Samaritan laws in jurisdictions where they are enacted, in some cases they have a Duty To Act for example, Ontario. Certified First Responders who are providing medical coverage to events (such as Red Cross, St. John Ambulance&#x27;s Patient Care Divisions and private event medical companies), as well as those who are employed by Volunteer Fire Departments, Campus Response Teams, and others who are required to perform Emergency Medical Response as part of their duties all have a Duty to Act. While Certified First Responders in general are not required to render aid to injured/ill persons, those who work in the aforementioned areas can be accused of and prosecuted for negligence if they fail to respond when notified of a medical emergency, if their care does not meet the standard to which they were trained, or their care exceeds their scope of practice and causes harm to the patient. As with all medically trained and certified persons, Certified First Responders are immune to successful prosecution if assistance was given in good faith up to, and not beyond, the limits of certification and training.

== France ==

In France, pre-hospital care is performed either by first responders from the fire department (&quot;sapeurs-pompiers&quot;, in most emergency situations) or from a private ambulance company (relative emergency at home), or by a medical team that includes a physician, a nurse and an emergency medical technician (called &quot;SMUR&quot;). The intermediate scale, the firefighter nurse (&quot;infirmier sapeur-pompier&quot;, ISP), is only a recent evolution and is performed by nurses who have been specially trained acting with emergency protocols; these nurses are the French equivalent of paramedics. The arrival of first responders is thus the most common result of an emergency call. In addition, in France there exists a network of first responder associations, as French Red Cross (Croix-rouge française), French Civil Protection (&quot;Protection civile&quot;), FFSS (&quot;Fédération Française de Sauvetage et de Secourisme&quot;) or others. These CFR volunteers are allowed to supervise massive outside meetings, student gatherings, &quot;et cetera&quot;. These volunteers have followed the same special rescuer training as firefighters (PSE 1 and PSE 2, in all 70 hours of training).

== Thailand ==

In the Kingdom of Thailand (Thailand) First Responder is a certification most commonly achieved by local volunteers. This certification is referred to as Emergency Medical Responder or EMR. EMRs can provide emergency care for vehicle collisions, trauma, CPR, birthing, and other emergencies. EMRs must maintain their certification through a foundation, club, association, or government agency. The next level of certification in emergency response is Emergency Medical Technician Basic (EMT-B).

Training for EMR level must be done through an approved training. Most provincial hospitals provide training or are directly connected with teaching the training. EMR is a 50-hour course. The National Institute for Emergency Medicine of Thailand acts as the approving body for Emergency Medical Responder certification and provides the training curriculum. Guidelines for EMRs are published in the Emergency Medical Operation Manual for First Responder Units. Certification only lasts for two 2 years and requires refresher training to maintain.

Rescue clubs and ambulance foundations most often serve communities with volunteers to respond to emergencies with ambulances and other rescue resources. Most foundations and clubs request volunteers to acquire at least the Emergency Medical Responder level of training. Most EMR level units use pickup trucks with elevated caps to respond to emergencies. These vehicles usually are marked with the association name and seal along with lighting and sirens. Units at this level act as the first arriving responders, and must do much to stabilize the scene for other units, such as Advanced Life Support (ALS), to arrive. EMR units often transport patients to medical treatment facilities especially for basic level patients and when ALS units are unavailable. EMRs coordinate with firefighters, police, and other medical professionals in emergency situations.

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, most statutory NHS ambulance services deploy paid first responders who drive dedicated rapid response vehicles. These are typically estate cars, MPVs or 4x4s, are liveried with high-visibility ambulance markings, and fitted with blue flashing lights and sirens. These vehicles are generally single-crewed, by a paramedic. This differs from most ambulances in the UK, which usually have two crew members.

===Community First Responder Schemes===


A Community First Responder Scheme is made up of groups of volunteers who, within the community in which they live or work, have been trained to attend emergency calls received by the NHS (National Health Service) Ambulance Service, providing potentially life-saving treatment and first aid until an emergency ambulance arrives.

The Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust, when looking at the locations for Responder Groups, take the following into consideration:

* Towns or villages where it is challenging for an emergency ambulance to arrive at scene within 8 minutes – this is usually in the more rural areas of the county.
* The total number of calls received within these locations must be significant enough for training to take place, ensuring motivation of the group members and that their contribution would have a valued, significant effect on patients.
* Community first responders are members of the community who are trained to use an automated external defibrillator, give oxygen, and use other pieces of lifesaving equipment to assist ambulance crews, and maintain patient stability whilst professional crews are in attendance. Responders have no special dispensation to break the rules of the road whilst attending calls. Under the Road Traffic Act and various other UK traffic law, correct and permitted use of Blue Lights on a vehicle does not allow the driver to cross solid white lines to overtake, but does allow the driver to treat a red light as a &#x27;Give Way&#x27; sign. Out of all the Ambulance trusts in the UK, a handful have CFR schemes with dedicated cars, and these are not given blue lights as CFR&#x27;s do not undergo blue light training.

== United States ==

&quot;See Emergency Medical Responder&quot;

=== History ===
The U.S. Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) recognized a gap between the typical eight hours training required for providing advanced first aid (as taught by the Red Cross) and the 180 hours typical of an EMT-Basic program. Also, some rural communities could not afford the comprehensive training and highly experienced instructors required for a full EMT-Basic course. The First Responder training program began in 1979 as an outgrowth of the &quot;Crash Injury Management&quot; course.

In 1995 the D.O.T. issued a manual for an intermediate level of training called &quot;First Responder.&quot; This training can be completed in twenty-four to sixty hours. Importantly, this training can be conducted by an EMT-Basic with some field experience—which is a resource available &quot;in-house&quot; for many volunteer fire departments who do not have the resources for full EMT training. The first responder training is intended to fill the gap between First Aid and Emergency Medical Technician.

The American Red Cross conducts a course titled &quot;Emergency Medical Response&quot; that fits this definition.

In the US the term &quot;Emergency Medical Responder&quot; has largely replaced the term &quot;Certified First Responder&quot; or &quot;Medical First Responder&quot; beginning in 2012. &quot;Emergency Medical Responder&quot; or &quot;EMR&quot; is an EMS certification level recognized by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians.

By 2015, most states recognize the level of Emergency Medical Responder.

=== Scope of practice ===

First Responders in the US can either provide initial emergency care first on the scene (police/fire department/search and rescue) or support Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics. The skills allowed at this level are very similar to an EMT&#x27;s including bleeding control, positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask, oral airway, nasal airway, supplemental oxygen administration, suctioning, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), manual stabilization of fractures, and assisting in the administration of basic medications such as epinephrine auto-injectors, oral glucose, and inhalers. They are also trained in packaging, moving and transporting patients.

=== Skills and limitations ===

First Responders can serve as secondary providers with some volunteer EMS services. An Emergency Medical Responder can be seen either as an advanced first aid provider, or as a limited provider of emergency medical care when more advanced providers have not yet arrived or are not available.

Skillwise, a certified first responder in the US is often trained and allowed to do most of what an emergency medical technician is allowed to. Some exceptions in some jurisdictions include insertion of King airways or combi-tubes, traction splinting, and administration of nebulized albuterol.

===Rescue===

The National Fire Protection Association standards 1006 and 1670 state that all &quot;rescuers&quot; must have medical training to perform any technical rescue operation, including cutting the vehicle itself during an extrication. Therefore, in most all rescue environments, whether it is an EMS or Fire Department that runs the rescue, the actual rescuers who cut the vehicle and run the extrication scene or perform any rescue such as rope rescues or swift water rescue, etc., are Emergency Medical Responders, Emergency Medical Technicians, or Paramedics, as most every rescue has a patient involved.

=== Traditional first responders ===

The first responder training is considered a bare minimum for emergency service workers who may be sent out in response to an emergency call. It is almost always required for professional and volunteer firefighters. For example, all firefighters of the New York City Fire Department require a valid CFR-D (Certified First Responder - Defibrillation) certification. The first responder level of emergency medical training is also often required for police officers, rescue squad personnel, and search and rescue personnel. Many first responders have location specific training such as water rescue or mountain rescue and must take advanced courses to be certified (i.e. lifeguard).

=== Non-traditional first responders ===
Many people who do not fall into the earlier mentioned categories seek out or receive this type of training because they are likely to be first on the scene of a medical emergency, or because they work far from medical help.

Some of these non-traditional first responders include:
* SCUBA Divers
* Park rangers
* Utility workers
* Teachers, childcare workers, and school bus drivers
* Designated industrial workers in a large facility (industrial plant) or at a remote site (fish-packing plant, commercial vessel, oil rig)
* Security Officers
* Emergency management personnel
* Search and rescue personnel
* Campus Responders and campus police
* Lifeguards
* Ski Patrollers
* Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) members (varies by jurisdiction)
* Stage Managers

<doc id="500273" wikidata="Q19693316" url="?curid=500273" title="First responder">
<text>A first responder is a person with specialized training who is among the first to arrive and provide assistance or incident resolution at the scene of an emergency. First responders typically include law enforcement officers (commonly known as police officers), emergency medical services members (such as EMTs or paramedics), fire service members (such as firefighters, search and rescue members, technical/heavy rescue members, etc) and Public Works employees such as Heavy Equipment Operators as well as Public Works Tree Department personnel. In some jurisdictions, emergency department personnel, such as doctors and nurses, are also required to respond to disasters and critical situations, designating them first responders; in other jurisdictions, military and security forces may also be authorized to act as first responders.

In a medical context, certified first responder is an individual who has received certification to provide pre-hospital care in a certain jurisdiction. A community first responder is a person dispatched to attend medical emergencies until an ambulance arrives. A wilderness first responder is trained to provide pre-hospital care in remote settings who has skills relevant to ad hoc patient care and transport by non-motorized means. Public Works departments are also recognized as First Responders as they are generally called to clean up natural disasters, plow snow and maintain roads as well as provide rescue support in extreme weather scenarios.

==Etymology==

The use of the term &quot;first responder&quot; in the current sense first emerged in the United States in the 1970s. Perhaps the earliest uses in print occurred in two articles in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in August 1973, about proposed ambulance regulations in Massachusetts. 
There were some earlier uses of &quot;first response&quot;, though not &quot;first responder&quot;, in this sense. They included an article in the &quot;Grand Junction Daily Sentinel&quot; in March 1972, and another about the formation of a &quot;First Response Group&quot; composed of volunteers in &quot;The Burlington&quot; &quot;Free Press&quot; in April 1973.

A few months after its use in the &quot;Globe&quot;, the term &quot;first-responders&quot; appeared in a &quot;Boston Herald&quot; article about a master plan for emergency care from the Health Planning Council of Greater Boston. One of the recommendations in the plan, reported the &quot;Herald&quot;, was that &quot;All ambulance personnel and first-responders (who are general police and firemen) should be adequately trained in emergency care such as cardopulmonary [&quot;sic&quot;] resuscitation.&quot;

&quot;First-responder&quot; was also used in a July 1974 classified advertisement for a deputy chief of EMT training—&quot;to assist in developing and implementing statewide training programs for EMT&#x27;s and first-responders&quot;—from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

The term began appearing in newspaper articles from other parts of the United States in the second half of 1974, and was in widespread use by 1975. At some point, the dash between &quot;first&quot; and &quot;responder&quot; disappeared.

==Specific jurisdictions==

Some jurisdictions have special laws defining and establishing the rights and duties of first responders.

===United States===

The term first responder is defined in U.S. Homeland Security Presidential Directive, HSPD-8 and reads:

Emergency response providers are defined by as follows:
==Issues==

First responders must be trained to deal with a wide array of potential emergencies. Due to the high level of stress and uncertainty associated with the position, first responders must maintain physical and mental health. Even with such preparation, first responders experience unique risks of being the first people to aid those with unknown contagions. For example, in 2003 first responders were among the earliest cases of the previously unknown SARS virus, when they cared for patients affected with the virus.

Infectious disease has continued to be a major occupational health concern among first responders with the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC and other agencies and organizations have issued guidance regarding workplace hazard controls for COVID-19. Specific precautions for first responders include modified call queries, symptom screening, universal PPE use, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and stringent disinfection protocols.

<doc id="500292" wikidata="Q2584209" url="?curid=500292" title="Anime Expo">
<text>Anime Expo, abbreviated AX, is an American anime convention held in Los Angeles, California and organized by the non-profit Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA). The convention is traditionally held annually on the first weekend of July, spanning the course of four days. Anime Expo is regularly hosted at the Los Angeles Convention Center but has also been held in other cities such as Anaheim, San Jose, New York, and Tokyo.

Anime Expo has events and activities during the convention for attendees to take part in such as guest panels, tabletop gaming, competitions, an arcade, and concerts.

==Convention history==

===History===

The first Anime Expo was held from July 3–6, 1992 at the Red Lion Hotel in San Jose, California. Many of its original staff came from Anime Con, an anime convention held in San Jose in 1991, and later absorbed by the SPJA in 1992. In 1994, Anime Expo made a strategic relocation to the Southern California area and all subsequent conventions have taken place there since.

It currently holds the title of North America&#x27;s largest anime convention, a title which it has consistently held every year except in 2003, in which its attendance was slightly edged out by the east coast anime convention Otakon. From 1,750 attendees in 1992, Anime Expo&#x27;s size has increased to over 107,658 in 2017, making Anime Expo the largest anime and manga convention in North America.

In March 2009, chief executive officer Trulee Karahashi, who had been a part of Anime Expo and SPJA in various capacities for 11 years, left the organization. In September, former Universal Studios executive Michael Lattanzio was later hired as the SPJA&#x27;s new CEO.

In January 2010, eight members of Anime Expo&#x27;s upper management team (ConCom) publicly resigned because of disagreements over the organization&#x27;s new direction set forth by Lattanzio. One significant point of contention was Lattanzio&#x27;s decision to refocus and restructure the SPJA&#x27;s marketing efforts, starting with the dismissal of a PR and marketing contractor that the organization had a close working relationship with since 2004. Additionally, two other personnel had already left for other reasons, leaving only the vice-chair and two others as returning members of the previous year&#x27;s team.

In September 2010, Lattanzio was released from his CEO position. 

In early 2012, Anime News Network reported that Anime Expo suffered a $1.2 million loss in 2010. The 2011 convention saw a $100,000 profit and reduced the outstanding debt to $700,000. The article also stated that one of the creditors, IDG World Expo, will be taking over several aspects of the organization, with guest selection and programming remaining under SPJA control. Additionally, Takayuki Karahashi has been elected as chairman of the board of directors.

The convention continued to be located at the LACC through 2019. In April 2016, Marc Perez left the company, with Ray Chiang becoming acting CEO of SPJA.

On June 30, 2017, the first Pre-Show Night was added to the Anime Expo, which included the Neon District, hosting the World Cosplay Summit U.S. Finals, and premieres.

As the convention&#x27;s attendance has grown, it&#x27;s seen long lines for entry into the convention hall, which organizers said was due to safety and security concerns.

In the months leading to the 2020 event, a global coronavirus outbreak created concerns related to large gatherings, such as Anime Expo. On April 17, 2020, the SPJA announced that it was cancelling Anime Expo 2020, citing &quot;health and safety&quot; concerns. However, the SPJA stated it still planned to hold the 2021 event on its normal July dates. On May 27, 2020, they announced a two-day online convention, titled Anime Expo Lite, which took place on July 3 and 4, 2020. On March 3, 2021, the SPJA canceled the 2021 live convention, and announced that the Anime Expo Lite would instead be held on the 2021 schedule, citing &quot;continued uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot; Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Anime Expo returned in-person in 2022; Anime Expo 2022 began on July 1 and ended on July 4 as an in-person event for the first time since 2019.

Anime Expo in 2023 suffered from serious overcrowding issues, and also occurred during a hotel staff strike.
===Convention locations===
===Other Anime Expos===
The SPJA twice ran conventions outside California: Anime Expo New York in 2002, and Anime Expo Tokyo in 2004.

====Anime Expo New York====
Anime Expo New York (AXNY) was held in 2002 in the Times Square district of New York City, New York. The event was originally a joint effort with Central Park Media and its industry event, Big Apple Anime Fest (BAAF). Due to differences, the event ran as separate entities within the same time frame and venues, with BAAF hosting the theatrical film screenings, and Anime Expo New York hosting the convention. The events shared some resources, with notable guests listed in the program guides of both events.
The SPJA ran the event in order to demonstrate that it could run events outside its home state of California. The event was a precursor to Anime Expo Tokyo which ran in Tokyo, Japan in 2004.
The SPJA has not run any events outside California since 2004.

====Anime Expo Tokyo====

Anime Expo Tokyo (AX Tokyo) was held in 2004 at the Sunshine City Convention Center in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, Japan. It was not technically organized directly by the SPJA, but rather was organized by the Japanese Association for Science Fiction International Communication (www.jasfic.or.jp)(JASFIC) with assistance from the SPJA. JASFIC had two goals for Anime Expo Tokyo. The first goal was to establish in Japan a non-corporate-sponsored convention dedicated to anime. The second goal was to demonstrate to the organizers of the World Science Fiction Convention (WorldCon) that Japan could serve as a suitable venue for conventions that attract foreigners. Although Anime Expo Tokyo did not go on to a second year, JASFIC was ultimately successful in attracting the 65th World Science Fiction Convention to Japan in 2007.

Anime Expo Tokyo had a list of over 40 guests such as manga artist Ken Akamatsu, MiQ, Under17, Hiroshi Aro, and many others, although a small handful had to make last-minute cancellations. Anime Expo Tokyo was also the very first Anime Expo that officially hosted guests from the U.S. anime industry such as webcomic artist Fred Gallagher and voice actor Crispin Freeman.

Of Anime Expo Tokyo&#x27;s 4,249 attendees, approximately 300 of that number were estimated to have traveled from abroad. In addition to the attendance numbers were 240 members of the press, 40 of which were from overseas. An additional 430 people were composed of dealers, guests, or staff.

No plans to host another official Anime Expo outside California have been announced.

====Anime Expo Chibi====
Anime Expo Chibi (formerly Anime Expo Ontario) is an annual two-day anime convention held during November at Ontario Convention Center in Ontario, California. Organized by Anime Expo, it is designed to be a smaller convention that focuses on the artist alley and exhibit hall. The programming has an arcade, cosplay contest, karaoke, live music, Maid Cafe, manga lounge, tabletop gaming, and workshops.

===Other conventions===
====Anime Conji====

In 2010, Anime Conji began as an annual anime convention in San Diego. In 2013, it began to be run by SPJA. Anime Conji 2016 was cancelled due to event quality concerns. Anime Conji 2017 was also cancelled. The convention returned in 2018 under its original organizers, the San Diego Speculative Fiction Society (SanSFiS). Anime Conji held no event in 2020 due to financial and location problems.

==Organizational structure==
The Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA), the parent organization which produces Anime Expo, is a federal and California state registered 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization. Before January 1, 2020, they were registered as a 501(c)(6) non-profit trade benefit organization.

==Notes==
* The 2009 event donated over $29,000 to the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) from the SPJA Charity Auction, announced during closing ceremonies on Sunday, July 5, 2009
* Masquerade main event was attended by a standing-room-only crowd with over 7,200 seats available.
* Total 2010 through-the-doors attendance achieved 105,000 (turnstile), compared to 2009&#x27;s attendance of 109,000 (turnstile). This was Anime Expo&#x27;s second attendance decline since its inception.

<doc id="500308" wikidata="Q1501766" url="?curid=500308" title="Lebombo Mountains">
<text>The Lebombo Mountains, also called Lubombo Mountains, Rivombo Mountains (), are an , narrow range of mountains in Southern Africa. They stretch from Hluhluwe in KwaZulu-Natal in the south to Punda Maria in the Limpopo Province in South Africa in the north. Parts of the mountain range are also found in Mozambique and Eswatini.

==Description==

Geologically, the range is considered a monocline; part of a rifted volcanic margin. The Lebombo monocline was aligned with the Explora Escarpment off-shore Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, before the break-up of Gondwana. The Lebombo monocline strikes N-S and dips to the east. It is composed of a sequence of Jurassic age volcanic rock, both basaltic lavas and rhyolitic flows and tuffs. The sequence rests on essentially horizontal Karoo Supergroup sedimentary rocks of the Kalahari Craton to the west and is overlain by Cretaceous to recent sediments to the east. The alternating resistant rhyolite and easily eroded basalts produce a series of parallel sharp cuesta ridges separated by savanna plains.

The range is relatively low with heights between and less than . The highest peak is the Mount Mananga. The Longwe is the highest point in the Lebombo Range north of the Letaba River.

The mountains dominate Lubombo District in Eswatini. Towns in the area include Siteki in the centre, Lubhuku in the west and Mayaluka and Big Bend in the south with the Lusutfu River running past the southern region of the mountain range. At the north lie the towns of Simunye, Tambankulu and Namaacha, and the Mlawula Nature Reserve as well as the Mbuluzi River.

A number of rivers, including the Pongola, Mkuze, and Lusutfu, cross the mountains from west to east. The Lebombo Mountains are home to the Thonga people who are part of the Tsonga ethnic group, it straddles from North KwaZulu-Natal (Amathongaland) to Kruger National Park in Limpopo Province with the same name origin of the Lebombo/Rivombo clan.

==Protected areas==
Kruger National Park and Phongolo Nature Reserve protect part of the range.

<doc id="500309" wikidata="Q1807196" url="?curid=500309" title="Alaska North Slope">
<text>The Alaska North Slope is the region of the U.S. state of Alaska located on the northern slope of the Brooks Range along the coast of two marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean, the Chukchi Sea being on the western side of Point Barrow, and the Beaufort Sea on the eastern. With the exception of the highway connecting Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay, the region is disconnected from the rest of the Alaskan road system and relies mostly on waterways and small airports for transportation due to the Brooks Range secluding the region from the rest of the state.

The entire Arctic coastal plain of Alaska with its Arctic coastal tundra has tremendous ecological importance with the densest concentration of birds in the Arctic, along with housing substantial amounts of large mammals such as whales, walrus, seals, caribou, and moose. The region includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) as well as the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska (NPRA).

==Topography==
Within the North Slope, only a surface &quot;active layer&quot; of the tundra thaws each season; most of the soil is permanently frozen year-round. On top of this permafrost, water flows out to sea via shallow, braided streams or settles into pools and ponds. Along the bottom of the Landsat 7 image on the right, the rugged terrain of the Brooks Range mountains is snow-covered in places (blue areas) and exposed (pink areas) in others.

Much of the region is located politically in North Slope Borough, and geographically in the Alaska North Slope basin.

On August 12, 2018, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the region, the most powerful recorded for the Alaskan North Slope.

==Ecology==
The region includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The entire coastal plain of Alaska has tremendous ecological importance with the densest concentration of birds in the Arctic.

==Petroleum resources==


Under the North Slope is an ancient seabed, which now contains large amounts of petroleum. Within the North Slope, there is a geological feature called the Barrow Arch — a belt of the kind of rock known to be able to serve as a trap for oil. It runs from the city of Utqiaġvik to a point just west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 

Ira Harkey quotes Noel Wien as stating that in the 1920s, &quot;To keep warm and to cook with, the Eskimo was burning hunks of dark stuff he just picked up on the ground all around his tent. This was oil from seepage under the tundra. The Eskimos had always known about the oil, long before there was any drilling for it.&quot;

The North Slope region includes the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska (NPRA), which was established by President Warren G. Harding in 1923 as an oil supply for the US Navy, though the presence of oil in the region had been known by American whalers for some time. It constituted the bulk of Alaska&#x27;s known petroleum until the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was discovered (outside the NPRA) in 1968, followed by the Kuparuk River oil field in 1969. 
The petroleum extracted from the region is transferred south by means of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to Valdez on the Pacific Ocean. 

In 2005 the USGS estimated that the Arctic Alaska Petroleum Province, encompassing all the lands and adjacent Continental Shelf areas north of the Brooks Range-Herald arch (see map) held more than 50 billion bbl of oil and natural-gas liquids and 227 trillion cubic feet of gas.

The source rock for the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field and neighboring reserves is also a potential source for unconventional tight oil and shale gas – possibly containing &quot;up to 2 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and up to 80 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to a 2012 U.S. Geological Survey report.&quot;

Alaska North Slope (ANS) is a more expensive waterborne crude oil. Since 1987, Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude production has been in decline.

As of 2020, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated 3.6 billion barrels of oil and 8.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Mississippian through Paleogene strata in the central North Slope of Alaska, which are undiscovered and technically recoverable.

<text>Sevenoaks is a local government district in west Kent, England. Its council is based in the town of Sevenoaks.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of Sevenoaks Urban District, Sevenoaks Rural District and part of Dartford Rural District.

==Geography==
The area is approximately evenly divided between buildings and infrastructure on the one hand and woodland or agricultural fields on the other. It contains the upper valley of the River Darenth and some headwaters of the River Eden.

The vast majority of the district is covered by the Metropolitan Green Belt.

In terms of districts, it borders Dartford to the north, Gravesham to the northeast, Tonbridge and Malling to the east, briefly Tunbridge Wells to the southeast. It also borders two which, equal to it, do not have borough status, the Wealden district of East Sussex to the south and the Tandridge district of Surrey to the southwest. It borders the London Boroughs of Bromley and Bexley to the northwest.

In the 2011 Census, the district had a population of 114,893.

==Governance==
Sevenoaks District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In 2009 the Audit Commission named Sevenoaks District Council as one of the four best-run and most efficient councils in the country.

===Political control===
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was as follows:
Two of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Sevenoaks Independents&quot;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2003 the council has comprised 54 councillors, representing 26 wards. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Argyle Road. The offices were built for the council on the site of a large house which had served as the offices of one of the council&#x27;s predecessors, the Sevenoaks Urban District Council. The new building was formally opened on 3 March 1986.

==Housing and architecture==

The layout of the district is dual-centred:
*A well-buffered suburban town itself, which spreads into suburban villages (St Johns, Riverhead, Dunton Green, Sevenoaks Weald). 
*Swanley and smaller, equally buffered Hextable and Crockenhill within the M25 motorway.

In all areas low-rise dominates: the incidence of flats exceeding two storeys is rare.
The number of listed buildings in the district exceeds 150. This includes 16 churches listed in the highest grading in the national listing system (Grade I). Castles and English country houses of the wealthiest in society from the 16th to 18th centuries form part of this district.

Examples at Grade I include Knole House, Chartwell, Penshurst Place and Chevening House, most of which have their own produce-selling farms. Older with original stone walls are Hever Castle with its -wooded island in a listed parkland. A folly exists at Lullingstone Castle which is a reconstruction of its gatehouse and separate modern house.

==Towns and parishes==
The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Sevenoaks and Swanley are styled as town councils.

<text>The Borough of Ashford is a local government district with borough status in Kent, England. It is named after its largest town, Ashford, where the council is based. The borough also includes the town of Tenterden and an extensive surrounding rural area including numerous villages; with an area of , it is the largest district in Kent. Parts of the borough lie within the designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty of High Weald and the Kent Downs.

The neighbouring districts are (clockwise from west) Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone, Swale, Canterbury, Folkestone and Hythe, and Rother. The latter is in East Sussex, the rest are in Kent.

==History==
The parish of Ashford was made a local government district in 1863, run by an elected local board. Such districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ashford Urban District
*East Ashford Rural District
*Tenterden Rural District
*Tenterden Municipal Borough
*West Ashford Rural District
The new district was named Ashford after its largest town. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Ashford Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. Much of the district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2022. Following the 2023 election a coalition of the Ashford Independents and the Green Party took minority control of the council, led by Ashford Independent councillor Noel Ovenden.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Ashford. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1999 have been:

===Compositions===
Following the 2023 election, subsequent changes of allegiance and a by-election in October 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2019 the council has comprised 47 councillors representing 39 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Civic Centre on Tannery Lane in Ashford, which was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1983. The council has announced plans to move during 2024 to International House, a 1972 office building opposite Ashford International railway station, which the council bought in 2014.

== Population ==
=== Expansion and growth ===
In 1961, the population of the districts which make up the present borough was as follows:
Forty years later the population had almost doubled: the 2001 census recorded a population of 102,661.

From the 1960s onwards Ashford has experienced phases of rapid urban growth, creating new suburbs such as Stanhope and, more recently, Singleton. Today&#x27;s urban growth is partially shaped by the &quot;de facto&quot; corridors created by the M20 motorway, the High Speed 1 line and several other rail lines which converge on the town&#x27;s railway station.

The 2011 census reported Ashford as having:
* 117,956 residents
* 47,787 households (an increase of just under 6,000 since 2001)
* 83% of residents describing their health as &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;very good&#x27;
* 13% of residents describing their health as &#x27;fair&#x27;
* 16.8% of those over the age of 16 having no qualifications
* an unemployment rate of 2.6% of all economically active people aged 16–74 (an increase since 2001 of 0.2%)

== Economy and Infrastructure ==

The area&#x27;s economy, once strongly dominated by agriculture and associated activities such as brewing and food production as well as some quarrying of ragstone and brick manufacture, evolved into a centre for rail engineering in the 19th century, and is now primarily light industrial and commercial, with the notable exception of Hitachi&#x27;s rail depot. The borough&#x27;s local plan (&quot;Local Plan to 2030&quot;) continues to plan for new housing in and around the town, such as the development at Finberry.

From the historic town centre, roads radiate out in the following directions: NW to Charing and Maidstone and SE to Hythe and Folkestone (A20/M20 in each direction); south to Hamstreet, Lydd and Romney Marsh and then westwards to Hastings (A2070); SW to Tenterden and NE to Wye and Canterbury (A28) and finally north to Ashford&#x27;s historic port at Faversham (A251).

== Media ==
=== Television ===
The area is served by the regional news programmes:
*&quot;BBC South East Today&quot;
*&quot;ITV News Meridian&quot;
===Radio===
Radio stations that broadcast to the area are:
*BBC Radio Kent
*Heart South
*Gold Radio 
*AHBS Community Radio broadcast from the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford.
*KMFM Ashford
*Radio Ashford, a community based station.

== Historic buildings and landscape character ==
There are more than 400 listed buildings in the district. This includes 33 churches listed in the highest grading in the national listing system (Grade I) as well as many oast houses and pubs dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, along with some even earlier buildings such as the Black Horse at Pluckley built in the 1470s as a dry-moated farmhouse by the Dering family (see also: Little Chart).

Well-known examples of Grade I listed buildings include: the Archbishop&#x27;s palace at Charing, Chilham Castle and Godinton House, as well as more domestic examples such as the row of 17th century Flemish weavers&#x27; cottages which stretches the full length of the south side of Biddenden High Street.

See also the listings: Grade I listed buildings in Ashford (borough) .

Beyond the town of Ashford, most of the borough&#x27;s land area is rural, with fields, woodland and fruit orchards. Much of the woodland is coppiced. Changes in rural land use over the past century mirror those in the rest of the present County. The north-east of the borough, including the villages of Wye and Chilham, is within the Kent Downs AONB, whilst the south-west, including Rolvenden and the Isle of Oxney, is part of the High Weald AONB. In addition to these national landscape areas, the borough has many smaller Local Nature Reserves such as Hothfield Common.

==Towns and parishes==

As of April 2023 there were 44 civil parishes within the borough. The parish council for Tenterden has declared that parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Much of the built-up area of Ashford itself is unparished, although some suburbs fall within parishes.

<text>An outrigger is a projecting structure on a boat, with specific meaning depending on types of vessel. Outriggers may also refer to legs on a wheeled vehicle that are folded out when it needs stabilization, for example on a crane that lifts heavy loads.
==Powered vessels and sailboats==

An outrigger describes any contraposing float rigging beyond the side (gunwale) of a boat to improve the vessel&#x27;s stability. If a single outrigger is used it is usually but not always windward. The technology was originally developed by the Austronesian people. There are two main types of boats with outriggers: double outriggers (prevalent in maritime Southeast Asia) and single outriggers (prevalent in Madagascar, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia). Multihull ships are also derived from outrigger boats.

In an outrigger canoe and in sailboats such as the proa, an outrigger is a thin, long, solid, hull used to stabilise an inherently unstable main hull. The outrigger is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull is less likely to capsize. If only one outrigger is used on a vessel, its weight reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its buoyancy reduces the tendency in the other direction.

On a keelboat, &quot;outrigger&quot; refers to a variety of structures by which the running rigging (such as a sheet) may be attached outboard (outside the lateral limits) of the boat&#x27;s hull. The Racing Rules of Sailing generally prohibit such outriggers, though they are explicitly permitted on specific classes, such as the IMOCA Open 60 used in several major offshore races.

==Fishing==
In fishing from vessels, an outrigger is a pole or series of poles that allow boats to trawl more lines in the water without tangling and simulates a school of fish.

==Rowing==
In a rowing boat or galley, an outrigger (or rigger) is a triangular frame that holds the rowlock (into which the oar is slotted) away from the saxboard (or gunwale in gig rowing) to optimize leverage. Wooden outriggers appear on the new trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300, while Harry Clasper (1812–1870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern tubular-metal version and the top rowing events accepted the physiological and ergonomic advantages so acceded to its use in competitions. In recent decades, some manufacturers of racing shells have developed wing-riggers which are reinforced arcs or flattened tubular projections akin to aircraft wings, instead of conventional triangular structures.

<doc id="500353" wikidata="Q19045" url="?curid=500353" title="Mario Molina">
<text>Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez (19 March 19437 October 2020) was a Mexican physical chemist. He played a pivotal role in the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, and was a co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his role in discovering the threat to the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases. He was the first Mexican-born scientist to receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry and the third Mexican-born person to receive a Nobel prize.

In his career, Molina held research and teaching positions at University of California, Irvine, California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California, San Diego, and the Center for Atmospheric Sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Molina was also Director of the Mario Molina Center for Energy and Environment in Mexico City. Molina was a climate policy advisor to the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.

==Early life==
Molina was born in Mexico City to Roberto Molina Pasqual and Leonor Henriquez. His father was a lawyer and diplomat who served as an ambassador to Eritrea, Australia and the Philippines. His mother was a family manager. With considerably different interests than his parents, Mario Molina went on to make one of the biggest discoveries in environmental science.

Mario Molina attended both elementary and primary school in Mexico. However, before even attending high school, Mario Molina had developed a deep interest in chemistry. As a child he converted a bathroom in his home into his own little laboratory, using toy microscopes and chemistry sets. Ester Molina, Mario&#x27;s aunt, and an already established chemist, nurtured his interests and aided him in completing more complex chemistry experiments. At this time, Mario knew he wanted to pursue a career in chemistry, and at the age of 11, he was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland at Institut auf dem Rosenberg, where he learnt to speak German. Before this, Mario had initially wanted to become a professional violinist, but his love for chemistry triumphed over that interest. At first Mario was disappointed when he arrived at the boarding school in Switzerland due to the fact that most of his classmates did not have the same interest in science as he did.

Molina&#x27;s early career consisted of research at various academic institutions. Molina went on to earn his bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1965. Following this, Molina studied polymerization kinetics at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, West Germany, for two years. Finally, he was accepted for graduate study at the University of California, Berkeley. After earning his doctorate he made his way to UC Irvine. He then returned to Mexico where he kickstarted the first chemical engineering program at his alma mater. This was only the beginning of his chemistry endeavors.

== Career ==

Mario Molina began his studies at the University of California at Berkeley in 1968, where he would obtain his PhD in physical chemistry. Throughout his years at Berkeley, he participated in various research projects such as the study of molecular dynamics using chemical lasers and investigation of the distribution of internal energy in the products of chemical and photochemical reactions. Throughout this journey is where he worked with his professor and mentor George C. Pimentel who grew his love for chemistry even further. After completing his PhD in physical chemistry, in 1973, he enrolled in a research program at UC Berkeley, with Sherwood Rowland. The topic of interest was Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) . The two would later on make one of the largest discoveries in atmospheric chemistry. They developed their theory of ozone depletion, which later influenced the mass public to reduce their use of CFCs. This kickstarted his career as a widely known chemist.

Between 1974 and 2004, Molina variously held research and teaching posts at University of California, Irvine, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he held a joint appointment in the Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and the Department of Chemistry. On 1 July 2004, Molina joined the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of California, San Diego, and the Center for Atmospheric Sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
In addition he established a non-profit organization, which opened the Mario Molina Center for Strategic Studies in Energy and the Environment () in Mexico City in 2005. Molina served as its director.

Molina served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 2000 to 2005. 
He also served on the board of directors of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (2004–2014), and as a member of the MacArthur Foundation&#x27;s Institutional Policy Committee and its Committee on Global Security and Sustainability.

Molina was nominated to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences as of 24 July 2000. He served as a co-chair of the Vatican workshop and co-author of the report &quot;Well Under 2 Degrees Celsius: Fast Action Policies to Protect People and the Planet from Extreme Climate Change&quot; (2017) with Veerabhadran Ramanathan and Durwood Zaelke. The report proposed 12 scalable and practical solutions which are part of a three-lever cooling strategy to mitigate climate change.

Molina was named by US president Barack Obama to form a transition team on environmental issues in 2008.
Under President Obama, he was a member of the United States President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

Molina sat on the board of directors for Xyleco.

He contributed to the content of the papal encyclical Laudato Si&#x27;.

In 2020, Mario Molina contributed to research regarding the importance of wearing face masks amid the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. The research article titled &quot;Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19&quot; was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Journal in collaboration with Renyi Zhang, Yixin Li, Annie L. Zhang and Yuan Wang.

==Work on CFCs==
Molina joined the lab of Professor F. Sherwood Rowland in 1973 as a postdoctoral fellow. Here, Molina continued Rowland&#x27;s pioneering research into &quot;hot atom&quot; chemistry, which is the study of chemical properties of atoms with excess translational energy owing to radioactive processes.

This study soon led to research into chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), apparently harmless gases that were used in refrigerants, aerosol sprays, and the making of plastic foams. CFCs were being released by human activity and were known to be accumulating in the atmosphere. The basic scientific question Molina asked was &quot;What is the consequence of society releasing something to the environment that wasn&#x27;t there before?&quot;

Rowland and Molina had investigated compounds similar to CFCs before. Together they developed the CFC ozone depletion theory, by combining basic scientific knowledge about the chemistry of ozone, CFCs and atmospheric conditions with computer modelling. First Molina tried to figure out how CFCs could be decomposed. At lower levels of the atmosphere, they were inert. Molina realized that if CFCs released into the atmosphere do not decay by other processes, they will continually rise to higher altitudes. Higher in the atmosphere, different conditions apply. The highest levels of the stratosphere are exposed to the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet light. A thin layer of ozone floating high in the stratosphere protects lower levels of the atmosphere from that type of radiation.

Molina theorized that photons from ultraviolet light, known to break down oxygen molecules, could also break down CFCs, releasing a number of products including chlorine atoms into the stratosphere. Chlorine atoms (Cl) are radicals: they have an unpaired electron and are very reactive. Chlorine atoms react easily with ozone molecules (O3), removing one oxygen atom to leave O2 and chlorine monoxide (ClO).

:Cl· + → ClO· + 

ClO is also a radical, which reacts with another ozone molecule to release two more O2 molecules and a Cl atom.

:ClO· + → Cl· + 2

The radical Cl atom is not consumed by this pair of reactions, so it remains in the system.

Molina and Rowland predicted that chlorine atoms, produced by this decomposition of CFCs, would act as an ongoing catalyst for the destruction of ozone. When they calculated the amounts involved, they realized that CFCs could start a seriously damaging chain reaction to the ozone layer in the stratosphere.

In 1974, as a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Irvine, Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland co-authored a paper in the journal &quot;Nature &quot;highlighting the threat of CFCs to the ozone layer in the stratosphere. At the time, CFCs were widely used as chemical propellants and refrigerants. Molina and Rowland followed up the short &quot;Nature&quot; paper with a 150-page report for the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which they made available at the September 1974 meeting of the American Chemical Society in Atlantic City. This report and an ACS-organized press conference, in which they called for a complete ban on further releases of CFCs into the atmosphere, brought national attention.

Rowland and Molina&#x27;s findings were disputed by commercial manufacturers and chemical industry groups, and a public consensus on the need for action only began to emerge in 1976 with the publication of a review of the science by the National Academy of Sciences. Rowland and Molina&#x27;s work was further supported by evidence of the long-term decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica, published by Joseph C. Farman and his co-authors in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1985. Ongoing work led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol (an agreement to cut CFC production and use) by 56 countries in 1987, and to further steps towards the worldwide elimination of CFCs from aerosol cans and refrigerators. By establishing this protocol, the amount of CFCs being emitted into the atmosphere decreased significantly, and while doing so, it has paced the rate of ozone depletion and even slowed climate change. It is for this work that Molina later shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland. The citation specifically recognized him and his co-awardees for &quot;their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.&quot;

Following this in 1985, after Joseph Farman discovered a hole in the ozone layer in Antarctica, Mario Molina led a research team to further investigate the cause of rapid ozone depletion in Antarctica. It was found that the stratospheric conditions in Antarctica were ideal for chlorine activation, which ultimately causes ozone depletion.

==Honors==

Molina received numerous awards and honors, including sharing the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their discovery of the role of CFCs in ozone depletion.

Molina was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1993.
He was elected to the United States Institute of Medicine in 1996, 
and The National College of Mexico in 2003. 
In 2007, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was also a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences.
Molina was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and co-chaired the 2014 AAAS Climate Science Panel, &quot;What We Know: The reality, risks and response to climate change.&quot;

Molina won the 1987 Esselen Award of the Northeast section of the American Chemical Society, the 1988 Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the 1989 NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Advancement and the 1989 United Nations Environmental Programme Global 500 Award. In 1990, The Pew Charitable Trusts Scholars Program in Conservation and the Environment honored him as one of ten environmental scientists and awarded him a $150,000 grant.

<doc id="500362" wikidata="Q1971967" url="?curid=500362" title="Dover District">
<text>Dover is a local government district in Kent, England. It is named after its largest town, the port town of Dover. The council is based in Whitfield on the outskirts of Dover. The district also covers the towns of Deal, Sandwich and Walmer as well as the surrounding rural areas.

The district borders Thanet District to the north, the City of Canterbury to the west, and Folkestone and Hythe District to the south-west. To the south and east, it faces the Strait of Dover.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the whole area of four former districts and part of a fifth, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*Deal Municipal Borough
*Dover Municipal Borough
*Dover Rural District
*Eastry Rural District (except five parishes which went to Thanet)
*Sandwich Municipal Borough
The new district was named Dover after its largest town.

==Governance==
Dover District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
Following the 2023 election, the council was under Labour majority control. They subsequently lost their majority following changes of allegiance in January 2025, leaving the council under no overall control.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council (formally the chair of the policy and resources committee prior to 2001) have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, and a defection in 2025, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council&#x27;s main offices are at the White Cliffs Business park in the parish of Whitfield, to the north of the town of Dover itself.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 32 councillors representing 17 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Geography==
The northern boundary of the district is the River Stour; on its western side is the district of Canterbury; to the south the parish of Capel-le-Ferne; and to the east the Straits of Dover. The southern part of the latter is the point where the North Downs meets the sea, at the White Cliffs of Dover. Further north along the coast, from Deal onwards, the land is at sea level, where the River Stour enters the sea by a circuitous route. It is here, on the sand-dunes, that the Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club, founded in 1887, and of international repute, is situated.

In the district are industrial remains of the erstwhile Kent coalfield, situated around Tilmanstone and Betteshanger. Half of the underwater section of the Channel Tunnel is under British Sovereignty and thus part of the district.

==Parishes==

There are 35 civil parishes covering the whole district. The parish councils of Deal, Dover, Sandwich and Walmer take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

* Alkham
* Ash
* Aylesham
* Capel-le-Ferne
* Deal (town)
* Denton with Wootton
* Dover (town)
* Eastry
* Eythorne
* Goodnestone
* Great Mongeham
* Guston
* Hougham Without
* Langdon

==Communications==
Deal Timeball is a Victorian maritime Greenwich Mean Time signal located on the roof of a waterfront four-storey tower. It was established in 1855 by the Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in collaboration with Charles V. Walker.

Crossing Dover district are the Roman roads of Watling Street and that leading from Richborough. Today the main road, the A2, closely follows Watling Street to Dover.

<doc id="500370" wikidata="Q3372509" url="?curid=500370" title="Paul Bins, comte de Saint-Victor">
<text>Paul Bins, comte de Saint-Victor (11 July 1827 in Paris – 9 July 1881 in Paris), known as Paul de Saint-Victor, a French author and critic. He is likely most known today as a French cultural figure mentioned by Marcel Proust in the novel &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

==Personal==
Saint-Victor was born in Paris. His father Jacques Bins, comte de Saint-Victor (1772–1858), is chiefly remembered for his poem &quot;L&#x27;Espérance&quot;, and for an excellent verse translation of Anacreon.

He had an affair with Lia Félix, a sister of the famous actress Rachel Félix. They had a girl, Claire, on 26 October 1860, whose godfather was Edmond de Goncourt.

Saint-Victor died in Paris on 9 July 1881.

==Career==
Saint-Victor ceased using his title as he found it out of keeping with his democratic principles. He began as a drama critic on the &quot;Pays&quot; newspaper in 1851, and in 1855 he succeeded Théophile Gautier on the &quot;Presse&quot;. In 1866 he migrated to the &quot;Liberté&quot;, and in 1869 joined the staff of the &quot;Moniteur universel&quot;. In 1870, during the last days of the Second Empire, he was made inspector-general of fine arts.

Almost all of Saint-Victor&#x27;s work consists of articles, the best known being the collection entitled &quot;Hommes et Dieux&quot; (1867). His death interrupted the publication of &quot;Les Deux Masques&quot;, in which he intended to survey the whole of ancient and modern dramatic literature. Saint-Victor&#x27;s critical faculty was considerable, though rather one-sided. He owed a good deal to Théophile Gautier, but his writing was more florid than Gautier&#x27;s.

<text>The 1st South African Infantry Division was an infantry division of the army of the Union of South Africa. During World War II the division served in East Africa from 1940 to 1941 and in the Western Desert Campaign from 1941 to 1942. The division was disbanded on 1 January 1943, for conversion into what would become the 6th South African Armoured Division. The division was also briefly active after the war from 1 July 1948 to 1 November 1949.
==Outbreak of war==
When Neville Chamberlain declared war on 3 September 1939, the Union Defence Force consisted of 5,385 Permanent Force members, 14,631 Citizen Force members and 122,000 Commandos of which only 39,000 were considered suited for field deployment. The Defence Act also prohibited the deployment of its members beyond the confines of southern Africa. On 4 September, General Hertzog resigned and was replaced by General Smuts and two days later, on 6 September South Africa declared war against Germany.

The &quot;phoney war&quot; luckily granted more time and by 22 September a policy paper had been submitted calling for the formation of two &quot;Forces&quot; and was approved in mid October, laying the foundations for the formation of 1 and 2 SA Divisions. In March 1941, fearing the Italian commitment to war, General Wavell requested the services of a South African Brigade Group in Kenya via the Imperial General Staff. Prime Minister Smuts consented.

Initially, to circumvent the limitations of the South African Defence Act (Act No 13 of 1912), only volunteers were recruited and they were subject to an oath on induction whereby they consented to being deployed anywhere in Africa, this being a pre-requisite for acceptance into the Union forces. Men who attested under these terms were entitled to wear the distinct insignia of the Mobile Field Force, a red / orange shoulder strap which was to become known as the &quot;Red Tab&quot;. The Defence Act was later amended.

===Advance party to East Africa===
The formation of the 1st South Africa Infantry Brigade Group was approved on 13 May 1940. Although approved, South Africa was desperately short of equipment and had few armoured vehicles save for a limited number of locally designed prototype armoured cars. Due to this limited infantry and armour offensive capacity, all that could initially be mobilised was an anti-aircraft detachment. Thus, part of the 1st SA Anti-Aircraft brigade, who arrived in Mombasa on 1 June 1940 as an advance party to protect Mombasa harbour from feared Italian air attacks, becoming the first South African land forces to be deployed outside of South Africa since the First World War. On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war and on the next day South Africa officially declared war on Italy. Two hours after the South African declaration, four Ju 86&#x27;s of the South African Air Force bombed Italian troops at a Banda Camp close to Moyale, a few kilometres across the Kenya border into Ethiopia.

=== 1st Brigade Group Mobilised ===
In order to rapidly provide forces to East Africa, as well as due to the lack of trained manpower it was decided to initially form a single Infantry Brigade from the 1st Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Rifles, the 1st Royal Natal Carabineers and the 1st Transvaal Scottish with brigade artillery and support elements (Refer ORBAT below). On 13 July, the 1st South African Brigade Group under command of Colonel John Daniel was issued its movement order and it assembled at Zonderwater for the farewell parade, with General Smuts taking the salute ironically, that Sunday being celebrated as &quot;Delville Wood Day&quot;.

Embarkation commenced in Durban the next day, with Brigade HQ, 1st Transvaal Scottish and attached troops boarding the MS &quot;Dilwara&quot; while the Royal Natal Carbineers and a number of voluntary aid nurses boarded the &quot;Devonshire&quot;. The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Rifles followed in the &quot;Rajula&quot;. The convoy cast off on 17 July 1940.

===Establishment===
On 13 August 1940 the 1st South African Infantry Division was officially constituted consisting of the 1st SA Brigade Group already in Kenya and the 2nd and 5th South African Infantry Brigade Groups. Brig-Gen George Brink was appointed as commander with Lt. Col W.H.E. Poole as GSO 1. The Division HQ landed at Mombasa on 11 November 1940.

===2nd and 5th Brigades===

====Dominating the Dida Galgalla (&quot;Desert of the Night&quot;)====

After the success of the 1st South African Infantry Brigade against the Italians at the El Wak border post on 16 December 1940, Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham was intent on opening access into the Galla-Sidamo area across the Chalbi Desert by advancing eastwards from the eastern side of Lake Rudolf and to support a possible rebellion by the Shifta tribe against the Italians. This was the first offensive to be assigned to 1 SA Division. The division then consisted of the 2nd and 5th SA Brigades (located at Marsabit), the 25th East African Brigade (at Lokitaung) as well as six companies of the 2nd Abyssinian Irregulars. Almost on a daily basis, division infantry and armoured cars crossed the Dida Galgalla in search of enemy patrols. The Italians maintained a well established outpost at Turbi Hills, from which they had clear observation of any vehicle or troop movements in the Dida Galgalla. From December 1940 to February 1941 patrols had never been able to engage Italian patrols or elements as they withdrew deeper into Abyssinia on sighting the South African patrols entering the Dida Galgalla, only to return the next day.

====El Yibo====
Before advancing into southern Abyssinia, General Brink was compelled to protect his western flank and to deny water sources to the Italians. For this reason, on 16 January the 1st Natal Mounted Rifles (of the 2nd Brigade), No 2 Armoured Car Company, 12 SA Field Battery and two irregular companies attacked the string of wells at El Yibo and El Sardu in the Kenyan Northern Frontier District. After three days of fighting, supported by the SAAF, the enemy withdrew from El Yibo on the night of 17 January and on the afternoon of 18 January, the 2nd Field Force Battalion, which had been moved up from the brigade reserve, entered an abandoned El Sardu. With the only water sources in the area in the hands of the South Africans, the advance into Abyssinia could commence.

====Gorai and Hobok====

2nd and 5th Brigades crossed the Abyssinian border north of Dukana late afternoon on 31 January 1941, moving in parallel columns to assault the Italian positions in the Mega-Moyale complex. The Italians had well established and entrenched advance positions at Goai Crater, El Gumu and Hobok which were to be taken before the main forces at Mega-Moyale could be attacked. 2nd Brigade was assigned to attack Gorai on the right, while 5th Brigade was to assault El Gumu. The attack commenced early morning on 1 February and by 1600 both objectives had been secured. The armoured cars however failed to cut off the remnant Italian forces, and they retreated back towards Mega and Moyale. The next day, 3rd Transvaal Scottish and the armoured cars attacked Fort Hobok, sited on a ridge 30 km west of El Gumu supported by artillery. The armoured cars again covered the flanks and tried to cut off any retreating forces. By afternoon, the fort had been captured. The 2nd Brigade now held Gorai and the 5th Brigade, Hobok (&quot;Map 1: Point 1&quot;). It was again hoped that these raids would ignite the Shifta uprising, but as with the previous occasion, this never materialised.

====Battle for Mega====
Having two salients extending into Ethiopia, Cunningham and Brink decided to consolidate and to secure their lines of supply in face of the oncoming rainy season which would make the Chalbi desert impassable. The key to supply in the area were the towns of Mega and Moyale, overlooking the two major roads into Abyssinia from Kenya. These were to be taken in a two brigade assault, by first attacking Mega (Map 1: Point 2) and then Moyale (Map 1: Point 3).

The Italians inadvertently opened the offensive when one of their supply columns from Yavello drove into a 2nd Brigade detachment deployed to control the Yavello-Mega road. Poor defensive arrangements by the South Africans allowed the Italians and Banda (irregulars) to drive into the centre of the detachment. After much reactive manoeuvre and intervention by the armoured car company, the Italian supply column and supporting troops were destroyed. The South African positions now known to the Italians, they were attacked by a detachment of Italian light tanks on 16 February, which caused the armoured cars to flee westwards and allowed the tanks to descend on the unprotected infantry. After a brisk but fierce fire-fight, the Italian tanks returned to Mega, leaving the South African detachment dispersed and disorganised.
This attack had compromised surprise – and the attack on Mega was now commenced in all urgency. The 1st SA Irish (Col. Dobbs) were tasked to take the ridges east of Mega fort while the 3rd Transvaal Scottish (Lt-Col. Walter Kirby) were to occupy the a series of hills west of the fort and were to advance in line with the SA Irish. 2nd Brigade was to launch a direct attack on the fort and the Mega defensive complex. Despite incoming artillery fire, the Irish and Scottish regiments advances progressed well – but there was no sign of the 2nd Brigade who had not yet crossed the start-line, threatening to undermine the planned attack. At noon, a torrential rainstorm erupted and a thick mist enveloped the heights around Mega and it became obvious that the fort would not be taken by nightfall. The next morning, cloud and mist prevented air support and the Irish and Scottish battalions restarted their advance. It was only after the third day that the 2nd Brigade managed to reach their designated start-line due to poor navigation and the failure to identify serious terrain obstacles on their line of advance during reconnaissance. Clear skies on the third day permitted a coordinated attack with air support, artillery and the two brigades attacking together leading to an Italian surrender late that afternoon (18 February).
Mega fell with 1,000 Italian and African soldiers being captured on 22 February, and later that day one of the irregular companies attached to 2nd Brigade entered Moyale unopposed. The Italians had fled, leaving large quantities of logistical stores. The division had attained its objective and had secured the access roads into southern Abyssinia before the onset of the seasonal rains.

====Operations west of Lake Rudolf====
West of Lake Rudolf, the 25th East African Brigade (Brig. W. Owen) marched on Namaraputh with the objective of taking the town of Kalam (&quot;Map 1: Point 4&quot;). Opposition from Merille tribesman in the area was so fierce, that the Brigade was compelled to cease its advance and to go over to the defensive. Any advance west of the lake would first require wide area operations to subdue these irregular forces. By the time Moyale fell, allied forces had captured Mogadishu to the east and this success encouraged General Wavell to advise Cunningham that the South African division should be readied to deploy to Egypt at short notice. Cunningham thus replaced 2nd and 5th Brigades with the 21st East African Brigade and withdrew them back into Kenya.

===Transfer to Egypt===
The Division HQ, Division troops and 5 SA Infantry Brigade arrived in Suez, after an eleven-day voyage from Mombassa on 3 May 1941. The 2nd Brigade arrived in Suez on 8 June from Berbera and was forthwith assigned to 2 SA Infantry Division. The 1st Brigade sailed from Massawa on 12 June 1941 to Egypt. At the peak of operations in 1940, there were 77,000 troops in Kenya of which 27,000 were South African.

==Western Desert==

===Situation===

During the time the division had spent in East Africa, the Desert War had progressed and by the time of their arrival in Egypt:
* The initial advance by the Italians to the Egypt border had been checked (August 1940), with constant raids being launched across the border fence. The Italians were demoralised and had lost approximately three thousand men against British losses of little more than one hundred.
* By September the Italians had attacked and taken Sollum, Halfaya Pass, and Sidi Barrani and dug in around Sidi Barrani and established several fortified campsin the area, stopping eighty miles west of the British defences at Mersa Matruh.
* In December 1940, the Western Desert Force launched Operation Compass, the British counterattack. The Italians were caught completely off-guard and by 10 December, the British and Indian forces had taken more than 20,000 Italian prisoners. The following day, the British and Indian forces attacked Sollum. Sidi Barrani fell on the same day.
* The 4th Indian Division was replaced with the newly arrived Australian 6th Division. The Australians then pressed on to capture Bardia and Tobruk, with little or no opposition. In early February, the Italians were in headlong retreat along the coast, pursued by the Australians.
* An overland advance by the 7th Armoured Division through Mechili to Beda Fomm, cut off the Italian line of retreat. Combe Force, an ad hoc flying column was sent racing ahead of the tanks and they reached Beda Fomm just ahead of the Italians, and established a roadblock. After a hard and narrowly won battle on 6 February, the Italians surrendered 25,000 men, 200 artillery guns, 100 tanks and 1,500 vehicles. During the course of this battle, the Western Desert Force was renamed as XIII Corps.
* In early 1941, after the British and Commonwealth victory in Cyrenaica, the military position was soon reversed. Wavell ordered a significant portion of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s XIII Corps to support Greece as part of Operation Lustre and the Germans initiated their Operation Sunflower (&quot;Unternehmen Sonnenblume&quot;). This was the deployment of the newly formed German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; (&quot;Deutsches Afrikakorps&quot;) as reinforcements to the Italians to prevent total collapse. The German corps included fresh troops with better equipment and a charismatic commander, General Erwin Rommel.
* Rommel quickly defeated the Allied forces at El Agheila on 24 March. He then launched an offensive which, by 15 April, had pushed the British back to the Egyptian border at Sollum, recapturing all of Libya except for Tobruk which was encircled and besieged with the front lines now stabilised at the Egyptian border.
* The Western Desert Force launched Operation Brevity in May 1941. This was an inconclusive attempt to secure more ground to launch the main effort to relieve Tobruk.
* Operation Battleaxe was launched in June. After the failure of Battleaxe, Wavell was replaced by Claude Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief Middle East and the British forces were reinforced with XXX Corps.
* The next offensive, Operation Crusader was planned for November 1941.

===Discontented South Africans===
Deployed at Matruh and responsible for constructing defensive positions, the division was still not considered ready for operations by the end of June having 90% of its allotted transport (many vehicles being those which had been used in the East Africa campaign) and 90% of its arms and equipment. Severe administrative problems, as well as organizational issues related to integration of the division into the Western Desert Force, caused discontent and eventually lead Gen. Brink to raise the issues with Field-Marshal Smuts and the Chief of SA General Staff when they visited Cairo in early July. Discussions indicated that Lt-Gen. Sir Alan Cunningham and Wavell were of the opinion that South Africa could not field two divisions for lack of resources. Smuts claimed that the manpower shortages were due to troops being retained for protection duties in East Africa and that a lack of shipping precluded the arrival of a further 3,000 men and he rejected the idea of reducing the South African forces into divisions of two brigade strength, as was recommended by Wavell. In addition, Brink continued to express his displeasure at the fact that the 1st Division was being utilised to construct defensive positions, instead of training in order to prepare for operations.
Differences between British and South African administration were becoming more pronounced (and so too were differences between the South Africans and other Commonwealth troops.) The insistence by the Australian government to retain the Australians in the theatre (at Tobruk at that stage) as a unified corps, caused manpower shortages in other areas in the Western Desert. Brink feared that the division would be split up and deployed piece-meal to fill these gaps, as had happened in East Africa. His insistence in this regard to Auchinleck further widened the gap between the South Africans and the Army commander. At the end of October, Brink advised XXX Corps that 1st Division would not be ready to participate in the preparatory exercise as a prelude to &quot;Crusader&quot; and that he required an additional 21 days for training. After consideration by Cunningham and Auchinleck, the division was permitted three days for training and was required to be available for the commencement of &quot;Crusader&quot; on 18 November, subject to Brink confirming that the division was ready for operations. Brink was faced with the dilemma of either committing untrained troops to battle, or holding back the division and having them replaced by the Indian Division which would invariably relegate the division to defensive duties and a significant loss of prestige to the South Africans. He declared the division &quot;ready&quot; and 1 SA Division was deployed for &quot;Operation Crusader&quot;.

===Sidi Rezeg: November 1941===
 This account only reflects the role of the 1st SA Infantry Division.

====Operational plan====
Following the costly failure of Operation Battleaxe, General Archibald Wavell was relieved as Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command and replaced by General Claude Auchinleck. The Western Desert Force was reorganised and renamed the Eighth Army under the command of Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham and at this stage, the division comprised only two brigades. The plan for Operation Crusader (See Map 2) was to engage the Afrika Korps with the 7th Armoured Division while the 1st SA Division and the 22 Guards Brigade covered their left flank. Meanwhile, on their right, XIII Corps, supported by 4th Armoured Brigade (detached from 7th Armoured Division), would make a clockwise flanking advance west of Sidi Omar and hold position threatening the rear of the line of Axis defensive strongpoints which ran east from Sidi Omar to the coast at Halfaya. Central to the plan was the destruction of the Axis armour by 7th Armoured Division to allow the relatively lightly armoured XIII Corps to advance north to Bardia along the coast while XXX Corps continued northwest to Tobruk and link up with a planned break-out by the 70th Division.

====Advance====
The division advance commenced at 0600 on 18 November with uneventful progress through the empty desert, save for two air attacks by Italian aircraft (&quot;Point 1 on Map 3&quot;). Having steadily advanced northwards, 1 SA Division was advised on 20 November to &quot;mask&quot; Bir el Gubi and to prevent interference from the Ariete Div into the flank of 7 Armoured Div (&quot;Point 2 on Map 3&quot;). El Gubi had now become a lesser objective after the capture of Sidi Rezeg and early morning on 21 November, the 21st and 15th Panzer had withdrawn to the north-west, not aware of the Allied advance to their south – creating the impression within the division, that the Axis forces had already been defeated.

By noon, 22 November, the Sidi Rezeg area was clear of Axis formations but by mid afternoon, German armour launched a violent attack on the area of the airfield. In this attack, 4th Armoured Brigade HQ had been destroyed (captured) and by nightfall, the SA 5th Brigade as well as the 6th New Zealand Brigade had been tasked to hurry in support of 7 Armoured Div at Sidi Rezeg (&quot;Advance 3 on Map 3&quot;), with the 5th SA Bde tasked to occupy Point 178, three miles south of Sidi Rezeg. 1st SA Bde was to disengage from the Ariete at Bir el Gubi and to advance in a night march, north in support of the 5th Brigade at Sidi Regez, being relieved by the 22nd Guards Brigade.

====Totensonntag====
By the 23rd, 5th Brigade had joined up with 7 Armoured Div, deploying straight from its advance into the centre of the armoured division area of deployment to the south of the airfield. The 1st SA Brigade was expected later the morning, from its night march from El Gubi. Unbeknownst to the division Rommel&#x27;s plan was to attack 7 Armoured Division in a frontal assault with the &quot;Afrikakorps&quot; and to launch an attack into the rear of 7th Armoured Division with the armoured Ariette Division. The 5th SA Brigade was caught in the middle of this armoured attack.

By late morning, the 15th Panzer had launched their attack with 150 tanks aimed to link up with the Ariette Division and panzers were cutting through the rear of 7th Armoured Division into the support B Echelons. 5th SA Brigade had most of their transport and supplies destroyed in this action, but did destroy a number of German tanks. After destroying significant logistical elements the 15th Panzer withdrew so as to by-pass the 7 Armoured Division / 5th SA Brigade positions and to engineer a link-up with the Ariette Division. They achieved this by 1235 and Gen Crüwell prepared for a decisive attack on the Allied armour. Advance elements of the 1st SA Brigade had now met elements of 5 Brigade, but the brigades never physically linked up.

By 1315 a major tank battle was underway between Axis forces and 7 Armoured Division. At 1555 1st SA Division were passing a signal to 5 SA Brigade when the brigade interjected &quot;wait...&quot; Those were the last words received from the 5th SA Infantry Brigade. Some units retained some form of unity and managed to escape east through the New Zealand and Indian fronts. Against the German tanks, the South African infantry had no real means of defence with limited Anti-Tank capabilities, they were compelled to use 25-pounders in a direct fire role. By the time the panzers had broken into the rear of the brigade, the artillery had been subdued and all anti-tank capabilities had been destroyed. By nightfall, all that remained of 5 SA Brigade was &quot;...little groups of disconsolate prisoners...between frequent flares and the light of burning ammunition.&quot;
&quot;The 5th SA Brigade had been caught by an overwhelming force in the open desert, quite unprepared and without inflicting any negligible damage on its opponents.&quot; The battle had resulted in a victory for the &quot;Afrikakorps&quot;, but the 7th Armoured and 1st South African Divisions had not been annihilated and the loss of the 5th SA Brigade was not enough to set off the loss of almost 50% of the &quot;Afrikakorps&quot; tanks which went into battle. At 0100 on 24 November, Brink reported to XXX Corps that 5th SA Brigade had &quot;ceased to exist as a fighting formation&quot;.

====Aftermath====

Having failed to link up with 5 SA Brigade, 1st Brigade withdrew south to Bir Taieb el Esem and commenced to establish a strong-point to effect its own defence. Between 24 and 26 November, elements of the 1st SA Brigade were deployed north east in attempts to support the New Zealand Division in their assault on Tobruk. Attempts to join up with the New Zealanders were repeatedly blocked (at one stage Gen Norrie himself lead a combat group from the SA Brigade) by Axis actions. On the 24th, 1st SA Brigade was attacked by the Ariete Armoured Division at Taib el Esem and were able to extricate themselves only after assistance from Gatehouse and the 4th Armoured Brigade.

The same day, Rommel committed himself to a &quot;dash for the wire&quot; with the intention of exploiting the disorganisation and confusion in the enemy&#x27;s bases and cutting their supply lines. The Germans attacked towards Egypt to relieve his garrisons at Bardia and Sollum. The advance came on a route that took the Afrikakorps in succession through the headquarters of XXX Corps, 7th Armoured Division, 1st SA Division, 7th Support Group and 7th Armoured Brigade. By 1145 General Norrie stated that the &quot;Matruh Stakes&quot; had officially started as 8th Army A and B Echelons hurriedly withdrew east (&quot;Point 5 Map 3&quot;). However, fighting continued at El Duda north west of Sidi Regez, with the South Africans being involved in fierce battles in &quot;Die Kessel&quot; of Sidi Regez on 29 and 30 November. But the pressure was too great and an eastward withdrawal was inevitable. Finally, the Afrikakorps stalled as it outran its supplies and met stiffening resistance. By early December, Rommel had withdrawn to a line of defences east of Tobruk at Gazala, and the division occupied defensive positions at Mersa Matruh.

After the Sidi Regez battles, the division brigades were deployed in various offensive and defensive roles from Mersa Matruh, of which the following are noteworthy:
* The Imperial Light Horse found an unprotected Axis tank repair depot on 9 December and their attack resulted in the destruction of 38 tanks (Five Mk IVs, 26 Mk IIIs and five Mk Is);
* On 18 December 2 company of the 3rd Recce Bn of the armoured car regiment in cooperation with the 4/11 Sikhs destroyed 12 Ju 52 transports on the ground and took 300 prisoners and captured five 88 mm AA guns when they attacked an airfield at Derna.

====Preparing defences at Gazala and change of command====

By New Year, the 5th Brigade was re-forming at Mersa Matruh and the 2nd Brigade was earmarked for deployment to Tobruk and the 1st Brigade was to be deployed on operations outside of the division structure. The question re-arose, as to whether South Africa was capable of maintaining the division in the field. By 8 January 1942, the division was 5,570 men under-strength of the approved establishment of 23,187. On 25 January the 1st Brigade was deployed to Tobruk, tasked to fight a delaying action with the 38th Indian Infantry Brigade against the Axis who had by now started a new advance from Msus.

Although it had been agreed that Tobruk would no longer be &quot;held at all costs&quot; in the event of an Axis attack, it formed a critical forward base to protect the Gazala Line from air, land or sea attack. Auchinleck recommended to Ritchie that the forthcoming battle was to be fought west of Tobruk, and not on the frontier. For this reason, 2nd Brigade was also moved forward to support the 1st. By 10 February, the Gazala defences were organised on a two division basis, with the left (southern) sector occupied by the 4th Indian Division and the 1st SA Division taking responsibility for the right sector, reaching down to the sea. On 10 March, Brink injured his back and was evacuated back to South Africa he was replaced by Dan Pienaar from the 1st Brigade, who had now been promoted to Maj-General.

On 26 May 1942, in his Order of the Day, Gen Pienaar warned the division (now, for the first time deployed with all three brigades under Division command) of an impending attack – directly aimed at their front.

===Gazala: May 1942===
 This account only reflects the role of the 1st SA Infantry Division.

====&quot;The Cauldron&quot;====

Rommel&#x27;s advance, containing at least 10,000 vehicles was headed south, to make a long sweeping right-hook around the southern end of the Allied line. The Afrika Korps diary speaks of a bright moonlit night where they advanced without having any contact with the enemy. However the 4th SA Armoured Car Regiment had been tracking their advance and reporting the progress three to four times per hour. The following morning, the German—Italian forces made contact with the 7th Armoured Division, east of Bir Hakeim where General Messervy of the 7th Armoured Division was taken prisoner. 7th Armoured as well as the Free French at Bir Hakeim held up the advance but by late morning, Axis forces had advanced well behind the southern flank and were now heading north behind the Allied lines. The 90th Light captured and held El Adem. With Allied forces now recovering and re-deploying into better assault positions, the Axis forces were caught in an area known as &quot;The Cauldron&quot; between Bir Hakeim to the south, Tobruk to the north east and the Allied minefields between the Axis and their supply lines to the west. Three days armoured fighting ensued in the area of the Cauldron. To better secure his positions, Rommel then drove two Italian formations directly west, through the Allied minefields to re-establish his supply channels. All this time, opposite the 1st SA Division positions to the north of the Gazala Line, the German 15th Rifle Brigade (&quot;Brigade Stab zbv (mot) 15&quot;), and the Italian Sabratha and Trento Divisions remained quiet.

By 12 June, the remaining Free French had been forced to withdraw from Bir Hakeim. At Bir el Hatmat, Rommel had dispersed the tactical HQs of the two British Divisions as well as the HQs of the 9th and 10th Indian Infantry Brigades and other smaller units and the 22nd Armoured Brigade had been forced from the battlefield by renewed attacks from 15th Panzer. In &quot;The Cauldron&quot;, three Indian infantry battalions, a reconnaissance regiment and four artillery regiments had been virtually destroyed. On the day before, Axis forces had pushed towards El Adem and had forced the 201st Guards Brigade to withdraw from the Knightsbridge Box on the Gazala Line back to the Tobruk perimeter. On the 14th, Auchinlek authorised Ritchie to withdraw from the Gazala line and the 1st SA and the 50th Northumbrian Divisions were ordered to withdraw along the coastal road back towards Tobruk.

====Retreat====
While the 1st SA and 50th Divisions were preparing for their withdrawal on the Via Balbia, Axis forces were wreaking havoc on the escarpment amongst Allied forces and Rommel dictated his 170mm guns to open fire from the escarpment down onto the Via Balbia as the South Africans and British were destroying their ammunition dumps in the Gazala Line Rommel tasked 15th and 21st Panzer with breaking north and severing the Via Balbia close to Elwet et Tamar, cutting off the two Divisions to the west. With the road being unable to accommodate two divisions, elements of the 50th Division broke out in a south westerly direction in a wide sweep eventually turning back east towards the Allied lines. The South Africans withdrew to series of defensive boxes at Williams Post, Best Post, &quot;Point 187,&quot; Commonwealth Keep and then Acroma. The 21st and 15th Panzer attacks forced the 1st SA Division to fight a rearguard action and to withdraw through each of the respective boxes well into the night. Chased by Axis tanks, driving east on the Via Balbia, the first elements reached Tobruk during the night of 13/14 June. The division was now spread out between the original Gazala defences and Tobruk, as each element tried to make their way east.

====Gazala Gallop====
By 1400 on 15 June, 1st SA Division and elements of the 50th Northumbian Division were close to Gambut, headed towards the Egypt frontier. At the same time, Ritchie had ordered the balance of Eighth Army to withdraw to the defensive positions at Mersa Matruh, some 100 miles east of the frontier, leaving Tobruk to hold out and threaten the Axis lines of communication in much the same way as in 1941 This became known as the Gazala Gallop. At dawn on 21 June, the Tobruk Garrison surrendered to the Axis forces. On the same day, 1st SA Division were ordered to withdraw a further 220 miles east, to El Alamein.

===First Battle of El Alamein: July 1942===
Having arrived back from the Gazala Line, the division spent two weeks improving defences on the El Alamein defences in the &quot;Alamein Box&quot;. Auchenlik had issued an order instructing all surplus personnel to be sent back to the Delta, which greatly displeased Pienaar. The division had been deploying two brigades of infantry, each accompanied by a battery of artillery to protect the areas west and south of the defensive box. Auchinlecks order effectively meant that Pienaar could only hold the box with one under-strength brigade Before these troops could be returned, battle was joined with the 90th Light Infantry Division in the early morning hours of 1 July.

At 0605 Axis transports were seen advancing to within 2,000 yards of the 3rd Brigade positions and they were engaged with machine and anti-tank gun fire from the Imperial Light Horse. During the early morning hours, the 90th Light had lost direction and veered too far north, resulting in the clash with ILH. While the Rand Light Infantry were driving off German towed artillery, South African Air Force Boston light bombers bombed their supply columns. By 0730 the 90th Light had been halted and were pinned down by the South Africans, determined to avenge Gazala and the surrender of Tobruk. The 90th Light only managing to extricate themselves under cover of a dust storm later in the day. The Axis attack had been stopped all along the Allied line of defence.

====Cracks Widen====
Cracks and fissures had again become visible between the 1st SA Div and the Army command. 1st SA Brigade had been deployed on the flank, on Ruweisat Ridge and by this time they had become somewhat isolated during the previous days fighting and the Allied bombing missions of the previous night. The Brigade had lost its Officer Commanding as well as its Brigade Major during the previous two days fighting and over 15,000 shells had fallen on their strongpoint, known as &quot;Hotbox,&quot; from the area of the Trieste Division. Pienaar advised Norrie that their position was &quot;untenable&quot; and Norrie replied that if that was the case, he would &quot;... relieve the Brigade, place it in reserve and replace it with another formation.&quot; Offended by this Pienaar called 8th Army HQ and was advised by Dorman-Smith that the Brigade was to remain where it was. Not satisfied, Pienaar insisted on speaking to Auchinleck, who ordered that the Brigade hold its ground – but offered to relieve the Brigade within two days when the 9th Australian Division reached El Alamein. Pienaar&#x27;s demands of the evening of 2 July shook the 8th Army command&#x27;s confidence in the morale of the division and Auchinleck stated that the division could no longer be exposed to &quot;undue operational strain,&quot; fearing that material losses to the division, especially after the surrender of the 2nd SA Division at Tobruk, would lead to political disaster. Auchinleck deployed the 9th Australian Division to re-enforce the northern sector of the line held by the South Africans three days later. Pienaar had also been falsely accused of supporting the retreat to the Delta and engaging the Axis from behind the Suez Canal – he remained resolved to fight, stating to an American war correspondent at Alam Halfa in July 1942 &quot;...Here I stop, I&#x27;ve retreated far enough, whether we hold the damn thing or not!&quot;

===Alam Halfa: August 1942===

Rommel launched one more assault on 31 August, aimed at Alam el Halfa ridge. The division responded by launching a number of successful raids at the enemy forces after last light, once they had stopped their advance for the night on 31 August. By noon on 1 September, 15th Panzer were immobilised by lack of fuel south of Alam Halfa. Pienaar re-organised the division to occupy the positions with one brigade and released two brigades as part of &quot;battle groups&quot; to act against the immobilised Axis division. The report that these forces were available was not welcomed at Corps and Army headquarters, and these mobile formations were not used. After the counter-attack was eventually organised, the Axis had already started to withdraw and fighting was broken off on 7 September.

===Second Battle of El Alamein: October 1942===

====Battle plan====
For what was to become the final South African assault on the Axis forces (&quot;Operation Lightfoot&quot;), the division was tasked attack on a two-brigade front to secure the southern end of Mieiriya Ridge. The Indian 4th and Northumbrian 50th Divisions were deployed to their south and to the north, was the 2nd New Zealand Division. The South Africans were to attack towards the south west with 2nd SA Infantry Brigade (Brig. W.H.E. Poole) on the right and 3rd SA Infantry Brigade (Brig. R. Palmer) on the left. 1st SA Infantry Brigade was deployed further south and was responsible for creating an anti-tank screen to protect the left flank of the South African attack (See Map 4). The Australians and Highlanders were to force a northern corridor through the Axis minefields while the New Zealanders and South Africans were to do the same in the southern sector.

====Break-In: Operation Lightfoot====
Operation Lightfoot started at 2140 on 23 October with a five-hour fire plan, the start of which signified H-Hour for the infantry assault. Pienaar had deployed each of the lead brigades, with on battalion leading for the first phase to the &quot;red line&quot; after a pause of an hour and a quarter, the two trailing battalions would pass through to the final objective on Miteiriya Ridge. 1st Brigade who was not part of the main advance was provided with a special force of armoured cars, machine guns and anti-tank guns to guard their and the division&#x27;s left flank (Refer Map 4). They were also allocated a mobile element of the 8th Royal Tanks. The divisional artillery, reinforced by three troops from X Corps was to fire a fire-plan of timed concentrations – using smoke on the intermediate and final objectives to cover re-organisation and to help with direction finding.

The two South African brigades advanced with 40mm Bofors guns marking the lines of advance between the respective battalions and the first objectives on the Corps objective line called &quot;Oxalic&quot; were occupied by the Natal Mounted Rifles at 2350. The Cape Town Highlanders were the last battalion to reach their individual unit objectives on Oxalic – and were established on Miteiriya Ridge by 0800 the following morning. The fact that the 1st and 10th Armoured Divisions had not broken through into the open areas west of the line as originally planned, meant that Montgomery had to change his orders – moving to an attritional World War I type of battle, which Montgomery in a semblance of a novelty – dubbed &quot;Crumbling Actions.&quot; By the evening of 26 October (as from the H-Hour on the 23rd), the South Africans had suffered 600 casualties, as compared to 2,000 in the 51st Division, 1,000 Australians and a similar number of New Zealanders.

====&quot;Crumbling Operations&quot;====

During the night of 25/26 October, some South African and other elements which had not yet established themselves on their exact Oxalic objectives, made corrective moves and by dawn the entire XXX Corps was finally in their initial phase objectives. The Australians and the 1st Armoured Division had launched attacks in the north, being the start of the &quot;crumbling&quot; process, while at the same time, there was much re-organisation and re-deployment to the south. On 26 October Leese issued orders for the 1st SA Division to &quot;side-step&quot; north in conjunction with a similar move by the 4th Indian Division and to extend their lines to occupy the area held by the New Zealand Division and the 9th Armoured Brigade. Once this move was completed, these relieved units were to be withdrawn into reserve. During the order group to issue these instructions, Pienaar again voiced an objection to orders – on the grounds that he had insufficient transport to make the move in the required time. Freyberg, in a move to &quot;spike his guns&quot; asked Pienaar again, if the only limiting factor was transport? Pienaar confirmed – and when Freyberg offered him transport from the New Zealand Division, no more was heard of the matter and the re-deployment was executed. The South Africans were now stretched on a wider front, between the Australians and 51st Division in the north and the Indian 4th Division on Ruweisat Ridge, with 5th SA Brigade on the right, 3rd SA Brigade on its left and 1st SA Brigade being pulled back as the divisional reserve.

====Break-Out: Operation Supercharge====
On the night of 2/3 November, the Australians noticed signs of withdrawal by Axis units in the coastal salient and by 1000 Montgomery had received similar reports from the south. Contrary to Hitler&#x27;s instructions – Rommel had started to withdraw. The final plan to destroy the Axis forces, code named &quot;Supercharge&quot; was put into action. The 1st SA Division played no role in this phase of the operation – but the South African armoured cars attached to XXX Corps were actively involved in the attempted destruction and subsequent pursuit.

At 0540 on 4 November, after repeated attempts at breaking through the Axis lines – Lt-Col Reeves-Moore lead the South African armoured cars into the rear of the Axis positions, &quot;...the eager children of any mechanized pursuit... scampered at dawn into the open desert beyond the mines and trenches and guns, to make their exuberant mischief amid the disintegrating enemy&quot;. They soon started causing the havoc for which they had been intended – A Sqn capturing two 88mm guns, two 105 mm guns, two 110mm guns, a Breda portee, six trucks and 130 prisoners; while B Sqn captured five trucks, a staff car, one 105 mm and one 150 mm gun and 100 prisoners within a matter of hours.

While the armoured cars were dashing west, the 1st SA Division had moved further north and over the previous two nights had relieved the 51st Highland Division. During the night of 3/4 November, the last unit to move into its new position was the 1st Cape Town Highlanders, who moved during a major artillery barrage in support of an attack by the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade. The regiment awoke on 4 November to silence and the absence of gunfire, save for the sound of Allied vehicles advancing west in pursuit of the retreating enemy. For the 1st South African Division, the war had ended.

==Disbandment==

The Union Defence Force had finalised a decision to convert the 1st SA Infantry Division into an Armoured Division and the Axis withdrawal from El Alamein marked the end of fighting for the division in the Middle East. By 1 December, advance parties were already returning to South Africa to assist with the establishment of the intended armoured division and later in the month, General Dan Pienaar was recalled to South Africa to lead the formation of the new division. He and eleven other officers boarded a Lockheed Lodestar on 17 December to fly back to South Africa. The aircraft stopped to re-fuel at Kisumu on the shores of Lake Victoria and on takeoff on 19 December, it plunged into the lake, killing all on board.

On 1 January 1943, the 1st SA Infantry Division embarked for home, with troops returning to their parent units in South Africa. The division had been dissolved and many of its former units were to be absorbed into the 6th South African Armoured Division. The designation 1st South African Infantry Division was also used briefly by a successor formation in 1948–49.

<text>The Borough of Eastleigh is a local government district with borough status in Hampshire, England. It is named after its main town of Eastleigh, where the council is based. The borough also contains the town of Hedge End along with several villages, many of which form part of the South Hampshire urban area.

The neighbouring districts are Fareham, Winchester, Test Valley, Southampton and (across Southampton Water) New Forest. Water bounds much of the borough, with Southampton Water and the River Hamble bordering the east and southwest of the district. The borough lies within the Hampshire Basin.

The original Eastleigh borough was formed in 1936 following the incorporation of the former Eastleigh Urban District Council. The borough as it is today was formed in 1974, when the existing Borough of Eastleigh expanded to include part of the former Winchester Rural District as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. The borough&#x27;s Latin motto, &quot;Salus populi suprema lex&quot; translates as &quot;The Welfare of the People is the most important Law&quot;.

The borough is served by two motorways and seven railway stations as well as an international airport. There is also a ferry linking Hamble-le-Rice in Eastleigh to Warsash in Fareham, and a disused canal running through the north of the borough.

There are eight scheduled monuments and around 180 listed buildings in the borough, with Netley Abbey, Bursledon Windmill, the chapel of Netley Hospital, and Netley Castle among them. The borough also contains eight conservation areas and around 20,000 trees protected by tree preservation orders.

==History==

The borough&#x27;s origins begin with the formation of an ecclesiastical parish covering the hamlets of Eastley and Barton in 1868, in an area which was beginning to be developed around Bishopstoke railway station which had opened in 1839 to serve the older village of Bishopstoke a mile to the east. Author Charlotte Mary Yonge, a resident of Otterbourne, donated £500 (£ at 2025 values) towards the cost of building a parish church and in return was asked which of the two villages to name the parish after; she chose Eastley, but also chose to alter the spelling to Eastleigh as she considered this more modern. The parish grew rapidly: it had a population of 515 in 1871, over 1,000 in 1881 and 3,613 in 1891.

Despite the creation of the ecclesiastical parish, Eastleigh remained part of the civil parish of South Stoneham. In order to facilitate the creation of pavements with kerbs, drains and sewers, and street lights, a local government district covering the ecclesiastical parish of Eastleigh was established in 1893, governed by a local board. Such districts were converted into urban districts in 1894, when Eastleigh was also made its own civil parish. Eastleigh Urban District was enlarged to take in the community of Bishopstoke in 1899, becoming the Eastleigh and Bishopstoke Urban District. The name was changed back to just Eastleigh in 1932.

The first Eastleigh Borough was incorporated in 1936 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1882. This conversion from Eastleigh Urban District Council to Eastleigh Borough Council allowed the authority to create byelaws and appoint a mayor. Notice of the petition for incorporation was served on the 1 February 1936, and the matter being raised for consideration on 16 March, along with petitions for the creation of boroughs for Crosby and Sale in North West England, among others.

The modern borough was created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the former borough plus seven parishes from the Winchester Rural District, being Botley, Bursledon, Fair Oak, Hamble, Hedge End, Hound and West End. Eastleigh&#x27;s borough status passed to the enlarged district from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Eastleigh&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1936.

In 2006, the borough was ranked the ninth best place to live in the UK by a Channel 4 programme.

==Governance==
Eastleigh Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. The whole borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

The council has a strong tradition of attending to environmental matters and in 2008 was named a beacon council under the theme &quot;Tackling Climate Change&quot;.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 1994.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Eastleigh. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1976 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in May 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2018 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with roughly a third of the council being elected each time for a four year term of office. Hampshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

Most of the borough is covered by the Eastleigh parliamentary constituency, represented by Liz Jarvis of the Liberal Democrats. The remaining wards, which cover Chandler&#x27;s Ford and Hiltingbury, belong to the Winchester constituency, represented by Danny Chambers of the Liberal Democrats.

===Premises===

The council has its main offices at Eastleigh House on Upper Market Street in Eastleigh. The building does not have a council chamber and so full council meetings are held in various locations, including The Point, a theatre which is the former town hall that was built in 1899 for the old Eastleigh and Bishopstoke Urban District Council. It remained the town hall until 1974 when new offices were built at the junction of Leigh Road and Villeneuve St Georges Way.

Between 1974 and 2014 the council was based at Civic Offices on Leigh Road, before moving to Eastleigh House, an existing office building in the town centre which was refurbished and extended to become the council&#x27;s main offices.

==Geography==

The southern part of the borough is bounded on the east by the River Hamble (separating it from Fareham) and on the west by Southampton Water (separating it from the New Forest). The Hamble flows into Southampton Water at Hamble-le-Rice, thus accounting for the borough&#x27;s southern boundary. Further north, the borough borders Southampton to the west and the City of Winchester district to the north. As well as Southampton Water and the River Hamble, a number of watercourses flow through Eastleigh, including the River Itchen, Monks Brook and the Itchen Navigation.

The largest settlement in the borough is the town of Eastleigh itself, with a continuous urban area which now includes Chandler&#x27;s Ford, Bishopstoke and Boyatt Wood. The only other settlement in the borough with town status is Hedge End. Due to the urban nature of Southampton and the town of Eastleigh, the western side of the borough is generally more built up than the east. There are three country parks in the borough, Itchen Valley in West End and Lakeside, located just to the south of the town of Eastleigh, are managed by the borough council while Royal Victoria Country Park is managed by Hampshire County Council.

The borough is within the Hampshire Basin, with an underlying geology of mainly Cretaceous chalk.

Soil in the borough is principally of poor to moderate agricultural quality although high grade land is present in pockets. The south of the borough has acid soils and gravels, but poorly drained clays predominate in the north. Most of the borough is covered by a series of clays and marls, with sandy and lignitic beds, part of the Bracklesham Group of beds. As well as clay soils, the Bracklesham Beds result in some bands of sandy soil to the north of West End, and podzol soils around the M27 motorway west of Hedge End and on small areas of the gravels on top of the beds themselves. However most of the soil over the beds is more fertile brown earth.

In the north of the borough, small pockets of valley gravels, London clay, Brickearth and Alluvium can be found, although these have mainly been built over with the exception of the Alluvium, which forms peaty soils around the floodplain of the River Itchen.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the UK, Eastleigh experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). The nearest weather station to the Borough is in Southampton, which has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at since 1976.


==Demography==
In the 2021 census, Eastleigh had a population of 136,443 people consisting of 66,700 males (48.9%) and 69,743 females (51.1%). The borough is much more densely populated than South East England and England as a whole, with a population density of 1,712.1 people per square km (South East England and England have population densities of 486.5 and 433.5 people per square km, respectively). 45.7% of Eastleigh&#x27;s population state their religion as Christian, which is a significant decrease from 61.9% in 2011. 45.0% stated they had no religion (up from 28.5% in 2011) and 5.6% did not state a religion; the most popular non-Christian religions in the borough were Islam (1%), Hinduism (1%) and Sikhism (0.7%). The census also indicates that the residents of Eastleigh are generally in better health than those in England as a whole.

==Economy==

Historically, the economy of the area has strong links with the transport industry. The proximity of substantial waterways made shipbuilding a major industry in the south of the borough, and today the pleasure boat industry still dominates the area around Hamble-le-Rice and Bursledon, made famous by the television drama series on the subject, &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, which was filmed in the area. The borough is also strongly linked with the Spitfire, the first test flights of which took place from Southampton Airport in Eastleigh. Eastleigh was once the heart of the London and South Western Railway, with the Eastleigh Works building most of the company&#x27;s engines. At present, the works maintains South Western Railway and CrossCountry trains. The works building is now home to Arlington Fleet Services, which provides a multitude of train maintenance services. Finally, Network Rail has a yard here, from which it carries out track maintenance.

The economy of the borough today is dominated by the retail sector, which accounts for around 33 per cent of the jobs in the borough, and this proportion is rising. As well as the large Swan Centre, a shopping centre in the town of Eastleigh, there is a large out-of-town retail development near Hedge End which includes flagship stores for Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury&#x27;s among others. Eastleigh also has proportionately more manufacturing and construction jobs than the nation, but the number of jobs in these sectors is declining in the borough.

The B&amp;Q head office is in the Portswood House in Eastleigh, Eastleigh borough.

==Landmarks==

There are eight scheduled ancient monuments in Eastleigh, around 180 listed buildings (9 of which are Grade II* listed, the remainder are Grade II) and over 800 tree preservation orders covering 20,000 trees across 5,000 properties. The council also maintains a &quot;local list&quot; of buildings which are of local importance but do not meet English Heritage&#x27;s listing criteria.

The area around Netley is particularly rich in notable historic landmarks, with Netley Abbey, Netley Castle and Netley Hospital all nearby. The borough also boasts Hampshire&#x27;s only functioning windmill, Bursledon Windmill, and eight conservation areas.

==Transport==

The M3 motorway runs through the north-west of the borough, providing a direct road route to London, and the midlands and north of England via the A34 road which joins the M3 just north of Winchester. The M27 motorway also runs through much of the borough, linking Eastleigh to the rest of the south coast.

There are seven railway stations in the borough, served by the South West Main Line, the Eastleigh to Romsey Line, the Eastleigh to Fareham Line, the West Coastway Line and the Cross Country Route. Passenger train operators serving the Eastleigh stations are South Western Railway, CrossCountry and Southern.

Southampton Airport is located in the north west of the borough, just south of the town of Eastleigh itself. The airport is the 20th largest in the United Kingdom and flights operate from there to destinations throughout the British Isles (including the Channel Islands) and some destinations in western continental Europe.

Local bus services in Eastleigh are operated by Bluestar. Stagecoach South also operate some services. National coach operators such as National Express tend not to serve Eastleigh due to the close proximity of Southampton and Winchester to the borough. Megabus does serve Southampton Airport Parkway, on a limited timetable.

The disused Itchen Navigation runs through the north of the borough, and in the south, Hamble is served by the Hamble-Warsash Ferry.

==Education==

The local education authority for Eastleigh is Hampshire County Council, which lists 40 schools in the borough. In addition, there are two further education colleges in the town of Eastleigh, and a number of private schools such as the Gregg School in Chartwell Green and King&#x27;s School in Fair Oak.

==International relationships==
The Borough of Eastleigh is twinned with:
*Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, France
*Kornwestheim, Germany
has a friendship alliance with:
*Kimry, Russia
and has one Sister City:
*Temple Terrace, Florida, United States

Eastleigh was awarded the European Flag of Honour in 1983 to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Borough&#x27;s twinning with Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. The flag, which is awarded to local authorities which promote pan-Europe relationships, was presented to the council by a European Commission representative on 18 June 1983.

<text>The Johnstown Flood National Memorial is a unit of the United States National Park Service in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Established in 1964 through legislation signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, it pays tribute to the thousands of victims of the Johnstown Flood, who were injured or killed on May 31, 1889 when the South Fork Dam ruptured.

==History==

===History of the Johnstown Flood===
Founded in 1800, Johnstown was a steel town that grew from the development of the Pennsylvania Railroad and other transportation services in Cambria County. By 1889, the town had a population of thirty thousand people who were of mostly German and Welsh ancestry. Established in the center of a narrow floodplain between Little Conemaugh and Stony Creek rivers, the community was surrounded, during the latter part of the nineteenth century, by land that had been altered by deforestation and the leveling of hills. These factors contributed to periodic floods, as did the narrow river valleys.

In 1836, the South Fork dam was built to create a reservoir (later named Conemaugh Lake) for the Pennsylvania Canal&#x27;s western division. Measuring eight hundred and fifty feet at its breast section, the dam was made of earth and stone. It was reported to be the largest dam of its type in the world at the time of its construction. Subsequently abandoned by the canal system, it was purchased by private owners, including a former congressman.

Ultimately it was purchased by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive recreational group composed of wealthy individuals from the Pittsburgh region, for use as a summer mountain retreat. The club paid for repairs to the dam and additional development: a main building and &quot;cottages&quot; to transform the area into a boating and fishing resort community.

On May 31, 1889, the South Fork dam broke from the weight of combined heavy rains and a sudden freshet that had caused a significantly higher amount of water to accumulate in its reservoir than normal. The dam&#x27;s rupture released twenty million tons of water, which traveled at forty miles per hour, creating a seventy-foot-high wall of water that was propelled fourteen miles downward into the Little Conemaugh River Valley, where it flooded Johnstown. Property, industry, homes, farms, and lives were destroyed as the water, debris, oil, and bodies of flood victims were caught in the arches of a Pennsylvania Railroad-owned stone bridge. Eighty of the trapped people subsequently died in a related fire.

Although the flood lasted for only ten minutes, the catastrophic damage it caused required five years of cleanup and rebuilding to enable residents of Johnstown to recover. In addition to the thousands of initial injuries and lives lost, the community was affected by an outbreak of typhoid fever, which developed from bacteria-tainted flood waters and lack of sanitation. Forty more people died.

Surviving residents were treated and cared for by relief corps from several cities in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The federal government and foreign countries also responded with more than $3.7 million in money, food, and clothing for the town. Clara Barton and the Red Cross also responded with substantial aid.

Just sixteen when the flood happened, survivor Victor Heiser years later recollected that time during a recording of his oral history. He remembered people living in the area near the dam often saying beforehand, &quot;That dam will give way, but it won&#x27;t ever happen to us.&quot; He said that when the flood hit, it was like a &quot;huge wall&quot; coming down the street. The longest-living survivor of the flood, Frank Shomo, died March 20, 1997, at the age of one hundred and eight.

===History of the memorial===
As a result of legislation proposed by U.S. Congressman John P. Saylor (R-PA), H.R. 931, which was supported by the Blair County Historical Society and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, creation of this memorial was approved by the United States Congress on August 31, 1964. Signed into law by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 2, 1964, the Johnstown Flood National Memorial was officially established.

It was to preserve the remains of the South Fork Dam. This had been found to be structurally lacking at the time of its rupture during the Johnstown Flood on May 31, 1889. Also conserved by this legislation were the former Lake Conemaugh bed, along with the nearby farm of Elias Unger and the clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which had owned the dam and reservoir. The associated land is treated as a park.

The memorial is presently located at 733 Lake Road near South Fork, Pennsylvania, about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

The clubhouse and several associated buildings have since been designated as part of a National Historic Landmark District, established in 1986 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are significant not only for the role of the club in the flood, but as an example of elite recreational clubs in the late nineteenth century, and the architecture of the time.

==Park features==
The visitor center at this national memorial offers two floors of exhibits with maps, views of the former dam, tactile displays, historic photographs of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, a reproduction morgue book, the oral history of flood survivor Victor Heiser, and the film, &quot;Black Friday.&quot; Visitors may go to s the Unger House and the Springhouse.

Visitors to the national memorial may also explore the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Clubhouse, which was acquired by the park in 2006, and the Lake View Visitor Center. Ranger-interpreted and van-guided tours are also both available.

Hiking trails connect various parts of the memorial, and picnicking areas are also present throughout.

==Lakebed Rehabilitation Project==
In January 2020, the Lakebed Rehabilitation Project began at the Johnston Flood National Memorial. The project&#x27;s goal was to restore the view of how the lakebed looked before the breakage of the dam in 1889. Vegetation has grown in the area so the National Park Service Wildland Fire and Aviation staff cleared it using a masticator machine. This caused problems however as there are many places that both man and machine cannot clear with safety. An organization named Allegheny Goatscape from Pittsburgh used their services of 12 goats and a donkey to provide assistance in clearing the area. The herd is able to eat an approximate of an acre of vegetation every two weeks. Another organization named Russell Tree Experts from Ohio also assisted in mechanical clearing of the lakebed. This clearing project is expected to continue till the summer of 2021.

<text>The Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Tempe, Arizona. It is seen as a front group for the fossil fuel industry, and as promoting climate change denial. The Center produces a weekly online newsletter called &quot;CO2Science&quot;.

The Center was founded and is run by Craig D. Idso, along with Sherwood B. Idso, his father, and Keith E. Idso, his brother. They came from backgrounds in agriculture and climate. According to the Idsos, they became involved in the global warming controversy through their study of Earth&#x27;s temperature sensitivity to radiative perturbations and plant responses to elevated CO2 levels and carbon sequestration. The Center sharply disputes the scientific consensus on climate change shown in IPCC assessment reports, and believes that global warming will be beneficial to mankind.

== Funding ==
According to IRS records, the ExxonMobil Foundation provided a grant of $15,000 to the center in 2000. Another report states that ExxonMobil has funded an additional $55,000 to the center. ExxonMobil stated it funded, &quot;organizations which research significant policy issues and promote informed discussion on issues of direct relevance to the company. [...] These organizations do not speak on our behalf, nor do we control their views and messages.&quot;

The center was also funded by Peabody Energy, America’s biggest coalmining company.
== Reception ==

A December 2009 article in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine said the Center was a promoter of climate disinformation, from a family prominent in promoting climate change denial.

<text>The Borough of Fareham is a local government district with borough status in Hampshire, England. Its council is based in Fareham. Other places within the borough include Portchester, Hill Head, Sarisbury, Stubbington, Titchfield and Warsash. The borough covers much of the semi-urban area between the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth, and is part of the South Hampshire conurbation. The neighbouring districts are Eastleigh, Winchester, Portsmouth and Gosport. The district&#x27;s southern boundary is the coast of the Solent.

==History==
The town of Fareham was governed by a local board of health from 1849. Such local boards were reconstituted as urban district councils in 1894. The parish and urban district of Fareham was significantly enlarged in 1932 when the neighbouring parishes of Crofton, Hook with Warsash, Portchester, Sarisbury and Titchfield were abolished.

Fareham Urban District was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The reformed district was awarded borough status at the same time, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Fareham Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Fareham. Political leadership is provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1995 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Offices on Civic Way in the centre of Fareham. The building was purpose-built for the council, being completed in 1975.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2024 the council has comprised 32 councillors representing 16 wards, with each ward electing two councillors. Elections are held in alternate years, with half the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time to serve a four-year term of office.

<doc id="500399" wikidata="Q894086" url="?curid=500399" title="Borough of Guildford">
<text>The Borough of Guildford is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. With around half of the borough&#x27;s population, Guildford is its largest settlement and only town, and is where the council is based.

The borough includes part of the Surrey Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The neighbouring districts are Surrey Heath, Woking, Elmbridge, Reigate and Banstead, Waverley and Rushmoor.

==History==
The town of Guildford was an ancient borough, with its first known charter dating from 1257. It was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised the way many boroughs operated across the country. The borough boundaries were enlarged several times, notably in 1836, 1933 and 1954.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Guildford Municipal Borough
*Guildford Rural District
Guildford&#x27;s borough status transferred to the new district from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Guildford&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to at least the fifteenth century.

==Governance==
Guildford Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. Parts of the borough are covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

The council owns significant heritage assets that include monuments such as Guildford Castle, as well museums, art collections and civic regalia.

The council has shared a chief executive with neighbouring Waverley Borough Council since 2021.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2023 election.

Political control of the old municipal borough council from 1836 to 1974 was as follows:
Political control of the modern borough council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:
===Leadership===

The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Guildford. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

=== Elections ===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

====Members of Parliament====

The borough straddles four parliamentary constituencies:
===Premises===

The council is based at Millmead House on Millmead in Guildford. The original house dates from the late seventeenth century, with extensive modern additions to the rear. Prior to the local government reorganisation of 1974, the building had been the headquarters of Guildford Rural District Council. The council&#x27;s annual meeting when new mayors are appointed each May is held at Guildford Guildhall.

==Demography==
Guildford has the second largest population of Surrey&#x27;s eleven districts (based on census statistics, only 600 residents behind Reigate and Banstead). Approximately half of the borough&#x27;s population live in the town of Guildford.

==Parishes==
The central part of the borough, corresponding to the pre-1974 borough and covering the majority of the Guildford built-up area, is an unparished area. This area includes Bellfields, Boxgrove, Onslow Village, Park Barn, Stoughton, Westborough, and the (former) villages of Burpham, and Merrow.

The rest of the borough is covered by civil parishes:

In the Portuguese language, &quot;Ademar&quot; is the current spelling, &quot;Adhemar&quot; being an archaic version of the name.

<text>The expression &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; (or &quot;the elephant in the living room&quot;) is a metaphorical idiom in English for an important or enormous topic, question, or controversial issue that is obvious or that everyone knows about but no one mentions or wants to discuss because it makes at least some of them uncomfortable and is personally, socially, or politically embarrassing, controversial, inflammatory, or dangerous. The metaphorical elephant represents an obvious problem or difficult situation that people do not want to talk about.

It is based on the idea and thought that something as conspicuous as an elephant can appear to be overlooked in codified social interactions and that the sociology and psychology of repression also operates on the macro scale.

Various languages around the world have words that describe similar concepts.

==Origins==
In 1814, Ivan Krylov (17691844), poet and fabulist, wrote a fable entitled &quot;The Inquisitive Man&quot;, which tells of a man who goes to a museum and notices all sorts of tiny things, but fails to notice an elephant. The phrase became proverbial. Fyodor Dostoevsky in his novel &quot;Demons&quot; wrote, &quot;Belinsky was just like Krylov&#x27;s Inquisitive Man, who didn&#x27;t notice the elephant in the museum...&quot;

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the first recorded use of the phrase, as a simile, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 20 June 1959: &quot;Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room. It&#x27;s so big you just can&#x27;t ignore it.&quot; According to the website the Phrase Finder, the first known use in print is from 1952.

This idiomatic expression may have been in general use much earlier than 1959. For example, the phrase appears 44 years earlier in the pages of the British &quot;Journal of Education&quot; in 1915. The sentence was presented as a trivial illustration of a question British schoolboys would be able to answer, e.g., &quot;Is there an elephant in the class-room?&quot;

The first widely disseminated conceptual reference was a story written by Mark Twain in 1882, &quot;The Stolen White Elephant&quot;, which recounts the inept, far-ranging activities of detectives trying to find an elephant that was right on the spot after all. This story, combined with Dostoyevsky&#x27;s white bear, may have been on Jerome Frank&#x27;s mind when he wrote in his dissent in &quot;United States v. Antonelli Fireworks&quot; (1946) and again in dissent in &quot;United States v. Leviton&quot; (1951) of &quot;the Mark Twain story of the little boy who was told to stand in a corner and not to think of a white elephant.&quot;

The phrase may also be a response to philosopher Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s 1929 description of the validity of immediate experience: &quot;Sometimes we see an elephant, and sometimes we do not. The result is that an elephant, when present, is noticed.&quot;

In 1935, comedian Jimmy Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose Broadway musical &quot;Jumbo&quot;, in which a police officer stops him as he leads a live elephant and asks, &quot;What are you doing with that elephant?&quot; Durante&#x27;s reply, &quot;What elephant?&quot; was a regular show-stopper. Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play, &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot;.

==Usage==
The term refers to a question, problem, solution, or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation, but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment, sadness, or arguments, or is simply taboo. The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly, or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself.

The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social taboo or which generates disagreement, such as race, religion, politics, homosexuality, mental illness, or suicide. It is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged, and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided.

The idiom is commonly used in addiction recovery terminology to describe the reluctance of friends and family of an addicted person to discuss the person&#x27;s problem, thus aiding the person&#x27;s denial. Especially in reference to alcohol abuse, the idiom is sometimes coupled with that of the pink elephant, &quot;the pink elephant in the room.&quot;

The expression has also been used as a metaphorical idiom in Spanish. In 1994, the 8000 Process was a legal investigation of a Colombian presidential campaign. There were accusations that the campaign of Colombian Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper was partially funded with drug money from the Cali Cartel. Insisting on his innocence, Samper stated that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign, it had done so &quot;behind his back&quot;. Cardinal Pedro Rubiano, a leader of Colombia&#x27;s Catholic Church, stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing &quot;an elephant entering one&#x27;s living room&quot;. Since then, the events that led to drug money financing the &quot;Samper for President&quot; campaign have been referred to as &quot;The Elephant.&quot;

The title of Alan Clarke&#x27;s 1989 television film &quot;Elephant&quot; references the term. This was in turn influential in the naming of Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 2003 film of the same name, although Van Sant thought a different expression was being referenced. 

Graffiti artist Banksy, in his 2006 Los Angeles show Barely Legal, included a stuffed elephant painted to match the wallpaper as a literal presentation of the concept.

Alexandra Burke&#x27;s 2012 single &quot;Elephant&quot; also uses the concept. Burke incorrectly claimed to have brought the phrase to the United Kingdom from the United States. 

Terry Kettering&#x27;s named his poem &quot;The Elephant in the Room&quot;. In a November 2013 edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, New Jersey governor Chris Christie was labeled as the &quot;Elephant in the Room&quot; on the cover page. 

===Similar===
A variation is the phrase &quot;elephant in the corner&quot; which is infrequently used to the same effect.

Logician and philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein used an example of a rhinoceros in the room to show either the impossibility of disproving negative existential statements or perhaps a more subtle philosophical point.
