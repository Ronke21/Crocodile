<text>Footfall is a 1985 science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The book depicts the arrival of members of an alien species called the Fithp that have traveled to the Solar System from Alpha Centauri in a large spacecraft driven by a Bussard ramjet. Their intent is conquest of the planet Earth.

== Plot ==
The alien Fithp resemble baby elephants with multiple prehensile trunks. They possess more advanced technology than humans, but did not develop any of it on their own. In the distant past on their planet, another species was dominant. The predecessor species badly damaged the environment, rendering itself and many other species extinct, but left behind their knowledge inscribed on large stone cubes from which the Fithp gained their technology. An arms race between two rival herds threatened to render the species extinct, so they wagered to see who would depart in a starship and seek a new home elsewhere. The leadership of the loser formed the &quot;Chtaptisk Fithp&quot; (&#x27;Traveling Herd&#x27;). 

The herd was divided into &quot;Sleepers&quot; and the &quot;Spaceborn&quot;, as the starship is both a generation ship and a sleeper ship. The original leaders are subordinate to the Spaceborn, who are prepared to start a space-based civilization, but are still dedicated to the generations-old goal of conquest.

The Fithp are herd creatures and fight wars differently from humans. When two herds meet, they fight until it is evident which is dominant. Fighting then ceases, and the losers are incorporated into the winning herd. The Fithp are confused by human attempts at peaceful contact. Upon arrival, they attack the Soviet space station, the country still being a world superpower, where Soviets and Americans wait to greet them. They proceed to destroy military sites and important infrastructure on Earth. US Congressman Wes Dawson and Soviet cosmonauts are captured from the ruins of the space station.

The human characters fall into two major groups: those on Earth and those who are taken aboard the Fithp spaceship as captives. Civilians are used to show the effects of the war on day-to-day life in the US, and military and government personnel convey a more strategic overview of events. Science fiction writers are employed as technical advisers on alien technology and behavior; the characters are based on real writers, including Niven (&quot;Nat Reynolds&quot;), Pournelle (&quot;Wade Curtis&quot;), and Robert Anson Heinlein (&quot;Bob Anson&quot;).

After their initial assault, the Fithp land ground forces in the center of North America, primarily in and around Kansas. They initially repel attacks with orbital lasers and kinetic energy weapons, but a combined Soviet and US nuclear attack wipes out their beachhead. The Fithp, who are familiar with nuclear weapons, but prefer to use cleaner ones, are shocked by what they consider the barbarity of humans&#x27; willingness to &quot;sow radioactive fire on their own croplands&quot;. The Fithp respond to the defeat of their invasion by dropping a large asteroid into the Indian Ocean, whose impact results in environmental damage on a global scale, particularly the almost total destruction of India. The Fithp then invade southern Africa, successfully subjugating most of its people. On numerous occasions, the Fithp are assisted by human leaders seeking to keep their power over the masses.

The US secretly builds a large, heavily armed spacecraft in Washington state that is propelled by nuclear bombs, a real concept known as Project Orion. The ship is named after the Biblical archangel Michael, who cast Lucifer out of Heaven. When there is a security leak, &quot;Michael&quot; launches prematurely and battles through small enemy &quot;digit&quot; ships, aided by one-man gunships and larger space shuttles carried aboard &quot;Michael&quot; and released as needed. Though seriously damaged, &quot;Michael&quot; pursues the alien mothership. One of the shuttles rams the Fithp ship, damaging it badly enough that it cannot escape &quot;Michael&quot;. 

On Earth, US President David Coffey receives an offer of conditional surrender from the Fithp. Coffey is willing to let the Fithp withdraw into space and is reluctant to destroy their technology and cargo of females and children. He is opposed by his advisors, who feel that by allowing the Fithp to escape and regroup, he risks the whole of humanity. When Coffey seemingly folds under the pressure, National Security Adviser Admiral Carrell stages a bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, circumventing the President and rejecting the aliens&#x27; proposal. An act of sabotage by the humans aboard the alien vessel disables the Fithp engines, allowing &quot;Michael&quot; to inflict heavy damage, which forces the Fithp to accept humanity as the stronger species and surrender themselves to become part of the human &quot;herd&quot;. In the final scene, the Fithp leader lies on his back and allows the former captive Dawson to place his foot on his chest, which is the formal Fithp gesture of surrender.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; commented, &quot;Overblown and largely underdone.&quot; It judged the novel to be &quot;more tedious and less thoughtful&quot; than previous joint Niven–Pournelle works, with &quot;barely relevant&quot; subplots and a &quot;cumbersome cast of thousands&quot; but praising the Fithp society as &quot;particularly well worked-out.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Footfall&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #71, and stated that &quot;Their flaws are blockbuster flaws: momentum takes 100 pages to build, several of the teeming characters are dispensable, and megadeaths are glossed over. [...] All the same, I read most of it twice and ran out of adrenalin.&quot; James Nicoll found it to have &quot;the mediocrity and tedium of a much longer novel,&quot; with a weak characterization and a scientifically-inaccurate portrayal of the effects of the asteroid&#x27;s impact, but conceded that it was better than most other works in its subgenre and commended Niven for his portrayal of the Fithp.

&quot;Footfall&quot; was nominated for the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was a No. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller.

<text>Ubu Roi (; &quot;Ubu the King&quot; or &quot;King Ubu&quot;) is a play by French writer Alfred Jarry, then 23 years old. It was first performed in Paris in 1896, by Aurélien Lugné-Poe&#x27;s Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre at the Nouveau-Théâtre (today, the Théâtre de Paris). The production&#x27;s single public performance baffled and offended audiences with its unruliness and obscenity. Considered to be a wild, bizarre and comic play, significant for the way it overturns cultural rules, norms and conventions, it is seen by 20th- and 21st-century scholars to have opened the door for what became known as modernism in the 20th century, and as a precursor to Dadaism, Surrealism and the Theatre of the Absurd.

==Overview==
&quot;Ubu Roi&quot; was first performed in Paris on December 10, 1896, by Aurélien Lugné-Poe&#x27;s Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre at Nouveau-Théâtre (today, the Théâtre de Paris), 15, rue Blanche, in the 9th arrondissement. The play – scheduled for an invited &quot;industry&quot; run-through followed by a single public performance the next night – caused a riotous response in the audience and denunciatory reviews in the days after. It is considered a wild, bizarre and comic play, significant for the way it overturns cultural rules, norms, and conventions. To some of those who were in the audience on opening night, including W. B. Yeats and the poet and essayist Catulle Mendès, it seemed an event of revolutionary importance, but many were mystified and outraged by the work&#x27;s seeming childishness, obscenity, and disrespect. It is now seen by some to have opened the door for what became known as modernism in the 20th century. It is a precursor to Dada, Surrealism and the Theatre of the Absurd. It is the first of three stylised burlesques in which Jarry satirises power, greed, and their evil practice – in particular the propensity of the complacent bourgeoisie to abuse the authority engendered by success.

The title is sometimes translated as &quot;King Turd&quot;; however, the word &quot;Ubu&quot; is actually merely a nonsense word that evolved from the French pronunciation of the name &quot;Hebert&quot;, which was the name of one of Jarry&#x27;s teachers, the satirical target and inspiration of the first versions of the play.

Jarry made some suggestions regarding how his play should be performed. He wanted King Ubu to wear a cardboard horse&#x27;s head in certain scenes, &quot;as in the old English theatre&quot;, for he intended to &quot;write a &quot;guignol&quot;&quot;. He thought a &quot;suitably costumed person would enter, as in puppet shows, to put up signs indicating the locations of the various scenes&quot;. He also wanted costumes with as little specific local colour reference or historical accuracy as possible.

&quot;Ubu Roi&quot; was followed by &quot;Ubu Cocu&quot; (&quot;Ubu Cuckolded&quot;) and &quot;Ubu Enchaîné&quot; (&quot;Ubu in Chains&quot;), neither of which was performed during Jarry&#x27;s 34-year life. One of his later works, a novel/essay on &quot;pataphysics&quot;, is offered as an explanation behind the ideas that underpin &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;. Pataphysics is, as Jarry explains, &quot;the science of the realm beyond metaphysics&quot;. Pataphysics is a pseudo-science Jarry created to critique members of the academy. It studies the laws that &quot;govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one&quot;. It is the &quot;science of imaginary solutions&quot;.

==Synopsis==

The story is a parody of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; and some parts of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;.

As the play begins, Ubu&#x27;s wife convinces him to lead a revolution, and kills the King of Poland and most of the royal family. The King&#x27;s son, Bougrelas, and the Queen escape, but the latter later dies. The ghost of the dead king appears to his son and calls for revenge. Back at the palace, Ubu, now King, begins heavily taxing the people and killing the nobles for their wealth. Ubu&#x27;s henchman gets thrown into prison; who then escapes to Russia, where he has the Tsar declare war on Ubu. As Ubu heads out to confront the invading Russians, his wife tries to steal the money and treasures in the palace. She is driven away by Bougrelas, who is leading a revolt of the people against Ubu. She runs away to her husband, Ubu, who has, in the meantime, been defeated by the Russians, been abandoned by his followers, and been attacked by a bear. Ubu&#x27;s wife pretends to be the angel Gabriel, in order to try to scare Ubu into forgiving her for her attempt to steal from him. They fight, and she is rescued by the entrance of Bougrelas, who is after Ubu. Ubu knocks down the attackers with the body of the dead bear, after which he and his wife flee to France, which ends the play.

The action contains motifs found in the plays of Shakespeare: a king&#x27;s murder and a scheming wife from &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the ghost from &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Fortinbras&#x27; revolt from &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the reneging of Buckingham&#x27;s reward from &quot;Richard III&quot;, and the pursuing bear from &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. It also includes other cultural references, for example, to Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (&quot;Œdipe Roi&quot; in French) in the play&#x27;s title. &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; is considered a descendant of the comic grotesque French Renaissance author François Rabelais and his &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; novels.

The language of the play is a unique mix of slang code-words, puns and near-gutter vocabulary, set to strange speech patterns.

==Development==
&quot;The beginnings of the original Ubu&quot;, writes Jane Taylor, &quot;have attained the status of legend within French theatre culture&quot;. In 1888, when he became a student at the Lycée in Rennes at the age of fifteen, Jarry encountered a brief farcical sketch, &quot;Les Polonais&quot;, written by his friend Henri Morin, and Henri&#x27;s brother Charles. This farce was part of a campaign by the students to ridicule their physics teacher, Félix-Frederic Hébert (1832–1917). &quot;Les Polonais&quot; depicted their teacher as the King of an imaginary Poland, and was one of many plays created around Père Hébé, the character that, in Jarry&#x27;s hands, eventually evolved into King Ubu. &quot;Les Polonais&quot; was performed as a marionette play by the students at their homes in what they called the &quot;Theatre des Phynances&quot;, named in honor of Père Hébert&#x27;s lust for &quot;phynance&quot; (finance), or money. This prototype for &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; is long-lost, so the true and complete details of the authorship of &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; may never be known. It is clear, however, that Jarry considerably revised and expanded the play.

While his schoolmates lost interest in the Ubu legends when they left school, Jarry continued adding to and reworking the material for the rest of his short life. His plays are controversial for their scant respect to royalty, religion and society, their vulgarity and scatology, their brutality and low comedy, and their perceived utter lack of literary finish.

==Ubu==

According to Jane Taylor, &quot;the central character is notorious for his infantile engagement with his world. Ubu inhabits a domain of greedy self-gratification&quot;. Jarry&#x27;s metaphor for the modern man, he is an antihero – fat, ugly, vulgar, gluttonous, grandiose, dishonest, stupid, , voracious, greedy, cruel, cowardly and evil – who grew out of schoolboy legends about the imaginary life of a hated teacher who had been at one point a slave on a Turkish galley, at another frozen in ice in Norway and at one more the King of Poland. &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; follows and explores his political, martial and felonious exploits.

&quot;There is&quot;, writes Taylor, &quot;a particular kind of pleasure for an audience watching these infantile attacks. Part of the satisfaction arises from the fact that in the burlesque mode which Jarry invents, there is no place for consequence. While Ubu may be relentless in his political aspirations, and brutal in his personal relations, he apparently has no measurable effect upon those who inhabit the farcical world which he creates around himself. He thus acts out our most childish rages and desires, in which we seek to gratify ourselves at all cost&quot;. The derived adjective &quot;ubuesque&quot; is recurrent in French and francophone political debate.

==Première==
Both &quot;Ubu Cocu&quot; and &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; have a convoluted history, going through decades of rewriting and, in the case of the former, never arriving, despite Jarry&#x27;s exertions, at a definitive version. By the time Jarry wanted &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; published and staged, the Morins had lost their interest in schoolboy japes, and Henri gave Jarry permission to do whatever he wanted with them. Charles, however, later tried to claim credit, but it had never been a secret that he had had some involvement with the earliest version. The music was composed and performed at the premiere by Claude Terrasse.

The first word of the play (&quot;merdre&quot;, the French word for &quot;shit&quot;, with an extra &quot;r&quot;) may have been part of the reason for the response to the play in Paris. At the end of the performance a riot broke out, an incident which has since become &quot;a stock element of Jarry biographia&quot;. After this, &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; was outlawed from the stage, and Jarry moved it to a puppet theatre.

Jarry said to the audience in a curtain speech just before that first performance in Paris: &quot;You are free to see in M. Ubu however many allusions you care to, or else a simple puppet—a school boy&#x27;s caricature of one of his teachers who personified for him all the ugliness in the world&quot;.

The poet W. B. Yeats, though he did not understand French, attended the premiere with a companion who interpreted the action for him. He recalled, in his memoir &quot;The Trembling of the Veil&quot;, his dismay that the play challenged the symbolist, spiritual-themed literature he advocated: &quot;Feeling bound to support the most spirited party, we have shouted for the play, but that night at the Hotel Corneille I am very sad, for comedy, objectivity, has displayed its growing power once more. I say, &#x27;After Stéphane Mallarmé, after Paul Verlaine, after Gustave Moreau, after Puvis de Chavannes, after our own verse, after all our subtle colour and nervous rhythm, after the faint mixed tints of Conder, what more is possible? After us the Savage God.&#x27;”

==Adaptations==
===20th century===
In 1936 Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, the great Polish modernist and prolific writer and translator created in Polish &quot;Ubu Król czyli Polacy&quot; (&quot;King Ubu, otherwise, The Poles&quot;). Some of his phraseology in the play has passed into the language. In 1990, at the invitation of the Munich Opera, Krzysztof Penderecki wrote an opera buffa on Jarry&#x27;s theme entitled &quot;Ubu Rex&quot;, staged on 8 July 1991 for the opening of the Munich Opera Festival; the opera was later mounted in Poland in 2003.

The first English translation was &quot;Ubu Roi. Drama in Five acts followed by the Song of Disembraining&quot;, by Barbara Wright, for which she wrote the preface. It was illustrated by Franciszka Themerson and published by the Gaberbocchus Press in 1951.

In 1964 the Stockholm Puppet theatre produced a highly popular version of &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; directed by Michael Meschke, with scenery by Franciszka Themerson.

&quot;Ubu Roi&quot; was translated into Serbian in 1964 by Ljubomir Draškić and performed at the Atelje 212 theatre in Belgrade for the next 20 years, until Zoran Radmilović, who played Père Ubu, died. The play was so successful that it was adapted into a movie in 1973.

&quot;Ubu Roi&quot; was translated into Czech by Jiří Voskovec and Jan Werich as &quot;Král Ubu&quot;, and premiered in 1928 at Osvobozené divadlo. The play was banned in Czechoslovakia after the 1968 Soviet invasion.

The play was the basis for Jan Lenica&#x27;s animated film &quot;Ubu et la Grande Gidouille&quot; (1976).

In 1976–1977 Oakley Hall III translated and adapted &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; (called &quot;Ubu Rex&quot;) and its sequels, and directed them in New York City Off-Off-Broadway and at the Lexington Conservatory Theatre in Lexington, New York. The adaptations starred Richard Zobel, who also produced the play and created the masks for it.

In Lithuania (then part of the USSR) the play was adapted as &quot;Karalius Ūbas&quot; by director Jonas Vaitkus in 1983.
The play was adapted into an opera, with libretto by Michael Finnissy and Andrew Toovey and music by Toovey. It was produced by the Banff Centre Theatre, Canada, in collaboration with Music Theatre Wales, in May 1992, directed by Keith Turnbull.

A musical adaptation, &quot;Ubu Rock&quot;, book by Andrei Belgrader and Shelly Berc, music and lyrics by Rusty Magee, premiered at the American Repertory Theater in 1995 and was remounted at ART the following year.

The play was adapted for the Czech film &quot;Král Ubu&quot;, directed by F. A. Brabec in 1996. The film received three Czech Lion Awards.

Sherry C. M. Lindquist&#x27;s adaptation was performed in Chicago, at The Public Theater in New York City, at the International Festival of Puppet Theater, and at the Edison Theater, St. Louis, Missouri, by Hystopolis Productions, Chicago, from 1996 to 1997.

Jane Taylor adapted &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; as &quot;Ubu and the Truth Commission&quot; (1998), a play addressing the emotional complexities revealed by the process of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was formed in response to the atrocities committed during apartheid.

===21st century===

In Poland the play was adapted for the film &quot;Ubu Król&quot; (2003) by Piotr Szulkin, highlighting the grotesque nature of political life in Poland immediately after the fall of communism.

The play was translated by David Ball in &quot;The Norton Anthology of Drama&quot; in 2010, and performed at the University of Virginia the same year.

Inspired by the black comedy of corruption within &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;, the Puerto Rican absurdist narrative &quot;United States of Banana&quot; (2011) by Giannina Braschi dramatizes, with over-the-top grotesque flourishes of &quot;pataphysics&quot;, the fall of the American Empire and the liberation of Puerto Rico.

The play was adapted and directed by Dash Kruck as part of Vena Cava Production&#x27;s 2013 mainstage season. Performed in Brisbane, Australia, the adaptation made cultural political references to Queensland&#x27;s Premier Campbell Newman, even including him in the show&#x27;s promotional poster.

In 2013, the international theatre company Cheek by Jowl created a French-language production of Ubu Roi, directed by Declan Donnellan and designed by Nick Ormerod. The production was presented across Europe, Russia, the United-States and Mexico. It was live-streamed worldwide from the Lincoln Center in New York on 26 July 2015. According to The New York Times &quot;the Cheek by Jowl production asks us to see Jarry’s play through the eyes of a sulky, moody, sexually tormented adolescent, who is pitilessly judgmental of his elders.&quot;

In 2014, Toronto&#x27;s One Little Goat Theatre Company produced &quot;Ubu Mayor: A Harmful Bit of Fun&quot;, combining the &quot;merde&quot;-filled sensibilities of &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; with the internationally renowned antics, absurdities and obscenities of Toronto&#x27;s mayor Rob Ford and his brother Doug.

In 2016, the play was adapted by Jared Strange into &quot;UBU ROY: An American Tale&quot;, an updated version of the original play through the lens of the 2016 United States presidential election. The show opened November 3, 2016, in Lubbock, Texas, as the Lubbock Community Theatre&#x27;s first play in their &quot;LCT After Dark&quot; season.

In 2020, the play was adapted and set in modern-day Tasmania, taking place on a purpose-built stage in the Cataract Gorge.

In 2020, the play was also adapted into a musical by Kneehigh Theatre company.

In 2021, the play was condensed and adapted by Jen Silverman under the title &quot;Ubu Anew (A Play for Strange People)&quot; and is featured in Silverman&#x27;s collection &quot;Real American Dinner Party &amp; Other Short Plays.&quot;

==References in popular culture==

In 1923, the Dadaist pioneer Max Ernst produced a painting entitled &quot;Ubu Imperator&quot;.

Between 1952 and 1953, the King Ubu Gallery existed at 3119 Fillmore Street in San Francisco. Founded by Robert Duncan, Jess Collins, and Harry Jacobus, the gallery was an important institution until it was replaced by the Six Gallery, where Allen Ginsberg first read &quot;Howl.&quot;

Alfred Jarry is one of the few real figures to appear among the many literary characters in &quot;Les Faux-Monnayeurs&quot; (&quot;The Counterfeiters&quot;, 1925), by André Gide. In Part III, Chapter 8, Jarry attends a literary banquet, where the fictional Comte de Passavant introduces him as the author of &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;, saying of the literary set, &quot;They have dubbed him a genius because the public have just damned his play. All the same, it&#x27;s the most interesting thing that&#x27;s been put on the stage for a long time&quot;.

Joan Miró used &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; as a subject of his 50 lithographs in 1940 called the Barcelona Series. These pictures could be Ubu Roi but they also satirise General Franco and his generals after he had won the Spanish Civil War.

In her book &quot;Linda McCartney&#x27;s Sixties: Portrait of an Era&quot;, Linda McCartney mentions that Paul had become interested in avant-garde theatre and immersed himself in the writings of Jarry. This is how McCartney discovered the word &quot;pataphysical&quot;, which he used in the lyrics of his song &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot;.

The American experimental rock group Pere Ubu is named after the main character. Their 2009 album &quot;Long Live Père Ubu!&quot; is an adaptation of Jarry&#x27;s play.

Dead Can Dance&#x27;s frontman Brendan Perry makes a reference to Père Ubu in the song &quot;The Bogus Man&quot; (on his second solo album &quot;Ark&quot;) with the line &quot;Hail, Father Ubu, here comes the Grand Guignol&quot;.

The figure of Ubu Roi, particularly as depicted by Jarry in his woodcut, appears to have inspired the character Oogie Boogie in Tim Burton&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.

Television producer Gary David Goldberg named his dog Ubu and his production company Ubu Productions after Ubu Roi.

Australian band Methyl Ethel&#x27;s song &quot;Ubu&quot; contains references to the play.

The protagonist of Walter Jon Williams&#x27; novel &quot;Angel Station&quot; is named Ubu Roy.
In Paul Auster’s last novel Baumgartner (2023) King Ubu is named on page 95 clearly referencing Donald J. Trump as “King Ubu in the White House”.

<text>Miss Puerto Rico is a national title bestowed on the women representing Puerto Rico in international beauty pageants.

In 1987, Puerto Rico became the ninth nation to win the &quot;Big Three&quot; pageants of Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss International. In 2019, Puerto Rico won Miss Earth, becoming the fourth nation to win the &quot;Big Four&quot; pageants. Having also won Miss Supranational, Miss Grand International, and Miss Intercontinental by 2019, Puerto Rico became the first nation—and only one as of —to win the &quot;Big Six&quot; or &quot;Grand Slam&quot; and the &quot;Big Seven&quot; pageants. 

As the second Ibero-American nation with the most titles in the &quot;Big Three&quot;, &quot;Big Four&quot;, &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, and &quot;Big Seven&quot; pageants, the fourth nation globally with the most titles in the &quot;Big Three&quot;, &quot;Big Four&quot;, and &quot;Big Seven&quot;, and the fifth nation globally in the &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, Puerto Rico, which has won 17 major titles as of , is considered a &quot;powerhouse&quot; in beauty pageants, alongside Venezuela, United States, Philippines, and India.

In Puerto Rico, beauty queens are an important part of the culture. The businesswoman in the modeling and beauty industry in charge of many Puerto Rican representatives in international pageants between 1952 and 1998, Anna Santisteban, popularly known as the &quot;Hacedora de Reinas (Maker of Queens)&quot;, is recognized as the figure who established the fervent enthusiasm for beauty queens in Puerto Rico. As the holder of the Miss Universe franchise in Puerto Rico, Santisteban produced three international winners, in 1970, 1985 and 1993.

Despite being a self-governed unincorporated U.S. territory with the title of commonwealth (), Puerto Rico competes in international beauty competitions as a separate and independent nation from the United States since 1952, as it does in the Olympic Games since 1948 and the Pan American Games since 1955.

===History===

Currently, a pageant is not being held to choose the representative of Puerto Rico for Miss Intercontinental. The delegate is chosen from the group of finalists in Miss World Puerto Rico and prepared by the Miss World Puerto Rico organization, which is presided by Miss World 1975, Wilnelia Merced Forsyth, and directed by Ana Esther Avilés.

===Placements===

Puerto Rico has won Miss Intercontinental five times in 1986, 1991, 2010, 2016, and 2024, but the current organization of the pageant only recognizes four winners. Miss Intercontinental does not include Puerto Rico&#x27;s 1991 win in their official archive. 

Miss Intercontinental was held twice in 1991. Carmen Lynda Díaz from Puerto Rico won the first edition held in Lagos, Nigeria by Nigerian owners of the pageant, Silverbird Productions, which held the franchise from 1986 to 1991, and Elena Ivanova from Russia won the second edition held in Bonn, Germany by organizers working under the direction of the new owners of the pageant, a company from Germany, which held the competition in Europe from 1991 to 2003. Despite not being included in the official archive of the pageant by the current owners, Puerto Rico irrefutably won the first edition of 1991 in Nigeria, thus achieving its second Miss Intercontinental crown.

Having produced five winners as of , Puerto Rico is the country with the most crowns, along Venezuela and United States, which have 5 winners each.

Since it began to be awarded in 2008, Puerto Rico is the country with the most &quot;Miss North America&quot; titles, winning it seven times as of.

<text>Capacitors and inductors as used in electric circuits are not ideal components with only capacitance or inductance. However, they can be treated, to a very good degree of approximation, as being ideal capacitors and inductors in series with a resistance; this resistance is defined as the equivalent series resistance (ESR). If not otherwise specified, the ESR is always an AC resistance, which means it is measured at specified frequencies, 100 kHz for switched-mode power supply components, 120 Hz for linear power-supply components, and at its self-resonant frequency for general-application components. Additionally, audio components may report a &quot;Q factor&quot;, incorporating ESR among other things, at 1000 Hz.

==Overview==
Electrical circuit theory deals with ideal resistors, capacitors and inductors, each assumed to contribute only resistance, capacitance or inductance to the circuit. However, all components have a non-zero value of each of these parameters. In particular, all physical devices are constructed of materials with finite electrical resistance, so that physical components have some resistance in addition to their other properties. The physical origins of ESR depend on the device in question.
One way to deal with these inherent resistances in circuit analysis is to use a lumped-element model to express each physical component as a combination of an ideal component and a small resistor in series, the ESR. The ESR can be measured and included in a component&#x27;s datasheet. To some extent it can be calculated from the device properties.

Q factor, which is related to ESR and is sometimes a more convenient parameter than ESR to use in calculations of high-frequency non-ideal performance of real inductors, is quoted in inductor data sheets.

Capacitors, inductors, and resistors are usually designed to minimise other parameters. In many cases this can be done to a sufficient extent that &quot;parasitic&quot; capacitance and inductance of a resistor, for example, are so small as not to affect circuit operation. However, under some circumstances parasitics become important and even dominant.

==Component models==
Pure capacitors and inductors do not dissipate energy; any component which dissipates energy must be treated in an equivalent circuit model incorporating one or more resistors. Actual passive two-terminal components can be represented by some network of lumped and distributed ideal inductors, capacitors, and resistors, in the sense that the real component behaves as the network does. Some of the components of the equivalent circuit can vary with conditions, e.g., frequency and temperature.

If driven by a periodic sinewave (alternating current) the component will be characterised by its complex impedance &quot;Z&quot;(ω) = &quot;R&quot; + &quot;j&quot; &quot;X&quot;(ω); the impedance can involve several minor resistances, inductances and capacitances in addition to the main property. These small deviations from the ideal behavior of the device can become significant under certain conditions, typically high frequency, where the reactance of small capacitances and inductances can become a significant element of circuit operation. Models of lesser or greater complexity can be used, depending upon the accuracy required. For many purposes, a simple model with an inductance or capacitance in series with an ESR is good enough.

These models, however simple or complex, can be inserted into a circuit to calculate performance. Computer tools are available for complex circuits; e.g., the SPICE program and its variants.

===Inductors===
An inductor consists of a conducting insulated wire coil usually wound around a ferromagnetic core. Inductors have resistance inherent in the metal conductor, quoted as DCR in datasheets. This metallic resistance is small for small inductance values (typically below 1Ω). The DC wire resistance is an important parameter in transformer and general inductor design because it contributes to the impedance of the component, and current flowing through that resistance is dissipated as waste heat, and energy is lost from the circuit. It can be modeled as a resistor in series with the inductor, often leading to the DC resistance being referred to as the ESR. Though this is not precisely correct usage, the unimportant elements of ESR are often neglected in circuit discussion, since it is rare that all elements of ESR are significant to a particular application.

An inductor using a core to increase inductance will have losses such as hysteresis and eddy current in the core. At high frequencies there are also losses in the windings due to proximity and skin effects. These are in addition to wire resistance, and lead to a higher ESR.

===Capacitors===
In a non-electrolytic capacitor and electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte, the metallic resistance of the leads and electrodes and losses in the dielectric cause the ESR. Typically quoted values of ESR for ceramic capacitors are between 0.01 and 0.1 Ω. ESR of non-electrolytic capacitors tends to be fairly stable over time; for most purposes real non-electrolytic capacitors can be treated as ideal components.

Aluminium and tantalum electrolytic capacitors with non solid electrolyte have much higher ESR values, up to several ohms; electrolytics of higher capacitance have lower ESR. ESR decreases with frequency up to the capacitor&#x27;s self-resonant frequency. A very serious problem, particularly with aluminium electrolytics, is that ESR increases over time from evaporation and more importantly from oxygen being depleted in the electrolyte with use. ESR can increase enough to cause circuit malfunction and even component damage, although measured capacitance may remain within tolerance. While this happens with normal aging, high temperatures and large ripple current exacerbate the problem. In a circuit with significant ripple current, an increase in ESR will increase heat accumulation, thus accelerating aging.

Electrolytic capacitors rated for high-temperature operation and of higher quality than basic consumer-grade parts are less susceptible to become prematurely unusable due to ESR increase. A cheap electrolytic capacitor may be rated for a life of less than 1000 hours (6 weeks) at 85 °C. Higher-grade parts are typically rated at a few thousand hours at maximum rated temperature, as can be seen from manufacturers&#x27; datasheets. If ESR is critical, specification of a part with higher temperature rating, &quot;low ESR&quot; or larger capacitance than is otherwise required may be advantageous. There is no standard for &quot;low ESR&quot; capacitor rating.

Polymer capacitors usually have lower ESR than wet-electrolytic of same value, and stable under varying temperature. Therefore, polymer capacitors can handle higher ripple current. From about 2007 it became common for better-quality computer motherboards to use only polymer capacitors where wet electrolytics had been used previously.

The ESR of capacitors larger than about 1 μF is easily measured in-circuit with an ESR meter.

<doc id="497685" wikidata="Q2353428" url="?curid=497685" title="M-66 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-66 is a north–south state trunkline highway on the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It runs from the Indiana state line in the south to Charlevoix in the north. M-66 is the only state highway to run the north–south distance of the Lower Peninsula. It starts as a continuation of State Road 9 (SR 9), which provides access to the Indiana Toll Road. The total length is approximately , which includes almost of freeway between Interstate 94 (I-94) and downtown Battle Creek designated as I-194. A section of the highway immediately south of I-94 is an expressway, a type of divided limited-access highway, while the section along I-194 is a full freeway; otherwise M-66 is a two-lane rural highway. Two sections are listed on the National Highway System.

The first usage of the M-66 designation dates back to around July 1, 1919 with the rest of the original state highway system. At the time, the highway only extended between Lowell and Lakeview, a route now covered by M-91. The highway has been lengthened in a series of extensions north and south starting in 1925. A rerouting in 1944–45 removed M-66 from its original 1919 routing to replace another highway south of Six Lakes, the change that spawned M-91. The last big extension in 1965 resulted in the modern trans-peninsular highway route. The last modifications were shorter reroutings in the 1970s.

==Route description==
M-66 runs for as an almost entirely a north–south undivided surface highway in western Michigan from the Indiana state line north to Lake Michigan at Charlevoix. Most of the highway is two-lane undivided rural highway. There is a section south of Battle Creek that is a four-lane expressway. Running north into the Cereal City, M-66 is concurrent with I-194, which is a full freeway. This section along I-194 is listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a system of highways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. Another section of M-66 is included on the NHS where it is concurrent with either M-72 or U.S. Highway 131 (US 131) in Kalkaska or Antrim counties.

===Indiana to Ionia===
M-66 is a four-lane highway that connects with State Road 9 (SR 9) at the Indiana state line in southern St. Joseph County. The highway runs north to Sturgis through farm land where it turns east through town running concurrently with US 12 on Chicago Road. As it leaves Sturgis to the north it crosses a branch of the Michigan Southern Railroad, and it becomes a two-lane surface highway along Nottawa Street. The highway runs near several small lakes and crosses the Prairie River before meeting M-86. The two highways run north–south concurrently for about along the Nottawa–Colon township line. Farther north, M-66 crosses the St. Joseph River and meets M-60. M-60/M-66 run together to the east, crossing Nottawa Creek, then turning northeasterly in Leonidas and crossing into the northwest corner of Branch County. M-60 and M-66 separate west of Union City, and M-66 turns north into Calhoun County.

Running through woodland terrain in southern Calhoun County, M-66 passes through Athens, along Graham Lake and continues to the outskirts of Battle Creek. The highway widens first to a four-lane, limited access expressway south of the Lakeview Square Mall before becoming a full freeway at the interchange with I-94. It is at the transition to freeway that M-66 starts its concurrency with I-194. I-194/M-66 is known as the Sojourner Truth Downtown Parkway, but the locals still use the former semi-official nickname, &quot;The Penetrator&quot;. The southern section of the freeway has the highest traffic levels along M-66 as measured by average annual daily traffic (AADT) in the survey conducted in 2009. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculates the AADT value as a tally of the average number of vehicles using a given stretch of roadway. I-194/M-66 carried 25,200 vehicles on the average day during the year; 980  trucks were included in that traffic. The freeway continues north into downtown Battle Creek along part of the Kalamazoo River and crossing a branch of the Canadian National Railway and Norfolk Southern Railway before ending at the at-grade intersection with Hamblin Avenue. I-194 ends, and M-66 continues northeast out of the Cereal City on Division Street and then northeast on Capital Avenue along the Battle Creek River.

M-66 continues northward through Barry County on Capital Avenue which becomes 9 Mile Road north of Baseline Road. The highway passes through Assyria before meeting M-79, with which it has a short concurrency, in Nashville. On the north side of the village, M-66 crosses the Thornapple River and continues north through mixed rural forest land and farm fields. Near Woodland, M-66 joins M-43 and the two run to the northeast and along the Barry–Eaton county line. M-43/M-66 meets M-50 at a four-way intersection southwest of Lake Odessa near Woodbury, and M-43 turns east leaving M-66 in favor of a concurrency with M-50. M-66 crosses a rail line of CSX Transportation and the county line on State Road. It meets I-96 in a rural southern part of the Ionia County south of Ionia. On the south edge of town, the highway passes the county airport and curves to the northeast becoming Dexter Street. While entering downtown Ionia, the trunkline crosses the Grand River and the abandoned mainline of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad near the county fairgrounds. M-66 turns west along M-21 (Lincoln Avenue) for two blocks before turning back to the north along State Street. The trunkline runs through the northern part of the county and meets M-44&#x27;s eastern terminus near Woodard Lake.

===Montcalm County and northward===
In Montcalm County, M-66 intersects M-57 in a rural area south of Sheridan before running north on Sheridan Road through Stanton. The highway jogs west along Main Street in Stanton before returning to a northerly course on a discontinuous section of Sheridan Road. The roadway curves around the west end of Hemmingway Lake near Cannonsville Road. West of Edmore, M-66 turns northwesterly along M-46 on Edmore–Howard City Road to Six Lakes. M-66 separates there and returns to its northerly journey along Six Lakes Road between Little Bass Lake and First Lake. The road crosses into Mecosta County as 30th Avenue north of Six Lakes. The highway intersects M-20 at the intersection with 9 Mile Road in Remus. This area of rural Mecosta County is more heavily forested with rolling hills and sporadic farms. In Barryton, the roadway crosses the Chippewa River. M-66 continues north passing Merrill Lake before crossing into rural eastern Osceola County at Mesceola Road.

The highway meets US 10 near Sears after crossing the Pere Marquette State Trail. M-66 crosses the Muskegon River near a separate 9 Mile Road in Osceola County. It meets both M-115 and M-61 (16 Mile Road) south of Marion. The highway continues north and crosses the Great Lakes Central Railroad for the first time in Marion, before entering Missaukee County. The trunkline then turns westward on Stoney Corners Road toward McBain through farm land. In town it runs along Maple Street and then runs north toward Lake City on Morey Road. South of the Lake City, M-55 runs concurrently with M-66 by Missaukee Golf Course and into town along the eastern shore of Lake Missaukee. North of town, M-55 splits off to the east on Houghton Lake Road, and M-66 continues north to an intersection with the eastern terminus of M-42 in a rural forest. M-66 leaves Morey Road and follows Pioneer Road to the county line.

As the highway crosses into Kalkaska County it crosses the Manistee River. M-66 runs through rolling hills in woodlands through the unincorporated farming community of Lodi north to an intersection with M-72. The two highways travel west together over the Great Lakes Central Railroad before turning north and merging with US 131 on a route parallel to the rail line. US 131/M-66/M-72 follows and crosses a branch of the Boardman River along Cedar Street through downtown Kalkaska. North of the central business district, M-72 separates to the west and US 131/M-66 crosses through the Pere Marquette State Forest on the way to Antrim and Mancelona in Antrim County. The highway follows Williams Street through the twin towns, meeting the southern terminus of M-88 and western terminus of C-38 at the intersection with State Street in Mancelona. M-66 separates from US 131 and follows Mancelona–East Jordan Road out of town.
The section of M-66 north of the US 131 split had the highway&#x27;s lowest AADT levels in the 2009 survey. MDOT reported that only 1,500 vehicles use this stretch of road in 2009. Of these vehicles, only were 140 trucks that used the segment of highway in 2009. The highway meanders through more forest lands through the community of Green River to East Jordan. M-66 follows Lake Street and turns to follow the western shore of the South Arm of Lake Charlevoix. The roadway turns inland through Ironton before returning to the lakeshore the rest of the way to Charlevoix. M-66 ends at an intersection with US 31 south of downtown next to Lake Michigan.

===Services===
MDOT provides a number of different services to motorists traveling along the state trunkline highway system. Along M-66, there are six different carpool lots located near Nashville, Woodland, Belding, Sheridan, Sears and Marion. There are additional services provided to travelers in the form of roadside parks and rest areas. There are two roadside parks along the highway, one is between Woodland and Woodbury, and the second is in Sheridan. The roadway also provides access to the Ionia State Recreation Area and a state harbor on Lake Charlevoix.

==History==

M-66 was first signed along a roadway by July 1, 1919, between M-16 (now M-21) at Lowell and M-46 near Lakeview. The designation was extended in 1925 along M-46 to Six Lakes and then north to M-13 (now US 131) in Lodi. A further extension north from Lodi in 1929 or 1930 along M-131 to Mancelona, a short segment of M-88 and north to US 31 in Charlevoix. The southern end was extended to US 16 south of Lowell by 1931. A section of the northern extension was marked on maps through 1933 as &quot;under construction&quot;. That section was cancelled in favor of another routing near Mancelona. A short bypass of Six Lakes added about a mile to the length of the roadway in 1936. The M-131 concurrency was switched to a US 131 concurrency when the latter was extended in 1939. This concurrency was shortened just before World War II when the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) rerouted US 131 along a new road between South Boardman and Kalkaska.

The MSHD completed a major rerouting of M-66 around 1944–45. The M-14 designation of the time was decommissioned and replaced with M-66. Starting at Six Lakes, M-66 turned west along M-46 instead of east and then turned south through Stanton and Ionia ending north of Battle Creek. The highway between Lowell and Lakeview was redesignated as M-91. A minor realignment in late 1950 removed two 90° curves near the Osceola–Missaukee county line and replaced them with a pair of sweeping curves.

The MSHD rerouted M-66 between Maple Grove and Nashville in mid-1953. In the changes, M-79 was extended along the new route of M-66 and then over M-214 to Hastings. M-66 was shifted off Assyria Road which was turned back to local control. Another realignment in 1954 shifted M-66 to the modern routing between the M-43 concurrency termini, removing M-43/M-66 from a section of M-50 in the process. The final section gravel section of M-66, approximately in length, was paved near Nashville in 1957. M-32 was extended along the northernmost section of M-66 in 1963.

M-66 was extended southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M-78 in 1965. M-66 turned south and west along M-60 and new highway to Colon. The segment of former M-78 not used by M-66 was transferred to local control. The final section of M-78&#x27;s roadway given to M-66 extended it all the way to the state line, resulting in a north–south trans-peninsular highway from Lake Michigan near Charlevoix to Indiana. M-66 is the only such highway to run the length of the Lower Peninsula. The extension allowed the Green Arrow Association to promote the whole length of the Green Arrow Route with a single highway number. The next year, M-66 was rerouted through Battle Creek to use the completed I-194 freeway.

A 90° turn in Missaukee County was removed north of Lake City in 1972. In late 1973 or early 1974, M-66 and M-72 were shifted around the south side of Kalkaska. Later in 1974, the M-32 concurrency was removed when M-32 was scaled back to its former terminus. A project in 1981 furthered the 1972 realignment in Missaukee County. About were shortened from the routing when the new alignment was built between Smithville and Phelps Road.

==Memorial designations==
To capitalize on the opening of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957, local leaders in Battle Creek wanted to promote M-66 as a route north from Indiana to the bridge. They named the highway the Green Arrow Route as part of this marketing strategy. The color was to evoke the forests in the area, and &quot;arrow&quot; was meant to play on several historical connections. One of these was the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Northern Arrow&quot; passenger train that once operated in the area. The official explanation was to tie into the history of Native Americans in the area, but the route was also &quot;straight as an arrow&quot;. The backers also promoted the highway as a direct and scenic route to vacation country in the northern Lower Peninsula, avoiding most of the larger cities in the area. M-66 was given the Green Arrow Route name in Public Act 170 of 1959 between the Indiana state line and Kalkaska. Despite these efforts, M-66 failed to attract much traffic. When the Michigan Legislature recodified the memorial highway names in Public Act 142 of 2001, the Green Arrow Route was truncated to the northern border of Calhoun County, a change confirmed by Public Act 138 of 2004.

Born Isabella Baumfree in 1797, Sojourner Truth settled in the Battle Creek area in the 1840s. She travelled through the Midwest and New England speaking against slavery and for women&#x27;s rights. She lived in the area until her death in 1883. Her connection to the state of Michigan was honored by the state American Revolution Bicentennial Commission in 1976 which urged the Michigan Legislature to name a highway in her honor. Public Act 93 of 1976 named all of M-66 in Calhoun County, including the segment that runs concurrently with I-194, as the Sojourner Truth Memorial Highway. The highway was dedicated to her on May 21, 1976.

The Cereal City Development Corporation (CCDC) asked the Legislature to amend the memorial designation in 1993. They felt that I-194/M-66 was better known to locals as The Penetrator, and they wished to restore emphasis to Truth. They asked for the &quot;Sojourner Truth Downtown Parkway&quot; name to be applied to &quot;M-66 between Interstate 94 and Hamblin&quot;. The Legislature passed Public Act 208 of 1993 to affect the change, restoring &quot;the link between Sojourner Truth and the City of Battle Creek, which was once the center of abolitionist sentiment in the state.&quot;

<text>CBC Radio is the English-language radio operations of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The CBC operates a number of radio networks serving different audiences and programming niches, all of which (regardless of language) are outlined below.

==English==
CBC Radio operates three English language networks.

*CBC Radio One - Primarily news and information, &quot;Radio One&quot; broadcasts to most communities across Canada. Until 1997, it was known as &quot;CBC Radio&quot;.
*CBC Music - Broadcasts an adult music format with a variety of genres, with the classical genre generally restricted to midday hours. From 2007 to 2018, it was known as &quot;CBC Radio 2&quot;. 
*CBC Radio 3 - Broadcasts a youth-oriented indie rock format through the CBC&#x27;s online radio platform, and formerly on Sirius XM. Some content from Radio 3 was also broadcast as weekend programming on Radio Two until March 2007.
The inconsistency of branding between the word &quot;One&quot; and the numerals &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; was a deliberate design choice on CBC&#x27;s part and is not an error, though from 1997 to 2007, CBC Music was known as &quot;CBC Radio Two&quot;.

From 1944 to 1962 the CBC&#x27;s English service operated two radio networks, the main Trans-Canada Network and the Dominion Network. In 1962 the Dominion Network was disbanded and the Trans-Canada Network became known as CBC Radio and in 1997, CBC Radio One. In some cases CBC announcers will still say &quot;CBC Radio&quot; in reference to programs that air only on Radio One.

CBC Music originated in 1960 as the CBC FM network. It was rebranded as CBC Stereo in 1975, and then CBC Radio Two in 1997 before becoming CBC Music in 2018.

In August 2009, CBC Radio launched a mobile app, initially for iOS, featuring streams of the three services, and other web-exclusive stations. In February 2012, the CBC launched a new, similar streaming platform and app known as CBC Music. In October 2019, CBC Music was succeeded by CBC Listen, a new platform that encompasses CBC Radio and CBC Music content, as well as CBC-produced podcasts.

==French==

The CBC (better known in French as &quot;la Société Radio-Canada&quot;, or colloquially simply &quot;Radio-Canada&quot;) also operates three French language radio networks, two of which have a similar programming focus as the corporation&#x27;s English-language radio networks.

Structurally, the French-language radio operations are managed as part of the CBC&#x27;s overall French-language services division and therefore have limited ties to the English-language radio networks, which are structured similarly (i.e., there is no overall &quot;CBC Radio&quot; division responsible for both English and French radio).

*Ici Radio-Canada Première - News and information.
*Ici Musique - Music, arts and culture.
*Ici Musique Classique - Classical music service broadcasting online and through HD Radio in Ottawa and Montreal.

==CBC North==
In the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Nunavut, and northern Quebec, CBC North airs a modified Radio One schedule to accommodate programming in Indigenous languages.

== Podcasts ==
CBC Radio has 14 original podcasts. Two of the podcasts, Someone Knows Something and Missing &amp; Murdered, are ranked among the top shows on the iTunes and Stitcher charts. In addition, select podcasts are often now broadcast on its terrestrial radio network as supplement material, typically during the summer programming months of July and August to fill time such as on &quot;The Current&quot; when regular programming is reduced during the summer period.

=== Someone Knows Something ===
&quot;Someone Knows Something,&quot; hosted by filmmaker David Ridgen, first aired in 2016. The show, which investigates cold cases in Canada and the United States, finished its fourth season in March 2018. In season three, Ridgen worked with a Mississippi man, Thomas Moore, to solve the 1964 kidnapping and murder of Moore&#x27;s brother, Charles, and his friend, Henry Dee. As a result of information uncovered by the podcast, James Ford Seale, a former member of the KKK, was convicted of the killings in 2007 and received three life sentences for his crimes against Moore and Dee. Season four returned to Canada as Ridgen sought answers in the 1996 unsolved murder case of Wayne Greavette, an Ontario man killed by a bomb that was disguised as a Christmas gift and sent to his home. Season four ended in March 2018 and had the fewest episodes of the series.

=== Missing &amp; Murdered ===

Investigative journalist Connie Walker hosts &quot;Missing &amp; Murdered,&quot; a podcast that looks into deaths and disappearances of indigenous women in Canada. The show&#x27;s first season, &quot;Missing &amp; Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams,&quot; covered the unsolved homicide of Alberta Williams who went missing from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, after a night out with friends. Her body was discovered days later along Highway 16, which has since become known as &quot;the Highway of Tears.&quot; Following the show, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced the case was once again active. The second season, released in March 2018, helped a family find out what happened to their teenage sister, Cleo Semaganis Nicotine, after she was sent to the United States from Saskatchewan during the &quot;Sixties Scoop.&quot; The stories featured on this podcast are part of a broader effort by Walker, who is Cree, and CBC News to raise awareness about the more than 250 unsolved disappearances and homicides of indigenous women and girls across Canada. In 2017, the RCMP announced an initiative to stop violence against indigenous women and girls, citing studies were done in 2014 that found they are among the most likely populations to be victims of violent crime.

==Other services==
The CBC operates Radio Canada International (RCI), an online service. RCI ended its shortwave radio broadcast in June 2012.

In some remote Canadian tourist areas, such as national or provincial parks, the CBC also operates a series of transmitters that broadcast weather alerts from Environment Canada&#x27;s Weatheradio Canada service. 

The CBC formerly operated &quot;Galaxie&quot;, a digital television radio service that provides 45 channels of music programming to digital cable subscribers in both English and French. This service is now operated by Stingray Digital, who since relaunched the service as &quot;Stingray Music&quot;. The CBC also celebrates the generation of leaders, builders, and change-makers of Canada under the age of 40 through the CBC Future 40 People Choice Award.

==CBC Radio in the news==
In 2012, CBC Radio lost some of its funding due to large cuts in Canadian government spending. This has resulted in a reduction of the number of concerts being recorded, the closing of recording studios, and the laying off of technicians, as well as the introduction of four minutes per hour of advertising on the Radio 2 and Espace Musique stations. The CBC&#x27;s requirement to air advertising on the stations expired on August 31, 2016; it was fully discontinued on September 1.

<text>Guillaume de Champeaux (18 January 1121 in Châlons-en-Champagne), known in English as William of Champeaux and Latinised to Gulielmus de Campellis, was a French philosopher and theologian.

==Biography==
William was born at Champeaux near Melun. After studying under Anselm of Laon and Roscellinus, he taught in the school of the cathedral of Notre-Dame, of which he was made canon in 1103. Among his pupils was Peter Abelard, whom he had a disagreement with because Abelard challenged some of his ideas, and because William thought Abelard was too arrogant. Abelard calls him the &quot;supreme master&quot; of dialectic after he replaced his master as the new teacher. In 1108 he resigned his positions as archdeacon of Paris and master of Notre Dame, and retreated to the shrine of St Victor, outside the city walls of Paris, where, under his influence, there formed what would become the abbey of St Victor.

He was a friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, having helped Bernard recuperate from ill-health; later he motivated Bernard to write some of his important works including the &quot;Apologia&quot;, which was dedicated to William.

William left St Victor in 1113 when he became bishop of Châlons-en-Champagne, at which time he took part in the dispute concerning investitures as a supporter of Pope Callixtus II, whom he represented at the conference of Mousson. In 1114, he issued the &quot;Grande charte champenoise&quot; (Great Champagne Chart) which defined the agricultural and viticultural possessions of the Abbey of Saint-Pierre-aux-Monts, thus giving rise to the modern-day Champagne wine region as well as the Grande Charte House of Champagne named in French after the Grande Charte Champenoise and his sponsor Guillaume de Champeaux. After relinquishing his Benedictine Abbacy, he moved to a Cistercian monastery in Rheims, where he also composed a number of spiritual books, such as his &quot;Vita Prima&quot;, which were widely read in monastic circles.

His surviving works are a fragment on the Eucharist, inserted by Jean Mabillon in his edition of the works of St Bernard, and the &quot;Moralia A brevi ala&quot; and &quot;De Origine Animae&quot;. In the last of these he maintains that children who die unbaptized must be lost, the pure soul being defiled by the grossness of the body, and declares that God&#x27;s will is not to be questioned. He upholds the theory of Creationism (i.e., that a soul is specially created for each human being). Ravaisson-Mollien has discovered a number of fragments by him, among which the most important is the &quot;De Essentia Dei et de Substantia Dei&quot;; a &quot;Liber Sententiarum&quot;, consisting of discussions on ethics and scriptural interpretation, is also ascribed to Champeaux.

He is considered the founder of an early version of moderate realism, a philosophy which held that universals exist in particular things as common substances individuated by accidents and in the mind as concepts.

<text>STS-51-G was the 18th flight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the fifth flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The seven-day mission launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 17, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1985. Sultan bin Salman Al Saud from Saudi Arabia was on board as a payload specialist; Al Saud became the first Arab, the first Muslim, and the first member of a royal family to fly into space. It was also the first Space Shuttle mission which flew without at least one astronaut from the pre-Shuttle era among its crew.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
&quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39A, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), at 7:33 a.m. EDT on June 17, 1985. The mission&#x27;s crew members included Daniel C. Brandenstein, commander; John O. Creighton, pilot; Shannon W. Lucid, Steven R. Nagel, and John M. Fabian, mission specialists; and Patrick Baudry, from France, and Prince Sultan Sultan bin Salman Al Saud, from Saudi Arabia, both payload specialists.

STS-51-G carried three communications satellites as its primary cargo. These were Arabsat-1B (Arab Satellite Communications Organization); Morelos-1 (Mexico); and Telstar-303 (AT&amp;T Corporation); all three were Hughes-built satellites. All three successfully utilized Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) booster stages to achieve geostationary transfer orbits (GTO) after being deployed from &quot;Discovery&quot;.

Also carried was the SPARTAN-1 (Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for AstroNomy) a deployable/retrievable carrier module, designed to be deployed from the orbiter and fly free in space before being retrieved. SPARTAN-1 included of astronomy experiments. It was deployed and operated successfully, independent of the orbiter, before being retrieved. &quot;Discovery&quot; furthermore carried an experimental materials-processing furnace, two French biomedical experiments (French Echocardiograph Experiment (FEE) and French Postural Experiment (FPE)), and six Getaway Special (GAS) experiments, which were all successfully performed, although the GO34 Getaway Special shut down prematurely. This mission was also the first flight test of the OEX advanced autopilot which gave the orbiter capabilities above and beyond those of the baseline system.

The mission&#x27;s final payload element was a High Precision Tracking Experiment (HPTE) for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) (nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot;); the HPTE failed to deploy properly during its first try on the mission&#x27;s 37th orbit, because the orbiter was not at the correct attitude. It was successfully deployed on orbit 64.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base at 9:11:52 a.m. EDT on June 24, 1985, after a mission duration of 7 days, 1 hour, 38 minutes, and 52 seconds.

== Mission Insignia ==
The STS-51-G insignia illustrates the advances in aviation technology in the United States within a relatively short span of the twentieth century with &quot;Discovery&quot; flying over the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;. A gold-and-orange-flame eagle forms the base of the insigna. The surnames of the crewmembers for the &quot;Discovery&quot;″s mission appear near the center edge of the circular design, with the French and Saudi crewmembers added below, with a respective flag icon along their name. Although Baudry was the first French citizen to fly with a Space Shuttle mission into space, he was only the second Frenchman to go to space, following Jean-Loup Chrétien&#x27;s earlier missions with Soyuz capsule, Soyuz T-6.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="497704" wikidata="Q906228" url="?curid=497704" title="List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union">
<text>A state of the United States is one of the 50 constituent entities that shares its sovereignty with the federal government. Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside, due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government. Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia use the term &quot;commonwealth&quot; rather than &quot;state&quot; in their full official names.

States are the primary subdivisions of the United States. They possess all powers not granted to the federal government, nor prohibited to them by the Constitution of the United States. In general, state governments have the power to regulate issues of local concern, such as regulating intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, public school policy, and non-federal road construction and maintenance. Each state has its own constitution grounded in republican principles, and government consisting of executive, legislative, and judicial branches. 

All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two senators, and at least one representative, while the size of a state&#x27;s House delegation depends on its total population, as determined by the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States, equal to the total of representatives and senators in Congress from that state. 

Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.

==List of U.S. states==
The following table is a list of all 50 states and their respective dates of statehood. The first 13 became states in July 1776 upon agreeing to the United States Declaration of Independence, and each joined the first Union of states between 1777 and 1781, upon ratifying the Articles of Confederation, its first constitution. (A separate table is included below showing AoC ratification dates.) These states are presented in the order in which each ratified the 1787 Constitution and joined the others in the new (and current) federal government. The date of admission listed for each subsequent state is the official date set by Act of Congress.

==Articles of Confederation ratification dates==
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles of Confederation for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777. The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. On March 4, 1789, the general government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the present Constitution.

<doc id="497705" wikidata="Q1747342" url="?curid=497705" title="NUnit">
<text>NUnit is an open-source unit testing framework for the .NET Framework and Mono. It serves the same purpose as JUnit does in the Java world, and is one of many programs in the xUnit family.

== Features ==
* Tests can be run from a console runner, within Visual Studio through a Test Adapter, or through 3rd party runners.
* Tests can be run in parallel.
* Strong support for data driven tests.
* Supports multiple platforms including .NET Core, Xamarin Mobile, Compact Framework and Silverlight.
* Every test case can be added to one or more categories, to allow for selective running.

NUnit provides a console runner (nunit3-console.exe), which is used for batch execution of tests. The console runner works through the NUnit Test Engine, which provides it with the ability to load, explore and execute tests. When tests are to be run in a separate process, the engine makes use of the nunit-agent program to run them.

The NUnitLite runner may be used in situations where a simpler runner is more suitable. It allows developers to create self-executing tests.

== Assertions ==
NUnit provides a rich set of assertions as static methods of the codice_1 class. If an assertion fails, the method call does not return and an error is reported. If a test contains multiple assertions, any that follow the one that failed will not be executed. For this reason, it&#x27;s usually best to try for one assertion per test.

Nunit 3.x is supporting multiple assertions.
[Test]
public void ComplexNumberTest()
 ComplexNumber result = SomeCalculation();

 Assert.Multiple(() =&gt;
 Assert.AreEqual(5.2, result.RealPart, &quot;Real part&quot;);
 Assert.AreEqual(3.9, result.ImaginaryPart, &quot;Imaginary part&quot;);
}
=== Classical ===
Before NUnit 2.4, a separate method of the codice_1 class was used for each different assertion. It continues to be supported in NUnit, since many people prefer it.

Each assert method may be called without a message, with a simple text message or with a message and arguments. In the last case the message is formatted using the provided text and arguments.
// Equality asserts
Assert.AreEqual(object expected, object actual);
Assert.AreEqual(object expected, object actual, string message, params object[] parms);

Assert.AreNotEqual(object expected, object actual);
Assert.AreNotEqual(object expected, object actual, string message, params object[] parms);

// Identity asserts
Assert.AreSame(object expected, object actual);
Assert.AreSame(object expected, object actual, string message, params object[] parms);

Assert.AreNotSame(object expected, object actual);
Assert.AreNotSame(object expected, object actual, string message, params object[] parms);

// Condition asserts
// (For simplicity, methods with message signatures are omitted.)
Assert.IsTrue(bool condition);
Assert.IsFalse(bool condition);

Assert.IsNull(object anObject);
Assert.IsNotNull(object anObject);

Assert.IsNaN(double aDouble);

Assert.IsEmpty(string aString);
Assert.IsNotEmpty(string aString);

Assert.IsEmpty(ICollection collection);
Assert.IsNotEmpty(ICollection collection);
=== Constraint based ===
Beginning with NUnit 2.4, a new &quot;Constraint-based&quot; model was introduced. This approach uses a single method of the codice_1 class for all assertions, passing a codice_4 object that specifies the test to be performed. This constraint-based model is now used internally by NUnit for all assertions. The methods of the classic approach have been re-implemented on top of this new model.

== Example ==
Example of an NUnit test fixture:

using NUnit.Framework;
[TestFixture]
public class ExampleTestOfNUnit
 [Test]
 public void TestMultiplication()
 Assert.AreEqual(4, 2*2, &quot;Multiplication&quot;);
 // Equivalently, since version 2.4 NUnit offers a new and
 // more intuitive assertion syntax based on constraint objects
 Assert.That(2*2, Is.EqualTo(4), &quot;Multiplication constraint-based&quot;);
}

// The following example shows different ways of writing the same exception test.

[TestFixture]
public class AssertThrowsTests
 [Test]
 public void Tests()
 // .NET 1.x
 Assert.Throws(typeof(ArgumentException),
 new TestDelegate(MethodThatThrows));
 // .NET 2.0
 Assert.Throws&lt;ArgumentException&gt;(MethodThatThrows);
 Assert.Throws&lt;ArgumentException&gt;(
 delegate { throw new ArgumentException(); });

 // Using C# 3.0 
 Assert.Throws&lt;ArgumentException&gt;(
 () =&gt; { throw new ArgumentException(); });
 
 void MethodThatThrows()
 throw new ArgumentException();
}

// This example shows use of the return value to perform additional verification of the exception.

[TestFixture]
public class UsingReturnValue
 [Test]
 public void TestException()
 MyException ex = Assert.Throws&lt;MyException&gt;(
 delegate { throw new MyException(&quot;message&quot;, 42); });
 Assert.That(ex.Message, Is.EqualTo(&quot;message&quot;));
 Assert.That(ex.MyParam, Is.EqualTo(42)); 
}

// This example does the same thing using the overload that includes a constraint.

[TestFixture]
public class UsingConstraint
 [Test]
 public void TestException()
 Assert.Throws(Is.Typeof&lt;MyException&gt;()
 .And.Message.EqualTo(&quot;message&quot;)
 .And.Property(&quot;MyParam&quot;).EqualTo(42),
 delegate { throw new MyException(&quot;message&quot;, 42); });
}
The NUnit framework discovers the method codice_5 automatically by reflection.

== Extensions ==
FireBenchmarks is an addin able to record execution time of unit tests and generate XML, CSV, XHTML performances reports with charts and history tracking. Its main purpose is to enable a developer or a team that work with an agile methodology to integrate performance metrics and analysis into the unit testing environment, to easily control and monitor the evolution of a software system in terms of algorithmic complexity and system resources load.

NUnit.Forms is an expansion to the core NUnit framework and is also open source. It specifically looks at expanding NUnit to be able to handle testing user interface elements in Windows Forms. As of January 2013, Nunit.Forms is in Alpha release, and no versions have been released since May 2006.

NUnit.ASP is a discontinued expansion to the core NUnit framework and is also open source. It specifically looks at expanding NUnit to be able to handle testing user interface elements in ASP.Net.

<text>STS-51-I was the 20th mission of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and the sixth flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. During the mission, &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed three communications satellites into orbit. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 27, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1985.

* Duration: 4 hours, 26 minutes

== Mission summary ==
&quot;Discovery&quot; launched at 6:58 a.m. EDT on August 27, 1985. Two earlier launch attempts, one on August 24 and another on August 25, were scrubbed – the first because of poor weather, and the second because the backup orbiter computer failed and had to be replaced. The successful launch on August 27, 1985, took place just as an approaching storm front reached the launch pad area.

The five-man STS-51-I crew included Joe H. Engle, commander; Richard O. Covey, pilot; and James D. A. van Hoften, John M. Lounge, and William F. Fisher, mission specialists. Their primary mission was to deploy three commercial communications satellites and retrieve and repair the Syncom IV-3 (Leasat-3) satellite, which had been deployed during the STS-51-D mission in April 1985, but had malfunctioned. In addition, a mid-deck materials processing experiment, the Physical Vapor Transport Organic Solid Experiment (PVTOS), was flown aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;.

The three communications satellites were Aussat-1, a multi-purpose spacecraft owned by Australia; ASC-1, owned and operated by the American Satellite Corporation (ASC); and Syncom IV-4 (Leasat-4), leased to the Department of Defense (DoD) by its builder, Hughes Space and Communications. Both Aussat-1 and ASC-1 were deployed on the day of the launch, August 27, 1985. Syncom IV-4 (Leasat-4) was deployed two days later. All three achieved their planned geosynchronous orbits and became operational.

On the fifth day of the mission, astronauts Fisher and van Hoften began repair efforts on the malfunctioning Syncom IV-3, following a successful rendezvous maneuver by &quot;Discovery&quot;. The effort was slowed by a problem with the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) elbow joint. After a second EVA by Fisher and van Hoften, the satellite&#x27;s control lever was repaired, permitting commands from the ground to activate the spacecraft&#x27;s systems and eventually send it into its proper geosynchronous orbit. The two EVAs lasted a total of 11 hours and 46 minutes.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed on Runway 23 at Edwards Air Force Base at 6:16 a.m. PDT on September 3, 1985. The flight lasted a total of 7 days, 2 hours, 18 minutes and 42 seconds, during which the shuttle completed 112 orbits of the Earth.

== Mission insignia ==
The insignia depicts an American bald eagle, trailing red and white stripes, and pushing a boundary layer forward. The 19 stars, along with the eagle, are references to the 20th shuttle mission (with the eagle representing the orbiter and thus being the 20th &quot;star&quot;). Lining the patch are the surnames of the crew members.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-51-J was NASA&#x27;s 21st Space Shuttle mission and the maiden flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. It launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985, carrying a payload for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985.

== Mission summary ==
STS-51-J launched on October 3, 1985, at 15:15:30 UTC (11:15:30 a.m. EDT), from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The launch was delayed by 22 minutes and 30 seconds due to a problem with a main engine liquid hydrogen prevalve close remote power controller; the controller was showing a faulty &quot;on&quot; indication.

The mission was the second shuttle flight totally dedicated to deploying a United States Department of Defense payload, after STS-51-C. Its cargo was classified, but it was reported that two (USA-11 and USA-12) DSCS-III (Defense Satellite Communications System) satellites were launched into geostationary orbits by an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS). The DSCS satellites used X-band frequencies (8/7 GHz). Each DSCS-III satellite had a design life of ten years, although several of the DSCS satellites have far exceeded their design life expectancy.

The mission was deemed successful. After a flight lasting 4 days, 1 hour, 44 minutes and 38 seconds, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on Runway 23 at Edwards Air Force Base at 17:00:08 UTC (13:00:08 EDT) on October 7, 1985. During STS-51-J, mission commander Bobko became the first astronaut to fly on three different shuttle orbiters, and the only astronaut to fly on the maiden voyages of two different orbiters.

== Mission insignia ==
The 51-J mission insignia, designed by &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s first crew, pays tribute to the Statue of Liberty and the ideas it symbolizes, but also as not to emphasize the &quot;classified&quot; nature of the mission like the first one did. The historical gateway figure bears additional significance for astronauts Karol J. Bobko, mission commander; and Ronald J. Grabe, pilot, both New York City natives.

<doc id="497711" wikidata="Q2353587" url="?curid=497711" title="M-78 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-78 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The western terminus is the intersection with M-66 north of Battle Creek in Pennfield Township. The roadway runs through rural farmland and the community of Bellevue as it approaches its eastern terminus at an interchange with Interstate 69 (I-69) near Olivet. The highway is used by between 3,100 and 5,300 vehicles on a daily basis.

When the state highway system was signed in 1919, M-78 followed a similar routing. At Bellevue, it turned northeast to terminate at Charlotte. In the 1920s, the highway was extended southerly to the Indiana state line near Sturgis and northeasterly into the Lansing area. In the 1930s, M-78 was extended further on its northern and eastern end to Flint. The highway was converted into a freeway in sections starting in the 1960s. During that decade, the southern extension from the 1920s was removed from M-78 and added to other state highways, and in the 1970s, the northeastern extensions, now mostly freeways, were removed from M-78 as well. Two special routes were created as a result of the various reroutings in the Lansing area, both of which are no longer part of the state highway system.

==Route description==
M-78 begins at an intersection with M-66 in Pennfield Township, north of Battle Creek in Calhoun County. The trunkline passes through rural farm lands as it runs due east and northeast. It briefly crosses the southeast corner of Barry County as it enters Eaton County. There M-78 follows Battle Creek Highway past some small ponds and into the town of Bellevue. The trunkline becomes Capitol Avenue in town and turns south onto Main Street in the middle of the central business district. M-78 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway before leaving town. Main Street turns easterly and becomes Butterfield Highway. M-78 crosses the Battle Creek River before terminating at I-69&#x27;s exit 48 in Bellevue Township.

M-78 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-78 were the 5,256 vehicles daily on Capitol Avenue in Bellevue; the lowest counts were the 3,176 vehicles per day in Calhoun County. No part of M-78 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
When the original state highway system was designated , M-78 ran along a route similar that of today. It started north of Battle Creek at a junction with then M-79 and cut through the corner of Barry County to Bellevue, but it turned northeasterly to end at Charlotte at a junction with M-29. By 1927, M-78 was extended southward, replacing M-79 to the Indiana state line, connecting with State Road 9 (SR 9) south of Sturgis. At the same time, a northerly addition extended the highway concurrently along US Highway 27 (US 27) to Dewitt and then solo to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg. The section north of Lansing was changed in 1929. The section from Dewitt Pittsburg was redesignated M-104, and M-78 was extended through East Lansing to Haslett. By 1936, the highway was extended all the way into Flint to end at M-21. Around the same time, a second routing through downtown Lansing for US 27/M-78 was designated along Capitol Avenue; the former route along Main, Kalamazoo and Larch streets and Grand Avenue was given the Truck M-78 designation.

In the latter half of 1941 or the beginning of 1942, a section of the concurrent M-78/M-86 was rerouted west of Colon in St. Joseph County. In 1950, the bridge across the Grand River on Main Street was completed; after completion, the mainline M-78 was routed over the bridge and up Larch Street, replacing Truck M-78 in the process. The former car-only route on Capitol Avenue was removed from the state highway system. By the middle of 1960, the first section of freeway along M-78 was opened in the Lennon area. The next year, the freeway had been extended as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon. By the start of 1962, M-78 was a freeway from Perry at the junction with M-47 all the way to Swartz Creek near Flint.

On December 12, 1962, the I-96 freeway was completed around the south and west sides of Lansing, and a year later, the I-496 freeway was completed north into downtown from I-96. M-78 was rerouted from the I-96/US 27 interchange southwest of Lansing east along I-96 and then north on I-496. From there, M-78 followed the one-way pairing of Homer and Howard streets from the northern end of the freeway up to the one-way couplet of Saginaw Street and Grand River Avenue, returning to its previous routing. The former route through downtown along US 27 was redesignated Business M-78 (Bus. M-78) at the same time.

M-66 was extended southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M-78 in 1965. The US 127 freeway was completed from Mason north to Lansing in 1966, adding the US 127 designation along the I-496/M-78 freeway. The next year, M-78&#x27;s freeway was extended eastward to I-75/US 10/US 23 in Flint. The US 127/M-78 freeway was extended north of I-496 in 1969, and a discontinuous section of M-78 freeway east of Flint was completed around the same time frame. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed and the Bus. M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. In 1972, the highway was rerouted to run east of Bellevue to Olivet instead of northeast to Charlotte. The next year, all of M-78 northeast of Olivet was removed when I-69 between Charlotte and I-96 southwest of Lansing was completed; this truncation produced the modern routing of M-78 in the state.

==Related routes==

===Truck route===

Truck M-78 was a former truck route through the city of Lansing. It started at the corner of Capitol Avenue and Main Street and ran along Main Street to Grand Avenue. There, it turned north on Grand Avenue to Kalamazoo Street and turned east on Kalamazoo over the Grand River. At Larch Street, Truck M-78 continued north to rejoin the mainline at the corner of Larch and Saginaw streets.

By the middle of 1936, the US 27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The mainline was restricted to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designed as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US 27 was rerouted to use it to connect to Larch Street. From there north, US 27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.

===Business route===

Business M-78 (Bus. M-78) was a business loop through the city of Lansing. It ran from an interchange between US 27/M-78 and I-96 on the southwest side of Lansing along US 27 (Lansing Road) into downtown. From there, it ran east on Main Street and north on Larch Street. At Saginaw Street, Bus. M-78 turned east to reconnect to M-78.

The business loop was created in 1963 when M-78 was rerouted along the newly completed sections of the I-96 and I-496 freeways in the Lansing area. The designation was decommissioned in 1970 when I-496 was completed through downtown Lansing.

<text>STS-61-A (also known as Spacelab D-1) was the 22nd mission of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program. It was a scientific Spacelab mission, funded and directed by West Germany – hence the non-NASA designation of D-1 (for Deutschland-1). STS-61-A was the ninth and last successful flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; before the disaster. STS-61-A holds the current record for the largest crew—eight people—aboard any single spacecraft for the entire period from launch to landing.

The mission carried the NASA/European Space Agency (ESA) Spacelab module into orbit with 76 scientific experiments on board, and was declared a success. Payload operations were controlled from the German Space Operations Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, West Germany, instead of from the regular NASA control center. This was the first spaceflight to include multiple crewmembers from any single country other than the United States or Soviet Union. The crew also included the first Dutch citizen astronaut, payload specialist Wubbo Ockels. 

== Crew ==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 12:00 p.m. EST on October 30, 1985. This was the first Space Shuttle mission largely financed and operated by another nation, West Germany. It was also the only Shuttle flight to launch with a crew of eight. The crew members included Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., commander; Steven R. Nagel, pilot; Bonnie J. Dunbar, James F. Buchli and Guion S. Bluford, mission specialists; and Ernst Messerschmid and Reinhard Furrer of West Germany, along with first Dutch astronaut Wubbo J. Ockels of the European Space Agency (ESA), all payload specialists.

The primary task of STS-61-A was to conduct a series of experiments, almost all related to functions in microgravity, in Spacelab D-1, the third flight of a Spacelab orbital laboratory module. Two other mission assignments were to deploy the Global Low Orbiting Message Relay Satellite (GLOMR) out of a Getaway Special (GAS) canister in the cargo bay, and to operate five materials processing experiments, which were mounted in the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay on a separate device called the German Unique Support Structure. The experiments included investigations into fluid physics, with experiments in capillarity, Marangoni convection, diffusion phenomena, and critical points; solidification experiments; single crystal growth; composites; biological studies, including cell functions, developmental processes, and the ability of plants to perceive gravity; medical experiments, including the gravitational perceptions of humans, and their adaptation processes in space; and speed-time interaction studies of people working in space.

One equipment item of unusual interest was the Vestibular Sled, an ESA contribution consisting of a seat for a test subject that could be moved backward and forward with precisely controlled accelerations and stops, along rails fixed to the floor of the Spacelab aisle. By taking detailed measurements on a human strapped into the seat, scientists gained data on the functional organization of the human vestibular and orientation systems, and the vestibular adaptation processes under microgravity. The acceleration experiments by the sled riders were combined with thermal stimulations of the inner ear and optokinetic stimulations of the eye.

NASA operated the Space Shuttle, and was responsible for overall safety and control functions throughout the flight. West Germany was responsible for the scientific research carried out during the seven-day mission. To fulfill this function, German scientific controllers on the ground worked closely with the personnel in orbit, operating out of the German Space Operations Center at Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich, West Germany. The orbiting crew was divided into two teams, working in shifts to ensure laboratory work was performed 24 hours a day. Communications were optimal throughout the mission and the ground and orbital crews were able to interact regularly. The overall system of one control center controlling spacecraft operations and a second controlling experiment functions worked smoothly in practice.

The GLOMR satellite was successfully deployed during the mission, and the five experiments mounted on the separate structure behind the Spacelab module obtained useful data. &quot;Challenger&quot; landed, for what was to be the last time, on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base on November 6, 1985. The wheels stopped rolling at 12:45 p.m. EST, after a mission duration of 7 days, 0 hour, 44 minutes, and 51 seconds.

STS-61-A marked the last successful mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, which would be destroyed with all hands on board during the launch of the STS-51-L mission on January 28, 1986.

== Records ==
STS-61-A with its crew of 8 set a record as the highest number of people in space on a single spacecraft. The first seven-person Shuttle mission had been STS-41-G in October 1984.

STS-61-A was not the first Space Shuttle flight of an ESA astronaut or a West German citizen, as Ulf Merbold, who also served as the backup on this mission, had previously flown on the STS-9 mission in 1983, but Wubbo Ockels became the first Dutch citizen in space.

Guion S. Bluford at the time was already the first African-American in space, having previously flown on STS-8. With STS-61-A he became the first African-American to fly in space twice. He would later go on to fly on STS-39 in 1991 and on STS-53 in 1992. Bluford was a member of the U.S. astronaut class of 1978.

== Mission insignia ==
The insignia was chosen by the eight members of the STS-61A/D1 Spacelab mission to represent the record-sized Space Shuttle crew. Crewmembers surnames surround the colorful patch scene depicting &quot;Challenger&quot; carrying a long science module and an international crew from Europe and the United States, and as the module is primarily part of the German contribution to the mission, the German flag and the mission suffix D-1 are prominently depicted. As to further distinguish Ockels, being the first Dutch citizen to fly into space, gets attributed an ESA logo to his name, instead of the more traditional addition of the respective non-US members being attributed with their respective nation&#x27;s flags, as the patch already was that elaborately showing such.

<text>STS-61-B was the 23rd NASA Space Shuttle mission, and its second using Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The shuttle was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 26, 1985. During STS-61-B, the shuttle crew deployed three communications satellites, and tested techniques of constructing structures in orbit. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 16:33:49 EST on December 3, 1985, after 6 days, 21 hours, 4 minutes, and 49 seconds in orbit.

STS-61-B marked the quickest turnaround of a Shuttle orbiter from launch to launch in history – just 54 days elapsed between &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ launch on STS-51-J and launch on STS-61-B. , this is still the record for turn around between two flights of the same orbital space vehicle. The mission was also notable for carrying the first Mexican astronaut, Rodolfo Neri Vela. This was also &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ second and final mission before the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986. The Challenger disaster would ground the shuttle fleet for two and a half years and &quot;Atlantis&quot; would not fly again until STS-27, which launched three years later on December 2, 1988.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Shuttle processing ==
After landing at the Edwards Air Force Base at the end of STS-51-J on October 7, 1985, &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to the Kennedy Space Center on October 12, 1985. The shuttle was moved directly into an Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), where post-flight de-servicing and pre-flight processing took place simultaneously.

After only 26 days in the OPF, a record fast processing in the history of the Space Shuttle program, the shuttle was rolled to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on November 7, 1985. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was mated with the External Tank (ET) and Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) stack and was rolled out to launch LC-39A on November 12, 1985.

== Payload ==
Three satellites were deployed during this mission: Aussat-2, Morelos-2, and Satcom-K2. Aussat-2 and Morelos-2 were the second satellites in their series (the first satellites in the series were deployed during STS-51-I and STS-51-G). Both of these were Hughes Space and Communications HS-376 satellites and were equipped with a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) booster to reach geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). Satcom-K2 was a version of the RCA 4000 series satellites, which were owned and operated by RCA American Communications (RCA). This satellite was deployed using a PAM-D2 booster (which was a larger version of the PAM-D). This was the first flight of the PAM-D2 booster on a Space Shuttle.

All three satellites were successfully deployed, one at a time, and their booster stages fired automatically to lift them to geostationary transfer orbits. Their respective owners assumed charge, and later fired the onboard kick motors at apogee, to circularize the orbits and align them with the equator.

=== Middeck payloads ===
* Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES)
* Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions (DMOS)
* Morelos Payload Specialist Experiments (MPSE) and Orbiter Experiments (OEX)

=== Other items ===
A checkered racing flag was carried on board &quot;Atlantis&quot; during STS-61-B; the flag is now on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. This was also the second test flight of the Orbiter Experiments (OEX) advanced autopilot. It ran for approximately 65 hours and demonstrated the ability to fly the orbiter on nose jets only, aft jets only, to automatically stationkeep on another satellite and to fly an orbit with zero aerodynamic drag. The OEX autopilot was also more fuel efficient than the baseline system.

== Mission summary ==

Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center at 19:29:00 p.m. EST on November 26, 1985. The launch marked the second night launch of the Space Shuttle program, and the ninth and final flight of 1985.

A key element of the mission&#x27;s objectives was EASE/ACCESS, an experiment in assembling large structures in space. EASE/ACCESS was a joint venture between the Langley Research Center (LRC) and the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). ACCESS was a &quot;high-rise&quot; tower composed of many small struts and nodes. EASE was a geometric structure shaped like an inverted pyramid, that was composed of a few large beams and nodes. Together, these experiments demonstrated the feasibility of assembling large preformed structures in space. Astronauts Ross and Spring performed two spacewalks on the mission, which marked the 50th, and 51st extravehicular activity (EVAs) for the United States, and the 12th and the 13th for the Shuttle program. An IMAX camera mounted in the cargo bay filmed the activities of the astronauts engaged in the EASE/ACCESS work, as well as other scenes of interest.

&quot;This is probably not the preferred way of building a space station&quot;, Ross said later of EASE. The astronauts reported that the most difficult part of the spacewalks was torquing their own masses while holding the EASE beams. They found that ACCESS worked well, while EASE required too much free floating. The astronauts judged that performing six-hour spacewalks every other day over a five or six-day period was feasible, and recommended glove changes to reduce hand fatigue. Ross said in the EVA debrief that the crew had tried to have the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) manifested for use in the second spacewalk, because &quot;for certain applications it would be very useful. In particular if you were building portions of a space station attached to the orbiter, then moving those portions farther than the manipulator arm could transport them&quot;. He added that the MMU could be used to attach cable runs and instruments in places that were out of reach of the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm (Canadarm).

During the mission astronaut Rodolfo Neri Vela accomplished a series of experiments, that were primarily related to human physiology. He also photographed Mexico and Mexico City as part of the mission&#x27;s Earth observations. However, Commander Brewster Shaw installed a padlock on the hatch control because he was &quot;particularly concerned&quot; that the Mexican could &quot;flip out&quot; during the mission. Shaw had noted that he didn&#x27;t think that Neri Vela noticed the padlock, but that the other members of the crew did. Astronaut Charles Walker again operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES), the third flight of this larger and improved equipment, to produce commercial pharmaceutical products in microgravity. An experiment in Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions (DMOS), was conducted successfully for 3M. The object of this experiment was to grow single crystals that were larger and more pure than any that could be grown on Earth. One Getaway Special (GAS) canister stored in &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s payload bay carried a Canadian student experiment, which involved the fabrication of mirrors in microgravity with higher performance than ones made on Earth.

All the experiments on this mission were successfully accomplished, and all equipment operated within established parameters. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed safely at Edwards Air Force Base at 16:33:49 EST on December 3, 1985, after a mission lasting 6 days, 21 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds. Atlantis landed one orbit earlier than planned due to lighting concerns at the Edwards. Rollout distance on landing was lasting 78 seconds.

== Spacewalks ==
Two spacewalks were conducted during the STS-61-B mission to demonstrate assembly techniques which might be used in space station assembly.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="497717" wikidata="Q466496" url="?curid=497717" title="FTSE 100 Index">
<text>The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, also called the FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 100, FTSE, or, informally, the &quot;Footsie&quot; , is the United Kingdom&#x27;s best-known stock market index of the 100 most highly capitalised blue chips listed on the London Stock Exchange. 

==History==
The index started on 3 January 1984, having been constructed by the London Stock Exchange to better reflect activity on the market. The index would replace the Financial Times&#x27; own FT 30 after its public unveiling on 14 February. As late as 10 February, the Stock Exchange referred to the index as &#x27;SE 100&#x27;, cutting out the Financial Times who had not contributed to its construction. Recognition was ultimately given to the fact that having the FT involved in the official launch possessed value.

The new index allowed the Stock Exchange&#x27;s own London Traded Options Market (LTOM) to launch an options contract derived from the FTSE&#x27;s real-time data in May 1984, while competitors LIFFE were quick to coincide their launch of the futures contract.

Usage of the index grew, although the tradeable index contracts struggled to gain traction: annual volume on the FTSE futures contract fell short of 89,000 in 1985, pale in comparison to the 15 million lots traded on the S&amp;P 500 index contract. By 1986, Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s sweeping financial deregulation and high profile privatisations of index members British Telecom, British Gas, and British Aerospace had culminated in the Big Bang. The combination of a new index, major privatisations, LIFFE tradable derivatives, and promotion by the Financial Times led to the FTSE 100 becoming the most widely used indicator of whether the UK stock market was rising or falling.

In 1987, privatisations continued with British Airways and British Petroleum. The latter concluded on the same day as Black Monday, a crash in which the index fell 21.73% in two days; one of those days is still the index&#x27;s worst single-day return, –12.22%.

2024 saw delistings from the London market in numbers not seen since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, with companies citing higher valuations and cheaper costs available by switching to NYSE. Among them Ashtead Group, CRH, and Flutter represented almost £120 billion in FTSE 100 market capitalisation. Takeovers from private equity further reduced the available pool of companies that could be drawn on to populate the index, with Hargreaves Lansdown also set to delist. Across the entire exchange there were five delistings for every new issue, with speculation at the close of the year around the future of index stalwarts British American Tobacco, Rio Tinto, and Shell.

==Description==
The index has trading symbol UKX and is maintained by FTSE Russell, a wholly owned subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group, which originated as a joint venture between the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and the London Stock Exchange. It is calculated in real time and published every second when the market is open.

The FTSE 100 broadly consists of the largest 100 qualifying UK companies by full market value. The total market value of a company is calculated by multiplying the share price of the company by the total number of shares they have issued. However, many of these are internationally focused companies: therefore the index&#x27;s movements are a fairly weak indicator of how the UK economy is faring and are significantly affected by the exchange rates of the pound sterling. A better indication of the UK economy is the FTSE 250 Index, as it contains a smaller proportion of international companies.

Even though the FTSE All-Share Index is more comprehensive, the FTSE 100 is by far the most widely used UK stock market indicator. Other related indices are the FTSE 250 Index (which includes the next largest 250 companies after the FTSE 100), the FTSE 350 Index (which is the aggregation of the FTSE 100 and 250), FTSE SmallCap Index and the FTSE Fledgling Index. The FTSE All-Share aggregates the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE SmallCap.

The index consists of 20 ICB sectors, four of which had a market capitalisation exceeding £200 billion . These are Banks, Health Care, Industrial Goods and Services and Energy, which together account for approximately 48% of the index&#x27;s capitalisation. On the same date, there were four companies with a market cap exceeding £100 billion: AstraZeneca, Shell, HSBC and Unilever, which together accounted for approximately 28% of the market cap.

Each calendar quarter, the FTSE&#x27;s constituents are reviewed and some companies exit or enter the index, resulting in irregular trading volume and price changes as market participants rebalance their portfolios.

===Weighting===
In the FTSE indices, share prices are weighted by free-float capitalisation, so that the larger companies, with more of their stock &quot;floating&quot;, make more of a difference to the index than smaller companies. The basic formula for these indices is:

formula_1

The free float adjustment factor represents the percentage of all issued shares that are readily available for trading, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%. The free-float capitalisation of a company is its market capitalisation multiplied by its free float adjustment factor. It therefore does not include restricted stocks, such as those held by company insiders.

==FT 30==

The oldest continuous index in the UK is the FT 30, also known as the Financial Times Index or the FT Ordinary Index (FTOI). It was established in 1935 and nowadays is largely obsolete due to its redundancy. It is similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and companies listed are from the industrial and commercial sectors. Financial sector companies and government stocks are excluded.

Of the original constituents, three are currently in the FTSE 100: Tate &amp; Lyle, Imperial Tobacco and Rolls-Royce, although Rolls-Royce has not been continuously listed and Imperial Tobacco was a subsidiary of Hanson for a number of years, and is now renamed as Imperial Brands. Only one of the original FT 30 companies is still in that index: Tate &amp; Lyle (membership is not strictly based on market capitalisation, so this does not mean they are necessarily among the top thirty companies in the FTSE 100). The best performer from the original lineup has been Imperial Tobacco.

<doc id="497718" wikidata="Q658305" url="?curid=497718" title="STS-61-C">
<text>STS-61-C was the 24th mission of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the seventh mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. It was the first time that &quot;Columbia&quot;, the first space-rated Space Shuttle orbiter to be constructed, had flown since STS-9. The mission launched from Florida&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986, and landed six days later on January 18, 1986. STS-61-C&#x27;s seven-person crew included the first Costa Rican-born astronaut, Franklin Chang-Díaz, the second African-American shuttle pilot, Charles Bolden, and the second sitting politician to fly in space, Rep. Bill Nelson (D-FL). Both Bolden and Nelson would also later go on to become Administrators of NASA. STS-61-C was the last shuttle mission before the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, which occurred ten days after STS-61-C&#x27;s landing.

== Crew ==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission background ==

STS-61-C saw &quot;Columbia&quot; return to flight for the first time since the STS-9 mission in November 1983, after having undergone major modifications over the course of 18 months by Rockwell International in California. Most notable of these modifications was the addition of the SILTS (Shuttle Infrared Leeside Temperature Sensing) pod atop &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; vertical stabilizer, which used an infrared camera to observe reentry heating on the shuttle&#x27;s left wing and part of its fuselage. The camera was only used for a few more missions after STS-61-C, but the pod remained on &quot;Columbia&quot; for the remainder of its operational life. Smaller and more discreet modifications were also added at various points throughout the shuttle. The bulky ejection seats, which had been disabled after STS-4, were replaced with conventional seats and head-up displays for the commander and pilot were installed.

The launch was originally scheduled for December 18, 1985, but the closeout of an aft orbiter compartment was delayed, and the mission was rescheduled for the following day. However, on December 19, 1985, the countdown was stopped at T−14 seconds due to an out-of-tolerance turbine reading on the right SRB&#x27;s hydraulic system. Another launch attempt, on January 6, 1986, was terminated at T−31 seconds because of a problem in a valve in the liquid oxygen system. The countdown was recycled to T−20 minutes for a second launch attempt on the same day, but was held at T−9 minutes, and then scrubbed as the launch window expired. Another attempt was made on January 7, 1986, but was scrubbed because of bad weather at contingency landing sites at Dakar, Senegal, and Morón de la Frontera, Spain; yet another attempt, on January 9, 1986, was delayed because of a problem with a main engine prevalve, and on January 10, 1986, heavy rainfall in the launch area led to another scrub.

== Mission summary ==
After four unsuccessful launch attempts, &quot;Columbia&quot; launched successfully from Kennedy Space Center at 6:55:00 a.m. EST on January 12, 1986. There were no significant anomalies reported during the launch.

The primary objective of the mission was to deploy the Satcom-K1 communications satellite, second in a planned series of geosynchronous satellites owned and operated by RCA Americom; the deployment was successful. &quot;Columbia&quot; also carried a large number of small scientific experiments, including 13 Getaway Special (GAS) canisters devoted to investigations involving the effect of microgravity on materials processing, seed germination, chemical reactions, egg hatching, astronomy, atmospheric physics, and an experiment designed by Ellery Kurtz and Howard Wishnow of Vertical Horizons* to determine the effects of the space environment on fine arts materials and original oil paintings, flying four of Kurtz&#x27;s paintings into space. It also carried the Materials Science Laboratory-2 structure for experiments involving liquid bubble suspension by sound waves, melting and resolidification of metallic samples and container-less melting and solidification of electrically conductive specimens. Another small experiment carrier located in the payload bay was the Hitchhiker G-1 (HHG-1), which carried three experiments to study film particles in the orbiter environment, test a new heat transfer system and determine the effects of contamination and atomic oxygen on ultraviolet optics materials, respectively. There were also four in-cabin experiments, three of them part of the Shuttle Student Involvement Program. The shuttle carried an experiment called the Comet Halley Active Monitoring Program (CHAMP), consisting of a camera intended to photograph Halley&#x27;s Comet through the aft flight deck overhead window. This experiment proved unsuccessful because of battery problems.

According to Bolden, in addition to deploying the RCA satellite, Cenker operated a classified experiment for the United States Air Force during the mission. Bolden was only told that it was a prototype for an infrared imaging camera.

STS-61-C was originally scheduled to last seven days, but NASA decided to end it after four because its delays had delayed the next flight, STS-51-L. It was rescheduled to land on January 17, 1986, but this was brought forward by one day. However, the landing attempt on January 16, 1986, was canceled because of unfavorable weather at Edwards Air Force Base. Continued bad weather forced another wave-off the following day. The flight was extended one more day to provide for a landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center on January 18, 1986 – this was in order to avoid time lost in an Edwards Air Force Base landing and turnaround. However, bad weather at the KSC landing site resulted in yet another wave-off.

&quot;Columbia&quot; finally landed at Edwards Air Force Base on its fifth landing attempt at 5:59:51 a.m. PST, on January 18, 1986. The mission lasted a total of 6 days, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 51 seconds. STS-61-C was the last successful Space Shuttle flight before the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, which occurred on January 28, 1986, only 10 days after &quot;Columbia&quot;″s return. Accordingly, commander Gibson later called the STS-61-C mission &quot;The End of Innocence&quot; for the Shuttle Program.

Nelson, the Florida congressman, had hoped to receive a Florida orange after landing in the state. The personnel at Edwards greeted the crew with what Bolden described as a &quot;basket of California oranges and grapefruits&quot;.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

== Gag photo ==
During the same session as the official crew photo, the NASA photographer took a gag photo of the STS-61-C crew with their heads and faces obscured by their helmets and visors.

<text>STS-26 was the 26th NASA Space Shuttle mission and the seventh flight of the orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988, and landed four days later on October 3, 1988. STS-26 was declared the &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission, being the first mission after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of January 28, 1986. It was the first mission since STS-9 to use the original Space Transportation System (STS) numbering system, the first to have all its crew members wear pressure suits for launch and landing since STS-4, and the first mission with bailout capacity since STS-4. STS-26 was also the first U.S. space mission with an all-veteran crew since Apollo 11, with all of its crew members having flown at least one prior mission.

The mission is technically designated STS-26R, as the original STS-26 designation previously belonged to STS-51-F (also known as Spacelab-2). Likewise all flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designations would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data between the old and new flight designations.

== Crew ==
The crew roster for STS-26 was based on the original crew assignment for STS-61-F, which would have launched the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe from &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was eventually launched on STS-41. Hauck, Lounge and Hilmers were all assigned to that flight, with Roy D. Bridges Jr. as pilot. Bridges never flew again after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, but would eventually become the director of Langley Research Center (LRC).

Covey was the CAPCOM operator during the STS-51-L launch who uttered the words, &quot;&quot;Challenger&quot;, go at throttle up&quot;, shortly after which the orbiter disintegrated. He also would have been the CAPCOM operator for the canceled STS-61-F mission during launch and landing.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39B, Kennedy Space Center, at 11:37:00 a.m. EDT on September 29, 1988, 975 days after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

The launch was delayed by one hour and thirty-eight minutes due to unseasonable and unusual light winds, and the need to replace fuses in the cooling systems of two crew members&#x27; flight suits. The suits were repaired, and a waiver was issued for the wind conditions after officials determined there was a sufficient safety margin for wind loads on the orbiter&#x27;s wing leading edges. At T−1:30, it was proposed that the launch be delayed at T−0:31 due to a cabin air pressure issue. It was quickly determined that the cabin pressure had been increased slightly by the activation of the oxygen systems in the crew&#x27;s flight suits, and the launch was conducted without further delay. The shuttle crew, all veteran astronauts, included Commander Frederick H. &quot;Rick&quot; Hauck, Pilot Richard O. Covey, and Mission Specialists John M. &quot;Mike&quot; Lounge, George D. &quot;Pinky&quot; Nelson and David C. Hilmers.

The primary payload for the STS-26 mission, TDRS-C, was successfully deployed, and 11 scheduled mid-deck scientific and technological experiments were carried out. The orbiter sustained only minor Space Shuttle thermal protection system tile damage, and the post-&quot;Challenger&quot; redesigned solid rocket booster segment joints showed no signs of leakage or overheating.

Two minor problems occurred during the flight. After ascent, the Flash Evaporator System for cooling the orbiter iced up and shut down, increasing the crew cabin temperature to approximately . The problem was resolved on Flight Day 4 and cooler temperatures resulted. A Ku-band antenna for communications was deployed on Flight Day 2, but it failed to respond properly and had to be stowed for the remainder of the mission.

During STS-26, &quot;Discovery&quot; became the first spacecraft to fly in space equipped with a VCU (Voice Control Unit), a computer capable of recognising and responding to human speech. The VCU was created by SCI Systems in Huntsville, Alabama, and was based on technology licensed from the Votan company. This speech recognition system controlled the cameras and monitors that were used by the crew to monitor the Canadarm mechanical arm mounted in the cargo bay. Because of the experimental nature of speech recognition at the time, this system was not used for any critical operations. Initial problems almost sidelined the tests when the voice templates that were created prior to liftoff were found to have less than 60% recognition for one crew member and less than 40% recognition for another. This problem was corrected by retraining the templates. It was retested and found to be operational with a recognition success rate of over 96%. It was concluded that weightless conditions caused a fundamental change in human speech, making the templates created prior to liftoff virtually useless on orbit.

Besides conducting the mission&#x27;s various experiments, crew members practiced suiting up in new partial-pressure &quot;launch-and-entry&quot; flight suits, and also practiced the unstowing and attaching of the new crew escape system. On October 2, 1988, the day before the mission ended, the five-man crew paid tribute to the seven crew members lost in the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed on Runway 17, Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 12:37:11 p.m. EDT on October 3, 1988, after a mission duration of approximately 4 days, 1 hour, 0 minute, and 11 seconds. Capsule Communicator Blaine Hammond Jr. welcomed the crew, saying it was &quot;a great ending to a new beginning&quot;.

=== Payloads and experiments ===
TDRS-C, which became TDRS-3 in orbit, and its attached Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), were deployed from &quot;Discovery&quot;″s cargo bay six hours and 13 minutes into the flight. The first stage of the IUS placed TDRS-3 in a transfer orbit, and the second stage placed it in a geosynchronous orbit on September 30, 1988. TDRS-3 moved into position over the Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii at 171° west longitude. It joined TDRS-1 in tracking Earth-orbiting spacecraft; a sister satellite, TDRS-B, was lost in the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. Also in the payload bay was the Orbiter Experiments Autonomous Supporting Instrumentation System (OASIS). OASIS recorded environmental data on the orbiter and the TDRS payload during various inflight phases.

All the mission&#x27;s mid-deck experiments were deemed to have been performed successfully. However, there were some glitches with two of the five materials science experiments. In the Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) experiment, two of the 11 proteins processed – including an enzyme believed to be key to the replication of AIDS – did not produce crystals suitable for analysis. Also, there were some equipment problems with the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), an experiment to investigate the melting and solidification of various materials in zero-gravity.

The materials processing experiments included two Shuttle Student Involvement Projects, one on titanium grain formation and the other on controlling crystal growth with a membrane. Another materials science experiment, the Physical Vapor Transport of Organic Solids-2 (PVTOS-2), was a joint project of NASA&#x27;s Office of Commercial Programs and the 3M company.

Three life sciences experiments were conducted, including one on the aggregation of red blood cells, intended to help determine if microgravity can play a beneficial role in clinical research and medical diagnostic tests. Two further experiments involved atmospheric sciences, while one was in communications research.

=== List of payloads ===
==== Primary payload ====
* NASA&#x27;s TDRS-C satellite, attached to an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), became the second Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) deployed. After deployment, the IUS propelled the satellite into a geosynchronous orbit.

==== Secondary payloads ====
* Physical Vapor Transport of Organic Solids (PVTOS-2)
* Protein Crystal Growth (PCG)
* Infrared Communications Flight Experiment (IRCFE)
* Aggregation of Red Blood Cells (ARC)
* Isoelectric Focusing Experiment (IFE)
* Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE)
* Phase Partitioning Experiment (PPE)
* Earth-Limb Radiance Experiment (ELRAD)
* Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF)
* Two Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiments
* Voice Control Unit test and evaluation (VCU)

=== Damage to thermal protection ===
&quot;Discovery&quot; suffered severe damage to its thermal protection tiles in the underwing area. Post-flight analysis showed that the impact of a long piece of cork insulation during ascent was the culprit. The origin of the debris was the forward field joint on the right-hand SRB. The damage was such that, during re-entry, the thermal protection tile eroded almost completely. A similar chain of events ultimately led to the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; fifteen years later.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to awaken a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities. Kathryn D. Sullivan chose the wakeup music for STS-26, including a contribution from Robin Williams, who provided a pastiche of his &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; radio greeting.

<text>Hyperuricaemia or hyperuricemia is an abnormally high level of uric acid in the blood. In the pH conditions of body fluid, uric acid exists largely as urate, the ion form. Serum uric acid concentrations greater than 6 mg/dL for females, 7 mg/dL for males, and 5.5 mg/dL for youth (under 18 years old) are defined as hyperuricemia. The amount of urate in the body depends on the balance between the amount of purines eaten in food, the amount of urate synthesised within the body (e.g., through cell turnover), and the amount of urate that is excreted in urine or through the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperuricemia may be the result of increased production of uric acid, decreased excretion of uric acid, or both increased production and reduced excretion.


==Signs and symptoms==
Unless high blood levels of uric acid are determined in a clinical laboratory, hyperuricemia may not cause noticeable symptoms in most people. Development of gout which is a painful, short-term disorder is the most common consequence of hyperuricemia, which causes deposition of uric acid crystals usually in joints of the extremities, but may also induce formation of kidney stones, another painful disorder. Gout symptoms are typically inflammation, swelling and redness of a joint, such as a toe or knee, accompanied by intense pain. Not all people with hyperuricemia develop gout.

==Causes==
Many factors contribute to hyperuricemia, including genetics, insulin resistance, hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, obesity, diet, iron overload, use of diuretics (e.g. thiazides, loop diuretics), and excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Of these, alcohol consumption is the most important.

Causes of hyperuricemia can be classified into three functional types: increased production of uric acid, decreased excretion of uric acid, and mixed type. Causes of increased production include high levels of purine in the diet and increased purine metabolism. Causes of decreased excretion include kidney disease, certain drugs, and competition for excretion between uric acid and other molecules. Mixed causes include high levels of alcohol and/or fructose in the diet, and starvation.

===Increased production of uric acid===
A purine-rich diet is a common but minor cause of hyperuricemia. Diet alone generally is not sufficient to cause hyperuricemia (see Gout). Foods high in the purines adenine and hypoxanthine may aggravate symptoms of hyperuricemia.

Various studies have found higher uric acid levels to be positively associated with consumption of meat and seafood and inversely associated with dairy food consumption.

Myogenic hyperuricemia, as a result of the myokinase (adenylate kinase) reaction and the Purine Nucleotide Cycle running when ATP reservoirs in muscle cells are low (ADP&gt;ATP), is a common pathophysiologic feature of glycogenoses such as GSD-III, GSD-V and GSD-VII, as they are metabolic myopathies which impair the ability of ATP (energy) production for the muscle cells to use. In these metabolic myopathies, myogenic hyperuricemia is exercise-induced; inosine, hypoxanthine and uric acid increase in plasma after exercise and decrease over hours with rest. Excess AMP (adenosine monophosphate) is converted into uric acid. AMP → IMP → Inosine → Hypoxanthine → Xanthine → Uric Acid

Hyperuricemia experienced as gout is a common complication of solid organ transplant. Apart from normal variation (with a genetic component), tumor lysis syndrome produces extreme levels of uric acid, mainly leading to kidney failure. The Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is also associated with extremely high levels of uric acid.

===Decreased excretion of uric acid===
The principal drugs that contribute to hyperuricemia by decreased excretion are the primary antiuricosurics. Other drugs and agents include diuretics, salicylates, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, nicotinic acid, ciclosporin, 2-ethylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole, and cytotoxic agents.

The gene SLC2A9 encodes a protein that helps to transport uric acid in the kidney. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms of this gene are known to have a significant correlation with blood uric acid. Hyperuricemia cosegregating with osteogenesis imperfecta has been shown to be associated with a mutation in GPATCH8 using exome sequencing

A ketogenic diet impairs the ability of the kidney to excrete uric acid, due to competition for transport between uric acid and ketones.

Elevated blood lead is significantly correlated with both impaired kidney function and hyperuricemia (although the causal relationship among these correlations is not known). In a study of over 2500 people resident in Taiwan, a blood lead level exceeding 7.5 microg/dL (a small elevation) had odds ratios of 1.92 (95% CI: 1.18-3.10) for renal dysfunction and 2.72 (95% CI: 1.64-4.52) for hyperuricemia.

===Mixed type===
Causes of hyperuricemia that are of mixed type have a dual action, both increasing production and decreasing excretion of uric acid.

Pseudohypoxia (disrupted NADH/NAD+ ratio), caused by diabetic hyperglycemia and excessive alcohol consumption, results in hyperuricemia. The lactic acidosis inhibits uric acid secretion by the kidney, while the energy shortage from inhibited oxidative phosphorylation leads to increased production of uric acid due to increased turnover of adenosine nucleotides by the myokinase reaction and purine nucleotide cycle.

High intake of alcohol (ethanol), a significant cause of hyperuricemia, has a dual action that is compounded by multiple mechanisms. Ethanol increases production of uric acid by increasing production of lactic acid, hence lactic acidosis. Ethanol also increases the plasma concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine via the acceleration of adenine nucleotide degradation, and is a possible weak inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase. As a byproduct of its fermentation process, beer additionally contributes purines. Ethanol decreases excretion of uric acid by promoting dehydration and (rarely) clinical ketoacidosis.

High dietary intake of fructose contributes significantly to hyperuricemia. In a large study in the United States, consumption of four or more sugar-sweetened soft drinks per day gave an odds ratio of 1.82 for hyperuricemia. Increased production of uric acid is the result of interference, by a product of fructose metabolism, in purine metabolism. This interference has a dual action, both increasing the conversion of ATP to inosine and hence uric acid and increasing the synthesis of purine. Fructose also inhibits the excretion of uric acid, apparently by competing with uric acid for access to the transport protein SLC2A9. The effect of fructose in reducing excretion of uric acid is increased in people with a hereditary (genetic) predisposition toward hyperuricemia and/or gout.

Starvation causes the body to metabolize its own (purine-rich) tissues for energy. Thus, like a high purine diet, starvation increases the amount of purine converted to uric acid. A very low calorie diet lacking in carbohydrates can induce extreme hyperuricemia; including some carbohydrate (and reducing the protein) reduces the level of hyperuricemia. Starvation also impairs the ability of the kidney to excrete uric acid, due to competition for transport between uric acid and ketones.

=== Gut Microbiome ===
Radioisotope studies suggest about 1/3 of uric acid is removed in healthy people in their gut with this being roughly 2/3 in those with kidney disease. Uric acid metabolism is done in the human gut by ~1/5 of bacteria that come from 4 of 6 major phyla. Such metabolism is anaerobic involving uncharacterized ammonia lyase, peptidase, carbamoyl transferase, and oxidoreductase enzymes. The result is that uric acid is converted into xanthine or lactate and the short chain fatty acids such as acetate and butyrate. In mouse models, such bacteria compensate for the loss of uricase leading researchers to raise the possibility &quot;that antibiotics targeting anaerobic bacteria, which would ablate gut bacteria, increase the risk for developing gout in humans&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
Hyperuricemia can be detected using blood and urine tests.

==Treatment==

=== Medications that aim to lower the uric acid concentration ===
Medications used to treat hyperuricemia are divided into two categories: xanthine oxidase inhibitors and uricosurics. For people who have recurring attacks of gout, one of these two categories of drugs is recommended. The evidence for people with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia to take these medications is not clear.

==== Xanthine oxidase inhibitors ====
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, including allopurinol, febuxostat and topiroxostat, decrease the production of uric acid, by interfering with xanthine oxidase.

==== Uricosurics ====
Uricosuric agents (benzbromarone, benziodarone, probenecid, lesinurad, sulfinpyrazone, ethebencid, zoxazolamine, and ticrynafen) increase the excretion of uric acid, by reducing the reabsorption of uric acid once it has been filtered out of the blood by the kidneys.

Some of these medications are used as indicated, others are used off-label. In people receiving hemodialysis, sevelamer can significantly reduce serum uric acid, apparently by adsorbing urate in the gut. In women, use of combined oral contraceptive pills is significantly associated with lower serum uric acid. Following Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, lowering the blood concentration of uric acid may permit any existing crystals of uric acid to gradually dissolve into the blood, whence the dissolved uric acid can be excreted. Maintaining a lower blood concentration of uric acid similarly should reduce the formation of new crystals. If the person has chronic gout or known tophi, then large quantities of uric acid crystals may have accumulated in joints and other tissues, and aggressive and/or long duration use of medications may be needed. Precipitation of uric acid crystals, and conversely their dissolution, is known to be dependent on the concentration of uric acid in solution, pH, sodium concentration, and temperature.

Non-medication treatments for hyperuricemia include a low purine diet (see Gout) and a variety of dietary supplements. Treatment with lithium salts has been used as lithium improves uric acid solubility.

===pH===
Serum pH is neither safely nor easily altered. Therapies that alter pH principally alter the pH of urine, to discourage a possible complication of uricosuric therapy: formation of uric acid kidney stones due to increased uric acid in the urine (see nephrolithiasis). Medications that have a similar effect include acetazolamide.

===Temperature===
Low temperature is a reported trigger of acute gout. An example would be a day spent standing in cold water, followed by an attack of gout the next morning. This is believed to be due to temperature-dependent precipitation of uric acid crystals in tissues at below normal temperature. Thus, one aim of prevention is to keep the hands and feet warm, and soaking in hot water may be therapeutic.

==Prognosis==
Increased levels predispose for gout and, if very high, kidney failure. Metabolic syndrome often presents with hyperuricemia. Prognosis is good with regular consumption of allopurinol or febuxostat.

<text>STS-27 was the 27th NASA Space Shuttle mission, and the third flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Launching on December 2, 1988, on a four-day mission, it was the second shuttle flight after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of January 1986. STS-27 carried a classified payload for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), ultimately determined to be a Lacrosse surveillance satellite. The vessel&#x27;s heat shielding was substantially damaged during lift-off, and crew members thought that they would die during reentry. This was a situation that was similar to the one that would prove fatal 15 years later on STS-107. Compared to the damage that &quot;Columbia&quot; sustained on STS-107, &quot;Atlantis&quot; experienced more extensive damage. However, this was over less critical areas and the missing tile was over an antenna which gave extra protection to the spacecraft structure. The mission landed successfully, although intense heat damage needed to be repaired.

The mission is technically designated STS-27R, as the original STS-27 designator belonged to STS-51-I, the twentieth Space Shuttle mission. Official documentation for that mission contained the designator STS-27 throughout. As STS-51-L was designated STS-33, future flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designators would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

== Mission summary ==
The Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (OV-104), at the time the youngest in NASA&#x27;s shuttle fleet, made its third flight on a classified mission for the United States Department of Defense (DoD). It deployed a single satellite, USA-34. NASA archival information has identified USA-34 as Lacrosse 1, a side-looking radar, all-weather surveillance satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

The mission was originally scheduled to launch on December 1, 1988, but the launch was postponed one day because of cloud cover and strong wind conditions at the launch site. Liftoff occurred from LC-39B at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1988, at 09:30:34 a.m. EST. &quot;Atlantis&quot; touched down on December 6, 1988, on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 18:36:11 EST. The total mission elapsed time at wheels-stop was 4 days, 9 hours, 5 minutes, and 37 seconds. Atlantis was returned to the Kennedy Space Center on December 13, 1988, and moved into an OPF on December 14, 1988.

There has been speculation that an EVA was conducted during this mission. Interviews with members of the crew several years after the flight confirmed there had been a problem with the satellite upon release, whereupon a rendezvous with the satellite was effected and repairs performed. These unspecified repairs could have necessitated a spacewalk, likely performed by Ross and Shepherd. As a classified DoD mission, details or confirmation of such an EVA remain unreleased.

The day after &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed, the 1988 Armenian earthquake killed tens of thousands in the Soviet Union. At an astronaut meeting Gibson said, &quot;I know many of you may have been very curious about our classified payload. While I can&#x27;t go into its design features, I can say Armenia was its &quot;first&quot; target! And we only had the weapon set on &quot;stun&quot;!&quot;

== Tile damage ==
&quot;Atlantis&quot;″ Thermal Protection System tiles sustained extensive damage during the flight. Ablative insulating material from the starboard solid rocket booster nose cap had hit the orbiter about 85 seconds into the flight, as seen in footage of the ascent. The STS-27 crew also commented that white material was observed on
the windshield at various times during ascent. The crew made an inspection of the shuttle&#x27;s impacted starboard side using the shuttle&#x27;s Canadarm, but the limited resolution and range of the cameras made it impossible to determine the full extent of the tile damage.

The problem was compounded by the fact that the crew was prohibited from using their standard method of sending images to ground control due to the classified nature of the mission. The crew was forced to use a slow, encrypted transmission method, likely causing the images NASA engineers received to be of poor quality, causing them to think the damage was actually &quot;just lights and shadows&quot;. They told the crew the damage did not look any more severe than on past missions.

One report describes the crew as &quot;infuriated&quot; that Mission Control Center seemed unconcerned. When Gibson saw the damage he thought to himself, &quot;We are going to die&quot;; he and others did not believe that the shuttle would survive reentry. Gibson advised the crew to relax because &quot;No use dying all tensed-up&quot;, he said, but if instruments indicated that the shuttle was disintegrating, Gibson planned to &quot;tell mission control what I thought of their analysis&quot; in the remaining seconds before his death.

Mullane recalled that while filming the reentry through the upper deck&#x27;s overhead windows, &quot;I had visions of molten aluminum being smeared backwards, like rain on a windshield&quot;. Although the shuttle landed safely, &quot;The damage was much worse than any of us had expected&quot;, he wrote. Upon landing, the magnitude of the damage to the shuttle astonished NASA; over 700 damaged tiles were noted, and one tile was missing altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ice/frost/debris Report 1989-02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This missing tile had fortunately been located over the aluminum mounting plate for an L-band antenna (one of six, part of the Tactical air navigation system (TACAN) landing system), perhaps preventing a burn-through of the sort that would ultimately doom &quot;Columbia&quot; in 2003. There was almost no damage present on the orbiter&#x27;s left side. STS-27 &quot;Atlantis&quot; was the most damaged launch-entry vehicle to return to Earth successfully. Gibson believed that had the shuttle been destroyed, Congress would have ended the shuttle program given that only one successful mission had occurred between his flight and the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;.

A review team investigated the cause, beginning with a detailed inspection of the &quot;Atlantis&quot; TPS damage, and a review of related inspection reports to establish an in-depth anomaly definition. An exhaustive data review followed to develop a fault tree and several failure scenarios. This and other information gained during the review formed the basis for the team&#x27;s findings and recommendations.
== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during Project Gemini, and first used music to awaken a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-29 was the 28th NASA Space Shuttle mission, during which Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; inserted a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) into Earth orbit. It was the third shuttle mission following the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, and launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 13, 1989. STS-29R was the eighth flight of &quot;Discovery&quot; and the 28th Space Shuttle mission overall; its planned predecessor, STS-28, was delayed until August 1989.

The mission was technically designated STS-29R as the original STS-29 designator belonged to STS-61-A, the 22nd Space Shuttle mission. Official documentation and paperwork for that mission contained the designator STS-29 when it was allocated to Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; and later as STS-30 when allocated to &quot;Challenger&quot;. As STS-51-L was designated STS-33, future flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designators would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
&quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39B, Kennedy Space Center, at 9:57:00 a.m. EST on March 13, 1989. The launch was originally scheduled for February 18, 1989, but was postponed to allow for the replacement of faulty liquid oxygen turbopumps on the three main engines. The amended target date of March 11, 1989, was postponed by 1 day, because of the failure of a master event controller (MEC); #2 when it was powered up during prelaunch checkout, as well as an additional day to replace a faulty fuel preburner oxidizer valve (FPOV). On the rescheduled launch day of March 13, 1989, the launch was delayed for nearly two hours because of ground fog and high upper winds. A waiver was approved for the orbiter&#x27;s wing loads.

The primary payload was TDRS-D, the third and final component of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) constellation in geosynchronous orbit. The three on-orbit satellites were stationed over the equator at about above Earth; two of them were positioned 130° apart, while the third was located between them as an on-orbit spare.

On Flight Day 1, one of three cryogenic hydrogen tanks which supplied shuttle&#x27;s electricity-generating fuel cells exhibited erratic pressure fluctuations. It was deactivated while engineers studied the problem, and the crew was told to conserve electrical power. The tank was reactivated on Flight Day 3, March 15, 1989, and operated successfully thereafter.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed on March 18, 1989, after orbit 80, one orbit earlier than planned, in order to avoid possible excessive wind buildup expected at the landing site. The shuttle touched down on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 9:35:51 a.m. EST. The total mission duration was 4 days, 23 hours, 38 minutes, and 52 seconds.

=== Payload and experiments ===
The mission&#x27;s primary payload was TDRS-D, which became TDRS-4 after deployment, and its attached Inertial Upper Stage (IUS). The satellite was deployed from the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay less than six hours after launch, at 3:12 a.m. EST. The first-stage orbit burn of the IUS took place an hour later, and the second burn to circularize the orbit occurred 12 hours and 30 minutes into the mission. The satellite was stationed at 41.0° West longitude.

&quot;Discovery&quot; also carried eight secondary payloads, including two Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiments. One student experiment, using four live rats with tiny pieces of bone removed from their bodies, was to test whether the environmental effects of space flight inhibit bone healing. The other student experiment was to fly 32 chicken eggs to determine the effects of space flight on fertilized chicken embryos.

One experiment, mounted in the payload bay, was only termed &quot;partially successful&quot;. The Space Station Heat Pipe Advanced Radiator Element (SHARE), a potential cooling system for the planned Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;, operated continuously for less than 30 minutes under powered electrical loads. The failure was blamed on the faulty design of the equipment, especially the manifold section.

All other experiments operated successfully. Crystals were obtained from all the proteins in the Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) experiment. The Chromosomes and Plant Cell Division in Space (CHROMEX), a life sciences experiment, was designed to show the effects of microgravity on root development. An IMAX (70 mm) camera was used to film a variety of scenes for the 1990 IMAX film &quot;Blue Planet&quot;, including the effects of floods, hurricanes, wildfires and volcanic eruptions on Earth. A ground-based U.S. Air Force experiment used the orbiter as a calibration target for the Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) in Hawaii.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-30 was the 29th NASA Space Shuttle mission and the fourth mission for Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. It was the fourth shuttle launch since the Challenger disaster and the first shuttle mission since the disaster to have a female astronaut on board. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989, and landed four days later on May 8, 1989. During the mission, &quot;Atlantis&quot; deployed the Venus-bound &quot;Magellan&quot; probe into orbit.

The mission was officially designated STS-30R as the original STS-30 designator belonged to STS-61-A, the 22nd Space Shuttle mission. Official documentation for that mission contained the designator STS-30 throughout. As STS-51-L was designated STS-33, future flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designators would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

== Shuttle processing ==
Atlantis spent three months in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF-2) after returning to the Kennedy Space Center at the end of STS-27. During this period technicians got to work removing and replacing all of the damaged Thermal Protection System (TPS) tiles that Atlantis sustained during her prior flight. They also took detailed inspections of the shuttle while simultaneously preparing Atlantis for STS-30R. The shuttle was rolled over to the Vehicle Assembly Building and mated with ET-29 and an SRB set on March 11, 1989. Eleven days later on March 22, 1989, Atlantis was rolled out to launch pad 39B.

== Mission summary ==
Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39B at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, at 14:46:59 EDT on May 4, 1989. The primary payload, the &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft with its attached Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), was successfully deployed later that day. &quot;Magellan&quot; was the first American planetary mission in 11 years.

The launch was originally scheduled for April 28, 1989, the first day of a 31-day launch period when Earth and Venus were properly aligned. However, the liftoff was scrubbed at T−31 seconds because of a problem with the liquid hydrogen recirculation pump on Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) No. 1, and a vapor leak in the liquid hydrogen recirculation line between the orbiter and external tank (ET). On the rescheduled liftoff date of May 4, 1989, the launch was again delayed until the final five minutes of the launch window due to cloud cover and excessive crosswinds at KSC&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF). Good landing conditions were required at the SLF in case of a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) abort early in the flight.

The only major glitch during the flight occurred on May 7, 1989, when one of the four general-purpose computers programmed to operate the orbiter failed. The shuttle crew replaced the computer, part of a redundant set, with a backup one. It was the first time a computer had been replaced while in orbit. The glitch had no impact on the crew&#x27;s safety or the primary objectives of the mission, although some of the activities involved in conducting experiments had to be canceled while the crew was replacing the computer. There also was no impact to the mission when one of the three thrusters on &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; aft right-hand Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pod failed during ascent.

However, the STS-30 crew experienced several minor annoyances. A Hasselblad camera used to photograph sites on Earth had to be stowed for the remainder of the mission after a shutter stuck during the crew&#x27;s third day in space. The Text and Graphics Systems (TAGS), a device to send images and graphics to the orbiter from Mission Control Center, had to be turned off on Flight Day 2 because of a paper jam. Commander Walker and Pilot Grabe had problems with a device used to take measurements of central venous pressure to determine the effects of microgravity on the cardiovascular system. On the second full day in space, the water dispensing system in the galley malfunctioned, causing some difficulties for the crew in preparing meals.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; touched down at Runway 22, Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989, at 15:43:27 EDT. Minutes before landing, the runway had to be switched from 17 to 22 due to high crosswinds. The mission lasted a total of 4days, 0hours, 56minutes, and 28seconds.

=== Payload and experiments ===
The &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft was deployed from the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay six hours and 14 minutes into the mission. Two successive IUS propulsion burns placed the spacecraft on its trajectory to Venus about an hour later. &quot;Magellan&quot; arrived at Venus in August 1990 and began a 243-day mission of mapping the planet&#x27;s surface with radar.

Three mid-deck experiments were included on the mission. All had flown before. Mission Specialist Cleave used a portable laptop computer to operate and monitor the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA). An video camcorder, flown for the first time on the Shuttle, provided the opportunity for the crew to record and downlink on-orbit activities such as the FEA, which was a joint endeavor between Rockwell International and NASA. Payload bay video cameras were used to record storm systems from orbit as part of the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to awaken a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-28 was the 30th NASA Space Shuttle mission, the fourth shuttle mission dedicated to United States Department of Defense (DoD) purposes, and the eighth flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The mission launched on August 8, 1989, and traveled during 81 orbits of the Earth, before landing on runway 17 of Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 13, 1989. STS-28 was also &quot;Columbia&quot;″s first flight since January 1986, when it had flown STS-61-C, the mission directly preceding the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of STS-51-L. The mission details of STS-28 are classified, but the payload is widely believed to have been the first SDS-2 relay communications satellite. The altitude of the mission was between and .

The mission was officially designated STS-28R as the original STS-28 designator belonged to STS-51-J, the 21st Space Shuttle mission. Official documentation for that mission contained the designator STS-28 throughout. As STS-51-L was designated STS-33, future flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designators would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==

Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (OV-102) lifted off from Pad 39B, Launch Complex 39 at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1989. The launch took place at 8:37:00 a.m. EDT.

During STS-28, &quot;Columbia&quot; deployed two satellites: USA-40 and USA-41. Early reports speculated that STS-28&#x27;s primary payload was an Advanced KH-11 photo-reconnaissance satellite. Later reports, and amateur satellite observations, suggest that USA-40 was instead a second-generation Satellite Data System (SDS) relay, similar to those likely launched on STS-38 and STS-53. These satellites had the same bus design as the LEASAT satellites deployed on other shuttle missions, and were likely deployed in the same fashion.

The mission marked the first flight of a human skull, which served as the primary element of &quot;Detailed Secondary Objective 469&quot;, also known as the In-flight Radiation Dose Distribution (IDRD) experiment. This joint NASA/DoD experiment was designed to examine the penetration of radiation into the human cranium during spaceflight. The female skull was seated in a plastic matrix, representative of tissue, and sliced into ten layers. Hundreds of thermoluminescent dosimeters were mounted in the skull&#x27;s layers to record radiation levels at multiple depths. This experiment, which also flew on STS-36 and STS-31, was located in the shuttle&#x27;s mid-deck lockers on all three flights, recording radiation levels at different orbital inclinations.

During the flight, the crew shut down a thruster in the reaction control system (RCS) after receiving indications of a leak. An RCS heater also malfunctioned during the flight. Post-flight analysis of STS-28 discovered unusual heating of the thermal protection system (TPS) during re-entry, caused by an early transition to turbulent plasma flow around the vehicle. A detailed report identified protruding gap filler as the likely cause. This filler material was the same material that was removed during a spacewalk during STS-114, the Space Shuttle&#x27;s post-&quot;Columbia&quot; disaster Return to Flight mission, in 2005.

The Shuttle Lee-side Temperature Sensing (SILTS) infrared camera package made its second flight aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; on this mission. The cylindrical pod and surrounding black tiles on the orbiter&#x27;s vertical stabilizer housed an imaging system, designed to map thermodynamic conditions during reentry, on the surfaces visible from the top of the tail fin. Ironically, the camera faced the port wing of &quot;Columbia&quot;, which was breached by superheated plasma on its disastrous final flight, destroying the wing and, later, the orbiter. The SILTS system was used for only six missions before being deactivated, but the pod remained for the duration of &quot;Columbia&quot;″s career. &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; thermal protection system was also upgraded to a similar configuration as &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; in between the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; and STS-28, with many of the white LRSI tiles replaced with felt insulation blankets in order to reduce weight and turnaround time. One other minor modification that debuted on STS-28 was the move of &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; name from its payload bay doors to the fuselage, allowing the orbiter to be easily recognized while in orbit.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 9:37:08 a.m. EDT on August 13, 1989, after a mission lasting 5 days, 1 hour and 8 seconds. Because of a software glitch with the weight-on-wheels sensors installed on the landing gear, the crew was instructed to touch down on the runway as softly as possible. This instruction resulted in a touchdown airspeed of , the slowest of the entire Shuttle program by a wide margin and barely above the Orbiter&#x27;s stall speed.

<text>STS-34 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission using &quot;Atlantis&quot;. It was the 31st shuttle mission overall, and the fifth flight for &quot;Atlantis&quot;. STS-34 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 18, 1989, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 23, 1989. During the mission, the Jupiter-bound &quot;Galileo&quot; probe was deployed into space.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
&quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39B, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), at 12:53:40 EDT on October 18, 1989. It carried the Jupiter-bound &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft in its cargo bay. The countdown was delayed at T-minus 5 minutes for 3 minutes and 40 seconds to update the onboard computer for a change in the Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) site. The TAL site was changed from Ben Guerir Air Base, Morocco, to Zaragoza Air Base, Spain, because of heavy rain at Ben Guerir.

The launch was originally targeted for October 12, 1989, the first day of a 41-day launch period during which the planets were properly aligned for a direct flight to Jupiter. The liftoff was rescheduled for October 17, 1989, to replace a faulty main engine controller for Space Shuttle Main Engine No. 2. It was postponed again until October 18, 1989, because of rain-showers within of Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility. The weather conditions were in violation of the launch commit criteria for a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) landing in the event of an aborted flight.

The primary payload, the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft with its attached Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), was successfully deployed on its journey to Jupiter. STS-34 was only the second shuttle flight to deploy a planetary spacecraft, the first being STS-30, which deployed the &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft.

&quot;Galileo&quot; became the first spacecraft to orbit an outer Solar System planet and to penetrate the atmosphere of an outer planet. Also, the spacecraft was scheduled to make the first extended observations of the Jovian system and first direct sampling of Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, as well as the first asteroid flybys.

Several anomalies occurred during the flight, but none had a major impact on the mission. On October 22, 1989, an alarm woke the shuttle crew when the gas generator fuel pump system A heaters on Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) 2 failed to recycle at the upper limits of the system. There were also some minor problems with the Flash Evaporator System for cooling the orbiter, and the cryogenic oxygen manifold valve 2, which was left closed for the rest of the mission. A Hasselblad camera jammed twice, and a spare camera had to be used.

Chang-Díaz described his second flight as much more &quot;subdued&quot;. Demonstrators protested at launch time against the flight because the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft, the mission&#x27;s payload, was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Díaz also claimed the flight was almost aborted in orbit three times because of malfunctions, but continued because the alternative was to land &quot;Atlantis&quot;, carrying &quot;Galileo&quot; and its generator, at an airport in Senegal, which could have caused an &quot;international incident&quot;, according to the astronaut. He identified the deployment of &quot;Galileo&quot; as another tricky part of the mission as he only had a tight six-second opportunity to succeed.

On October 21, 1989, Costa Rican President Dr. Óscar Arias talked in Spanish with Chang-Díaz, a native of Costa Rica, and greeted the other crew members via a special telephone linkup. Arias told Chang-Díaz, &quot;You raise high the name of Costa Rica and Latin America in general&quot;. Chang-Díaz also explained the mission&#x27;s objectives in Spanish to Costa Rican listeners on the ground.

Because of high winds predicted at the planned landing time, reentry was moved two orbits earlier. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on Runway 23 at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 16:33:00UTC (9:33amPDT local time at the landing site) on October 23, 1989 after a mission duration of 4days, 23hours, 39minutes, and 20seconds.

=== Payload and experiments ===
The mission&#x27;s primary task was to deploy the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft with its attached IUS booster. Deployment occurred on schedule at 19:15 EDT on October 18, 1989, slightly more than six hours after launch, and the IUS successfully boosted &quot;Galileo&quot; toward Venus on the first leg of its six-year journey to Jupiter. The spacecraft was injected on a Venus transfer orbit at 20:20 EDT, and separated from the IUS 47 minutes later.

&quot;Galileo&quot; required a triple gravity assist – from Venus, Earth, and then Earth again – to propel it from the inner part of the Solar System to Jupiter in the outer system. The trajectory made it possible to also observe asteroids 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida. &quot;Galileo&quot; had two major components: an orbiter which examined Jupiter and its four largest moons for eight years, and a probe which descended into the Jovian atmosphere to take direct samplings before being destroyed by the gas giant&#x27;s heat and pressure.

Besides the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft, &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; payload bay held two canisters containing the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) experiment. SSBUV, which made its first flight on STS-34, was developed by NASA to check the calibration of the ozone sounders on free-flying satellites, and to verify the accuracy of atmospheric ozone and solar irradiance data. The experiment operated successfully.

STS-34 carried a further five mid-deck experiments, all of which were deemed successful, including the Polymer Morphology (PM) experiment, sponsored by the 3M company under a joint endeavor agreement with NASA. The PM experiment was designed to observe the melting and resolidifying of different types of polymers while in orbit. The Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), which had been flown on previous shuttle missions, observed the visual characteristics of large-scale lightning in the upper atmosphere.

The crew successfully troubleshot a student experiment on ice crystal growth. The experiment&#x27;s first activation did not produce crystals because the supercooled water formed an ice slag on the cooling plate. The crew turned the experiment off, allowing the ice to thaw, and then redispersed the liquid. Several crystals formed. On October 22, 1989, Lucid and Baker completed the Growth Hormone Concentration and Distribution in Plants experiment by freezing samples of corn seedlings grown in orbit during the mission.

In the cabin, the crew operated an IMAX (70 mm) camera, last flown on STS-29. Werner Herzog&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot; featured footage filmed on the flight.

Chang-Díaz and Baker, a medical doctor, performed a detailed supplementary objective by photographing and videotaping the veins and arteries in the retinal wall of Baker&#x27;s eyeball to provide detailed measurements which might give clues about a possible relationship between cranial pressure and motion sickness. Baker also tested the effectiveness of anti-motion sickness medication in space.
== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-33 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission and the 9th flight of Discovery, during which Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed a payload for the United States Department of Defense (DoD). It was the 32nd shuttle mission overall, the ninth flight of &quot;Discovery&quot;, the fifth shuttle mission in support of the DoD, the seventh post-Space Shuttle Challenger disaster mission and the last Shuttle mission of the 1980s. Due to the nature of the mission, specific details remain classified. &quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39B at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on November 22, 1989, at 7:23:30 p.m. EST; it landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 27, 1989, at 7:30:16 p.m. EST.

The mission was officially designated STS-33R as the original STS-33 designator belonged to the ill-fated Challenger STS-51-L, the 25th Space Shuttle mission. Official documentation for that mission contained the designator STS-33 throughout. As STS-51-L was designated STS-33, future flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designators would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission background ==


STS-33 was the original designation for the mission that became STS-51-L, the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. After &quot;Challenger&quot;″s destruction, NASA recycled the mission numbering system back to STS-26, which was the 26th shuttle mission and the first to fly after the disaster.

S. David Griggs, a veteran of STS-51-D, was to have been the pilot of this mission. He was killed in the crash of a vintage World War II aircraft in June 1989 while training to serve as pilot on STS-33, and is commemorated on the mission insignia with a single gold star on the blue field. He was replaced by John Blaha. Sonny Carter, a mission specialist on this flight, was killed in a commercial plane crash on April 5, 1991 while training to fly on STS-42.

== Mission summary ==
STS-33 was originally scheduled to launch on November 20, 1989, but was delayed because of problems with the integrated electronics assemblies which controlled the ignition and separation of the shuttle&#x27;s solid rocket boosters (SRBs). STS-33 was the third night launch of the Space Shuttle program, and the first since shuttle flights resumed in 1988 following the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of 1986.

During the mission, &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed a single satellite, USA-48 (1989-090B). Experts believe that this was a secret Magnum ELINT (ELectronic INTelligence) satellite headed for geosynchronous orbit, similar to that launched by STS-51-C in 1985, making this mission essentially a duplicate of that earlier mission. According to Jim Slade of ABC News, USA-48 was intended to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications from the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states. The satellite deployed by STS-33 was a replacement for the one launched by STS-51-C, which was running out of the maneuvering fuel required for keeping its station over the Indian Ocean. However, astronaut Gary E. Payton stated in 2009 that STS-51-C&#x27;s payload is &quot;still up there, and still operating&quot;.

&quot;Aviation Week&quot; claimed that during STS-33, the shuttle initially entered an x orbit at an inclination of 28.45° to the equator. It then executed three Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burns, the last on its fourth orbit. The first burn was to circularize the orbit at . The satellite was deployed on the seventh orbit, and ignited its Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) booster at the ascending node of the eighth orbit, successfully placing it in a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). This was the eighth IUS launched aboard the shuttle, and the seventh successfully deployed.

STS-33 suffered a cabin leak in the Waste Collection System.

STS-33 was observed by the telescope of the U.S. Air Force Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing observatory (AMOS) during five passes over Hawaii. Spectrographic and infrared images of the shuttle obtained with the Enhanced Longwave Spectral Imager (ELSI) were aimed at studying the interactions between gases released by the shuttle&#x27;s primary reaction control system (RCS) and residual atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen species in orbit.

The landing was initially scheduled for November 26, 1989, but was postponed for a day because of strong winds at the landing site. &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 27, 1989, at 7:30:16 p.m. EST, after a mission duration of 5 days, 0 hour, 6 minutes, and 46 seconds.

<text>Kuldīga () () is a town in the Courland region of Latvia, in the western part of the country. It is the center of Kuldīga Municipality with a population of approximately 13,500.

Kuldīga was first mentioned in 1242. It joined the Hanseatic League in 1368. In the 17th century, Kuldīga (along with Jelgava) was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Courland from 1596 to 1616.

Kuldīga is an ancient town in Latvia&#x27;s western region of Kurzeme with distinctive architecture, which is included in the list of the UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites. Saint Catherine is believed to be the patron saint of Kuldīga, and the oldest church of the town is named after St Catherine. The foundation of the building was laid as early as in 1252. The church has been remodeled a number of times. The small River Alekšupīte runs through the very centre of the Kuldīga old town, along the walls of the houses. The Old Town around the small river itself is the only remaining 17th–18th-century ensemble of this kind in the Baltic states. A 4.2 metres high waterfall on the Alekšupīte is the highest in Latvia. The Venta Rapid, a 240-meter wide natural rapid on the Venta River, is the widest in Europe. Not far from the rapid is the Kuldīga brick bridge built in 1874, which is the longest bridge of this type in Europe.

Kuldīga was recognized as an EDEN destination in 2007.

==History==

The origin of the ancient town Kuldīga can be explained by its location on the crossroads: the waterways of River Venta and land routes joining the Prussian lands with the lower reaches of River Daugava. The ancient Kuldiga town of Couronians – a fortified castle mound and a settlement were located 3,5 km to the North down the River Venta on its left bank. The castle mound still be seen today. It is located on a bank of the River Venta on the foreland between the deep gully of the River Veckuldīga and the ancient valley of the Venta. The Site of the Castle itself is located in the several hectare wide area, but together with the Old City of Kuldiga – the area of more than ten hectares. There might have been a port by the River Veckuldīga.

On April 19, 1242 the Livonian Order of Knights received the master&#x27;s permission to build a castle on the banks of River Venta. As this is the oldest preserved written document where Kuldiga is mentioned, it is considered to be the year of the foundation of Kuldiga. The Castle of the Livonian Order of Knights was built on the left bank of River Venta by the ford, and the dolomite from the riverbed was used as the construction material. In 1263, the castle and settlements around it were already mentioned as the town &quot;Goldingen&quot;, and its rights as for a town were based on Riga city rights.

On April 28, 1355, the Order&#x27;s master allocated new land areas. At the same time he attributed a new privilege to the town, as well as a coat of arms with the image of St. Catherine. From 1439 Kuldiga/Goldingen was given a privilege to arrange a market weekly. The town was established by joining the three main populated areas: the town, the small village of the castle (town of the Couronians) and the village on the hill (so called &quot;Kalnamiests&quot; in Latvian) (in the area of Kalna iela today). The Komtur lived in the Castle of Livonian Order together with his twelve brothers being knights and with so-called stepbrothers who took care of the economic life. The Komtur also led the Komturei of Kuldiga, which had also Durbe, Sabile, Skrunda, Aizpute, Alsunga and Saldus along with Kuldiga in possession.
After establishing the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in 1561, a new period began in the history of Kuldiga. The first duke Gotthard Kettler chose the former order castle to be one of his residences. He and later also other dukes approved the former town rights of Kuldiga by supporting its economic development. When the duke Gotthard died, the dukedom was divided into two parts and till 1618 Kuldiga was the residence of his youngest son Wilhelm and a capital of Kurzeme. The town profited from trading with Riga and Jelgava because of taxes on all goods taken across the bridge. In 1615, the bridge was destroyed by floods, causing a great loss to the town. In the same year, there was a huge fire destroying the major part of the wooden constructions in the town. After reconstruction of the town, a new market place was established (the Square of the City Council nowadays) and a new Town Hall was built (Baznīcas iela 5 nowadays), which we now name as the old one. So the centre of the town was moved from the old place near by the St. Catherine&#x27;s Church to the present Square of the City Council. The richest citizens and merchants built their houses around the new centre of the town.
In the second part of the 19th century, small industrial companies began to be developed in the town. Some of them became factories with more than 100 workers. The largest factory in Kuldiga was the factory &quot;Vulkāns&quot; producing matches (established in 1878 and closed in 2004), and the label of matchboxes had an image of a deer on it. The second largest was the factory of Vintelers Tūki. Furthermore things such as needles, cigars, soap, vodka, liqueurs and mineral water were produced in Kuldiga. Beer brewing was the tradition with deep routes – beer was brewed in the order castle, in the duke&#x27;s manors and in the town as well. Many new buildings were built in this period – not only residential, but also municipal and public buildings. After several centuries, Kuldiga got a new bridge across the River Venta (1873–74), a new Town Hall was built (1868), the Orthodox Parish House and a church in Liepājas iela, a prison (which is a post office nowadays), the House of Latvian Society (which is the Centre for Culture nowadays), the German &#x27;Gymnasium&#x27; (secondary school) in Kalna iela 19 and other buildings as well. Soon the number of local inhabitants doubled, reaching 13,000 just before World War I.

During World War II, the town was under Soviet occupation from 1940, and then under German occupation from 1941 to 1944.

==Sightseeing==

Kuldīga is a small and attractive town in Kurzeme which has always been admired and praised by poets and painters. The &#x27;historical city centre, which developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, has still preserved the old wooden buildings which form small and narrow streets. The oldest wooden building in Kurzeme put up in 1670 can be found near the Town square. The Old Town hall was built in the 17th century. The town square, since the very origins of the settlement, was a place where townspeople used to gather. The tradition has survived: the pulse of the town is best felt in the central square, a venue for weavers&#x27; exhibitions, traditional festivities and other events.

The Venta waterfall (Ventas rumba) is the widest waterfall in Europe. This 240 meter wide naturally formed waterfall is associated with a number of legends and historic events. In spring, one can watch the fish jumping up the ledge; due to this, Kuldīga was once famous as a &quot;place where they catch salmon in the air&quot;.

The old brick bridge across the Venta was built in 1874 and is the longest bridge of this kind in Europe – 164 m. It was built according to 19th century standards – 500 feet long and 26 feet wide, allowing two carriages to pass each other. It consists of seven spans of brick vaults. During World War I two of the spans were blown up. The &#x27;race of the naked&#x27; over the bridge has become an annual tradition for Midsummer nights.
The Alekšupīte River flows directly along the walls of many buildings which is why Kuldīga has been called the Venice of Latvia. Initially the buildings of the town centre were constructed as the suburb of Kuldīga. In 1701, during the Great Northern War, the Swedish army invaded Kuldīga Castle and in 1709 it became uninhabitable, but in the 19th century the castle ruins were relocated.

Alekšupīte Waterfall was created in the 17th century to use the stream to operate the first paper mill in Kurzeme. An annual race is held on the Alekšupīte, when the contestants run directly along the river bottom.

St Catherine&#x27;s Church was originally built in 1252. However, it was built anew with baroque style wood carvings on the altar. The church was given the name of St Catherine, the patroness of the town. One of the most successful rulers of the Duchy of Courland, Duke Jacob was baptized in this church, and his wedding to Princess Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg also took place here.
Liepājas street is a pedestrian street with several 17th–20th-century buildings, interesting doors and special windows.

Sculptress Livija Rezevska&#x27;s sculpture museum was founded in 2003. The visitors may see more than 15 sculptures characterizing Latvian nation, its strength, unity and love.

The Riežupe Sand Caves make up the longest cave labyrinth in Latvia (about 2 km total, 460 m can be toured). During Duke Jacob&#x27;s reign the sand from Riežupe sand caves was taken by ships abroad for glass production.

===Synagogue===
One of the largest buildings in Kuldiga (1905 street 6) known for its splendorous interior in marble with gilded details, is the Jewish synagogue. Documents in ancient Hebrew describing the construction of the building in 1875 are located in the Kuldiga District Museum. It was built during the reign of the tsar Alexander II and was the centre of a vibrant Jewish community. The synagogue was part of a larger complex with an adjacent prayer house, the Jewish sepulchre, and Jewish school, which can still be seen today. The Jewish community had been active since the settlement in the duchy of Courtland in the 16th century. Most of the first immigrants came from north western German territories, but around the mid-17th century unrest in Poland caused an influx of Jews from that region. By the 18th century, the Jewish population of Kurzeme played an active role in the economic life of the province. In 1941 the synagogue became a trap when all of Kuldigas&#x27; Jews were imprisoned in the synagogue and held there for several days by Nazis and Latvian sympathizers, before being divided into smaller groups and shot in the nearby forests. Shortly after the extermination of Jews, Germans set up food storage in the synagogue. Later during the first years of the Soviet Union a grain house was set up inside, and later abandoned for a couple of years. In 1958 the synagogue was transformed into the cinema Kurzeme. It contained 450 seats and a reading room. It remained a cinema until 2003, after the reinstatement of Latvian independence. In later years there was also a café and night club. , the synagogue was completely transformed into the central library of Kuldiga and a performance space. The building in its present state is stately and pristine, but there are no exterior signs of the building&#x27;s Jewish past (such as stars of David). The roof ornaments which can be seen in old photographs of the synagogue are still missing: three bare plinths, like chimneys, mark the gables on either side of the building. There is (as of August 2017) a plaque explaining the history of the building.

<text>A cope ( (&quot;rain coat&quot;) or (&quot;cape&quot;)) is a liturgical long mantle or cloak, open at the front and fastened at the breast with a band or clasp. It may be of any liturgical colour.

A cope may be worn by any rank of the Catholic or Anglican clergy, and by licensed lay ministers on certain occasions. If worn by a bishop, it is generally accompanied by a mitre. The clasp, which is often highly ornamented, is called a &quot;morse&quot;. In art, angels are often shown wearing copes, especially in Early Netherlandish painting.

==History==

There has been little change in the character of the cope since it was first worn by the clergy. It was made of a semicircular piece of silk or other material, its shape distinguishing it from the chasuble, which had straight edges sewn together in front. Both garments are similar in form and origin to the Orthodox phelonion.

Modern copes no longer have a hood. Some early examples feature a triangular hood, which was intended to protect the head during processions, but over time the hood it came to represented by a shield-shaped piece of embroidery that sometimes adorned with a fringe or tassel. Early chasubles depicted in 8th- and 9th-century drawings, have a primitive style of hood, suggesting that the cope and the chasuble had a common origin.

The earliest mentions of a is by the Gallo-Roman historian St. Gregory of Tours, and in the of St Fursey, when a hooded cloak is described. A letter written in 787 by the Benedictine abbot of Monte Cassino, Theodemar, in answer to a question by Charlemagne, King of the Franks, about monks&#x27; clothing. establishes that what in Gaul was styled &quot;cuculla&quot; (cowl) was known to the Cassinese monks as &quot;cappa&quot;. Moreover, the word occurs more than once in Alcuin&#x27;s correspondence, apparently as denoting a garment for everyday wear. When Alcuin twice observes about a &quot;casula&quot; which was sent him, that he meant to wear it always at Mass, this suggests that such garments at this date were not distinctively liturgical owing to anything in their material or construction, but that they were set aside for the use of the altar at the choice of the owner, who might equally well have used them as part of his ordinary attire. In the case of the chasuble the process of liturgical specialization was completed at a comparatively early date, and before the end of the ninth century the maker of a &quot;casula&quot; probably knew quite well in most cases whether he intended his handiwork for a Mass vestment or for an everyday outer garment. But in the case of a &quot;cappa&quot; or cope, this period of specialization seems to have been delayed until much later. The two hundred &quot;cappae&quot; or copes which appear in a Saint-Riquier inventory in the year 801, a number increased to 377 by the year 831, were thought to be mere cloaks, for the most part of rude material and destined for common wear. It may be that their use in choir was believed to add to the decorum and solemnity of the Divine Office, especially in the winter season. In 831 one of the Saint-Riquier copes is specially mentioned as being of chestnut colour and embroidered with gold. This, no doubt, implies use by a dignitary, but it does not prove that it was as yet regarded as a sacred vestment. In fact, according to the conclusions of Edmund Bishop, who was the first to sift the evidence thoroughly, it was not until the twelfth century that the cope, made of rich material, was in general use in the ceremonies of the Church, at which time it had come to be regarded as the special vestment of cantors. Still, an ornamental cope was even then considered a vestment that might be used by any member of the clergy from the highest to the lowest, in fact even by one who was only about to be tonsured.

Amongst monks it was the practice to vest the whole community, except the celebrant and the sacred ministers who assisted the celebrant, in copes at High Mass on the greatest festivals, whereas on feasts of somewhat lower grade, the community were usually vested in albs. Surviving inventories show that the Netherlands, France, and Germany had taken the lead in this movement. For example, already in 870, the Abbey of Saint Trond lists &quot;thirty-three precious copes of silk&quot; as against only twelve chasubles, and it was clearly the Cluny practice in the latter part of the tenth century to vest all the monks in copes during high Mass on the great feasts, though in England the regulations of Saint Dunstan and Saint Aethelwold show no signs of any such observance. The custom spread to the secular canons of such cathedrals as Rouen, and cantors nearly everywhere used copes of silk as their own peculiar adornment in the exercise of their functions.

Meanwhile, the old (&quot;black cape&quot;), or , a choir cape of black material, open or partly open in front, and commonly provided with a functioning hood, still continued in use. While the cope was a liturgical vestment, made of rich, colorful fabric and often highly decorated, the was a practical garment, made of heavy plain black wool and designed to provide warmth in cold weather. Whereas the cope&#x27;s hood had long since become a non-functional decorative item, the hood of the remained functional. The was worn at the [Divine Office by the clergy of cathedral and collegiate churches and also by many religious, as, for example, it is retained by the Dominicans during the winter months down to the present day. No doubt the &quot;copes&quot; of the friars, to which so many references in the Wycliffite literature and in the writings of Chaucer and Langland are found, designate their open mantles, which were part of their full dress, though not always black in colour. On the other hand, it is worth a note that the &quot;cappa clausa&quot;, or close cope, was simply a cope or cape sewn up in front for common outdoor use. &quot;The wearing of this&quot;, says Bishop, &quot;instead of the &quot;cappa scissa&quot;, the same cope not sewn up, is again and again enjoined on the clergy by synods and statutes during the late Middle Ages.&quot;

==Modern use==
===Catholic Church===
Under all these different forms, the cope has not substantially changed its character or shape. The cope is a vestment for processions worn by all ranks of the clergy when assisting at a liturgical function, but it is never worn by the priest and his sacred ministers in celebrating the Mass. At a Pontifical High Mass the cope was worn by the &quot;assistant priest,&quot; a priest who assists the bishop who is the actual celebrant. In the Sarum Rite, the Cope was also prescribed for members of the choir at various times.

It is now the vestment assigned to the celebrant, whether priest or bishop, for almost all functions except the Mass when the celebrant wears the chasuble instead. The cope is used, for example, in processions, in the greater blessings and consecrations, at the solemnly celebrated Liturgy of the Hours, in giving Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and the celebration of other sacraments outside of Mass. For most of these the celebrant may instead wear simply cassock and surplice or alb, both with the stole, for simpler celebrations. The chasuble, which is properly only worn for Mass, may also be worn during processions and other ceremonies that occur directly before or after Mass, such as the absolutions and burial of the dead, at the Asperges before Mass, and at the blessing and imposition of the ashes on Ash Wednesday, to avoid the need for the celebrant to change vestments.

The envisages its use by a bishop if presiding at but not celebrating Mass, for the Liturgy of the Hours, for processions, at the special ceremonies on the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord, Lenten gatherings modelled on the &quot;stations&quot; in Rome, Palm Sunday and Corpus Christi. The bishop may use a cope when celebrating outside of Mass the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, matrimony, penance in solemn form, ordination (if not concelebrating), and anointing of the sick. The list in the index of the continues with several more cases.

As regards liturgical colours, the cope usually follows the color assigned to that day in the liturgical calendar, although white may always be worn for celebrations of a joyful character or before the Blessed Sacrament, and violet may always be worn for celebrations of a penitential character. It may be made of any rich or becoming material, including cloth of gold (which may be used in place of any colour except violet or black). Owing to its ample dimensions and unvarying shape, ancient copes have been preserved in proportionately greater numbers than other vestments and provide the finest surviving specimens of medieval embroidery. Among these the &quot;Syon Cope&quot; in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the &quot;Ascoli Cope&quot; in the Pinacoteca Civica, Ascoli Piceno, are remarkable as representing the highest excellence of that specially English thirteenth-century embroidery known as the (&#x27;English work&#x27;). Copes also provide some magnificent specimens of the jeweller&#x27;s craft. The brooch or clasp, meant to fasten the cope in front, and variously called morse, pectoral, bottone, etc., was an object often in the highest degree precious and costly. The work which was the foundation of all the fortunes of Benvenuto Cellini was the magnificent morse which he made for Pope Clement VII. Some admirable examples of these morses still survive.
The mantum is longer than a cope, and is fastened in the front by an elaborate morse. In earlier centuries it was red, at the time the papal colour. In the 11th and 12th centuries the &quot;immantatio&quot;, or bestowal of the mantum on the newly-elected pope, was regarded as specially symbolical of investiture with papal authority. After the Second Vatican Council and the pontificate of Pope Paul VI, the mantum fell out of use. Some old mantums have been made into copes by being shortened.
The (&quot;great cape&quot;) is a voluminous mantle with a long train, proper to cardinals, bishops, and other honorary prelates. It is a jurisdictional garment.

The is not strictly a liturgical vestment, but only a glorified , or choir cope. It is worn in processions or in choir by those attending but not celebrating services. Its colour for cardinals is ordinarily red; for bishops it is violet. Cardinals and papal nuncios are entitled to wear a of watered silk.

The has a large hood, lined with ermine in winter and silk in summer. It is made to cover not only the back, breast, and shoulders. The hood is functional and was in the past placed on the head and covered with the &quot;galero&quot;, as when the pope created a new cardinal at a consistory. The hood is normally worn over the head only during penitential rites. The few remaining cardinals who still use this garment wear red.

The &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Valde solliciti&quot; of 30 November 1952 decreed that the train of the should be shortened by about half, from . The 1969 &quot;Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates&quot; laid down that:

The , always without ermine, is no longer obligatory; it can be used only outside of Rome, in circumstances of very special solemnity.

It is hardly ever used, except in celebrations according to pre-1969 liturgical books, as when deacons of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest were ordained in 2009. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem uses the ermine-lined winter , because he is bound by the complex and unalterable rules of the &quot;Status quo&quot;, an 1852 Ottoman firman which regulates the delicate relations between the various religious groups that care for the religious sites in the Holy Land. This anomaly is most evident at the Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve in Bethlehem.

===Anglican Communion===
The earliest Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England contemplated the continued use of the cope, with the post-English Reformation 1549 Prayer Book specifying that the priest at Holy Communion should wear &quot;a vestment or cope&quot;. It was common, particularly in English cathedrals, for the priest or bishop to wear a cope for Holy Communion. In the contemporary Anglican Communion, the cope can be worn. Lay ministers, such as readers, are permitted to wear copes on certain occasions, and it is also a tradition for clergy to wear copes on diocesan occasions.

A cope is worn by the Archbishop of Canterbury during the coronation of the Sovereign. Queen Elizabeth II presented a set of ornate copes to the Canons of Westminster Abbey as a coronation gift.

===Lutheran denominations===
The cope is usually worn only for processions and services of the Divine Office (morning and evening prayers) in most Lutheran denominations. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, a cope is usually worn by the bishop when not serving as the presiding minister at Holy Communion. In the Church of Norway and the Church of Denmark the cope is reserved for use by bishops. It is infrequently worn by clerics in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod or other Lutheran denominations, although its use has increased in recent decades.

In the Church of Sweden, bishops regularly wear the cope together with a mitre, crosier and pectoral cross. A cope can also be worn by priests on solemn and ceremonial occasions, such as when presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals. Copes are not worn as a eucharistic vestment by either bishops or priests, when the chasuble is instead prescribed for both.

===Universities===
As part of academic dress, the University of Cambridge uses a cope known as a , made of scarlet superfine cloth with the cowl lined and the cape opening edged with white fur. This was once the congregation robe of a Doctor of Divinity, but has now come to be the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s official congregation dress when conferring degrees. Professors, chairs of degree boards, and their deputies also wear a cope presenting candidates for higher doctoral degrees. The only other place that uses a cope is the University of the South (United States), where the cape hem is edged in fur.

<text>Weapons of Mass Distraction is a 1997 television film directed by Stephen Surjik and written by Larry Gelbart, about two media moguls and their fight over ownership of a professional American football team. The film starred Gabriel Byrne and Ben Kingsley, with an ensemble supporting cast including Illeana Douglas, Mimi Rogers, and Jeffrey Tambor.

The film was nominated for four awards at the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or a Special for Gelbart.

==Plot==
Lionel Powers and Julian Messenger are filthy rich men with vast media holdings and dirty family secrets. They play dirty as well, fighting for control over a professional football team in Los Angeles with every weapon at their disposal. Powers&#x27; bid attracts particular controversy since he intends to retain ownership of a successful football club in Tucson. During Congressional hearings, U.S. Senator Billy Paxton makes his objections to the obvoius conflict of interest clearly known.

As the billionaires ruthlessly scheme and squabble, they wreak havoc on the lives and careers of thousands of people. Powers is particularly unscrupulous as he specifically targets a number of well-known individuals. Among his targets is not only Senator Paxton, against whom he carries an obvious grudge, but also far less &quot;culpable&quot; individuals such as children&#x27;s television presenter Robin Zimmer and plastic surgeon Dr. Jonathon Cummings, whose lives are upended merely because Powers is convinced this will serve (or eliminate a perceived threat to) his interests.

Among the everyday people affected is Jerry Pascoe, who loses his well-paying job as a consequence of wider cost-cutting moves by Powers. As the Pascoe family struggles to make ends meet, Jerry&#x27;s marriage with his wife Rita becomes strained due to Jerry&#x27;s continuing inability to find and hold jobs as menial as cleaning stadium restrooms and selling peanuts.

After Powers and Messenger fail to resolve their differences in a secret face-to-face meeting, the wealthy characters continue to blackmail one another as homeless people look for handouts. The exposure of tabloid-worthy secrets of lives of Powers&#x27; wife Ariel and right-hand man Alan Blanchard lead to dire consequences for all. Although Blanchard is privy to the intimate details of Powers&#x27; most embarrassing personal secret, he opts for suicide insetead of revenge after his downfall.

In spite of all of his ruthlessness, the propects of Powers&#x27; Los Angeles bid look increasingly dim until he is able to procure details of the Messenger family&#x27;s darkest and most damaging secret. Once Powers discreetly divulges his knowledge to Messenger, Senator Paxton quickly brokers an uneasy compromise in which the feuding moguls agree to share ownership of the Los Angeles football franchise.

In the meantime, the marriage of the Pascoes turns tragi-comically from a terrible climax to fodder for reality TV.

<text>STS-36 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission, during which Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; carried a classified payload for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) (believed to have been a Misty reconnaissance satellite) into orbit. STS-36 was the 34th shuttle mission overall, the sixth flight for &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and the fourth night launch of the shuttle program. It launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990, and landed on March 4, 1990.

== Mission summary ==


&quot;Atlantis&quot; launched on the STS-36 mission on February 28, 1990, at 07:50:22UTC (2:50:22amEST, local time at the launch site).&lt;ref name=&quot;Recer 2/28/1990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was originally set for February 22, 1990, but was postponed repeatedly due to the illness of the crew commander and poor weather conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recer 2/24/1990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time since Apollo 13 in 1970 that a crewed space mission was affected by the illness of a crew member.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGDN 2/22/1990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first rescheduled launch attempt, set for February 25, 1990, was scrubbed at T−31 seconds due to a range safety computer malfunction. Another attempt, set for February 26, 1990, was scrubbed during the T−9 minute hold due to weather conditions. The successful launch on February 28, 1990, was set for a classified launch window, lying within a launch period extending from 00:00 to 04:00 EST. The launch weight for this mission was classified.

The launch trajectory was unique to this flight and allowed the mission to reach an orbital inclination of 62°, the deployment orbit of its payload — the normal maximum inclination for a shuttle flight was 57°. This so-called &quot;dog-leg&quot; trajectory saw &quot;Atlantis&quot; fly downrange on a normal launch azimuth and then maneuver to a higher launch azimuth once out over the water. Although the maneuver resulted in a reduction of vehicle performance, it was the only way to reach the required deployment orbit from Kennedy Space Center (originally, the flight had been slated to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, until the shuttle launch program there was cancelled). The payload was considered to be of importance to national security, leading normal flight rules to be suspended, allowing the shuttle to fly over or near Cape Hatteras, Cape Cod, and parts of Canada.

As a Department of Defense operation, STS-36&#x27;s payload remains officially classified. STS-36 launched a single satellite, also described as AFP-731. Other objects (1990-019C-G) reportedly appeared in orbit following its deployment.

It was reported that USA-53 was an Advanced KH-11 photo-reconnaissance satellite, using an all-digital imaging system to return pictures. KH-11 satellites are believed to resemble the Hubble Space Telescope in size and shape, as the satellites were shipped in similar containers and had comparable primary mirror diameters. USA-53, nicknamed &quot;Misty&quot;, was tracked briefly by amateur satellite observers in October and November 1990.

The mission marked another flight of an human skull, which served as the primary element of &quot;Detailed Secondary Objective 469&quot;, also known as the &quot;In-flight Radiation Dose Distribution Experiment&quot; (IDRD). This joint NASA/DoD experiment was designed to examine the penetration of radiation into the human cranium during spaceflight. The female skull was seated in a plastic matrix, representative of tissue, and sliced into ten layers. Hundreds of thermo-luminescent dosimeters were mounted in the skull&#x27;s layers to record radiation levels at multiple depths. This experiment, which also flew on STS-28 and STS-31, was located in the shuttle&#x27;s mid-deck lockers on all three flights, recording radiation levels at different orbital inclinations.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at 18:08:44UTC (10:08:44amPST, local time at the landing site) on March 4, 1990, at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on runway 23 ending the STS-36. The orbiter&#x27;s rollout distance was . &quot;Atlantis&quot; was towed to the 
Mate-Demate Device by around 15:00 PST.

About 62 impacts in the shuttle&#x27;s Thermal Protection System (TPS) tiles were counted by the debris team after the mission. Tile engineers reported that only one tile required replacement. The brakes and tires performed nominally. Drops of hydraulic fluid were observed in the right main landing gear wheel well, the liquid hydrogen disconnect cavity and possibly around two of the main engines.

== Mission insignia ==
The thirty-six stars on the insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence; the stars also form part of a stylized American flag, forming the background to an image of a bald eagle, the American national bird.

<text>STS-41 was the 36th Space Shuttle mission and the eleventh mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The four-day mission had a primary objective of launching the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe as part of the &quot;International Solar Polar Mission&quot; (ISPM).

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==

&quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off on October61990 at 7:47:16a.m. EDT. Liftoff occurred 12minutes after a two-and-a-half-hour launch window opened that day at 7:35a.m. EDT. STS-41 featured the heaviest payload to date; &quot;Discovery&quot; weighed .

The primary payload was the European Space Agency (ESA)-built &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft to explore the polar regions of Sun. Attached to &quot;Ulysses&quot; were two upper stages, the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) and a mission-specific Payload Assist Module-S (PAM-S), combined for the first time to send &quot;Ulysses&quot; toward an out-of-ecliptic trajectory. Other payloads and experiments included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) experiment, Intelsat Solar Array Coupon (ISAC), Chromosome and Plant Cell Division Experiment (CHROMEX), Voice Command System (VCS), Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE), Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP), Physiological Systems Experiment (PSE), Radiation Monitoring Experiment III (RME III), Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) and Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS).

Six hours after &quot;Discovery&quot;″s launch, &quot;Ulysses&quot; was deployed from the payload bay. &quot;Ulysses&quot;, a joint project between the European Space Agency and NASA, was the first spacecraft to study the Sun&#x27;s polar regions. Its voyage to the Sun began with a sixteen-month trip to Jupiter, where the planet&#x27;s gravitational energy was used to fling &quot;Ulysses&quot; southward out of the orbital plane of the planets and on toward a solar south pole passage in 1994. The spacecraft crossed back over the orbital plane and made a solar north pole passage in 1995. By the time &quot;Discovery&quot; touched down at Edwards Air Force Base, California, &quot;Ulysses&quot; had already traversed on its five-year mission.

With &quot;Ulysses&quot; on its way, the STS-41 crew began an ambitious schedule of science experiments. Flowering plant samples were grown in the CHROMEX-2 module in a Kennedy Space Center and Stony Brook University experiment. An earlier version of the experiment flown on STS-29 revealed chromosome damage in root tip cells but no damage to control plants on Earth. By studying plant samples carried on &quot;Discovery&quot;, researchers hoped to determine how the genetic material in the root cells respond to microgravity. The information gained was of importance to future space travelers on long-term expeditions, researchers on the planned Space Station Freedom, and may contribute to advances in intensive farming practices on Earth.

Understanding fire behavior in microgravity was part of the continuing research to improve Space Shuttle safety. In a specially designed chamber called the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE), a strip of paper was burned and filmed to gain an understanding of the development of flame and its movement in the absence of convection currents. This experiment was sponsored by the Lewis Research Center (LeRC) and Mississippi State University.

Atmospheric ozone depletion is an environmental problem of worldwide concern. At the time, NASA&#x27;s Nimbus 7 satellite and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s (NOAA) Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) satellites provided daily data to permit researchers to detect ozone trends. The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) instrument from the Goddard Space Flight Center carried an ozone detector instrument identical to those on the satellites. By comparing &quot;Discovery&quot;″s measurements with coordinated satellite observations, scientists were able to calibrate their satellite instruments to ensure the most accurate readings possible.

In 1990, a commercial expendable launch vehicle stranded an INTELSAT VI communications satellite in low Earth orbit. Before STS-41, NASA was evaluating a possible Shuttle rescue mission in 1992. In preparation for this rescue, solar arrays, similar to those on the satellite, were exposed to the conditions of low orbit to determine if they were in any way altered by the atomic oxygen present. When the returned arrays were closely examined, it was found that the arrays were not significantly damaged. Based on this finding, NASA went ahead and carried out STS-49 in 1992.

Until STS-41, previous research had shown that during the process of adapting to microgravity, animals and humans experienced loss of bone mass, cardiac deconditioning, and after prolonged periods (over 30 days), developed symptoms similar to that of terrestrial disuse osteoporosis. The goal of the STS-41 Physiological Systems Experiment (PSE), sponsored by the Ames Research Center and Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s Center for Cell Research, was to determine if pharmacological treatments would be effective in reducing or eliminating some of these disorders. Proteins, developed by Genentech of San Francisco, California, were administered to eight rats during the flight while another eight rats accompanying them on the flight did not receive the treatment.

The Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP) experiment was conducted to determine the role convection currents play in membrane formation. Membranes are used in commercial applications for purification of medicines, kidney dialysis, and water desalination. This experiment was sponsored in part by the Battelle Advanced Materials Center for the Commercial Development of Space in Columbus, Ohio.

During open periods in the STS-41 crew schedule, the astronauts videotaped a number of demonstrations in an effort to create an educational video tape for middle school students. The tape was later distributed nationwide through NASA&#x27;s Teacher Resource Center network.

The astronauts evaluated the suitability of graphical user interfaces. Previous shuttle crews used Grid Systems laptop computers with command-line interfaces. The evaluation used mostly commercially available hardware and software, including a Macintosh Portable laptop. The astronauts found the Portable&#x27;s trackball did not work well in weightlessness. The evaluation was continued on STS-43, this time using a Macintosh Portable with a modified trackball.

Additional crew activities included experimenting with a voice command system (VCS) to control onboard television cameras and monitoring ionizing radiation exposure to the crew within the orbiter cabin.

On October10,1990, at 6:57:19a.m. PDT, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on runway 22. Rollout distance was , and the rollout time was 49 seconds (including a braking test). &quot;Discovery&quot; was returned to Kennedy Space Center on October16,1990.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-38 was a Space Shuttle mission by NASA using the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. It was the 37th shuttle mission and carried a classified payload for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). It was the seventh flight for &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the seventh flight dedicated to the Department of Defense. The mission was a 4-day mission that traveled and completed 79 revolutions. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility&#x27;s runway 33. The launch was originally scheduled for July 1990 but was rescheduled due to a hydrogen leak found on during the STS-35 countdown. During a rollback to the Orbiter Processing Facility &quot;Atlantis&quot; was damaged during a hail storm. The eventual launch date of November 15, 1990, was set due to a payload problem. The launch window was between 18:30 and 22:30 EST. The launch occurred at 18:48:13 EST. The mission ended with a landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility, marking the first time in five years that a mission returned to the Kennedy Space Center since STS-51-D. This also marked the first time Atlantis ended a mission at the Kennedy Space Center.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Preparations and launch ==
The launch occurred on November 15, 1990, 18:48:13 EST. It was originally scheduled for July 9, 1990, however, a liquid hydrogen leak found on &quot;Columbia&quot; during the STS-35 countdown prompted three precautionary tanking tests on &quot;Atlantis&quot; at the pad on June 29, 1990, on July 13, and on July 25, 1990. Tests confirmed the hydrogen fuel leak on the external tank side of the external tank/orbiter quick disconnect umbilical. This could not be repaired at the pad and &quot;Atlantis&quot; was rolled back to the VAB on August 9, 1990, demated, then transferred to the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). During rollback, the vehicle remained parked outside the VAB for about a day while the &quot;Columbia&quot;/STS-35 stack was transferred to the pad for launch. While outside, &quot;Atlantis&quot; suffered minor hail damage to its tiles during a thunderstorm. After repairs were made in the OPF, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was transferred to the VAB for mating on October 2, 1990. During hoisting operations, the platform beam that was to have been removed from the orbiter&#x27;s aft compartment fell and caused minor damage, which was repaired. The vehicle rolled out to Pad A on October 12, 1990. The fourth mini-tanking test was performed on October 24, 1990, with no excessive hydrogen or oxygen leakage detected. During the Flight Readiness Review (FRR), the launch date was set for November 9, 1990. The launch was reset for November 15 due to payload problems. Liftoff occurred during a classified launch window lying within a launch period extending from 18:30 to 22:30 EST on November 15, 1990.

== Classified payload ==
According to &quot;Aviation Week&quot;, the shuttle initially entered a x orbit at an inclination of 28.45° to the equator. It then executed three orbital maneuvering system (OMS) burns, the last on orbit #4. The first of these circularized the orbit at .

The first classified payload was code-named USA-67, which was deployed from Atlantis&#x27; cargo bay on the seventh orbit and ignited its rocket motor at the ascending node of the eighth orbit to place it in a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). &quot;Aviation Week&quot; reported that USA-67 was a secret ELINT gathering satellite headed for geosynchronous orbit and launched to monitor the events during the first Gulf War in 1990. As a result of there being two upper stages aboard STS-38, USA-67 was originally believed to be a Magnum satellite like those deployed on STS-51-C and STS-33, which were launched via a two-stage Inertial Upper Stage (IUS). Today it is believed that USA-67 was instead a secret Satellite Data System (SDS-2) military communications satellite, like those deployed on STS-28 and STS-53.

It is also believed that USA-67 was not the only satellite deployed during STS-38. A publicly released image of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; vertical stabilizer and upper aft bulkhead, similar to the one released from STS-53, confirms that the ASE (Airborne Support Equipment) for the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) was absent from this flight. An explanation is that two separate satellites were deployed, using single-stage Payload Assist Module (PAM-D). Rumors that appear to have been substantiated by the identification of an &quot;unknown&quot; geostationary satellite by amateur observers insist that the second payload was a stealth satellite known as Prowler, reportedly intended to covertly inspect other nation&#x27;s geostationary satellites.

== Landing ==
The mission was extended by one day due to unacceptable crosswinds at the planned landing site of Edwards Air Force Base. Continued adverse conditions led to a decision to shift the landing to the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at the Kennedy Space Center. The SLF had not been used by a returning shuttle mission in five years, since STS-51-D when &quot;Discovery&quot; suffered extensive brake damage and a ruptured tire during landing. Landing occurred on November 20, 1990, at 21:42:46UTC (4:42:42pmEST, local time). The orbiter rolled down Runway 33 for and 57 seconds. STS-38 marked the first KSC landing for &quot;Atlantis&quot;, weighing at landing.

<text>STS-35 was the tenth flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, the 38th shuttle mission. It was devoted to astronomical observations with ASTRO-1, a Spacelab observatory consisting of four telescopes. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 2, 1990.

== Crew ==

Prior to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, this mission was slated to launch in March 1986 as STS-61-E. Jon A. McBride was originally assigned to command this mission, which would have been his second spaceflight. He chose to retire from NASA in May 1989 and was replaced as mission commander by Vance D. Brand. In addition, Richard N. Richards (as pilot) and David C. Leestma (as mission specialist), were replaced by Guy S. Gardner and John M. Lounge respectively. Fifty-nine-year-old Brand was the oldest astronaut to fly into space until F. Story Musgrave, 61 on STS-80 in 1996, and U.S. Senator John H. Glenn Jr., 77 when he flew on STS-95 in 1998.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Preparations and launch ==

The much-delayed ASTRO-1 had originally been manifested to fly on what would have been the next shuttle mission after &quot;Challenger&#x27;s&quot; ill-fated STS-51-L as STS-61-E in March 1986. The mission was remanifested as STS-35 during the long stand-down after the accident with the addition of the Broad Band X-ray Telescope (BBXRT-01), and the original ASTRO-1 payload was brought out of storage and recertified for flight. &quot;Columbia&quot; rolled out to Pad 39A in late April 1990 for a scheduled launch date of May 16, 1990. Following the Flight Readiness Review (FRR), announcement of a firm launch date was delayed to change a faulty freon coolant loop proportional valve in the orbiter&#x27;s coolant system. At the subsequent Delta FRR, the date was set for May 30, 1990. Launch on May 30 was scrubbed during tanking due to a minor hydrogen leak in the tail service mast on the mobile launcher platform and a major leak in the external tank/orbiter quick disconnect assembly. Hydrogen was also detected in the orbiter&#x27;s aft compartment and believed to be associated with a leak involving the umbilical assembly.

Leakage at the umbilical was confirmed by a mini-tanking test on June 6, 1990. The leakage could not be repaired at the pad, and the vehicle was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) June 12, 1990, demated, and transferred to the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). The orbiter-side umbilical assembly was replaced with one borrowed from &quot;Endeavour&quot;, then still under construction. The external tank (ET) was then fitted with new umbilical hardware. The ASTRO-1 payload was re-serviced regularly and remained in &quot;Columbia&quot;″s cargo bay during orbiter repairs and reprocessing.

&quot;Columbia&quot; was rolled out to Pad A for the second time on August 9, 1990, to support a September 1, 1990, launch date. Two days before launch, the avionics box on the BBXRT-01 portion of the ASTRO-1 payload malfunctioned and had to be changed and retested. Launch was rescheduled for September 6, 1990. During tanking, high concentrations of hydrogen were again detected in the orbiter&#x27;s aft compartment, forcing another postponement. NASA managers concluded that &quot;Columbia&quot; had experienced separate hydrogen leaks from the beginning: one of the umbilical assembly (now replaced) and one or more which had resurfaced in the aft compartment. Suspicion focused on the package of three hydrogen recirculation pumps in the aft compartment. These were replaced and retested. A damaged Teflon cover seal in the main engine number three hydrogen prevalve was replaced. Launch was rescheduled for September 18, 1990. The fuel leak in the aft compartment resurfaced during tanking, and the launch was scrubbed again. The STS-35 mission was put on hold until problem resolved by a special tiger team assigned by the Space Shuttle director.

&quot;Columbia&quot; was transferred to Pad B on October 8, 1990, to make room for &quot;Atlantis&quot; on Mission STS-38. Tropical storm Klaus forced another rollback to the VAB on October 9, 1990. The vehicle was transferred to Pad B again on October 14, 1990. Another mini-tanking test was conducted on October 30, 1990, using special sensors and video cameras and employing a see-through Plexiglas aft compartment door. No excessive hydrogen leakage was detected. With the problem resolved, the flight had only to wait for the completion of STS-38, imparting another four-week delay. A scheduled launch date of November 30, 1990, was moved by several days due to concerns that observations of astronomical targets would be adversely affected. Liftoff on December 2, 1990, was delayed by 21 minutes to allow the U.S. Air Force time to observe low-level clouds that might impede the tracking of the Shuttle&#x27;s ascent. Liftoff finally occurred on December 2, 1990, 1:49:01 a.m. EST, the ninth night launch in shuttle history and the second for &quot;Columbia&quot;. A nominal ascent to orbit followed. This was one of the most delayed launches of the Space Shuttle program.

== Mission highlights ==
The primary payload of mission STS-35 was ASTRO-1, the fifth flight of the Spacelab system and the second with the Igloo and two pallets train configuration. The primary objectives were round-the-clock observations of the celestial sphere in ultraviolet and X-ray spectral wavelengths with the ASTRO-1 observatory, consisting of four telescopes: Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT); Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE); Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT), mounted on the Instrument Pointing System (IPS). The Instrument Pointing System consisted of a three-axis gimbal system mounted on a gimbal support structure connected to a Spacelab pallet at one end and the aft end of the payload at the other, a payload clamping system for support of the mounted experiment during launch and landing, and a control system based on the inertial reference of a three-axis gyro package and operated by a gimbal-mounted microcomputer. The Broad-Band X-Ray Telescope (BBXRT) and its Two-Axis Pointing System (TAPS) rounded out the instrument complement in the aft payload bay.

The crew split into shifts after reaching orbit, with Gardner, Parker, and Parise comprising the Red Team; the Blue Team consisted of Hoffman, Durrance, and Lounge. Commander Brand was unassigned to either team and helped coordinate mission activities. The telescopes were powered up and raised from their stowed position by the Red Team 11 hours into the flight. Observations began under the Blue Team 16 hours into the mission after the instruments were checked out. In a typical ASTRO-1 ultraviolet observation, the flight crew member on duty maneuvered the Shuttle to point the cargo bay in the general direction of the astronomical object to be observed. The mission specialist commanded the pointing system to aim the telescopes toward the target. They also locked on to guide stars to help the pointing system remain stable despite orbiter thruster firings. The payload specialist set up each instrument for the upcoming observation, identified the celestial target on the guide television, and provided the necessary pointing corrections for placing the object precisely in the telescope&#x27;s field of view. He then started the instrument observation sequences and monitored the data being recorded. Because the many observations created a heavy workload, the payload and mission specialists worked together to perform these complicated operations and evaluate the quality of observations. Each observation took between 10 minutes to a little over an hour.

Issues with the pointing precision of the IPS and the sequential overheating failures of both data display units (used for pointing telescopes and operating experiments) during the mission impacted crew-aiming procedures and forced ground teams at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to aim the telescopes with fine-tuning by the flight crew. BBXRT-01 was directed from the outset by ground-based operators at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and was not affected. The X-ray telescope required little attention from the crew. A crew member would turn on the BBXRT and the TAPS at the beginning of operations and then turn them off when the operations concluded. After the telescope was activated, researchers at Goddard could &quot;talk&quot; to the telescope via computer. Before science operations began, stored commands were loaded into the BBXRT computer system. Then, when the astronauts positioned the Shuttle in the general direction of the source, the TAPS automatically pointed the BBXRT at the object. Since the Shuttle could be oriented in only one direction at a time, X-ray observations had to be coordinated carefully with ultraviolet observations. Despite the pointing problems, the full suite of telescopes obtained 231 observations of 130 celestial objects over a combined span of 143 hours. Science teams at Marshall and Goddard estimated that 70% of the mission objectives were completed. ASTRO-1 was the first shuttle mission controlled in part from the Spacelab Mission Operations Control facility at MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama.

During the flight, the crew experienced trouble dumping waste water due to a blocked waste water line, but managed to compensate using spare containers. Problems also affected one RCC thruster and an onboard text and graphics teleprinter used for receiving flight plan updates.

== Additional payloads and experiments ==
Conducting short-wave radio transmissions between ground-based amateur radio operators and a Shuttle-based amateur radio operator was the basis for the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX-II). SAREX communicated with amateur stations in line-of-sight of the orbiter in one of four transmission modes: voice, Slow-scan television (SSTV), data or (uplink only) Fast scan television (FSTV). The voice mode was operated in the attended mode while SSTV, data or FSTV could be operated in either attended or unattended modes. During the mission, SAREX was operated by Payload Specialist Ron Parise, a licensed operator (WA4SIR), during periods when he was not scheduled for orbiter or other payload activities. A ground-based experiment to calibrate electro-optical sensors at Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) in Hawaii was also conducted during the mission. The Space Classroom Program, Assignment: The Stars project was carried out to spark student interest in science, mathematics and technology. Mission Specialist Hoffman conducted the first classroom lesson taught from space on December 7, 1990, in support of this objective, covering material on the electromagnetic spectrum and the ASTRO-1 observatory. A supporting lesson was taught from the ASTRO-1 control center in Huntsville.

== Landing ==
The mission was cut short by one day due to impending bad weather at the primary landing site, Edwards Air Force Base, California. The Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines were fired at 8:48 p.m. PST over the Indian Ocean to deorbit the spacecraft, which landed on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 9:54 p.m. PST, on December 10, 1990, after a mission duration of 8 days, 23 hours, 5 minutes, and 8 seconds. This was the fourth night landing of the shuttle program. Rollout distance: ). Rollout time: 58 seconds. &quot;Columbia&quot; returned to KSC on December 20, 1990, on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA). Landing weight: .

<doc id="497747" wikidata="Q4116233" url="?curid=497747" title="Terminator (genetics)">
<text>In genetics, a transcription terminator is a section of nucleic acid sequence that marks the end of a gene or operon in genomic DNA during transcription. This sequence mediates transcriptional termination by providing signals in the newly synthesized transcript RNA that trigger processes which release the transcript RNA from the transcriptional complex. These processes include the direct interaction of the mRNA secondary structure with the complex and/or the indirect activities of recruited termination factors. Release of the transcriptional complex frees RNA polymerase and related transcriptional machinery to begin transcription of new mRNAs.

==In prokaryotes==
Two classes of transcription terminators, Rho-dependent and Rho-independent, have been identified throughout prokaryotic genomes. These widely distributed sequences are responsible for triggering the end of transcription upon normal completion of gene or operon transcription, mediating early termination of transcripts as a means of regulation such as that observed in transcriptional attenuation, and to ensure the termination of runaway transcriptional complexes that manage to escape earlier terminators by chance, which prevents unnecessary energy expenditure for the cell.

===Rho-dependent terminators===
Rho-dependent transcription terminators require a large protein called a Rho factor which exhibits RNA helicase activity to disrupt the mRNA-DNA-RNA polymerase transcriptional complex. Rho-dependent terminators are found in bacteria and phages. The Rho-dependent terminator occurs downstream of translational stop codons and consists of an unstructured, cytosine-rich sequence on the mRNA known as a Rho utilization site (&quot;rut&quot;), and a downstream transcription stop point (&quot;tsp&quot;). The &quot;rut&quot; serves as a mRNA loading site and as an activator for Rho; activation enables Rho to efficiently hydrolyze ATP and translocate down the mRNA while it maintains contact with the rut site. Rho is able to catch up with the RNA polymerase because it is being stalled at the downstream &quot;tsp&quot; sites. Multiple different sequences can function as a tsp site. Contact between Rho and the RNA polymerase complex stimulates dissociation of the transcriptional complex through a mechanism involving allosteric effects of Rho on RNA polymerase.

===Rho-independent terminators===

Intrinsic transcription terminators or Rho-independent terminators require the formation of a self-annealing hairpin structure on the elongating transcript, which results in the disruption of the mRNA-DNA-RNA polymerase ternary complex. The terminator sequence in DNA contains a 20 basepair GC-rich region of dyad symmetry followed by a short poly-A tract or &quot;A stretch&quot; which is transcribed to form the terminating hairpin and a 7–9 nucleotide &quot;U tract&quot; respectively. The mechanism of termination is hypothesized to occur through a combination of direct promotion of dissociation through allosteric effects of hairpin binding interactions with the RNA polymerase and &quot;competitive kinetics&quot;. The hairpin formation causes RNA polymerase stalling and destabilization, leading to a greater likelihood that dissociation of the complex will occur at that location due to increased time spent paused at that site and reduced stability of the complex.
Additionally, the elongation protein factor NusA interacts with the RNA polymerase and the hairpin structure to stimulate transcriptional termination.

==In eukaryotes==
In eukaryotic transcription of mRNAs, terminator signals are recognized by protein factors that are associated with the RNA polymerase II and which trigger the termination process. The genome encodes one or more polyadenylation signals. Once the signals are transcribed into the mRNA, the proteins cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) transfer from the carboxyl terminal domain of RNA polymerase II to the poly-A signal. These two factors then recruit other proteins to the site to cleave the transcript, freeing the mRNA from the transcription complex, and add a string of about 200 A-repeats to the 3&#x27; end of the mRNA in a process known as polyadenylation. During these processing steps, the RNA polymerase continues to transcribe for several hundred to a few thousand bases and eventually dissociates from the DNA and downstream transcript through an unclear mechanism; there are two basic models for this event known as the torpedo and allosteric models.

===Torpedo model===
After the mRNA is completed and cleaved off at the poly-A signal sequence, the left-over (residual) RNA strand remains bound to the DNA template and the RNA polymerase II unit, continuing to be transcribed. After this cleavage, a so-called exonuclease binds to the residual RNA strand and removes the freshly transcribed nucleotides one at a time (also called &#x27;degrading&#x27; the RNA), moving towards the bound RNA polymerase II. This exonuclease is XRN2 (5&#x27;-3&#x27; Exoribonuclease 2) in humans. This model proposes that XRN2 proceeds to degrade the uncapped residual RNA from 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; until it reaches the RNA pol II unit. This causes the exonuclease to &#x27;push off&#x27; the RNA pol II unit as it moves past it, terminating the transcription while also cleaning up the residual RNA strand.

Similar to Rho-dependent termination, XRN2 triggers the dissociation of RNA polymerase II by either pushing the polymerase off of the DNA template or pulling the template out of the RNA polymerase. The mechanism by which this happens remains unclear, however, and has been challenged not to be the sole cause of the dissociation.

In order to protect the transcribed mRNA from degradation by the exonuclease, a 5&#x27; cap is added to the strand. This is a modified guanine added to the front of mRNA, which prevents the exonuclease from binding and degrading the RNA strand. A 3&#x27; poly(A) tail is added to the end of a mRNA strand for protection from other exonucleases as well.

===Allosteric model===
The allosteric model suggests that termination occurs due to the structural change of the RNA polymerase unit after binding to or losing some of its associated proteins, making it detach from the DNA strand after the signal. This would occur after the RNA pol II unit has transcribed the poly-A signal sequence, which acts as a terminator signal.

RNA polymerase is normally capable of transcribing DNA into single-stranded mRNA efficiently. However, upon transcribing over the poly-A signals on the DNA template, a conformational shift is induced in the RNA polymerase from the proposed loss of associated proteins from its carboxyl terminal domain. This change of conformation reduces RNA polymerase&#x27;s processivity making the enzyme more prone to dissociating from its DNA-RNA substrate. In this case, termination is not completed by degradation of mRNA but instead is mediated by limiting the elongation efficiency of RNA polymerase and thus increasing the likelihood that the polymerase will dissociate and end its current cycle of transcription.

===Non-mRNAs===
The several RNA polymerases in eukaryotes each have their own means of termination. Pol I is stopped by TTF1 (yeast Nsi1), which recognizes a downstream DNA sequence; the endonuclease is XRN2 (yeast Rat1). Pol III is able to terminate on its on on a stretch of As on the template strand.

Finally, Pol II also have poly(A)-independent modes of termination, which is required when it transcribes snRNA and snoRNA genes in yeast. The yeast protein &quot;Nrd1&quot; is responsible. Some human mechanism, possibly PCF11, seems to cause premature termination when pol II transcribes HIV genes.

<text>STS-37, the thirty-ninth NASA Space Shuttle mission and the eighth flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was a six-day mission with the primary objective of launching the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), the second of the Great Observatories program which included the visible-spectrum Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) and the infrared Spitzer Space Telescope. The mission also featured two spacewalks, the first since 1985.

== Crew ==
=== Spacewalks ===
;EVA 1
* Personnel: Apt and Ross
* Date: April 7, 1991 (≈18:00–22:00 UTC)
* Duration: 4 hours, 32 minutes

;EVA 2
* Personnel: Apt and Ross
* Date: April 8, 1991 (14:51–20:38 UTC)
* Duration: 5 hours, 57 minutes

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Preparations and launch ==
The STS-37 mission was successfully launched from launch pad 39B at 9:22:44 a.m. EST on April 5, 1991, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Resumption of the countdown after the T−9-minute hold was delayed about 4 minutes 45 seconds because of two possible weather-condition violations of the launch commit criteria (LCC). The first concerned the cloud ceiling being less than the minimum of for a return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort, and the second concerned the possible weather-condition (wind) effects on blast propagation. Both conditions were found acceptable and the launch countdown proceeded to a satisfactory launch to an inclination of 28.45°. Launch weight: .

== Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ==
The primary payload, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), was deployed on flight day 3. CGRO&#x27;s high-gain antenna failed to deploy on command; it was finally freed and manually deployed by Ross and Apt during an unscheduled contingency spacewalk, the first since April 1985. The following day, the two astronauts performed the first scheduled spacewalk since November 1985 to test means for astronauts to move themselves and equipment about while maintaining the then-planned Space Station Freedom. CGRO science instruments were Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL), Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) and Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment (OSSE). CGRO was the second of NASA&#x27;s four Great Observatories. The Hubble Space Telescope, deployed during Mission STS-31 in April 1990, was the first. CGRO was launched on a two-year mission to search for the high-energy celestial gamma ray emissions, which cannot penetrate Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. At about , CGRO was the heaviest satellite to be deployed into low Earth orbit from the Shuttle. It was also designed to be the first satellite that could be refueled in orbit by Shuttle crews. Five months after deployment, NASA renamed the satellite the Arthur Holly Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, or Compton Observatory, after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who did important work in gamma-ray astronomy.

== Spacewalks ==


The first U.S. extravehicular activity (EVA) or spacewalk since 1985 was performed by Mission Specialists Ross and Apt after six failed attempts to deploy the satellite&#x27;s high-gain antenna. Repeated commands by ground controllers at the Payload Operations Control Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and maneuvering of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and its Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) robot arm, as well as CGRO&#x27;s antenna dish, were to no avail in dislodging the boom. Ross and Apt were prepared for such a contingency, and Ross freed the antenna boom within 17 minutes after beginning the spacewalk. It was the first unscheduled contingency EVA since STS-51-D in April 1985. Deployment occurred about 18:35 EST, approximately 4 hours after it was scheduled.

The following day, on April 8, 1991, Ross and Apt made the first scheduled EVA since Mission STS-61-B in November 1985. The spacewalk was to test methods of moving crew members and equipment around the future Space Station Freedom. One of the experiments was to evaluate manual, mechanical and electrical power methods of moving carts around the outside of large structures in space. Although all three methods worked, the astronauts reported that propelling the cart manually or hand-over-hand worked best. With both EVAs, Ross and Apt logged 10 hours and 29 minutes walking in space during STS-37. Crew members also reported success with secondary experiments.

During the second EVA, a stainless steel palm restraint bar punctured the pressure bladder of Apt&#x27;s right glove. However, the astronaut&#x27;s hand and silk comfort glove partially sealed the hole, resulting in no detectable depressurization. In fact, the puncture was not noticed until postflight examination.

== Additional payloads and experiments ==
Secondary payloads included Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA), which involved scheduled six-hour spacewalk by astronauts Ross and Apt (see above); Ascent Particle Monitor (APM); Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX II); Protein Crystal Growth (PCG); Bioserve/Instrumentation Technology Associates Materials Dispersion Apparatus (BIMDA); Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME Ill); and Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) experiment. Among the other payloads flown was the first flight of the Bioserve/Instrumentation Technology Associates Materials Dispersion Apparatus (BIMDA) to explore the commercial potential of experiments in the biomedical, manufacturing processes and fluid sciences fields, and the Protein Crystal Growth experiment, which has flown eight times before in various forms. Astronaut Pilot Kenneth D. Cameron was the primary operator of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), although all five crew members participated as amateur radio operators. It was arguably the first time that the astronauts received fast scan amateur television video from the ham radio club station (W5RRR) at Johnson Space Center (JSC).

During the spaceflight, the crew was additionally able to photograph the Kuwaiti oil fires on April 7, 1991, as the Gulf War was ongoing during the spaceflight.

== Landing ==
On April 11, 1991, at 06:55:29 PDT, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on runway 33 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The rollout distance was , and the rollout time was 56 seconds. The landing was originally scheduled for April 10, 1991, but was delayed one day by weather conditions at Edwards and Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The orbiter returned to KSC on April 18, 1991. The landing weight was .

An incorrect call on winds aloft caused &quot;Atlantis&quot; to land 623 feet (190 metres) short of the lakebed runway&#x27;s threshold marking. This did not present a problem, since the orbiter landed on the dry lakebed of Edwards, and was not obvious to most viewers. Had the landing been attempted at the Kennedy Space Center, the result would have been a touchdown on the paved underrun preceding the runway and would have been much more obvious. The landing speed was 168 knots equivalent airspeed (KEAS), 13 knots faster than the slowest landing of the Shuttle program, STS-28&#x27;s 155 KEAS.

== Mission insignia ==
The three stars on the top and seven stars on the bottom of the insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence. The stars also represented the Amateur Radio term &quot;73&quot; or &quot;Best regards&quot;, consistent with the fact that the entire crew had become licensed and operated the SAREX-II experiment while on orbit.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="497752" wikidata="Q5870590" url="?curid=497752" title="History of the United States Constitution">
<text>The United States Constitution has served as the supreme law of the United States since taking effect in 1789. The document was written at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention and was ratified through a series of state conventions held in 1787 and 1788. Since 1789, the Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; particularly important amendments include the ten amendments of the United States Bill of Rights and the three Reconstruction Amendments.

The Constitution grew out of efforts to reform the Articles of Confederation, an earlier constitution which provided for a loose alliance of states with a weak central government. From May 1787 through September 1787, delegates from twelve of the thirteen states convened in Philadelphia, where they wrote a new constitution. Two alternative plans were developed at the convention. The nationalist majority, soon to be called &quot;Federalists&quot;, put forth the Virginia Plan, a consolidated government based on proportional representation among the states by population. The &quot;old patriots&quot;, later called &quot;Anti-Federalists&quot;, advocated the New Jersey Plan, a purely federal proposal, based on providing each state with equal representation. The Connecticut Compromise allowed for both plans to work together. Other controversies developed regarding slavery and a Bill of Rights in the original document.

The drafted Constitution was submitted to the Congress of the Confederation in September 1787; that same month it approved the forwarding of the Constitution as drafted to the states, each of which would hold a ratification convention. &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, were published in newspapers while the states were debating ratification, which provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the new government. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that eleven states had ratified the new Constitution, and chose dates for federal elections and the transition to the new constitution on March 4, 1789. The new government began on March 4, 1789, with eleven states assembled in New York City. North Carolina waited to ratify the Constitution until after the Bill of Rights was passed by the new Congress, and Rhode Island&#x27;s ratification would only come after a threatened trade embargo.

In 1791, the states ratified the Bill of Rights, which established protections for various civil liberties. The Bill of Rights initially only applied to the federal government, but following a process of incorporation most protections of the Bill of Rights now apply to state governments. Further amendments to the Constitution have addressed federal relationships, election procedures, terms of office, expanding the electorate, financing the federal government, consumption of alcohol, and congressional pay. Between 1865 and 1870, the states ratified the Reconstruction Amendments, which abolished slavery, guaranteed equal protection of the law, and implemented prohibitions on the restriction of voter rights. The meaning of the Constitution is interpreted by judicial review in the federal courts. The original parchment copies are on display at the National Archives Building.

==Revolution and early governance==
===Declaration of Independence===

On June 4, 1776, a resolution was introduced in the Second Continental Congress declaring the union with Great Britain to be dissolved, proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective states. Independence was declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a plan of confederation was postponed. Although the Declaration was a statement of principles, it did not create a government or even a framework for how politics would be carried out. It was the Articles of Confederation that provided the necessary structure to the new nation during and after the American Revolution. The Declaration, however, did set forth the ideas of natural rights and the social contract that would help form the foundation of constitutional government.

The era of the Declaration of Independence is sometimes called the &quot;Continental Congress&quot; period. John Adams famously estimated as many as one-third of those resident in the original thirteen colonies were patriots. Scholars such as Gordon Wood describe how Americans were caught up in the Revolutionary fervor and excitement of creating governments, societies, a new nation on the face of the earth by rational choice as Thomas Paine declared in &quot;Common Sense&quot;.

Republican government and personal liberty for &quot;the people&quot; were to overspread the New World continents and to last forever, a gift to posterity. These goals were influenced by Enlightenment philosophy. The adherents to this cause seized on English Whig political philosophy as described by historian Forrest McDonald as justification for most of their changes to received colonial charters and traditions. It was rooted in opposition to monarchy they saw as venal and corrupting to the &quot;permanent interests of the people.&quot;

To these partisans, voting was the only permanent defense of the people. Elected terms for legislature were cut to one year, for Virginia&#x27;s Governor, one year without re-election. Property requirements for suffrage for men were reduced to taxes on their tools in some states. Free blacks in New York could vote if they owned enough property. New Hampshire was thinking of abolishing all voting requirements for men except residency and religion. New Jersey let women vote. In some states, senators were now elected by the same voters as the larger electorate for the House, and even judges were elected to one-year terms.

These &quot;radical Whigs&quot; were called the people &quot;out-of-doors.&quot; They distrusted not only royal authority, but any small, secretive group as being unrepublican. Crowds of men and women massed at the steps of rural Court Houses during market-militia-court days. Shays&#x27; Rebellion (1786–87) is a famous example. Urban riots began by the out-of-doors rallies on the steps of an oppressive government official with speakers such as members of the Sons of Liberty holding forth in the &quot;people&#x27;s &quot;committees&quot; until some action was decided upon, including hanging his effigy outside a bedroom window, or looting and burning down the offending tyrant&#x27;s home.

=== First and Second Continental Congresses ===

The First Continental Congress met from September 5 to October 26, 1774. It agreed that the states should impose an economic boycott on British trade, and drew up a petition to King George III, pleading for redress of their grievances and repeal of the Intolerable Acts. It did not propose independence or a separate government for the states.

The Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, and functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; national government at the outset of the Revolutionary War. Beginning in 1777, the substantial powers assumed by Congress &quot;made the league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history&quot;. The process created the United States &quot;by the people in collectivity, rather than by the individual states&quot;, because only four states had constitutions at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and three of those were provisional.

The Supreme Court in Penhallow v. Doane&#x27;s Administrators (1795), and again in Ware v. Hylton (1796), ruled on the federal government&#x27;s powers prior to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. It said that Congress exercised powers derived from the people, expressly conferred through the medium of state conventions or legislatures, and, once exercised, those powers were &quot;impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people&quot;.

===Confederation Period===

The Articles of Confederation was approved by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for ratification. It came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. Over the previous four years it had been used by Congress as a &quot;working document&quot; to administer the early United States government and win the Revolutionary War.

Lasting successes under the Articles of Confederation included the Treaty of Paris with Britain and the Land Ordinance of 1785, whereby Congress promised settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains full citizenship and eventual statehood. Some historians characterize this period from 1781 to 1789 as weakness, dissension, and turmoil. Other scholars view the evidence as reflecting an underlying stability and prosperity. But the returning of prosperity in some areas did not slow the growth of domestic and foreign problems. Nationalists saw the confederation&#x27;s central government as not strong enough to establish a sound financial system, regulate trade, enforce treaties, or go to war when needed.

The Congress of the Confederation, as defined in the Articles of Confederation, was the sole organ of the national government; there was no national court to interpret laws nor an executive branch to enforce them. Governmental functions, including declarations of war and calls for an army, were voluntarily supported by each state, in full, partly, or not at all.

The newly independent states, separated from Britain, no longer received favored treatment at British ports. The British refused to negotiate a commercial treaty in 1785 because the individual American states would not be bound by it. Congress could not act directly upon the States nor upon individuals. It had no authority to regulate foreign or interstate commerce. Every act of government was left to the individual States. Each state levied taxes and tariffs on other states at will, which invited retaliation. Congress could vote itself mediator and judge in state disputes, but states did not have to accept its decisions.

The weak central government could not back its policies with military strength, embarrassing it in foreign affairs. The British refused to withdraw their troops from the forts and trading posts in the new nation&#x27;s Northwest Territory, as they had agreed to do in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. British officers on the northern boundaries and Spanish officers to the south supplied arms to Native American tribes, allowing them to attack American settlers. The Spanish refused to allow western American farmers to use their port of New Orleans to ship produce.

Revenues were requisitioned by Congressional petition to each state. None paid what they were asked; sometimes some paid nothing. Congress appealed to the thirteen states for an amendment to the Articles to tax enough to pay the public debt as principal came due. Twelve states agreed, Rhode Island did not, so it failed. The Articles required super majorities. Amendment proposals to states required ratification by all thirteen states, all important legislation needed 70% approval, at least nine states. Repeatedly, one or two states defeated legislative proposals of major importance.

Without taxes the government could not pay its debt. Seven of the thirteen states printed large quantities of their own paper money, backed by gold, land, or nothing, so there was no fair exchange rate among them. State courts required state creditors to accept payments at face value with a fraction of real purchase power. The same legislation that these states used to wipe out the Revolutionary debt to patriots was used to pay off promised veteran pensions. The measures were popular because they helped both small farmers and plantation owners pay off their debts.

The Massachusetts legislature was one of the five against paper money. It imposed a tightly limited currency and high taxes. Without paper money veterans without cash lost their farms for back taxes. This triggered Shays&#x27; Rebellion to stop tax collectors and close the courts. Troops quickly suppressed the rebellion, but nationalists like George Washington warned, &quot;There are combustibles in every state which a spark might set fire to.&quot;

==Prelude to the Constitutional Convention==

=== Mount Vernon Conference ===

An important milestone in interstate cooperation outside the framework of the Articles of Confederation occurred in March 1785, when delegates representing Maryland and Virginia met in Virginia, to address navigational rights in the states&#x27;s common waterways. On March 28, 1785, the group drew up a thirteen-point proposal to govern the two states&#x27; rights on the Potomac River, Pocomoke River, and Chesapeake Bay. Known as the Mount Vernon Compact (formally titled the &quot;Compact of 1785&quot;), this agreement not only covered tidewater navigation but also extended to issues such as toll duties, commerce regulations, fishing rights, and debt collection. Ratified by the legislatures of both states, the compact, which is still in force, helped set a precedent for later meetings between states for discussions into areas of mutual concern.

The conference&#x27;s success encouraged James Madison to introduce a proposal in the Virginia General Assembly for further debate of interstate issues. With Maryland&#x27;s agreement, on January 21, 1786, Virginia invited all the states to attend another interstate meeting later that year in Annapolis, Maryland, to discuss the trade barriers between the various states.

===Constitutional reforms considered===
The Congress of the Confederation received a report on August 7, 1786, from a twelve-member &quot;Grand Committee&quot;, appointed to develop and present &quot;such amendments to the Confederation, and such resolutions as it may be necessary to recommend to the several states, for the purpose of obtaining from them such powers as will render the federal government adequate to&quot; its declared purposes. Seven amendments to the Articles of Confederation were proposed. Under these reforms, Congress would gain &quot;sole and exclusive&quot; power to regulate trade. States could not favor foreigners over citizens. Tax bills would require 70% vote, public debt 85%, not 100%. Congress could charge states a late payment penalty fee. A state withholding troops would be charged for them, plus a penalty. If a state did not pay, Congress could collect directly from its cities and counties. A state payment on another&#x27;s requisition would earn annual 6%. There would have been a national court of seven. No-shows at Congress would have been banned from any U.S. or state office. These proposals were, however, sent back to committee without a vote and were not taken up again.

=== Annapolis Convention ===

The Annapolis Convention, formally titled &quot;A Meeting of Commissioners to Remedy Defects of the Federal Government&quot;, convened at George Mann&#x27;s Tavern on September 11, 1786. Delegates from five states gathered to discuss ways to facilitate commerce between the states and establish standard rules and regulations. At the time, each state was largely independent from the others and the national government had no authority in these matters.

Appointed delegates from four states either arrived too late to participate or otherwise decided not attend. Because so few states were present, delegates did not deem &quot;it advisable to proceed on the business of their mission.&quot; However, they did adopt a report calling for another convention of the states to discuss possible improvements to the Articles of Confederation. They desired that Constitutional Convention take place in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.

Legislatures of seven states—Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Georgia—immediately approved and appointed their delegations. New York and others hesitated thinking that only the Continental Congress could propose amendments to the Articles. Congress then called the convention at Philadelphia. The &quot;Federal Constitution&quot; was to be changed to meet the requirements of good government and &quot;the preservation of the Union&quot;. Congress would then approve what measures it allowed, then the state legislatures would unanimously confirm whatever changes of those were to take effect.

==Constitutional Convention==

Twelve state legislatures, Rhode Island being the only exception, sent delegates to convene at Philadelphia in May 1787. While the resolution calling the Convention specified that its purpose was to propose amendments to the Articles, through discussion and debate it became clear by mid-June that the convention would propose a Constitution with a fundamentally new design.

===Sessions===
The Congress of the Confederation endorsed a plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on February 21, 1787. It called on each state legislature to send delegates to a convention &quot;&#x27;for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation&#x27; in ways that, when approved by Congress and the states, would &#x27;render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the Union.&#x27;&quot;

To amend the Articles into a workable government, 74 delegates from the twelve states were named by their state legislatures; 55 showed up, and 39 eventually signed. On May 3, eleven days early, James Madison arrived to Philadelphia and met with James Wilson of the Pennsylvania delegation to plan strategy. Madison outlined his plan in letters: (1) State legislatures shall each send delegates instead of using members of the Congress of the Confederation. (2) The convention will reach agreement with signatures from every state. (3) The Congress of the Confederation will approve it and forward it to the state legislatures. (4) The state legislatures independently call one-time conventions to ratify it, using delegates selected via each state&#x27;s various rules of suffrage. The convention was to be &quot;merely advisory&quot; to the people voting in each state.
====Convening and Rules====
George Washington arrived on time, Sunday, the day before the scheduled opening. For the entire duration of the convention, Washington was a guest at the home of Robert Morris, Congress&#x27; financier for the American Revolution and a Pennsylvania delegate. Morris entertained the delegates lavishly. William Jackson, in two years to be the president of the Society of the Cincinnati, had been Morris&#x27; agent in England for a time; and he won election as a non-delegate to be the convention secretary.

The convention was scheduled to open May 14, but only Pennsylvania and Virginia delegations were present. The convention was postponed until a quorum of seven states gathered on Friday the 25th. George Washington was elected the Convention president, and Chancellor (judge) George Wythe (Va) was chosen Chair of the Rules Committee. The rules of the convention were published the following Monday.

Nathaniel Gorham (MA) was elected Chair of the &quot;Committee of the Whole&quot;. These were the same delegates in the same room, but they could use informal rules for the interconnected provisions in the draft articles to be made, remade and reconnected as the order of business proceeded. The Convention officials and adopted procedures were in place before the arrival of nationalist opponents such as John Lansing (NY) and Luther Martin (MD). By the end of May, the stage was set.

The Constitutional Convention voted to keep the debates secret so that the delegates could speak freely, negotiate, bargain, compromise and change. Yet the proposed Constitution as reported from the convention was an &quot;innovation&quot;, the most dismissive epithet a politician could use to condemn any new proposal. It promised a fundamental change from the old confederation into a new, consolidated yet federal government. The accepted secrecy of usual affairs conducted in regular order did not apply. It became a major issue in the very public debates leading up to the crowd-filled ratification conventions.

Despite the public outcry against secrecy among its critics, the delegates continued in positions of public trust. State legislatures chose ten Convention delegates of their 33 total for the Constitutional Convention that September.

====Quorum====

Every few days, new delegates arrived, happily noted in Madison&#x27;s Journal. But as the Convention went on, individual delegate coming and going meant that a state&#x27;s vote could change with the change of delegation composition. The volatility added to the inherent difficulties, making for an &quot;ever-present danger that the Convention might dissolve and the entire project be abandoned.&quot;

Although twelve states sent delegations, there were never more than eleven represented in the floor debates, often fewer. State delegations absented themselves at votes different times of day. There was no minimum for a state delegation; one would do. Daily sessions would have thirty members present. Members came and went on public and personal business. The Congress of the Confederation was meeting at the same time, so members would absent themselves to New York City on Congressional business for days and weeks at a time.

But the work before them was continuous, even if attendance was not. The Convention resolved itself into a &quot;Committee of the Whole&quot;, and could remain so for days. It was informal, votes could be taken and retaken easily, positions could change without prejudice, and importantly, no formal quorum call was required. The nationalists were resolute. As Madison put it, the situation was too serious for despair. They used the same State House, later named Independence Hall, as the Declaration signers. The building setback from the street was still dignified, but the &quot;shaky&quot; steeple was gone. When they adjourned each day, they lived in nearby lodgings, as guests, roomers or renters. They ate supper with one another in town and taverns, &quot;often enough in preparation for tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.&quot;

Delegates reporting to the Convention presented their credentials to the Secretary, Major William Jackson of South Carolina. The state legislatures of the day used these occasions to say why they were sending representatives abroad. New York thus publicly enjoined its members to pursue all possible &quot;alterations and provisions&quot; for good government and &quot;preservation of the Union&quot;. New Hampshire called for &quot;timely measures to enlarge the powers of Congress&quot;. Virginia stressed the &quot;necessity of extending the revision of the federal system to all its defects&quot;. Conversely, Delaware categorically forbade any alteration of the Articles one-vote-per-state provision in the Articles of Confederation. The convention would have a great deal of work to do to reconcile the many expectations in the chamber. At the same time, delegates wanted to finish their work by fall harvest and its commerce.

====Agenda====

On May 29, Edmund Randolph (VA) proposed the Virginia Plan, which unofficially set the agenda for the convention. It was weighted toward the interests of the larger, more populous states. The intent was to meet the purposes set out in the Articles of Confederation, &quot;common defense, security of liberty and general welfare&quot;. The Virginia Plan was national, authority flowed from the people. If the people will ratify them, changes for better republican government and national union should be proposed.

Much of the Virginia Plan was adopted. All the powers in the Articles transfer to the new government. Congress has two houses, the &#x27;house&#x27; apportioned by population. It can enact laws affecting more than one state and Congress can override a veto. The President can enforce the law. The Supreme Court and inferior courts rule on international, U.S. and state law. The Constitution is the supreme law and all state officers swear to uphold the Constitution. Every state is a republic, and new states can be admitted. The Congress of the Confederation continued until the new system started. Amendments are possible without Congress. The Convention recommendations went to Congress, from them to the states. State legislatures set the election rules for ratification conventions, and the people &quot;expressly&quot; chose representatives to consider and decide about the Constitution.

June 15, William Paterson (NJ) proposed the Convention minority&#x27;s New Jersey Plan. It was weighted toward the interests of the smaller, less populous states. The intent was to preserve the states from a plan to &quot;destroy or annihilate&quot; them. The New Jersey Plan was purely federal, authority flowed from the states. Gradual change should come from the states. If the Articles could not be amended, then advocates argued that should be the report from the convention to the states.

Although the New Jersey Plan only survived three days as a proposal, it served as an important alternative to the Virginia Plan. Substantial elements of the New Jersey Plan were eventually adopted. The articles were &quot;revised, corrected and enlarged&quot; for good government and preservation of the Union. The Senate is elected by the states, at first by the state legislatures. Congress passes acts for revenue collected directly in the states, and the rulings of state courts are reviewed by the Supreme Court. State apportionment for taxes failed, but the &#x27;house&#x27; is apportioned by the population count of free inhabitants and three-fifths of others originally. States can be added to the Union. Presidents appoint federal judges. Treaties entered into by Congress are the supreme law of the land. All state judiciaries are bound to enforce treaties, state laws notwithstanding. The President can raise an army to enforce treaties in any state. States treat a violation of law in another state as though it happened there.

Current knowledge of drafting the Constitution comes primarily from the Journal left by James Madison, found chronologically incorporated in Max Farrand&#x27;s &quot;The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787&quot;, which included the Convention Journal and sources from other Federalists and Anti-Federalists.

Scholars observe that it is unusual in world history for the minority in a revolution to have the influence that the &quot;old patriot&quot; Anti-Federalists had over the &quot;nationalist&quot; Federalists who had the support of the revolutionary army in the Society of the Cincinnati. Both factions were intent on forging a nation in which both could be full participants in the changes which were sure to come, since that was most likely to allow for their national union, guarantee liberty for their posterity, and promote their mutual long-term material prosperity.

====Debate Over Slavery====

The contentious issue of slavery was too controversial to be resolved during the convention. But it was at center stage in the Convention three times: June 7 regarding who would vote for Congress, June 11 in debate over how to proportion relative seating in the &#x27;house&#x27;, and August 22 relating to commerce and the future wealth of the nation.

Once the Convention looked at how to proportion the House representation, tempers among several delegates exploded over slavery. When the Convention progressed beyond the personal attacks, it adopted the existing &quot;federal ratio&quot; for taxing states by three-fifths of slaves held.

On August 6, the Committee of Detail reported its proposed revisions to the Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again the question was met with attacks of outrage. Over the next two weeks, delegates wove a web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but only then. Later generations could try out their own answers. The delegates were trying to make a government that might last that long.

Migration of the free or &quot;importation&quot; of indentures and slaves could continue by states, defining slaves as persons, not property. Long-term power would change by population as counted every ten years. Apportionment in the House would not be by wealth, it would be by people, the free citizens and three-fifths the number of other persons meaning propertyless slaves and taxed Indian farming families.

In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson sent a message to the 9th Congress on their constitutional opportunity to remove U.S. citizens from the transatlantic slave trade &quot;[violating] human rights&quot;. The 1807 &quot;Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves&quot; took effect the first instant the Constitution allowed, January 1, 1808. The United States joined the British that year in the first &quot;international humanitarian campaign&quot;.

In the 1840–1860 era abolitionists denounced the Fugitive Slave Clause and other protections of slavery. William Lloyd Garrison famously declared the Constitution &quot;a covenant with death and an agreement with Hell.&quot;

In ratification conventions, the anti-slavery delegates sometimes began as anti-ratification votes. Still, the Constitution &quot;as written&quot; was an improvement over the Articles from an abolitionist point of view. The Constitution provided for abolition of the slave trade but the Articles did not. The outcome could be determined gradually over time. Sometimes contradictions among opponents were used to try to gain abolitionist converts. In Virginia, Federalist George Nicholas dismissed fears on both sides. Objections to the Constitution were inconsistent, &quot;At the same moment it is opposed for being promotive and destructive of slavery!&quot; But the contradiction was never resolved peaceably, and the failure to do so contributed to the Civil War.

===&quot;Great&quot; Connecticut Compromise===
Roger Sherman (CT), although something of a political broker in Connecticut, proved to a pivotal though unlikely leader at the convention. But on June 11, he proposed the first version of the convention&#x27;s &quot;Great Compromise&quot;. It was like the proposal he made in the 1776 Continental Congress. Representation in Congress should be both by states and by population. There, he was voted down by the small states in favor of all states equal, one vote only. Now in 1787 Convention, he wanted to balance all the big-state victories for population apportionment. He proposed that in the second &#x27;senate&#x27; branch of the legislature, each state should be equal, one vote and no more. The motion for equal state representation in a &#x27;senate&#x27; failed: 6 against, 5 for.

After these defeats, the delegates who called themselves the &quot;old patriots&quot; of 1776 and the &quot;men of original principles&quot; organized a caucus in the convention. William Paterson (NJ) spoke for them introducing his &quot;New Jersey Plan&quot;. Roger Sherman (CT), a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was with them. Supporters explained that it &quot;sustained the sovereignty of the states&quot;, while the Edmund Randolph (VA) &quot;Virginia Plan&quot; erased it. The convention had no authority to propose anything not sent up from state legislatures, and the states were not likely to adopt anything new. The &quot;nationalists&quot; answered, The convention could not conclude anything, but it could recommend anything.

&quot;Patriots&quot; said if their legislature knew anything about proposals for consolidated government, it would not have sent anyone. &quot;Nationalists&quot; countered, that it would be treason to withhold any proposal for good government when the salvation of the American republic was at stake. Three sessions after its introduction, the New Jersey Plan failed : 7 against, 3 for, 1 divided. For nearly a month there was no progress; small states were seriously thinking of walking out of the convention.

Then June 25, the &quot;original principles&quot; men finally won a vote. The &#x27;senate&#x27; would be chosen by the state legislatures, not the people, passed: 9 for, 2 against. The basis of representation for both the &#x27;house&#x27; and the &#x27;senate&#x27; re-surfaced. Sherman tried a second time to get his idea for a &#x27;house&#x27; on the basis of population and a &#x27;senate&#x27; on an equal states basis. The &quot;big states&quot; got their population &#x27;house&#x27; win, then his equal state &#x27;senate&#x27; motion was dropped without a vote. The majority adjourned &quot;before a determination was taken in the House.&quot; Luther Martin (MD) insisted that he would rather divide the Union into regional governments than submit to a consolidated government under the Randolph Plan.

Sherman&#x27;s proposal came up again for the third time from Oliver Ellsworth (CT). In the &quot;senate&quot;, the states should have equal representation. Advocates said that it could not be agreed to, the union would fall apart somehow. Big states would not be trusted, the small states could confederate with a foreign power showing &quot;more good faith&quot;. If delegates could not unite behind this here, one day the states could be united by &quot;some foreign sword&quot;. On the question of equal state representation, the Convention adjourned in the same way again, &quot;before a determination was taken in the House.&quot;.

On July 2, the convention for the fourth time considered a &quot;senate&quot; with equal state votes. This time a vote was taken, but it stalled again, tied at 5 yes, 5 no, 1 divided. The Convention elected one delegate out of the delegation of each state onto a Committee to make a proposal; it reported July 5. Nothing changed over five days. July 10, Lansing and Yates (NY) quit the Convention in protest over the big state majorities repeatedly overrunning the small state delegations in vote after vote. No direct vote on the basis of &#x27;senate&#x27; representation was pushed on the floor for another week.

With delegates unable to reconcile their differences, the Convention elected one delegate from each state to the First Committee on Representation to make a proposal. Unlike debate in the Committee of the Whole, the membership of the committee, led by Elbridge Gerry and including Sherman, was carefully selected and was more sympathetic to the views of the small states. The membership of the committee made a compromise amongst delegates more likely. After meeting, the Committee reported its proposal on July 5. The Committee proposed a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the House and equal state representation in the Senate. As a concession to large states, all bills raising revenue had to originate in the House.

Nothing changed for five days until Lansing and Yates (NY) left the Convention in protest over the large state majorities repeatedly overrunning the small state delegations in vote after vote. No direct vote on the basis of &#x27;senate&#x27; representation was pushed on the floor for another week. But the Convention floor leaders kept moving forward where they could. First the new &#x27;house&#x27; seat apportionment was agreed, balancing big and small, north and south. The big states got a decennial census for &#x27;house&#x27; apportionment to reflect their future growth. Northerners had insisted on counting only free citizens for the &#x27;house&#x27;; southern delegations wanted to add property. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s compromise was that there would be no &quot;property&quot; provision to add representatives, but states with large slave populations would get a bonus added to their free persons by counting three-fifths other &quot;persons&quot;.

On July 16, Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Great Compromise&quot; prevailed on its fifth try. Every state was to have equal numbers in the United States Senate. Washington ruled it passed on the vote 5 yes, 4 no, 1 divided. It was not that five states constituted a majority of twelve, but to keep the business moving forward, he relied on precedent established earlier in the Convention that only a majority of states voting was required. The First Committee on Representation and the Connecticut Compromise became the turning point of the convention. While some of the large-state delegates discussed leaving the convention, none did. Debate over the next ten days developed an agreed general outline for the Constitution. Small states readily yielded on many questions. Following the Compromise, most remaining delegates, large-state and small-state, felt safe enough to chance a new plan.

===Two new branches===


The Constitution innovated two branches of government that were not a part of the U.S. government during the Articles of Confederation. Previously, a thirteen-member committee had been left behind in Philadelphia when Congress adjourned to carry out the &quot;executive&quot; functions. Suits between states were referred to the Congress of the Confederation, and treated as a private bill to be determined by majority vote of members attending that day.

On June 7, the &quot;national executive&quot; was taken up in Convention. The &quot;chief magistrate&quot;, or &#x27;presidency&#x27; was of serious concern for a formerly colonial people fearful of concentrated power in one person. But to secure a &quot;vigorous executive&quot;, nationalist delegates such as James Wilson (PA), Charles Pinckney (SC), and John Dickenson (DE) favored a single officer. They had someone in mind whom everyone could trust to start off the new system, George Washington.

After introducing the item for discussion, there was a prolonged silence. Benjamin Franklin (PA) and John Rutledge (SC) had urged everyone to speak their minds freely. When addressing the issue with George Washington in the room, delegates were careful to phrase their objections to potential offenses by officers chosen in the future who would be &#x27;president&#x27; &quot;subsequent&quot; to the start-up. Roger Sherman (CT), Edmund Randolph (VA) and Pierce Butler (SC) all objected, preferring two or three persons in the executive, as the ancient Roman Republic had when appointing consuls.

Nathaniel Gorham was Chair of the Committee of the Whole, so Washington sat in the Virginia delegation where everyone could see how he voted. The vote for a one-man &#x27;presidency&#x27; carried 7-for, 3-against, New York, Delaware and Maryland in the negative. Virginia, along with George Washington, had voted yes. As of that vote for a single &#x27;presidency&#x27;, George Mason (VA) gravely announced to the floor, that as of that moment, the Confederation&#x27;s federal government was &quot;in some measure dissolved by the meeting of this Convention.&quot;

The convention was following the Randolph Plan for an agenda, taking each resolve in turn to move proceedings forward. They returned to items when overnight coalitions required adjustment to previous votes to secure a majority on the next item of business. June 19, and it was Randolph&#x27;s Ninth Resolve next, about the national court system. On the table was the nationalist proposal for the inferior (lower) courts in the national judiciary.

Pure 1776 republicanism had not given much credit to judges, who would set themselves up apart from and sometimes contradicting the state legislature, the voice of the sovereign people. Under the precedent of English Common Law according to William Blackstone, the legislature, following proper procedure, was for all constitutional purposes, &quot;the people.&quot; This dismissal of unelected officers sometimes took an unintended turn among the people. One of John Adams&#x27;s clients believed the First Continental Congress in 1775 had assumed the sovereignty of Parliament, and so abolished all previously established courts in Massachusetts.

In the convention, looking at a national system, Judge Wilson (PA) sought appointments by a single person to avoid legislative payoffs. Judge Rutledge (SC) was against anything but one national court, a Supreme Court to receive appeals from the highest state courts, like the South Carolina court he presided over as Chancellor. Rufus King (MA) thought national district courts in each state would cost less than appeals that otherwise would go to the &#x27;supreme court&#x27; in the national capital. National inferior courts passed but making appointments by &#x27;congress&#x27; was crossed out and left blank so the delegates could take it up later after &quot;maturer reflection.&quot;

===Reallocating power===
The Constitutional Convention created a new, unprecedented form of government by reallocating powers of government. Every previous national authority had been either a centralized government, or a &quot;confederation of sovereign constituent states.&quot; The American power-sharing was unique at the time. The sources and changes of power were up to the states. The foundations of government and extent of power came from both national and state sources. But the new government would have a national operation. To meet their goals of cementing the Union and securing citizen rights, Framers allocated power among executive, senate, house and judiciary of the central government. But each state government in their variety continued exercising powers in their own sphere.

====Increase Congress====
The Convention did not start with national powers from scratch, it began with the powers already vested in the Congress of the Confederation with control of the military, international relations and commerce. The Constitution added ten more. Five were minor relative to power sharing, including business and manufacturing protections. One important new power authorized Congress to protect states from the &quot;domestic violence&quot; of riot and civil disorder, but it was conditioned by a state request.

The Constitution increased Congressional power to organize, arm and discipline the state militias, to use them to enforce the laws of Congress, suppress rebellions within the states and repel invasions. But the Second Amendment would ensure that Congressional power could not be used to disarm state militias.

Taxation substantially increased the power of Congress relative to the states. It was limited by restrictions, forbidding taxes on exports, per capita taxes, requiring import duties to be uniform and that taxes be applied to paying U.S. debt. But the states were stripped of their ability to levy taxes on imports, which was at the time, &quot;by far the most bountiful source of tax revenues&quot;.

Congress had no further restrictions relating to political economy. It could institute protective tariffs, for instance. Congress overshadowed state power regulating interstate commerce; the United States would be the &quot;largest area of free trade in the world.&quot; The most undefined grant of power was the power to &quot;make laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution&quot; the Constitution&#x27;s enumerated powers.

====Limit governments====

As of ratification, sovereignty was no longer to be theoretically indivisible. With a wide variety of specific powers among different branches of national governments and thirteen republican state governments, now &quot;each of the &quot;portions&quot; of powers delegated to the one or to the other ... is ... sovereign &quot;with regard to its proper objects&quot;&quot;. There were some powers that remained beyond the reach of both national powers and state powers, so the logical seat of American &quot;sovereignty&quot; belonged directly with the people-voters of each state.

Besides expanding Congressional power, the Constitution limited states and central government. Six limits on the national government addressed property rights such as slavery and taxes. Six protected liberty such as prohibiting &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws and no religious tests for national offices in any state, even if they had them for state offices. Five were principles of a republic, as in legislative appropriation. These restrictions lacked systematic organization, but all constitutional prohibitions were practices that the British Parliament had &quot;legitimately taken in the absence of a specific denial of the authority.&quot;

The regulation of state power presented a &quot;qualitatively different&quot; undertaking. In the state constitutions, the people did not enumerate powers. They gave their representatives every right and authority not explicitly reserved to themselves. The Constitution extended the limits that the states had previously imposed upon themselves under the Articles of Confederation, forbidding taxes on imports and disallowing treaties among themselves, for example.

In light of the repeated abuses by &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws passed by the state legislatures, 1783–1787, the Constitution prohibited &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws and bills of attainder to protect United States citizen property rights and right to a fair trial. Congressional power of the purse was protected by forbidding taxes or restraint on interstate commerce and foreign trade. States could make no law &quot;impairing the obligation of contracts.&quot; To check future state abuses the framers searched for a way to review and veto state laws harming the national welfare or citizen rights. They rejected proposals for Congressional veto of state laws and gave the Supreme Court appellate case jurisdiction over state law because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. The United States had such a geographical extent that it could only be safely governed using a combination of republics. Federal judicial districts would follow those state lines.

====Population power====

The British had relied upon a concept of &quot;virtual representation&quot; to give legitimacy to their House of Commons. According to many in Parliament, it was not necessary to elect anyone from a large port city, or the American colonies, because the representatives of &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;, mostly abandoned medieval fair towns with twenty voters, &quot;virtually represented&quot; them. Philadelphia in the colonies was second in population only to London.

&quot;They were all Englishmen, supposed to be a single people, with one definable interest. Legitimacy came from membership in Parliament of the sovereign realm, not elections from people. As Blackstone explained, the Member is &quot;not bound ... to consult with, or take the advice, of his constituents.&quot; As Constitutional historian Gordon Wood elaborated, &quot;The Commons of England contained all of the people&#x27;s power and were considered to be the very persons of the people they represented.&quot;

While the English &quot;virtual representation&quot; was hardening into a theory of parliamentary sovereignty, the American theory of representation was moving towards a theory of sovereignty of the people. In their new constitutions written since 1776, Americans required community residency of voters and representatives, expanded suffrage, and equalized populations in voting districts. There was a sense that representation &quot;had to be proportioned to the population.&quot; The convention would apply the new principle of &quot;sovereignty of the people&quot; both to the House of Representatives, and to the United States Senate.

=====House changes=====
Once the Great Compromise was reached, delegates in Convention then agreed to a decennial census to count the population. The Americans themselves did not allow for universal suffrage for all adults. Their sort of &quot;virtual representation&quot; said that those voting in a community could understand and themselves represent non-voters when they had like interests that were unlike other political communities. There were enough differences among people in different American communities for those differences to have a meaningful social and economic reality. Thus New England colonial legislatures would not tax communities which had not yet elected representatives. When the royal governor of Georgia refused to allow representation to be seated from four new counties, the legislature refused to tax them.

The 1776 Americans had begun to demand expansion of the franchise, and in each step, they found themselves pressing towards a philosophical &quot;actuality of consent.&quot; The Convention determined that the power of the people, should be felt in the House of Representatives. For the U.S. Congress, persons alone were counted. Property was not counted.

=====Senate changes=====
The Convention found it more difficult to give expression to the will of the people in new states. What state might be &quot;lawfully arising&quot; outside the boundaries of the existing thirteen states? The new government was like the old, to be made up of pre-existing states. Now there was to be admission of new states. Regular order would provide new states by state legislatures for Kentucky, Tennessee and Maine. But the Congress of the Confederation had by its Northwest Ordinance presented the convention with a new issue. Settlers in the Northwest Territory might one day constitute themselves into &quot;no more than five&quot; states. More difficult still, most delegates anticipated adding alien peoples of Canada, Louisiana and Florida to United States territory. Generally in American history, European citizens of empire were given U.S. citizenship on territorial acquisition. Should they become states?

Some delegates were reluctant to expand into any so &quot;remote wilderness&quot;. It would retard the commercial development of the east. They would be easily influenced, &quot;foreign gold&quot; would corrupt them. Western peoples were the least desirable Americans, only good for perpetual provinces. There were so many foreigners moving out west, there was no telling how things would turn out. These were poor people, they could not pay their fair share of taxes. It would be &quot;suicide&quot; for the original states. New states could become a majority in the Senate, they would abuse their power, &quot;enslaving&quot; the original thirteen. If they also loved liberty, and could not tolerate eastern state dominance, they would be justified in civil war. Western trade interests could drag the country into an inevitable war with Spain for the Mississippi River. As time wore on, any war for the Mississippi River was obviated by the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and the 1812 American victory at New Orleans.

Even if there were to be western states, a House representation of 40,000 might be too small, too easy for the westerners. &quot;States&quot; had been declared out west already. They called themselves republics, and set up their own courts directly from the people without colonial charters. In Transylvania, Westsylvania, Franklin, and Vandalia, &quot;legislatures&quot; met with emissaries from British and Spanish empires in violation of the Articles of Confederation, just as the sovereign states had done. In the Constitution as written, no majorities in Congress could break up the larger states without their consent.

&quot;New state&quot; advocates had no fear of western states achieving a majority one day. For example, the British sought to curb American expansion, which caused the angered colonists to agitate for independence. Follow the same rule, get the same results. Congress has never been able to discover a better rule than majority rule. If they grow, let them rule. As they grow, they must get all their supplies from eastern businesses. Character is not determined by points of a compass. States admitted are equals, they will be made up of our brethren. Commit to right principles, even if the right way, one day, benefits other states. They will be free like ourselves, their pride will not allow anything but equality.

It was at this time in the Convention that Reverend Manasseh Cutler arrived to lobby for western land sales. He brought acres of land grants to parcel out. Their sales would fund most of the U.S. government expenditures for its first few decades. There were allocations for the Ohio Company stockholders at the convention, and for others delegates too. Good to his word, in December 1787, Cutler led a small band of pioneers into the Ohio Valley.

The provision for admitting new states became relevant at the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France. It was constitutionally justifiable under the &quot;treaty making&quot; power of the federal government. The agrarian advocates sought to make the purchase of land that had never been administered, conquered, or formally ceded to any of the original thirteen states. Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republicans would divide the Louisiana Purchase into states, speeding land sales to finance the federal government with no new taxes. The new populations of new states would swamp the commercial states in the Senate. They would populate the House with egalitarian Democrat-Republicans to overthrow the Federalist Party. Jefferson dropped the proposal of Constitutional amendment to permit the purchase, and with it, his notion of a confederation of sovereign states.

===Final document===
After nearly four months of debate, on September 8, 1787, the final text of the Constitution was set down and revised. Then, an official copy of the document was engrossed by Jacob Shallus. The effort consisted of copying the text (prelude, articles and endorsement) on four sheets of vellum parchment, made from treated animal skin and measuring approximately by , probably with a goose quill. Shallus engrossed the entire document except for the list of states at the end of the document, which are in Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s handwriting. On September 17, 1787, following a speech given by Benjamin Franklin, 39 delegates endorsed and submitted the Constitution to the Congress of the Confederation.

==Ratification of the Constitution==

Massachusetts&#x27; Rufus King assessed the convention as a creature of the states, independent of the Congress of the Confederation, submitting its proposal to that Congress only to satisfy forms. Though amendments were debated, they were all defeated. On September 28, 1787, the Congress of the Confederation resolved &quot;unanimously&quot; to transmit the Constitution to state legislatures for submitting to a ratification convention according to the Constitutional procedure. Several states enlarged the numbers qualified just for electing ratification delegates. In doing so, they went beyond the Constitution&#x27;s provision for the most voters for the state legislature.

Delaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new Constitution, with its vote being unanimous. Pennsylvania ratified on December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46 to 23 (66.67%). New Jersey ratified on December 19, 1787, and Georgia on January 2, 1788, both unanimously. The requirement of ratification by nine states, set by Article Seven of the Constitution, was met when New Hampshire voted to ratify, on June 21, 1788.

In New York, fully two thirds of the convention delegates were at first opposed to the Constitution. Hamilton led the Federalist campaign, which included the fast-paced appearance of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; in New York newspapers. An attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded, but on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close – yeas 30 (52.6%), nays 27 – due largely to Hamilton&#x27;s forensic abilities and his reaching a few key compromises with moderate anti-Federalists led by Melancton Smith.

Following Massachusetts&#x27;s lead, the Federalist minorities in both Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments. A minority of the Constitution&#x27;s critics continued to oppose the Constitution. Maryland&#x27;s Luther Martin argued that the federal convention had exceeded its authority; he still called for amending the Articles. Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation stated that the union created under the Articles was &quot;perpetual&quot; and that any alteration must be &quot;agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State&quot;.

However, the unanimity required under the Articles made all attempts at reform impossible. Martin&#x27;s allies such as New York&#x27;s John Lansing Jr., dropped moves to obstruct the convention&#x27;s process. They began to take exception to the Constitution &quot;as it was&quot;, seeking amendments. Several conventions saw supporters for &quot;amendments before&quot; shift to a position of &quot;amendments after&quot; for the sake of staying in the Union. New York Anti&#x27;s &quot;circular letter&quot; was sent to each state legislature on 26 July 1788 (the same date on which that state&#x27;s legislature voted to ratify the Constitution) proposing a second constitutional convention for &quot;amendments before&quot;. It failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately only North Carolina and Rhode Island would wait for amendments from Congress before ratifying.

Article VII of the proposed constitution stipulated that only nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect for the participating states. By the end of July 1788, eleven states had ratified the Constitution, and soon thereafter, the process of organizing the new government began. On September 13, 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that the new Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for it to go into effect. Congress fixed the city of New York as the temporary seat of the new government and set the dates for the election of representatives and presidential electors. It also set the date for operations to begin under the new government. This occurred on March 4, 1789, when the First Congress convened.

The membership of the new Congress was decidedly federalist. In the eleven-state (minus North Carolina and Rhode Island) Senate 20 were Federalist and two Anti-federalist (both from Virginia). The House included 48 Federalists and 11 Anti-federalists (from four states: Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia). On April 6 the House and Senate held a joint meeting to count the electoral vote. George Washington was unanimously elected the first president, even receiving the electoral vote of ardent anti-federalist Patrick Henry. John Adams of Massachusetts was elected vice president. Both were sworn into office on April 30, 1789.

Anti-Federalists&#x27; fears of personal oppression by Congress were allayed by twelve amendments passed under the floor leadership of James Madison during the first session of Congress. The ten of these that were ratified by the required number of state legislatures became known as the Bill of Rights. Objections to a potentially remote federal judiciary were reconciled with 13 federal courts (11 states, plus Maine and Kentucky), and three federal riding circuits out of the Supreme Court: Eastern, Middle and South. Suspicion of a powerful federal executive was answered by Washington&#x27;s cabinet appointments of once-Anti-Federalists Edmund Jennings Randolph as Attorney General and Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State. What Constitutional historian Pauline Maier termed a national &quot;dialogue between power and liberty&quot; had begun anew.

==Amendments to the Constitution==
Since the beginning of federal operations under the Constitution in 1789 through the beginning of 2013, approximately 11,539 proposals to amend the Constitution have been introduced in the United States Congress. Of these, thirty-three have been approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Twenty-seven of these amendments have been ratified and are now part of the Constitution. The first ten amendments were adopted and ratified simultaneously and are known collectively as the Bill of Rights. Prior to the Twenty-seventh Amendment, which languished for 202 years, 7 months, 12 days before being ratified (submitted for ratification in 1789 as part of the Bill of Rights, but not ratified until 1992), the Twenty-second Amendment held the record for longest time taken to successfully complete the ratification process – 3 years, 11 months, 6 days. The Twenty-sixth Amendment holds the record for shortest time taken – 3 months, 8 days. Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been ratified by the required number of states and are not part of the Constitution. Four of these are still technically open and pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it.

===Bill of Rights===
Much of opposition to the proposed Constitution within several states arose, not because the machinery of the new frame of government was considered unworkable or because strengthening the union between the 13 states viewed as undesirable. The debates in the state ratifying conventions centered around the absence of anything equivalent to the bill of rights found in several state constitutions. George Mason, a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, and the author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, refused to sign the document because he felt it did not specifically spell out or protect individual rights sufficiently. He also opposed the Constitution when it was brought before the state for ratification. He acquiesced and the convention voted narrowly to give its assent only after it was decided that a list of twenty proposed amendments be sent along with the state&#x27;s resolution of ratification. Delegates to Massachusetts&#x27; convention had many of the same concerns, and along with its notification of approval made a request for nine alterations, the first among them being &quot;that it be explicitly declared that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved to the states to be exercised by them.&quot; New York, not to be outdone, appended a list of thirty-two requested amendments plus a lengthy statement of &quot;impressions&quot; and &quot;explanations&quot; about the new Constitution to their affirmative vote.

The sharp Anti-Federalist critique of the Constitution did not abate after it became operational, and by the time the First Congress convened in March 1789, there existed widespread sentiment in both the House and Senate in favor of making alterations. That September, Congress adopted twelve amendments and sent to the states for ratification. Ten of these were ratified by the required number of states in December 1791 and became part of the Constitution. These amendments enumerate freedoms not explicitly indicated in the main body of the Constitution, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, a free press, and free assembly; the right to keep and bear arms; freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, security in personal effects, and freedom from warrants issued without probable cause; indictment by a grand jury for a capital or &quot;infamous crime&quot;; guarantee of a speedy, public trial with an impartial jury; and prohibition of double jeopardy. In addition, the Bill of Rights reserves for the people any rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution and reserves all powers not specifically granted to the federal government to the people or the States.

===Subsequent amendments===

Amendments to the Constitution subsequent to the Bill of Rights cover a wide range of subjects. Several have added significant content to the original document. One of the most far-reaching is the Fourteenth, ratified in 1868, which establishes a clear and simple definition of citizenship and guarantees equal treatment under the law. Also significant are the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-sixth, which were enacted to extend the right to vote to persons previously considered ineligible and also to protect their exercise of that right. One Amendment, the Eighteenth, which criminalized the production, transport and sale of alcohol nationwide, was later repealed by another, the Twenty-first. Nine ratified amendments (11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, and 25) have explicitly superseded or modified the text of the original Constitution.
==Criticism of the Constitution==

===Expand democracy===
In the early twentieth century Lochner era, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional various state laws that limited labor contracts. The Constitution was criticized as putting the government at the beck and call of big business.

More recent criticism has often been academic and limited to particular features. University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson wonders whether it makes sense for the Connecticut Compromise to give &quot;Wyoming the same number of votes as California, which has roughly seventy times the population&quot;. Levinson thinks this imbalance causes a &quot;steady redistribution of resources from large states to small states.&quot; Levinson is critical of the Electoral College as it allows the possibility of electing presidents who do not win the majority, or even plurality, of votes. Five times in American history, presidents have been elected despite failing to win a plurality of the popular vote: 1824 (John Quincy Adams), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison), 2000 (George W. Bush) and 2016 (Donald Trump). The current impeachment powers do not give the people a quick way to remove incompetent or ill presidents, in his view. Others have criticized gerrymandering.

Yale professor Robert A. Dahl saw a problem with an American tendency towards worship of the Constitution itself. He sees aspects of American governance which are &quot;unusual and potentially undemocratic: the federal system, the bicameral legislature, judicial review, presidentialism, and the electoral college system.&quot; Levinson and Labunski and others have called for a Second Constitutional Convention, although professors like Dahl believe there is no real hope this would ever happen. French journalist Jean-Philippe Immarigeon wrote in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; that the &quot;nearly 230-year-old constitution stretched past the limits of its usefulness&quot;, and suggested key problem points were the inability to call an election when government became gridlocked, a several month period between the election and when the president takes office, and inability of the lower house of Congress to influence serious foreign policy decisions such as ending a war when faced with a veto.

University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato advocates an amendment to organize presidential primaries. Sabato details more objections in his book &quot;A More Perfect Constitution&quot;. He opposes life tenure for Federal Court judges, including Supreme Court justices. He also writes that &quot;If the 26 least populated states voted as a bloc, they would control the U.S. Senate with a total of just under 17% of the country&#x27;s population.&quot; Sabato further contends that the Constitution is in need of an overhaul, and argues that only a national constitutional convention can bring the document up to date and settle many of the issues that have arisen over the past two centuries.

===States&#x27; rights===
In United States history, four periods of widespread Constitutional criticism have been characterized by the idea that specific political powers belong to state governments and not to the federal government—a doctrine commonly known as states&#x27; rights. At each stage, states&#x27; rights advocates failed to develop a preponderance in public opinion or to sustain the democratic political will required to alter the generally held constitutional understanding and political practice in the United States. At its adoption among the people in the state ratification conventions, the &quot;men of original principles&quot; opposed the new national government as violating the Whig philosophy generally accepted among the original thirteen colonies in 1776. According to this view, Congress as a legislature should be only equal to any state legislature, and only the people in each state might be sovereign. They are now referred to as the Anti-Federalists in American historiography. The proponents of &quot;state sovereignty&quot; and &quot;states rights&quot; were outvoted in eleven of thirteen state ratification conventions, then thirteen of thirteen, to &quot;ordain and establish&quot; the Constitution.

During Andrew Jackson&#x27;s administration, South Carolina objected to U.S. government&#x27;s &quot;tariff of abominations&quot; collected as federal duties in Charleston Harbor. The Nullification Crisis ensued. Justification for the nullifiers was found in the U.S. Senate speeches and writings of John C. Calhoun. He defended slavery against the Constitutional provisions allowing its statutory regulation or its eventual abolition by Constitutional amendment, most notably in his Disquisition on Government. The crisis was averted when President Jackson, a former Major General, declared he would march a U.S. army into South Carolina and hang the first nullifier he saw from the first tree, and a new negotiated tariff, the Compromise Tariff of 1833, satisfactory to South Carolina was enacted. Despite this, a states-rights-based defense of slavery persisted amongst Southerners until the American Civil War; conversely, Northerners explored nullification of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Abraham Lincoln kept a portrait of Andrew Jackson above his desk at the U.S. War Department for the duration of the American Civil War as a clear symbol of Lincoln&#x27;s intent and resolve as well as to draw attention to an executive precedent for Lincoln&#x27;s actions.

In the mid-19th Century during the administrations of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, the United States suffered a tragic passage through the Civil War and Reconstruction. An important survey of the philosophical and legal underpinnings of &quot;States Rights&quot; as held by secessionists and Lost Cause advocates afterwards is found in the speeches of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government. Davis defended secession by appealing to the &quot;original principles&quot; of the Founders&#x27; 1776 Revolutionary generation, and by expanding on William Blackstone&#x27;s doctrine of legislative supremacy. By the elections of 1872, all states which had been admitted to the United States in accordance with the Constitution were fully represented in the U.S. Congress.

Following the Supreme Court 1954 holding in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used National Guard and U.S. paratroopers to enforce the rulings of the Federal Courts as they pertained to the Constitution. The &quot;States Rights&quot; doctrine was again appealed to during the mid-20th Century resistance to racial integration in the schools, notably in Arkansas&#x27; Little Rock Nine, Alabama&#x27;s Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, and Virginia&#x27;s Massive Resistance. Public schools in every state are now racially integrated by law under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.

The tradition is seen in many shorter episodes of limited minority protest against the United States. During the War of 1812, Federalists conducted a Hartford Convention proposing New England secession during wartime to reopen trade with the declared enemy of the United States. It led to accusations of treason and the demise of the Federalist Party as a force in American politics. In 1921, the Maryland Attorney General sued to block woman suffrage. He argued in &quot;Leser v. Garnett&quot; that state legislatures were Constitutionally the sole determiners of who should vote in what federal or state elections, and that the 19th Amendment was improper. The Supreme Court&#x27;s judicial review of the state court findings held that the 19th Amendment was Constitutional, and that it applied to the women&#x27;s right to vote in every state. Women now vote in every state under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.

One exceptional example of &quot;states rights&quot; persuading overwhelming majorities in a democratic and sustained way, and so transforming the nation came in the John Adams administration. Fear had spread that radical democratic sentiment might turn subversive as it had in the French Reign of Terror. But the Federalist-sponsored Alien and Sedition Acts meant to preempt the danger led to suppression of opposition press. The political reaction in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions sparked public opposition against the Federalist policy and led to twenty-four years of Constitutionally elected Democratic-Republican Party rule through six administrations of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, opponents of federal laws prohibiting the sale and possession of marijuana have based their objections partially on states&#x27; rights grounds, as have opponents of federal laws and regulations pertaining to firearms. States&#x27; rights under the constitution has also been recently raised as an issue on a number of other occasions, most notably regarding Common Core, the Affordable Care Act, and same-sex marriage.

==History of the physical document==

At first, little interest was shown in the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–1809) but having left Washington, he had lost track of it in the years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found the parchment folded in a small tin box on the floor of a closet at the State, War and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.

The two parchment documents were turned over to the Library of Congress by executive order, and in 1924 President Calvin Coolidge dedicated the bronze-and-marble shrine for public display of the Constitution in the main building. The parchments were laid over moisture absorbing cellulose paper, vacuum-sealed between double panes of insulated plate glass, and protected from light by a gelatin film. Although building construction of the Archives Building was completed in 1935, in December 1941 they were moved from the Library of Congress until September 1944, and stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository, Fort Knox, Kentucky, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address. In 1951 following a study by the National Bureau of Standards to protect from atmosphere, insects, mold and light, the parchments were re-encased with special light filters, inert helium gas and proper humidity. They were transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1952.

Since 1952, the &quot;Charters of Freedom&quot; have been displayed in the Rotunda of the National Archives Building. Visual inspections have been enhanced by electronic imaging. Changes in the cases led to removal from their cases July 2001, preservation treatment by conservators, and installment in new encasements for public display in September 2003.

<text>STS-39 was the twelfth mission of the NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, and the 40th orbital shuttle mission overall. The primary purpose of the mission was to conduct a variety of payload experiments for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

== Mission highlights ==
Launch was originally scheduled for March 9, 1991, but during processing work at Pad LC-39A, significant cracks were found on all four lug hinges on the two external tank umbilical door drive mechanisms. NASA managers opted to roll back the vehicle to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on March 7, 1991, and then to Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) for repair. The faulty hinges were replaced with units taken from orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot;, and reinforced. &quot;Discovery&quot; was returned to the pad on April 1, 1991, and the launch was rescheduled for April 23. The mission was again postponed when, during prelaunch external tank loading, a transducer on high-pressure oxidizer turbopump for main engine number three showed readings out of specification. The transducer and its cable harness were replaced and tested. The launch was rescheduled for April 28. Actual launch occurred at April 28, 1991, 7:33:14 a.m. EDT. Launch weight: .

STS-39 was a dedicated U.S. Department of Defense mission. Unclassified payload included Air Force Program-675 (AFP-675); Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) with Critical ionization velocity (CIV), Chemical Release Observation (CRO) and Shuttle pallet satellite-II (SPAS-II) experiments; and Space Test Payload-1 (STP-1). Classified payload consisted of Multi-Purpose Release Canister (MPEC). Also on board was Radiation Monitoring Equipment-III (RME-III) and Cloud Logic to Optimize Use of Defense Systems-1A (CLOUDS-1A).

STS-39 was the first unclassified Department of Defense (DoD)-dedicated Space Shuttle mission. There had previously been seven Shuttle missions dedicated to the DoD, but those were considered classified and information about the operation or success of the payloads or experiments was not released. For STS-39, only the payload in the Multi-Purpose Experiment Canister (MPEC) was listed as classified. (Bluford reportedly launched the classified payload by himself while, according to another member of the crew, &quot;the rest of us pretended not to notice&quot;.)

The crew was divided into two teams for around-the-clock operations. Among other activities, the crew made observations of the atmosphere and gas releases, &quot;Discovery&quot;″s orbital environment,
and firings of the orbiter&#x27;s engines, in wavelengths ranging from infrared to far ultraviolet. As part of the sophisticated experiments, five spacecraft or satellites were deployed from the payload bay, and one was retrieved later during the mission.

Carried in the orbiter&#x27;s cargo bay were: Air Force Program-675 (AFP-675); Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS); Space Test Program-01 (STP-01); and the MPEC. Inside the crew cabin were the Cloud Logic to Optimize the Use of Defense Systems-1A (CLOUDS-1A) experiment and the Radiation Monitoring Equipment-III (RME-III).

The Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) in the payload bay was used to deploy the Shuttle Pallet Satellite-II (SPAS-II), on which the IBSS was mounted. Among other observations, the SPAS-II/IBSS watched &quot;Discovery&quot; as it performed some orbital maneuvers including the &quot;Malarkey Milkshake&quot;. The deployment of IBSS was delayed a day, until Flight Day Four, to give priority to the completion of the CIRRIS (Cryogenic Infrared Radiance Instrumentation for Shuttle) experiment which was depleting its liquid helium coolant supply faster than expected while making observations of auroral and airglow emissions.

As usual, crew members faced some unexpected challenges during the mission. After working only about four hours, two tape recorders could not be reactivated. The tape recorders were designed to record observations made by three instruments on AFP-675. In a complicated two-hour bypass repair operation, the astronauts had to route wires and attach a splice wire to a Ku-band antenna system so the data could be sent directly to a ground station.

The high orbital inclination of the mission, 57.01° with respect to the equator, allowed the crew to fly over most of Earth&#x27;s large land masses and observe and record environmental resources and problem areas.

STS-39 landed on May 6, 1991, at 2:55:35 p.m. EDT, at Runway 15, Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Landing was diverted there because of unacceptably high winds at the planned landing site, Edwards Air Force Base, California. Landing weight: . Rollout distance: , rollout time: 55 seconds.

<doc id="497755" wikidata="Q704797" url="?curid=497755" title="Hoeryong concentration camp">
<text>Hoeryong concentration camp (or Haengyong concentration camp) was a concentration camp in North Korea that was reported to have been closed in 2012. The official name was [[Kwalliso]] (penal labour colony) No. 22. The camp was a maximum security area, completely isolated from the outside world.

In 2012, satellite image analysis and reports indicated major changes including its reported closure.

==Location==

Camp 22 was located in Hoeryong County, North Hamgyong province, in northeast North Korea, near the border with China. It was situated in a large valley with many side valleys, surrounded by high mountains. The southwest gate of the camp was located around northeast of downtown Hoeryong, while the main gate was located around southeast of Kaishantun in China&#x27;s Jilin province. The western boundary of the camp runs parallel to, and at a distance of from, the Tumen River, which forms the border with China. The camp was not included in maps until recently and the North Korean government has always denied its existence.

==History==
The camp was founded around 1965 in Haengyong-ri and expanded into the areas of Chungbong-ri and Sawul-ri in the 1980s and 1990s. The number of prisoners increased sharply in the 1990s when three other prison camps in North Hamgyong province were closed and the prisoners were transferred to Camp 22. &quot;Kwan-li-so No. 11 (Kyongsong)&quot; was closed in 1989, &quot;Kwan-li-so No. 12 (Onsong)&quot; was closed in 1992 and &quot;Kwan-li-so No. 13 (Changpyong)&quot; in 1992.

==Description==
Camp 22 was around in area. It was surrounded by an inner 3300 volt electric fence and an outer barbed wire fence, with traps and hidden nails between the two fences. The camp was controlled by roughly 1,000 guards and 500–600 administrative agents. The guards were equipped with automatic rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, clubs, whips, and trained dogs.

In the 1990s, there were an estimated 50,000 prisoners in the camp. Prisoners were mostly people who criticized the government, people deemed politically unreliable (such as South Korean prisoners of war, Christians, returnees from Japan) or purged senior party members. Based on the guilt-by-association principle () they are often imprisoned together with the whole family including children and the elderly, and including any children born in the camp. All prisoners were detained until they died; they were never released.

The camp was divided into several prison labour colonies:
* Haengyong-ri was the camp headquarters with administration offices, a food factory, a garment factory, detention center, guards&#x27; quarters, and prisoner family quarters.
* Chungbong-ri was a mining section with a coal mine, loading depot, railway station, hospital, guards&#x27; quarters, and single prisoners&#x27; quarters.
* Naksaeng-ri, Sawul-ri, Kulsan-ri, and Namsok-ri were farming sections with prisoner family quarters.
There was an execution site in Sugol Valley, at the edge of the camp.

==Conditions in the camp==
Former guard Ahn Myong-chol describes the conditions in the camp as harsh and life-threatening. He recalls the shock he felt upon his first arrival at the camp, where he likened the prisoners to walking skeletons, dwarfs, and cripples in rags. Ahn estimates that about 30% of the prisoners had deformities, such as torn off ears, smashed eyes, crooked noses, and faces covered with cuts and scars resulting from beatings and other mistreatment. Around 2,000 prisoners, he says, had missing limbs, but even prisoners who needed crutches to walk were still forced to work.

Prisoners received of corn per meal (two times a day), with almost no vegetables and no meat. The only meat in their diets was from rats, snakes, frogs, or even insects that they caught. Ahn estimated that 1,500–2,000 people died of malnutrition there every year, mostly children. Despite these deaths, the inmate population remained constant, suggesting that similar numbers of new inmates arrived each year.

Children received only very basic education. From the age of 6 onward they were assigned work, such as picking vegetables, peeling corn, or drying rice, but received very little food — only in all per day. Consequently, many children died before the age of ten years. Elderly prisoners had the same work requirements as other adults. Seriously ill prisoners were quarantined, abandoned, and left to die.

Single prisoners lived in bunkhouses with 100 people in one room. As a reward for good work, families were often allowed to live together in a single room inside a small house, without running water. Houses were in poor condition; walls were made from mud and typically had many cracks. All prisoners were allowed access only to dirty and crowded communal toilets.

Prisoners had to do hard physical labor in agriculture, mining, and inside factories from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (7:00 p.m. in winter), followed by ideological re-education and self-criticism sessions. New Year&#x27;s Day was the only holiday for prisoners. The mines were not equipped with safety measures and, according to Ahn, prisoners were consequently killed almost every day. Prisoners could use only primitive tools such as shovels and picks and were forced to work to exhaustion. If a fire occurred or a tunnel collapsed, prisoners were simply abandoned inside and left to die. Kwon Hyuk, a former security officer in Camp 22, reported that corpses were loaded into cargo coaches together with the coal, to be burnt in a melting furnace. The coal was delivered to the Chongjin power plant as well as to Chongjin and Kimchaek steel mills, while the food was delivered to the State Security Agency or sold in Pyongyang and other parts of the country.

==Human rights violations==
Ahn explained how the camp guards are taught that prisoners are factionalists and class enemies that have to be destroyed like weeds down to their roots. They are instructed to regard the prisoners as slaves and not treat them as human beings. Based on this, the guards may at any time kill any prisoner who does not obey their orders. Kwon reported that as a security officer he could decide whether or not to kill a prisoner if they violated a rule. He admitted that once he ordered the execution of 31 people from five families in a collective punishment, because one member of a family tried to escape.

In the 1980s, public executions took place approximately once a week according to Kwon. Ahn reported that in the 1990s they were replaced by secret executions, as the security guards feared riots from the assembled crowd. Kwon was required to visit the secret execution site a number of times; there, he saw disfigured and crushed bodies.

In case of serious violations of camp rules, the prisoners are subjected to a process of investigation, which produced human rights violations such as reduced meals, torture, beating, and sexual harassment. In addition, there is a detention center; many prisoners die in detention and even more leave the detention building crippled.

Ahn and Kwon reported about the following torture methods used in Haengyong-ri:
* Water torture: The prisoner must stand on his or her toes in a tank filled with water to his or her nose for 24 hours.
* Hanging torture: The prisoner is stripped and hung upside down from the ceiling to be violently beaten.
* Box room torture: The prisoner is detained in a very small solitary cell, in which there is barely enough room to sit, but not stand or lie, for three days or a week.
* Kneeling torture: The prisoner must kneel down with a wooden bar inserted near his or her knee hollows to stop blood circulation. After a week, the prisoner cannot walk and may likely die some months later.
* Pigeon torture: The prisoner is tied to the wall with both hands at a height of and must crouch for many hours.
Prisoners are beaten every day, if, for example, they do not bow quickly or deeply enough before the guards, if they do not work hard enough, or do not obey quickly enough. It is a frequent practice for guards to use prisoners as martial arts targets. Rape and sexual violence are very common in the camp, as female prisoners know they may be easily killed if they resist the demands of the security officers.

Ahn reported about hundreds of prisoners each year being taken away for several “major construction projects”, such as secret tunnels, military bases, or nuclear facilities in remote areas. None of these prisoners ever returned to the camp. Ahn is convinced that they were secretly killed after finishing the construction work to keep the secrecy of these projects.

==Human experimentation==

Kwon reported about human experimentation carried out in Haengyong-ri. He described a sealed glass chamber, wide, long and high, where he witnessed a family with two children dying from being test subjects for an asphyxiant gas. Ahn explained how inexperienced medical officers of Chungbong-ri hospital practiced their surgery techniques on prisoners. He heard numerous accounts of unnecessary operations and medical flaws, killing or permanently crippling prisoners.

==Reports on mass starvation and closure==
Satellite images from late 2012 showed the detention centre and some of the guard towers being razed, but all other structures appeared operational. It was reported that 27,000 prisoners died of starvation within a short time and the surviving 3,000 prisoners were relocated to Hwasong concentration camp between March and June 2012. It was further reported that the camp was shut down in June, security guards removed traces of detention facilities until August and then miners from Kungsim mine and farmers from Saebyol and Undok were moved into the area. According to another report the authorities decided to close the camp to cover its tracks after a warden defected.

<text>An oxbow lake is a U-shaped lake or pool that forms when a wide meander of a river is cut off, creating a free-standing body of water. The word &quot;oxbow&quot; can also refer to a U-shaped bend in a river or stream, whether or not it is cut off from the main stream. It takes its name from an oxbow which is part of a harness for oxen to pull a plough or cart.

In South Texas, oxbows left by the Rio Grande are called &quot;resacas&quot;. In Australia, oxbow lakes are called billabongs.

== Geology ==

An oxbow lake forms when a meandering river erodes through the neck of one of its meanders. This takes place because meanders tend to grow and become more curved over time. The river then follows a shorter course that bypasses the meander. The entrances to the abandoned meander eventually silt up, forming an oxbow lake. Because oxbow lakes are stillwater lakes, with no current flowing through them, the entire lake gradually silts up, becoming a bog or swamp and then evaporating completely.

When a river reaches a low-lying plain, often in its final course to the sea or a lake, it meanders widely. In the vicinity of a river bend, deposition occurs on the bank (the bank with the smaller radius). In contrast, both lateral erosion and undercutting occur on the cut bank or bank (the bank with the greater radius). Continuous deposition on the convex bank and erosion of the concave bank of a meandering river cause the formation of a very pronounced meander with two concave banks getting closer. The narrow neck of land between the two neighboring concave banks is finally cut through, either by lateral erosion of the two concave banks or by the strong currents of a flood. When this happens a new, straighter river channel develops—and an abandoned meander loop, called a cutoff, forms. When deposition finally seals off the cutoff from the river channel, an oxbow lake forms. This process can occur over a time from a few years to several decades, and may sometimes become essentially static.

Gathering of erosion products near the concave bank and transporting them to the convex bank is the work of the secondary flow across the floor of the river in the vicinity of a river bend. The process of deposition of silt, sand and gravel on the convex bank is clearly illustrated in point bars.

The effect of the secondary flow can be demonstrated using a circular bowl. Partly fill the bowl with water and sprinkle dense particles such as sand or rice into the bowl. Set the water into circular motion with one hand or a spoon. The dense particles quickly sweep into a neat pile in the center of the bowl. This is the mechanism that leads to the formation of point bars and contributes to the formation of oxbow lakes. The primary flow of water in the bowl is circular and the streamlines are concentric with the side of the bowl. However, the secondary flow of the boundary layer across the floor of the bowl is inward toward the center. The primary flow might be expected to fling the dense particles to the perimeter of the bowl, but instead the secondary flow sweeps the particles toward the center.

The curved path of a river around a bend makes the water&#x27;s surface slightly higher on the outside of the bend than on the inside. As a result, at any elevation within the river, water pressure is slightly greater near the outside of the bend than on the inside. A pressure gradient toward the convex bank provides the centripetal force necessary for each parcel of water to follow its curved path.

The boundary layer that flows along the river floor does not move fast enough to balance the pressure gradient laterally across the river. It responds to this pressure gradient, and its velocity is partly downstream and partly across the river toward the convex bank. As it flows along the floor of the river, it sweeps loose material toward the convex bank. This flow of the boundary layer is significantly different from the speed and direction of the primary flow of the river, and is part of the river&#x27;s secondary flow.

River flood plains that contain rivers with a highly sinuous platform are populated by longer oxbow lakes than those with low sinuosity. This is because rivers with high sinuosity have larger meanders, and greater opportunity for longer lakes to form. Rivers with lower sinuosity are characterized by fewer cutoffs and shorter oxbow lakes due to the shorter distance of their meanders.

== Oxbow lake ecology ==

Oxbow lakes serve as important wetland ecosystems. In the United States, oxbow lakes serve as the primary habitat for water tupelo and the iconic bald cypress. The numerous oxbow lakes of the Amazon River are a favorable habitat for the giant river otter. Oxbow lakes may also be suitable locations for aquaculture.

Oxbow lakes contribute to the health of a river ecosystem by trapping sediments and agricultural runoff, thereby removing them from the main river flow. However, this is destructive of the oxbow lake ecosystem itself. Oxbow lakes are also vulnerable to heavy metal contamination from industrial sources.

==Artificial oxbow lakes==
Oxbow lakes may be formed when a river channel is straightened artificially to improve navigation or for flood alleviation. This occurred notably on the upper Rhine in Germany in the nineteenth century.

An example of an entirely artificial waterway with oxbows is the Oxford Canal in England. When originally constructed, it had a very meandering course, following the contours of the land, but the northern part of the canal was straightened out between 1829 and 1834, reducing its length from approximately and creating a number of oxbow-shaped sections isolated from the new course.

== Notable examples ==
*Bole and Burton Round in West Burton, Nottinghamshire, England are a good example of previous lakes in a close proximity to one another.
*Bayou Brevelle in Natchitoches Parish, United States was created after the Red River of the South altered its course due to the effects of the Great Raft.
*Carter Lake, United States was created after severe flooding in 1877 led to the Missouri River shifting approximately to the southeast.
*Cuckmere Haven in Sussex, England contains a widely meandering river with many oxbow lakes, often referred to in physical geography textbooks.
*Halfmoon Lake in downtown Eau Claire, United States was formed due to a shift in the course of the Chippewa River, which now flows immediately to the south. 
*Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary, India contains rare and endangered migratory birds and is one of Asia&#x27;s largest oxbow lakes.
*The Oxbow, a bend in the Connecticut River, is disconnected at one end.
*There are many oxbow lakes alongside the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The largest oxbow lake in North America, Lake Chicot (located near Lake Village, United States), was originally part of the Mississippi River, as was Horseshoe Lake, the namesake for the town of Horseshoe Lake, United States. Reelfoot Lake in west Tennessee is another notable oxbow lake; it was formed when the Mississippi River took a new channel following the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes.
*The upper reaches of New Zealand&#x27;s Taieri River has also cut a multitude of oxbow lakes in its upper course near the town of Paerau. Some of this area has been converted into water meadows.
*Vynthala Lake, Chalakudy, India is formed from a &quot;cutoff&quot; of the Chalakudy River which flows nearby.
*West Lake (Hồ Tây) in Tây Hồ District, Vietnam is formed by a cutoff of the Red River.

There has also been a possible oxbow lake postulated in Saraswati Flumen near Ontario Lacus on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan.

<text>M-89 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that runs from near Ganges to Battle Creek. M-89 starts at an interchange with Interstate 196/US Highway 31 (I-196/US 31) and passes through Allegan, Kalamazoo County, Michigan, and Calhoun counties. The highway also briefly crosses the southwest corner of Barry County before it terminates an at intersection with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on the northwestern side of downtown Battle Creek. In between the trunkline runs parallel to the Kalamazoo River through rural southwestern Michigan farmlands while also running through the middle of several smaller towns in the area.

Dating back to 1919, M-89 was originally just a segment of the current highway between the Ganges area and Martin. Changes through the 1920s and 1930s moved the eastern end to Calhoun County. The last section was paved in the 1950s before the highway was rerouted in the Allegan, Michigan area. The last extensions into Battle Creek came in the 1960s and 1998.

==Route description==
M-89 begins at an interchange with I-196/US 31 near Ganges, just a half mile (0.8 km) from Lake Michigan. The highway travels east on 124th Street from there through farmlands and small communities like Fennville. The trunkline passes wetlands just north of Swan Creek Marsh and crosses the Kalamazoo River about west of an intersection with M-40. M-89 and M-40 run concurrently to the southeast for through more farms and across Lake Allegan on the Kalamazoo River on the way into Allegan. Just two blocks before M-89 splits from M-40, the concurrent highways have a junction with M-222. After M-89 splits from M-40, it continues out of Allegan to the southeast, again crossing over the Kalamazoo River.

After leaving Allegan, M-89 runs roughly parallel with the Kalamazoo River for approximately , passing through mostly rural areas with residences and agricultural fields. The highway curves to the east and crosses the Kalamazoo River again just west of the city of Otsego. The trunkline curves to the south in the city then again runs east to junction with US 131/M-43 at exit 49 on the west side of Plainwell. At this interchange, the M-43 designation transfers from the freeway to run concurrently with M-89 eastward. After the freeway, M-43/M-89 passes through the city of Plainwell and crosses the Kalamazoo River again before continuing into rural areas again. The trunkline continues to the southeast on towards the village of Richland.

Just north of Richland, M-89 parts ways with M-43. M-89 heads south through town and intersects M-343, before turning eastward and passing to the south of Gull Lake. After passing the lake, the highway turns southeast towards Battle Creek. As M-89 begins to enter the outskirts of Battle Creek it follows Michigan Avenue. It passes through the neighborhoods of Level Park-Oak Park and Urbandale, the first residential areas of the city. As the highway continues towards Battle Creek it has a junction with M-37. M-89 continues on Michigan Avenue until an intersection with Washington Avenue where the route turns to the southwest where it crosses the Kalamazoo River one last time. The trunkline terminates a few blocks later at Dickman Road, otherwise known as the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94).

M-89 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-89 were the 26.470 vehicles daily between Otsego and Plainwell; the lowest counts were the 2,879 vehicles per day between Fennville and the I-196/US 31 interchange. No section of M-89 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
The July 1, 1919, incarnation of M-89 was much shorter relative to today&#x27;s road. Its western terminus was at a junction with M-11 (later US 31, now A-2) near Ganges. It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before turning back to the east towards Allegan on an alignment that is a few miles south of the present day configuration. The highway then left Allegan on present day M-222 and terminated at M-13, which is now A-45 east of the US 131 freeway.

In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the southeast along its present-day alignment to terminate at US 131 in Plainwell. Just a few years later, the road was extended further to the southeast to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then met up with M-96 just inside the Calhoun County line. The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years.

In late 1951 or early 1952, the last section of M-89 was paved, a segment south and east of Fennville in Allegan County. Just months later, the highways was realigned to run east from Fennville, rather than south to Pearl, to intersect M-40. From there it was rerouted to run concurrently into Allegan.

In 1963, when the I-196/US 31 freeway opened, the western terminus of M-89 was extended to meet the new freeway. A few years later, when M-96 was realigned onto a route that took it into Battle Creek, M-89 was extended southeasterly along Michigan Avenue (the old M-96) and terminated at M-37. The highway was extended further southeasterly into Battle Creek to replace the old routing of M-37 along Michigan Avenue; it then turned south on Washington to the BL I-94 where it terminated, thus bringing the route to its current alignment.

The City of Kalamazoo accepted jurisdiction of the trunklines within the city&#x27;s downtown from MDOT in January 2019; M-43 was rerouted out of the city as a result. After the change, M-43 ran concurrently along M-89 between Plainwell and Richland instead of overlapping M-89 within Richland.

<text>In statistics, Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; test, or simply the &quot;Q&quot; test, is used for identification and rejection of outliers. This assumes normal distribution and per Robert Dean and Wilfrid Dixon, and others, this test should be used sparingly and never more than once in a data set. To apply a &quot;Q&quot; test for bad data, arrange the data in order of increasing values and calculate &quot;Q&quot; as defined:

: formula_1

Where &quot;gap&quot; is the absolute difference between the outlier in question and the closest number to it. If &quot;Q&quot; &gt; &quot;Q&quot;table, where &quot;Q&quot;table is a reference value corresponding to the sample size and confidence level, then reject the questionable point. Note that only one point may be rejected from a data set using a &quot;Q&quot; test.

==Example==
Consider the data set:
:formula_2

Now rearrange in increasing order:

:formula_3

We hypothesize that 0.167 is an outlier. Calculate &quot;Q&quot;:

:formula_4

With 10 observations and at 90% confidence, &quot;Q&quot; = 0.455 &gt; 0.412 = &quot;Q&quot;table, so we conclude 0.167 is indeed an outlier. However, at 95% confidence, &quot;Q&quot; = 0.455 &lt; 0.466 = &quot;Q&quot;table 0.167 is not considered an outlier.

McBane notes: Dixon provided related tests intended to search for more than one outlier, but they are much less frequently used than the &quot;r10&quot; or &quot;Q&quot; version that is intended to eliminate a single outlier.

<text>STS-40, the eleventh launch of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, was a nine-day mission in June 1991. It carried the Spacelab module for Spacelab Life Sciences 1 (SLS-1), the fifth Spacelab mission and the first dedicated solely to biology. STS-40 was the first spaceflight that included three women crew members.

The launch was originally set for May 22, 1991. The mission was postponed less than 48 hours before launch when it became known that a leaking liquid hydrogen transducer in the orbiter&#x27;s main propulsion system, which was removed and replaced during leak testing in 1990, had failed an analysis by a vendor. Engineers feared that one or more of the nine liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen transducers protruding into fuel and oxidizer lines could break off and be ingested by the engine turbopumps, causing engine failure.

In addition, one of the orbiter&#x27;s five general purpose computers failed completely, along with one of the multiplexer demultiplexers that controlled the orbiter&#x27;s hydraulics ordinance and Orbital Maneuvering System / Reaction Control System functions in the aft compartment.

A new general purpose computer and multiplexer demultiplexer were installed and tested. One liquid hydrogen and two liquid oxygen transducers were replaced upstream in the propellant flow system near the disconnect area, which is protected by internal screen. Three liquid oxygen transducers were replaced in the engine manifold area, while three liquid hydrogen transducers here were removed and the openings plugged. The launch was reset for 8:00 a.m. EDT, June 1, 1991, but postponed again after several attempts to calibrate inertial measurement unit 2 failed. The unit was replaced and retested, and the launch was rescheduled for June 5, 1991. The mission launched successfully on June 5, 1991, at 9:24:51 a.m. EDT and the mission had a launch weight of . The launch was also captured on IMAX cameras, and used in the 2015 documentary film &quot;Journey to Space&quot;.

It was the fifth dedicated Spacelab mission, Spacelab Life Sciences-1, and first dedicated solely to life sciences, using the habitable module. The mission featured the most detailed and interrelated physiological measurements in space since the 1973–1974 Skylab missions. The subjects involved were humans, 30 rodents and thousands of tiny jellyfish. Primary SLS-1 experiments studied six body systems; of 18 investigations, ten involved humans, seven involved rodents, and one used jellyfish.

Six body systems investigated were cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary (heart, lungs and blood vessels); renal/endocrine (kidneys and hormone-secreting organs and glands); blood (blood plasma); immune system (white blood cells); musculoskeletal (muscles and bones); and neurovestibular (brains and nerves, eyes and inner ear). Other payloads included twelve Getaway Special (GAS) canisters installed on GAS bridge in cargo bay for experiments in materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation (see G-616); Middeck Zero-Gravity Dynamics Experiment (MODE); and seven Orbiter Experiments (OEX).

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed on June 14, 1991, at 8:39:11 a.m. PDT, on Runway 22, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It returned to KSC on June 21, 1991.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="497778" wikidata="Q906340" url="?curid=497778" title="Flag of Washington, D.C.">
<text>The flag of Washington, D.C., consists of three red stars above two red bars on a white background. It is an armorial banner based on the coat of arms granted to Lawrence Washington (George Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather) of Sulgrave Manor Northamptonshire, England, in 1592. This coat of arms was used privately by the president in his home at Mount Vernon. In heraldry, the stars are called mullets and the coat of arms is blazoned as &quot;argent two bars gules, in chief three mullets of the second&quot;.

In 1938, the District Flag Commission was created by an Act of Congress &quot;to procure a design for a distinctive flag for the District of Columbia&quot;. The District Flag Commission was composed of three non-elected federally-appointed members: the president of the Board of Commissioners, the secretary of war and the secretary of the Navy. The flag was selected by the commission with the help of the Commission of Fine Arts. Since no local group was involved in the selection process, Washingtonians saw the flag as a symbol of their lack of representation. More recently, it has been embraced by most DC residents and businesses, as well as the DC Statehood Movement as a symbol of their local identity in the 21st century.

The flag was ranked best with a score of 9.17 in a review of 150 American city flags by the North American Vexillological Association.

==History==
===Washington family coat of arms===

The Washington family traces its roots to England in the 13th century to Wessyngton, a small rural estate in the northeastern county of Durham where Sir William de Hertburn received a lordship. The original coat of arms evolved drastically over the next 150 years through alliances, land acquisitions and conflicts. In 1346, the first appearance of the family coat of arms as we would recognize it was recorded for Sir William de Wessyngton&#x27;s great-grandson, but with argent (silver) horizontal bars and mullets on a gules (red) field. By the end of the 14th century, the current design was recorded for the family. After various events, the family was dispersed around England in Buckinghamshire, Kent, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. In 1592, Robert Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms confirmed the coat of arms upon Lawrence Washington (1566/68-1616) of Sulgrave Manor in Northamptonshire during the reign of Elizabeth I.

Two grandsons of Lawrence Washington immigrated to English North America in the 1660s. One of them was John Washington, who immigrated to the colony of Virginia in 1656. His great-grandson was George Washington who would become the first president of the United States. George used the coat of arms extensively on his Mount Vernon plantation, including on personal objects and on the livery of his enslaved servants. This was a common practice among the American planter class.

After the United States became independent from Britain in 1783, George Washington started a communication by mail with Sir Isaac Heard, Garter Principal King of Arms of the College of Arms in London on the matter of the coat of arms. This correspondence took place between 1791 and 1796 and appears to have been genealogical and probably also heraldic in nature. The president and the Garter appear to have been working together to trace George Washington&#x27;s ancestors and the link to the British Isles. Mr. Heard confirmed the events that took place in England regarding his ancestors in a letter dated December 7, 1791. George Washington acknowledged that this was the same coat of arms used in the Colony prior to Independence.

===Early history===

Since its creation by Congress on July 9, 1790, by the Residence Act and for over a century, the District of Columbia was without an official flag and flew several unofficial banners, usually the flag of the D.C. National Guard.

In the early 20th Century, the Thompsen-Bryan-Ellis Company was a firm of printers working on a flag book under the direction of Lieutenant Commander Byron McCandless who had a great interest in vexillology. The work was then taken over by the National Geographic. It became the now well known &quot;Our Flag Number&quot; (Volume XXXII - Number 4) which contained 1197 flags in full colors and an additional 300 in black and white. On page 335, the National Guard&#x27;s flag is shown as the representation of the District of Columbia. It showed a blue flag with two banners on it: one above with the word &quot;Headquarters&quot; and one below with &quot;District of Columbia Militia&quot; written on it. In between was an axe.

One of the artists working on the project was Charles A. R. Dunn. While drawing some of the flags, he noticed the lack of good design for many of the state flags with many simply being the state seal on a blue field. He also realized that the District of Columbia did not have a flag. He started thinking about designing a flag for the capital. He was very attracted to the design of the neighboring state flag of Maryland which used the arms of Lord Baltimore. It was only natural that he would remain in the field of heraldry for the inspiration of his design.

===Early designs===
In 1921, Dunn had moved on to work for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. While working in the Mills Building, he drew a design for the flag in the office studio. He took the design directly from the coat of arms which belonged to the Washington family with no change to the design but did not release it at the time.

On February 8, 1924, the Daughters of the American Revolution managed to get a bill introduced in Congress to set up a commission to select a design. It was introduced by Chairman Reed of the House District Committee. The commission would be composed of the president of the United States, the secretary of war and the president of the board of commissioners of the district. It would have an appropriation of $1,500. On February 20, 1924, the &quot;Evening Star&quot; published a proposed design by John Mackaye Dunbar. It featured the shield portion of the coat-of-arms on a red field with a blue cross. While this design was not endorsed by the D.A.R., they appreciated its display of &quot;simplicity&quot; in their February 24 meeting. They confirmed that their research that the Militia flag with an ax had been used as a flag but was not an appropriate flag for the district. They further rejected the idea of having the seal of the District of Columbia be part of the design for a flag due to its complexity. Charles Moore, the chairman of the Fine Arts Commission who had been consulted on the drafting of the bill, also agreed that the design should be simple and should emphasize in some way that the district is the seat of the central government of all the states.
In February of that year, Charles Dunn submitted a set of drawings in black and white and in color to the Evening Star which was published on March 16, 1924. While the charges remained the same (two bars and three mullets) the tinctures had changed from all gules (red) to cobalt blue for the stars and vermilion for the bars. However, the enthusiasm died down soon after and the issue of a District of Columbia flag was not raised again until 1937.

However, some opposition arose from the Southeast Citizens&#x27; Association. On March 26, 1924, they adopted a resolution opposing the adoption of a special flag for the District of Columbia. This resolution was apparently adopted after Capt. W.E. Luckett declared &quot;that the only flag the District of Columbia should cherish as its own is the one flag for every American — the Stars and Stripes&quot;.

On May 12, 1924, at a gathering of the &quot;Federation of Citizen&#x27;s Associations&quot;, an imitation meeting of the federation was staged for the purpose of entertaining the guests present at the event. Meetings were known for their fiery debates and the topic of choice in this piece was the adoption of a flag for the District of Columbia. The &quot;special committee&quot; was headed by Fred S. Walker and James W. Murphy who came forward with the emblem with Jesse C. Suter as a member:
The design which would become known as the &quot;Jest Flag&quot; and was made public again on June 14, 2019 as part of #DCFlagDay as part of a discussion on the history of the DC flag. It is currently in the holdings of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., and was last displayed in 1960 according to Josh Gibson who found the flag.
On May 2, 1924, the Evening Star published a new designed proposed by the Army. It was designed by the Office of the Quartermaster General and was the joint work of Capt. J. Moultrie Ward, Q.M.C. and Flora F. Sherwood, the Quartermaster Corps civilian artist. While they used the arms of George Washington in part of the flag and its two colors, it was very different. The first third, next to the hoist, consisted of a broad red strip with three white five-pointed stars aligned vertically in its center. They represented the three cities originally in its boundaries: Washington City, Georgetown and Alexandria. The remainder of the flag was composed of four stripes aligned veritably and alternating white and red ending with red on its edge.

The Senate passed the bill on May 5, 1924, and it made its way to the House of Representatives. On May 7, 1924, the &quot;Native Washingtonians&quot; for a Banquet for the organizations fifth anniversary. During his presentation, the president of the society Jesse C. Suter showed the audience the version of the district flag that was presented a few weeks later and explained its meaning:

However, it seems the bill never made it through to become law. A decade later, the question reappeared. On September 16, 1934, Frederic Adrian Delano, chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission and the uncle of President Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled his design for a district flag. His version was based on the American flag with the same 13 stripes. In place of the stars a map of Washington when the city
was first projected in 1792 was added and was surrounded by pictures of the Capitol, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial, Mount Vernon, the Supreme Court Building, the Lee Mansion and the Amphitheater at Arlington, the Dumbarton House in Georgetown and the Masonic Memorial and Christ Church in Alexandria. In the four corners were four American eagles. The map design was originally drawn by Mildred G. Burrage at his suggestion and was known as the &quot;handkerchief map&quot;. The design was copyrighted by the American Civic Association of which Mr. Delano was president. Printed in six colors, the handkerchiefs were sold for $1 each and the proceeds were used for the George Washington Memorial Parkway fund.

===Creation of the District Flag Commission===
By 1938, the D.A.R. had been campaigning for a district flag for over a decade. The effort was being spearheaded by the local D.A.R. Committee on Correct Use of the Flag. In 1937, the local Chapter was asked to present a district flag to Dahlgren Hall at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland to be hung along the flags of the 48 states (the states of Alaska and Hawaii did not join the Union until 1959) provided by state societies for Navy Day. The state chairman of the Flag Committee reached out to the district commissioner who was unable to provide one since it did not exist. Through extensive lobbying to Congress, the search for a suitable flag was pushed forward.

On June 16, 1938, Congress requested by an act that the secretary of war, the secretary of the Navy and the president of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia create &quot;a commission to procure a design for a distinctive flag for the District of Columbia, the Seat of the Capital of the Nation&quot;. The selection of the design shall have the advice of the Commission of Fine Arts. The bill was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the same day.

The commission included the president of the Board of Commissioners Melvin C. Hazen, the secretary of war Harry H. Woodring and the secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson. They held a meeting on July 9, 1938 to discuss the plans of choosing a design. The Evening Star stated at the time that this was a first step for the people of Washington toward the district&#x27;s sovereignty which would include the right to vote. It was hoped that this was a sign of concession to come on the matter. At the time, the district commissioner was appointed by the president of the United States as were the two secretaries as part of the Cabinet. It was not until 1975 that DC residents voted for their mayor.

An announcement was made in the newspapers of a contest open to the public to submit design and ideas for the flag. The Heraldic Division of the War Department laid some heraldry and visibility rules. Arthur E. Du Bois was the heraldic expert of the Quartermaster General&#x27;s Office and sat on the commission as an adviser. The secretary of war and the secretary of the Navy did not appear to actually be present on the commission but were represented by members of their staff.

===Design submissions and selection===
Charles Dunn submitted his 1921 design with the Washington coat of arms with all the charges in their original tincture of gules (red) in June 1938. In addition to the flag itself, he proposed the use of a Washington coat of arms in the canton (which he erroneously called a &quot;jack&quot;) for local organizations such as the American Legion. The organization would then use the rest of the space (the &quot;field&quot;) on the flag for their own emblem.
On August 24, 1938, the &quot;Evening Star&quot; announced that the commission had met to review the designs. They were down to two submissions mentioned by name. The first one was Charles Dunn&#x27;s design using Washington&#x27;s coat of arms. The second was a submission by the American Liberty Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and designed by one of its members, Mrs. George T. Hawkins. On a blue background, a big gold star made up of 13 concentric lines representing the original Thirteen Colonies with the Capitol Building in the center. The star is encircled by 48 small gold stars representing the states in the Union. The words &quot;DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA&quot; written in gold could be added or removed from the bottom. A flag of Dunn&#x27;s design was made and a display board of Hawkins design were shown to the reporters present at the announcement. Both designs were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts for final review as the commission &quot;admitted a deadlock&quot;. The Fine Arts&#x27; meeting would take place in September.

===Formal requests for local selection involvement===
However, the Commission of Fine Arts had to delay the review as it wanted to study all of the 50-odd designs and some had not yet arrived as of September 3 when the meeting took place. The review was pushed by two weeks to the next meeting. In addition, the Evening Star reported that the process of selecting the design was being questioned among those active in civic affairs. It was suggested that the Commission of Fine Arts use a more democratic process. This selection was &quot;seen as a real opportunity to arouse interest and civic spirit through giving this voteless and unrepresented community an opportunity to have a part in the selection of the community colors under which it will in the future march with pride and devotion&quot;.

The question of what the flag should represent was also discussed. The Evening Star asked the question in these terms: &quot;what do any of the designs under consideration symbolize?&quot; Some citizens asked the same question. In their September 8, 1938 meeting, the &quot;Association of Oldest Inhabitants&quot; asked that the Commission of Fine Arts collaborate with a special committee of native Washingtonians as they felt left out. On a letter to the commissioner they stated their concerns:

The &quot;Federation of Citizens&#x27; Association&quot; joined in this movement in early October. They requested that the Commission of Fine Arts give them the privilege to co-operate with them to the selection of the design. A special committee was to be appointed to seek this. A letter from the Association of Oldest Inhabitants to the Federation of Citizens&#x27; Association was sent on October 5, 1938 requesting that both groups collaborate on the selection of the design. The &quot;Kalorama Association&quot; sided with the other two associations on October 11 as they sent a letter to the commission recommending that the choice of the design be left to the residents of the district.

===Selection of the final design===

On October 15, 1938, the Evening Star announced that a new flag has been adopted by the District Flag Commission and the Fine Arts Commission. After reviewing 50 designs, Washington&#x27;s coat of arms was selected. The design was described as &quot;paying honors to George Washington using the major elements of the emblem features of the family shield of the first President&quot;.

The following specifications were adopted:
The proportions of the design are prescribed in terms of the hoist, or vertical height, of the flag as follows: the upper white portion shall be of the hoist; the two horizontal bars are each of the hoist; the white area between the bars of the hoist; and the base, or lowest white space, is of the hoist. The three five-pointed stars have a diameter of of the hoist and are spaced equidistant in the fly, or horizontal, dimension of the flag.

===Design explanation and failure to credit local input===

On October 16, all the details of the selections were given to the press and explained. It was explained that the commissioner, who was the former district surveyor, recalled seeing the coat of arms on a shield on old maps. Upon research, a map by Andrew Ellicott engraved in 1792 by Thackara &amp; Vallance in Philadelphia was found. The direct association of the first president with the establishment of the district and the capital city bearing his name was sufficient to justify using heraldic symbolism in the flag to illustrate the historical connection. In his view, it explained why several designs included this idea.

Mr. Hazen was credited for having &quot;brought to attention the basic elements of the simplified Washington shield&quot; while Arthur E. Du Bois was credited for the details of the final design. Apart from the mention that many designs included these features and that 50 designs were submitted, there was no recognition of the contribution of the local residents in the process. He responded to the failure to include the local population (directly or through the civic associations) by stating that anyone interested could submit a design and that it would have been reviewed. No mention of Charles Dunn&#x27;s contribution was made at the time. His contribution was made public in 1957, when he published an article in the &quot;Records of the Columbia Historical Society&quot; entitled &quot;The Origins of the District of Columbia Flag&quot; where he reveals the process that took place from his point of view. When he died in 1978, his contribution was not mentioned.

Commissioner Hazen also announced that the flag could first be flown at the &quot;Inter-American Horse Show&quot; at Meadowbrook Farm, in Montgomery County, Maryland, on October 23, 1938, which would be designated as &quot;District Day&quot;. The commissioner was one of the sponsors of the Show. However, the flag was first flown on October 18, 1938, on the &quot;District Building&quot; (now known as the John A. Wilson Building, the city council&#x27;s offices) under the American flag. The flag measured feet by .

==Designer==
Today, most sources state that Charles Dunn is the actual designer of the DC flag. It seems all historical accounts come from &quot;The Origins of the District of Columbia Flag&quot; he published in the &quot;Records of the Columbia Historical Society&quot; and the August 24, 1938, &quot;Evening Star&quot; article where he is mentioned as a finalist. However, according to the commission set up by Congress and who had authority to choose the design, Commissioner Melvin C. Hazen is credited as playing a major role in the design and Arthur E. Du Bois as having done the final design. This appears to indicate that Hazen and Du Bois were seen as co-designers at the time. The criticisms that followed the announcement regarding the lack of local involvement seem to confirm that this was the accepted view at the time. The DC Council website no longer states that Dunn is the designer, while it stated it up until 2018 that this was the case.

The link to the Washington coat of arms is undeniable and has been stated by all parties as a source of inspiration for the DC flag. Therefore, from a heraldry perspective, it seems that neither Dunn nor Hazen and Du Bois can lay claim to the design itself as being their own. In addition, as stated by the commissioner himself, the use of the design and its first association with Washington City and the other territories of the District of Columbia dates back to 1792 when it appeared on the Ellicott map only two years after the District of Columbia was created and while President Washington was in office. This exact same design of the arms dates back to at least the 14th century in England and it seems the original designer would have lived at that time. No changes have been made between that time and the design set in 1938.

==Usage==
===DC Government use===
Starting in 1916 when the &quot;District Building&quot; was inaugurated to 1964, the flag of the United States was flown from a large flagpole located on the roof of the building. Due to concerns regarding the safety of the staff during inclement weather, two new poles were installed in front of the building. It was then that, for the first time, the DC flag was flown on the DC Government building grounds on a separate pole. Prior to that, it was flown under the US flag.

The flag first appeared on the District of Columbia license plates known as the &quot;1984 Capital City Baseplate&quot; starting on October 1, 1984. These plates were issued for new registrations and issued to motorists who had the old 1974 and 1978 series plates. This replacement process took place from October 1984 to September 1986.
The DC flag is used on all DC Government websites, publications, documents and equipment. It is used extensively on its own or integrated into some of the department logos and program logos. One notable exception is the patch of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia which had the Capitol building on it and never had the DC flag on it.

===Local politics===
Elements of the design are used extensively in local politics. The three stars and bars or the colors are often used by candidates and causes on their signs during local elections.


In 2002, the D.C. Council debated a proposal to change the flag in protest of the district&#x27;s lack of voting rights in Congress. The new design would have added the letters &quot;D.C.&quot; to the center star and the words &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; in white to the two red bars, a slogan already in use on the district&#x27;s license plates. The change presumably would have been temporary and revoked once the city achieved equal representation or statehood. It passed the council on a 10–2 vote, but support for the proposal soon eroded, and then-mayor Anthony A. Williams never signed the bill.

In spite of its adoption by a non-elected commission of federally appointed members, the DC flag has become a symbol of local identity and local self-governance in the 21st Century. Today, it is used extensively by the DC Government&#x27;s Statehood Campaign, activists and citizens fighting for the District of Columbia to become the 51st State of the Union. It is also a non-partisan symbol and is extensively used by all parties in the district including Democrats, Republicans and Green Party in their campaigns and websites.

===City Council Commemorative Flag Program===
Starting on June 1, 2017, the D.C. City Council began a new commemorative flag program, which is similar to the United States flag program operated by the Congressional Keeper of the Stationery and requested through a constituent&#x27;s U.S. senator or U.S. representative. In the case of the DC flag, interested parties can fill out an online form on the DC Council&#x27;s website providing a credit card or by sending a letter with applicable check or money order to the secretary of the City Council requesting a 3×5 or 4×6 District of Columbia flag; once the request is received a flag is taken and then flown on one of several flagpoles at the John A. Wilson Building. After the flag has been flown it is then packaged and sent to the requester with an accompanying certificate that authenticates the flag was flown at the top of a flagpole at the Wilson Building.

===DC Flag Day===
Flag Day is celebrated in the United States on June 14. The &quot;Neighbors United for DC Statehood&quot; has been organizing the &quot;DC Flag Day Photo Contest&quot; since 2013 (with the exception of 2016). It celebrates the DC flag and pride while advocating for DC Statehood on their website and on social media using the hashtag #DCFlagDay. In 2018, the contest was organized in several categories:
* Best Ward: given to the Council member to the highest volume of constituent tweets with the flag (won by Ward 6)
* Best Campaign Team: given to the best Campaign team bringing DC Love 
* Best Advocacy: for the best photo encouraging a specific House or Senate member not yet cosponsoring the statehood bills in Congress
* Best Group: given to a community group (won by Mayor Muriel Bowser)
* Best Elected Official: given to a local elected official (won by Brianne Nadeau)
* Best Agency: given to a local Government Agency (won by DOEE)
* Best Business: given to a business promoting the DC flag and its business
* Best Non-Profit: given to a non-profit representing the love of Washington, DC and their organization (won by DC Vote)
* Artistic Expression: given for the most artistic photo 
* Best Pet: given for the &quot;most cute, quirky, or compelling photo of a non-human living thing&quot; 
* Best Friend in a State: given to a person or group from one of the 50 states imploring their Representative or Senator to support the Statehood Movement or thank them for doing so (won by Eleanor Norton)
* Best Statehood Shot: given for the best photo symbolic of the fight for statehood (won by Charles Allen)

===Voter&#x27;s Guide upside-down flag incident===
On October 16, 2014, ahead of the November 4 elections, it was discovered that the DC flag was put upside down on the DC Voters Guide sent to residents in the district the previous day. It was originally reported by Denise Tolliver, the District of Columbia Board of Elections&#x27; spokesperson, that the inverted flag was placed as a way to draw attention to the upcoming election. The turnout at the previous election was at a historic low with only 27% turnout. Later that day, after checking with the printer, the Executive Director, Clifford Tatum, confirmed that it was indeed an error. According to him, a member of the design team had stylized the logo in past elections. He stated that &quot;[The Board] ha[s] done different things with the flag in the past. Her idea was the bars would be above the stars.&quot; Since the error was found after they were published, it appears someone came up with the cover-up idea of it being intentional. Ward 5 Council Member Kenyan McDuffie stated &quot;My impression is that this was not an intentional act, and it was an error. And if it was intentional, then it was ridiculous that anyone would sanction that.&quot; The board issued an apology and acknowledged both issues with the DC flag properly oriented as a watermark:
===Federal use===
Until 2013, the DC flag was not automatically raised at events in the United States Armed Forces along the flags of the 50 states. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 was signed into law by President Barack Obama in January 2013 contained a provision that required just that the DC flag and the flags of the territories be displayed whenever the flags of the states are displayed. This legislation was pushed by Delegate to the House of Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton.

===Private use===

The design has been embraced by the public in the 20th century and it has become a symbol of the city. It is used in the logos of D.C. United, the DC Defenders, Old Glory DC, the Washington Capitals, and the Washington Wizards.

It has been used by many local brands in their logos to show their local connection. One such example is DC Brau Brewing whose logo includes the DC flag on the US Capitol. The Department of Small and Local Business Development established the &quot;Made in DC&quot; program &quot;to capture, highlight and promote the intellectual and creative genius of DC’s local maker community&quot;. The logo includes the DC flag as part of its design.
The flag is a popular tattoo design among residents of the district. Some years on Flag Day, people with D.C. flag tattoos have gathered in Dupont Circle to celebrate it rather than the U.S. flag, and to rally for D.C. voting rights. Notable bearers of the tattoo include Ward 3 Council Member Mary Cheh and radio host Kojo Nnamdi—who, along with Tom Sherwood, political analyst at the local National Public Radio WAMU agreed to get tattooed in for a $3,000 donation to the public supported station. It was announced on air on October 23, 2015 and the tattoos took place on November 20, 2015.

==Criticism of the design==
===No local involvement in the selection===
The new flag was not well received by many in the local population at the time. The failure to involve the local population in the selection of their flag did not go unnoticed and many found new meanings for the stars and bars with many negative symbols and parallels.

With the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, the new federal district was placed under the sole authority of Congress. In the process, DC residents lost voting representation in Congress as they were no longer part of a US state. They also lost representation in the Electoral College and the right to home rule. By 1938, the residents were still fighting for these rights. The Twenty-third Amendment restored the right to vote in the Electoral College and on December 24, 1973, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act allowed the residents to elect a mayor and the 13-member Council of the District of Columbia.

In 1938 however, the situation was much different. The &quot;Evening Star&quot; points out that while the residents of the district had now a flag, they were still without a vote or representation. The refusal to involve local participation in spite of multiple requests of local civic associations was a clear sign that nothing had changed in terms of local representation and involvement in the federally controlled government. The lack of local significance or symbolism was also criticized and new interpretations of the flag were found. The two red stripes were seen as representing the Senate and House of Representatives where DC residents were not represented, while the three stars represented the three commissioners who ruled over the city with accountability to the people who were innocent and represented in white.

The chairman of the Flag Committee of the &quot;Society of Natives&quot; noted:
A citizen had similar views. He describes his vision of the flag which he considers &quot;a misfit for a flag to represent the seat of government of the greatest free country of the earth&quot;:

Over time attitudes toward the design changed and it went from being rejected to being embraced including by the Statehood movement in the District of Columbia.

The flag of Washington D.C. placed eighth out of 72 entries in a 2001 survey of U.S. and Canadian subdivisional flags by the North American Vexillological Association.

==History of Washington family arms==

The coat of arms in question is blazoned as:
According to records available, this coat of arms was granted to Lawrence Washington of Sulgrave Manor in 1592 by Robert Cook, Clarenceux King of Arms. He was the last known recorded grantee of that specific design by the College of Arms.

Lawrence would have passed it down to his descendants upon his death as it was the tradition. Lawrence Washington had two sons: John (1589–1688) and Lawrence (1602–1652). Lawrence Washington was the youngest. As was often the case of younger children, he entered the clergy as he seems to not have had received the estate and became a rector.

Lawrence&#x27;s oldest son, John Washington (1631-1677) was the earliest ancestor to arrive in America with his youngest brother. He settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1656. It is mentioned in &quot;Crozier&#x27;s General Armory&quot; that John was using the coat of arms in Virginia in 1657. However this armorial was published 250 years later in 1904 and the author does no cite his sources for the coat of arms. It could well be that William Armstrong Crozier was deducting the fact that John had it because George Washington was using them a century and a half later.

There seems to have been no official recordings of this coat of arms in the colonies so it remains unclear who used the coat of arms between John Washington who settled in 1656 and the Revolutionary war. It is said that it was engraved on Elizabeth Washington (1717–1734/35), George Washington cousin. It appears that the coat of arms had been used by the family in the Colony for some time as George Washington reported in his letter to Sir Isaac Heard on May 2, 1792. George himself had started using it as early as 1755, when he purchased goods with the coat of arms. It is well documented that George Washington, a British subject until the Revolutionary War, used this coat of arms extensively at Mount Vernon and on many objects.

While the United States were no longer under British rule after its independence, it appears that George Washington was actually studying his family heritage later in life both in terms of genealogy and heraldry as visible in his correspondence with the College of Arms represented by Isaac Heard from 1791 to 1796.

The earliest communication we have from his regarding this happens in 1788 with William Barton. The question was raised with regards to the design of the Great Seal of the United States and the possible need for regulations which George Washington was reluctant to the idea because of the fragility of the Union. At the time, he described himself as &quot;imperfectly acquainted with the subject of heraldry. In his view &quot;it might not [...] be advisable to stir any question, that would tend to reanimate the dying embers of faction, or blow the dormant spark of jealousy into an inextinguishable flame.&quot;
A couple years later, the same President was in communication with Isaac Heard, who was the Garter Principal King of Arms to inquire about his family&#x27;s coat of arms. The communication seems to be centered around the genealogical question. In the December 7, 1791 letter, Mr. Heard is requesting additional information regarding George Washington&#x27;s ancestry as he seem to not have that information available. Mr. Washington responds on May 2, 1792 that he will probably not be able to provide this pedigree due to the lack of centralized records. He has been researching the historical family link to England and acknowledges that he is unsure about the exact location in England. It is in this letter that he mentions the resemblance of the arms:

In an August 9, 1793, Mr. Heard informs Mr. Washington that he is still trying to prove that he is a direct descendant from Lawrence Washington who was granted the coat of arms and is requesting more information. The question appears to have not been resolved by July 10, 1796. He was still attempting to find the proof that the first immigrants (John and Lawrence) were in fact Lawrence Washington of Soul grove&#x27;s descendants. No further letter is known to exist between the two and George Washington passed away on December 14, 1799.

<text>Cassia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, and the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Species are known commonly as cassias. The genus includes 37 species and has a pantropical distribution. Species of the genera &quot;Senna&quot; and &quot;Chamaecrista&quot; were previously included in &quot;Cassia&quot;. &quot;Cassia&quot; now generally includes the largest species of the legume subtribe Cassiinae, usually mid-sized to tall trees.

Cassia is also the English common name of some unrelated species in the genus &quot;Cinnamomum&quot; of the family Lauraceae.

==Ecology==

&quot;Cassia&quot; species occur in a range of climates. Some can be utilized widely as ornamental plants. They have been used in reforestation projects, and species from desert climates can be used to prevent desertification.

&quot;Cassia&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of many lepidopteran taxa. For example, the skipper &quot;Astraptes fulgerator&quot; and the pierids &quot;Catopsilia pomona&quot; and &quot;C. pyranthe&quot; are all seen on &quot;Cassia fistula&quot;. The latter utilizes several other cassias, as well.

The plant pathogenic viruses cassia yellow blotch bromovirus and cassia yellow spot potyvirus were first described from &quot;Cassia&quot;.

==Uses==

Because the name &quot;Cassia&quot; is not precise, it is sometimes difficult to know what is meant by references to plants known as &quot;cassias&quot;. Cassia gum, for example, is made from &quot;Senna obtusifolia&quot;, a species formerly included in genus &quot;Cassia&quot;.

Genera &quot;Cassia&quot; and &quot;Senna&quot; are both known in systems of traditional medicine. &quot;Cassia fistula&quot;, for example, is used in Ayurvedic medicine.

There exists some culinary use for cassias. The fruit of some species is edible. In Central America, its pods are stewed into a molasses-like syrup, taken as a sweetener and for its nutritional and medicinal effects. Some have toxins in their seeds, however.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
There are hundreds of &quot;Cassia&quot; species, but it is unclear just how many. One estimate stands at 692. The genus was a wastebasket taxon for a long time, used to classify plants that did not fit well anywhere else. Over 1000 species have belonged to &quot;Cassia&quot; over the years. Many taxa have since been transferred to more appropriate genera, such as &quot;Senna&quot;. &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; accepts 37 species.

<doc id="497787" wikidata="Q363231" url="?curid=497787" title="Denys Arcand">
<text>Georges-Henri Denys Arcand (; born June 25, 1941) is a Canadian filmmaker. During his four decades career, he became one of the most internationally-recognized director from Quebec, earning widespread acclaim and numerous accolades for his &quot;intensely personal, challenging, and intellectual films.&quot;

His film &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004. His films have also been nominated three further times, including two nominations in the same category for &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; in 1989, becoming the only French-Canadian director in history whose films have received this number of nominations and, subsequently, to have a film win the award. For &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;, he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, losing to Sofia Coppola for &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.

Arcand has also won several awards from the Cannes Film Festival, including the Best Screenplay Award, the Jury Prize, and many other prestigious awards worldwide. He won three César Awards in 2004 for &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;: Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, the only Canadian director to have done so. He is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and a Commander of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

==Early life and education==
Arcand was born in Deschambault, Quebec, Canada. He grew up in a devoutly Roman Catholic home in a village about 40 km southwest of Quebec City. He attended Jesuit school for nine years. Entering his teen years, the family moved to Montreal and although he dreamed about being a professional tennis player, while studying for a master&#x27;s degree in history at the Université de Montréal he became involved in film making, which gave him a new sense of direction. In this era he was involved in several student film projects in collaboration with classmates Denis Héroux and Stéphane Venne, including &quot;À l&#x27;est d&#x27;Eaton&quot;, &quot;Alone or with Others (Seul ou avec d&#x27;autres)&quot; and &quot;Over My Head (Jusqu&#x27;au cou)&quot;.

==Career==

In 1963, he joined the National Film Board of Canada where he produced several award-winning documentaries in his native French language. A social activist, he made a feature-length documentary in 1970 titled &quot;Cotton Mill, Treadmill (On est au coton)&quot; that showed the exploitation of textile workers. The film caused an uproar that resulted in it not being distributed publicly for several years. Arcand received such publicity that it gave his fledgling career a great boost. He also worked on some television series, notably &quot;Duplessis&quot;, a historical work he wrote (but did not direct) about Premier Maurice Duplessis.

During the early part of the 1970s, Arcand produced a number of feature films that received critical acclaim. Arcand returned to directing documentaries and did no work for television. In 1982, his documentary, &quot;Comfort and Indifference (Le confort et l&#x27;indifférence)&quot; won the Prix Luc-Perreault from the Quebec Film Critics&#x27; Association. In 1986 he wrote and directed what was until then the highest-grossing film in Quebec (and Canadian) history, &quot;The Decline of the American Empire (Le Déclin de l&#x27;empire américain)&quot;.

At the Canadian Genie Awards, it captured best film, best director, and best writer of an original screenplay. It also won the &quot;International Critics Prize&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival and became the first Canadian feature film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Three years later Arcand repeated this award-garnering performance with his widely acclaimed 1989 film &quot;Jesus of Montreal (Jésus de Montréal)&quot; winning the same three Genie awards, plus the Jury Prize at Cannes. The movie earned him a second Academy Award nomination, becoming the first Canadian director to accomplish this achievement.

Arcand produced and directed his first English language film in 1993, titled &quot;Love and Human Remains&quot;, and did so again in 2000, with the film &quot;Stardom&quot;, which opened the Toronto International Film Festival. He then spent two years writing the script for what many claim is his finest piece of cinematic writing to date, &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; (&quot;Les invasions barbares&quot;). Released in 2003, the film won Arcand the Best Screenplay Award at the Cannes Film Festival, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Foreign Language Film and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In addition, Denys Arcand was nominated for an Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay. &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; won France&#x27;s 2004 César Award for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.

Arcand&#x27;s film &quot;Days of Darkness (L&#x27;Âge des ténèbres)&quot; was chosen to close the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The press opening was subdued and the subsequent reviews were mixed. Following this, he took a seven-year hiatus from feature film directing; he returned in 2014 with the film &quot;Le règne de la beauté.&quot;

==Awards and honours==

In 1988, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2005. In 1990 the Government of France awarded him the Legion of Honour. He finally earned from his home province one of its highest distinctions, the title of Knight of the National Order of Quebec, in 1990.

In 1995, Arcand received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement. In February 2004, the government of France named Denys Arcand a Commander of L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, that nation&#x27;s highest cultural honour. In 2004, Arcand was also inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

He is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

In 2023, he was named the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of Canada.

==Personal life==
Arcand is a lapsed Catholic. Married a second time, neither Arcand nor Denise Robert, his producer/wife, has had children. He was 55 years old when they adopted an orphaned baby boy from China named Carter. His brother Bernard Arcand (1945–2009) was a professor of anthropology, and his youngest brother Gabriel Arcand (b. 1949) is a noted Canadian actor. His great-uncle, Adrien Arcand (1899-1967), was a notorious far-right politician.

<doc id="497794" wikidata="Q503129" url="?curid=497794" title="Chocolate brownie">
<text>A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked dessert bar. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy &quot;skin&quot; on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.

Brownies are typically eaten by hand or with utensils, and may be accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with ice cream (), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar. In North America, they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants, ice cream parlors, and coffeehouses.

==History==
One legend about the creation of brownies is that of Bertha Palmer, a prominent Chicago socialite whose husband owned the Palmer House Hotel. In 1893, Palmer asked a pastry chef for a dessert suitable for ladies attending the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. She requested a dessert that would be smaller than a piece of cake, and easily eaten from boxed lunches. The result was the Palmer House Brownie, made of chocolate with walnuts and an apricot glaze. The Palmer House in Chicago still serves this dessert to patrons made from the same recipe. The name was given to the dessert some time after 1893, but was not used by cookbooks or journals at the time.

The first-known printed use of the word &quot;brownie&quot; to describe a dessert appeared in the 1896 version of the &quot;Boston Cooking-School Cook Book&quot; by Fannie Farmer, in reference to molasses cakes baked individually in tin molds. However, Farmer&#x27;s brownies did not contain chocolate. Brownies in this style are now known as &quot;blondies&quot;, derived from the term &quot;blond brownies&quot;, which appeared in the mid-1900s. 

In 1899, the first-known recipe was published in &quot;.&quot; They were called &quot;Brownie&#x27;s Food&quot;. The recipe appears on page 23 in the cake section of the book. Marie Kelley from Whitewater, Wisconsin, created the recipe.

The earliest-known published recipes for a modern-style chocolate brownie appeared in &quot;Home Cookery&quot; (1904, Laconia, New Hampshire), the &quot;Service Club Cook Book&quot; (1904, Chicago, Illinois), &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; (April 2, 1905 p. 34), and the 1906 edition of Fannie Farmer&#x27;s cookbook. These recipes produced a relatively mild and cake-like brownie.

By 1907, the brownie was well established in a recognizable form, appearing in &quot;Lowney&#x27;s Cook Book&quot; by Maria Willet Howard (published by Walter M. Lowney Company, Boston) as an adaptation of the Boston Cooking School recipe for a &quot;Bangor Brownie&quot;. It added an extra egg and an additional square of chocolate, creating a richer, fudgier dessert. The name &quot;Bangor Brownie&quot; appears to have been derived from the town of Bangor, Maine, which an apocryphal story states was the hometown of a housewife who created the original brownie recipe. Maine food educator and columnist Mildred Brown Schrumpf was the main proponent of the theory that brownies were invented in Bangor. While &quot;The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink&quot; (2007) refuted Schrumpf&#x27;s premise that &quot;Bangor housewives&quot; had created the brownie, citing the publication of a brownie recipe in a 1905 Fannie Farmer cookbook, in its second edition, &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America&quot; (2013) said it had discovered evidence to support Schrumpf&#x27;s claim, in the form of several 1904 cookbooks that included a recipe for &quot;Bangor Brownies&quot;.

In 2021, the food science journalist and home cookery YouTuber Adam Ragusea conducted a series of experiments to discover why modern brownies tend to form a desirably glossy &quot;skin&quot; on their upper crust. In a video reporting his findings, Ragusea asserted that the &quot;skin&quot; was the result of making a batter of high viscosity, with low levels of moisture and sugar well-dissolved into the mixture.

<text>, or CIÉ, is a statutory corporation of Ireland, answerable to the Irish Government and responsible for most public transport within the Republic of Ireland and jointly with its Northern Ireland counterpart, the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company (which trades as Translink), for the railway service between Dublin and Belfast, via Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry and Portadown. The company is headquartered at Heuston Station, Dublin. It is a statutory corporation whose members are appointed by the Minister for Transport.

==Services==

Since the enactment of the &quot;Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Act, 1986&quot;, CIÉ has been the holding company for Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann/Irish Rail, the three largest internal transport companies in Ireland. It was originally to have operated the Luas tram system in Dublin, but that project was transferred to the newly created Railway Procurement Agency (RPA).

CIÉ&#x27;s services are provided through three operating companies:
* Dublin Bus, which provides bus services in the Greater Dublin Area, including most bus services within Dublin city and the County Dublin;
* Bus Éireann, which provides intercity and regional bus services outside Dublin city and county and from Dublin to the rest of Ireland, as well as operating the city buses in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Galway and a number of other small urban bus systems;
* Iarnród Éireann, which operates InterCity, Commuter and DART trains, and – together with NI Railways – the Dublin–Belfast Enterprise train service. Iarnród Éireann also operates Rosslare Europort.

CIÉ is responsible for the overall strategy of the group. It owns all fixed assets used by the three companies, such as railway lines and stations, the latter being dealt with through the Group Property division. It also operates an international tour division, CIÉ Tours International. CIÉ&#x27;s vast number of advertising sites are organised through Commuter Advertising Network (CAN), since the mid-1990s employing an external company (currently Exterion Media Ireland) to manage them. There are also a number of shared services provided by CIÉ to its three operating companies.

Other than in the railway sector, CIÉ is not a monopoly provider of public transport services: a number of other operators exist; however, under the Transport Act, 1932, these may not compete directly on any route for which CIÉ has been granted a licence. However, legislation was enacted in 2013 to provide for the tendering of 10% of routes operated by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. This public competition includes these two operators, along with private operators such as Go-Ahead Ireland, and was completed in January 2019.

==History==

Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) was formed as a private company by the &quot;Transport Act 1944&quot; and incorporated the &quot;Great Southern Railways Company&quot; and &quot;Dublin United Transport Company&quot;, adopting the logo of the latter company, the so-called &quot;flying snail&quot;. Great Southern Railways(GSR) was incorporated in 1925, having been &quot;Great Southern Railway&quot; since 1924. Essentially the GSR became – especially as it started to broaden its business interests into road transport – a monopoly transport operator. The &quot;Transport Act 1950&quot; amalgamated CIÉ and the &quot;Grand Canal Company&quot; and formally nationalised CIÉ, changing its structure from that of a private limited company to a corporation under a board appointed by the Minister for Transport. The &quot;Great Northern Railway Act 1958&quot; and the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1958 (c. 15 (N.I.)), passed by the Parliament of Northern Ireland, transferred the lines of the &quot;Great Northern Railway Board&quot; in the Republic of Ireland (including County Donegal) to CIÉ.

Until 1986, CIÉ operated as a single legal entity, although it was internally organised into rail services and two bus divisions – Dublin City Services and Provincial Services. The vast majority of services were branded CIÉ, although long-distance provincial buses were branded &quot;Expressway&quot; and Dublin electric trains DART. In 1987, CIÉ was reorganised into a holding company and three operating companies. In 1990, it sold its nine Great Southern Hotels, including its hotel in Derry, to Aer Rianta, the airports authority.

The company does not run any services on Christmas Day.

==Financial losses and the future==
CIÉ was established to provide road and railway transport, and later took on some of the canals and ports. It was empowered as both a provider and a licensor of other providers.

For most of its existence, CIÉ, in particular its railways division, made large losses and was subsidised by the taxpayer. This provoked demands from the public and politicians to &quot;make CIÉ pay&quot;. In a similar pattern to that seen in many other states, Ireland&#x27;s railways were accordingly rationalised, and suffered severe cutbacks while at the same time the road division was expanded.

The Baker Tilly report found an amount of corporate malpractice in 2004–08. CIÉ did not pass on the report to the Minister for Transport until it was mentioned in the media.

Losses in 2009:
* Iarnród Éireann/Irish Rail — €4.0m
* Bus Éireann — €54.1m

The biggest change to CIÉ&#x27;s operational structure since 1987 came with the establishment of the National Transport Authority in December 2009, which has powers over CIÉ&#x27;s operations in the Greater Dublin Area. The &quot;Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008&quot; also gives the Minister for Transport instead of the chairman of CIÉ the power to appoint the directors of the subsidiary companies. CIÉ receives public service obligation payments to support the provision of services on most of its routes.

In 2013, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann made a profit of €500,000 and €400,000 respectively, for the first time in a number of years.

<doc id="497803" wikidata="Q615759" url="?curid=497803" title="Hypercapnia">
<text>Hypercapnia (from the Greek &quot;hyper&quot;, &quot;above&quot; or &quot;too much&quot; and &quot;kapnos&quot;, &quot;smoke&quot;), also known as hypercarbia and CO2 retention, is a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood. Carbon dioxide is a gaseous product of the body&#x27;s metabolism and is normally expelled through the lungs. Carbon dioxide may accumulate in any condition that causes hypoventilation, a reduction of alveolar ventilation (the clearance of air from the small sacs of the lung where gas exchange takes place) as well as resulting from inhalation of CO2. Inability of the lungs to clear carbon dioxide, or inhalation of elevated levels of CO2, leads to respiratory acidosis. Eventually the body compensates for the raised acidity by retaining alkali in the kidneys, a process known as &quot;metabolic compensation&quot;.

Acute hypercapnia is called acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) and is a medical emergency as it generally occurs in the context of acute illness. Chronic hypercapnia, where metabolic compensation is usually present, may cause symptoms but is not generally an emergency. Depending on the scenario both forms of hypercapnia may be treated with medication, with mask-based non-invasive ventilation or with mechanical ventilation.

Hypercapnia is a hazard of underwater diving associated with breath-hold diving, scuba diving, particularly on rebreathers, and deep diving where it is associated with increased breathing gas density due to the high ambient pressure.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Hypercapnia may happen in the context of an underlying health condition, and symptoms may relate to this condition or directly to the hypercapnia. Specific symptoms attributable to early hypercapnia are dyspnea (breathlessness), headache, confusion and lethargy. Clinical signs include flushed skin, full pulse (bounding pulse), rapid breathing, premature heart beats, muscle twitches, and hand flaps (asterixis). The risk of dangerous irregularities of the heart beat is increased. Hypercapnia also occurs when the breathing gas is contaminated with carbon dioxide, or respiratory gas exchange cannot keep up with the metabolic production of carbon dioxide, which can occur when gas density limits ventilation at high ambient pressures.

In severe hypercapnia (generally formula_1 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg), symptomatology progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.

== Causes ==
Carbon dioxide is a normal metabolic product but it accumulates in the body if it is produced faster than it is cleared. During strenuous exercise the production rate of carbon dioxide can increase more than tenfold over the production rate during rest. Carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood and elimination is by gas exchange in the lungs during breathing. Hypercapnia is generally caused by hypoventilation, lung disease, or diminished consciousness. It may also be caused by exposure to environments containing abnormally high concentrations of carbon dioxide, such as from volcanic or geothermal activity, or by rebreathing exhaled carbon dioxide. In this situation the hypercapnia can also be accompanied by respiratory acidosis.

Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure may occur in acute illness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chest wall deformity, some forms of neuromuscular disease (such as myasthenia gravis), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. AHRF may also develop in any form of respiratory failure where the breathing muscles become exhausted, such as severe pneumonia and acute severe asthma. It can also be a consequence of profound suppression of consciousness such as opioid overdose.

=== During diving ===

Normal respiration in divers results in alveolar hypoventilation resulting in inadequate CO2 elimination or hypercapnia. Lanphier&#x27;s work at the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit answered the question, &quot;Why don&#x27;t divers breathe enough?&quot;:
* Higher inspired oxygen (formula_2) at accounted for not more than 25% of the elevation in end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) above values found at the same work rate when breathing air just below the surface.
* Increased work of breathing accounted for most of the elevation of formula_1 (alveolar gas equation) in exposures above , as indicated by the results when helium was substituted for nitrogen at .
* Inadequate ventilatory response to exertion was indicated by the fact that, despite resting values in the normal range, formula_4 rose markedly with exertion even when the divers breathed air at a depth of only a few feet.

A variety of reasons exist for carbon dioxide not being expelled completely when the diver exhales:
* The diver is exhaling into an enclosed space that does not allow all the CO2 to escape to the environment, such as a long snorkel, full-face diving mask, or diving helmet, and the diver then re-inhales from that dead space.
* The carbon dioxide scrubber in the diver&#x27;s rebreather is failing to remove sufficient carbon dioxide from the loop (higher inspired CO2), the breathing gas is contaminated with CO2, or the non-return valves in the breathing circuit are malfunctioning.
* The diver is overexercising, producing excess carbon dioxide due to elevated metabolic activity and respiratory gas exchange cannot keep up with the metabolic production of carbon dioxide.
* Gas density limits ventilation at high ambient pressures. The density of the breathing gas is higher at depth, so the effort required to fully inhale and exhale increases, making breathing more difficult and less efficient (high work of breathing). Higher gas density also causes gas mixing within the lung to be less efficient, thus increasing the effective dead space.
* The diver is deliberately hypoventilating, known as &quot;skip breathing&quot;.
====Skip breathing====
Skip breathing is a controversial technique to conserve breathing gas when using open-circuit scuba, which consists of briefly holding one&#x27;s breath between inhalation and exhalation (i.e., &quot;skipping&quot; a breath). It can lead to CO2 not being exhaled efficiently. The risk of burst lung (pulmonary barotrauma of ascent) is increased if the breath is held while ascending. It is particularly counterproductive with a rebreather, where the act of breathing pumps the gas around the &quot;loop&quot;, pushing carbon dioxide through the scrubber and mixing freshly injected oxygen.

In closed-circuit rebreather diving, exhaled carbon dioxide must be removed from the breathing system, usually by a scrubber containing a solid chemical compound with a high affinity for CO2, such as soda lime. If not removed from the system, it may be reinhaled, causing an increase in the inhaled concentration.

Under hyperbaric conditions, hypercapnia contributes to nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity by causing cerebral vasodilation which increases the dosage of oxygen to the brain.

==Mechanism==
Hypercapnia normally triggers a reflex which increases breathing and access to oxygen (O2), such as arousal and turning the head during sleep. A failure of this reflex can be fatal, for example as a contributory factor in sudden infant death syndrome.

Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure (higher levels of carbon dioxide stimulate aortic and carotid chemoreceptors with afferents -CN IX and X- to medulla oblongata with following chrono- and ino-tropic effects), and a propensity toward cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance.

==Physiological effects==

A high arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (formula_1) causes changes in brain activity that adversely affect both fine muscular control and reasoning. EEG changes denoting minor narcotic effects can be detected for expired gas end tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (formula_6) increase from to approximately . The diver does not necessarily notice these effects.

Higher levels of formula_1 have a stronger narcotic effect: Confusion and irrational behaviour may occur around , and loss of consciousness around . High formula_1triggers the fight or flight response, affects hormone levels and can cause anxiety, irritability and inappropriate or panic responses, which can be beyond the control of the subject, sometimes with little or no warning. Vasodilation is another effect, notably in the skin, where feelings of unpleasant heat are reported, and in the brain, where blood flow can increase by 50% at a formula_6 of , Intracranial pressure may rise, with a throbbing headache. If associated with a high formula_1 the high delivery of oxygen to the brain may increase the risk of CNS oxygen toxicity at partial pressures usually considered acceptable.

In many people a high formula_1 causes a feeling of shortness of breath, but the lack of this symptom is no guarantee that the other effects are not occurring. A significant percentage of rebreather deaths have been associated with CO2 retention. The effects of high formula_1 can take several minutes to hours to resolve once the cause has been removed.

==Diagnosis==
Blood gas tests may be performed, typically by radial artery puncture, in the setting of acute breathing problems or other acute medical illness. Hypercapnia is generally defined as an arterial blood carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Since carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with carbonic acid in the blood, hypercapnia drives serum pH down, resulting in respiratory acidosis. Clinically, the effect of hypercapnia on pH is estimated using the ratio of the arterial pressure of carbon dioxide to the concentration of bicarbonate ion, formula_13.

=== Tolerance ===


=== CO2 toxicity in animal models ===
Tests performed on mongrel dogs showed the physiological effect of carbon dioxide on the body of the animal: after inhalation of a 50% CO2 and 50% air mixture, respiratory movement increased for about 2 minutes, and then, it decreased for 30 to 90 minutes. Hill and Flack showed that CO2 concentrations up to 35% have an exciting effect upon both circulation and respiration, but those beyond 35% are depressant upon them. The blood pressure (BP) decreased transiently during the increased respiratory movement and then rose again and maintained the original level for a while. The heart rate slowed slightly just after the gas mixture inhalation. It is believed that the initial BP depression with the decreased heart rate is due to the direct depressant effect of CO2 upon the heart and that the return of blood pressure to its original level was due to the rapid rise of formula_1. After 30–90 min, the respiratory center was depressed, and hypotension occurred gradually or suddenly from reduced cardiac output, leading to an apnea and eventually to circulatory arrest.

At higher concentrations of CO2, unconsciousness occurred almost instantaneously and respiratory movement ceased in 1 minute. After a few minutes of apnea, circulatory arrest was seen. These findings imply that the cause of death in breathing high concentrations of CO2 is not the hypoxia but the intoxication of carbon dioxide.

==Treatment==
The treatment for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure depends on the underlying cause, but may include medications and mechanical respiratory support. In those without contraindications, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is often used in preference to invasive mechanical ventilation. In the past, the drug doxapram (a respiratory stimulant), was used for hypercapnia in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but there is little evidence to support its use compared to NIV, and it does not feature in recent professional guidelines.

Very severe respiratory failure, in which hypercapnia may also be present, is often treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), in which oxygen is added to and carbon dioxide removed directly from the blood.

A relatively novel modality is extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R). This technique removes CO2 from the bloodstream and may reduce the time mechanical ventilation is required for those with AHRF; it requires smaller volumes of blood flow compared to ECMO.

==Terminology==
Hypercapnia is the opposite of hypocapnia, the state of having abnormally reduced levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.

<text>William Henry Fitton (24 January 178013 May 1861) was an Irish physician and amateur geologist.

==Biography==
Fitton was born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College in that city. He gained the senior scholarship in 1798, and graduated in the following year. At this time he began to take an interest in geology and to form a collection of fossils. Having adopted the medical profession, he proceeded in 1808 to Edinburgh, where he attended the lectures of Robert Jameson, and thenceforth his interest in natural history and especially in geology steadily increased. He moved to London in 1809, where he studied medicine and chemistry. In 1811 he presented to the Geological Society of London a description of the geological structure of the vicinity of Dublin, with an account of some rare minerals found in Ireland. He took a medical practice at Northampton in 1812, and for some years the duties of his profession engrossed his time. He was admitted M.D. at Cambridge in 1816.

In 1820, having married a lady of means, Fitton settled in London, and devoted himself to geology. His &quot;Observations on some of the Strata between the Chalk and the Oxford Oolite, in the South-east of England&quot; (Trans. Geol. Soc. ser. 2, vol. iv.) embodied a series of researches extending from 1824 to 1836, and form the memoir known as &quot;Fitton&#x27;s Strata below the Chalk&quot;. In this work he established the true succession and relations of the Upper and Lower Greensand, and of the Wealden and Purbeck formations, and elaborated their detailed structure. He had been elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1815, and he was president of the Geological Society of London in 1827–1829, and to which he contributed a number of research publications. His house then became a meeting place for scientific workers, and during his presidency he held a conversazione open on Sunday evenings to all fellows of the Geological Society. From 1817 to 1841 he contributed to the Edinburgh Review many essays on the progress of geological science, and reviews of the groundbreaking books of William Smith (geologist), Charles Lyell, and Roderick Murchison; he also wrote &quot;Notes on the Progress of Geology in England&quot; for the Philosophical Magazine (1832–1833). Another publication of note was &quot;A Geological Sketch of the Vicinity of Hastings&quot; (1833). He was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society in 1852. This medal is now in the collection of the Geological Museum, Trinity College, Dublin. Around 1825, according to Charles Babbage&#x27;s autobiography, he invented the thaumatrope, which was later commercially publicised by Dr. John Ayrton Paris (to whom the invention is more usually attributed). He died in London.

== Family ==
Fitton had three sisters, Sarah Mary, Elizabeth (fl. 1817–1834) and Susanna. Sarah and Elizabeth wrote &quot;Conversations on Botany,&quot; which influenced the popularity of botany as a field of scientific study for women.

<text>The Department of Peace is a proposed cabinet-level department of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States.

==History==
The peace movement in the United States has a proposed legislative history that dates to the first years of the republic:

* 1793: Benjamin Rush, Founding Father (signer of the Declaration of Independence), wrote an essay titled &quot;A plan of a Peace-Office for the United States&quot;. Rush called for equal footing with the Department of War and pointed out the effect of doing so for the welfare of the United States in promoting and preserving perpetual peace in the United States. First published in a 1793 almanac that Benjamin Banneker authored, the plan stated:

1. Let a Secretary of Peace be appointed to preside in this office; . . . let him be a genuine republican and a sincere Christian. . . .

2. Let a power be given to the Secretary to establish and maintain free schools in every city, village and township in the United States; . . . Let the youth of our country be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in the doctrines of a religion of some kind; the Christian religion should be preferred to all others; for it belongs to this religion exclusively to teach us not only to cultivate peace with all men, but to forgive—nay more, to love our very enemies. . . .

3. Let every family be furnished at public expense, by the Secretary of this office, with an American edition of the Bible. . . .

4. Let the following sentence be inscribed in letters of gold over the door of every home in the United States: The Son of Man Came into the World, Not To Destroy Men&#x27;s Lives, But To Save Them.

5. To inspire a veneration for human life, and a horror at the shedding of human blood, let all those laws be repealed which authorize juries, judges, sheriffs, or hangmen to assume the resentments of individuals, and to commit murder in cold blood in any case whatever. . . .

6. To subdue that passion for war . . . militia laws should everywhere be repealed, and military dresses and military titles should be laid aside. . . .
* 1925: Carrie Chapman Catt, founder of the League of Women Voters, at the Cause and Cure for War Conference, publicly suggested a cabinet-level Department of Peace and secretary of peace be established.
* 1926/1927: Kirby Page, author of &quot;A National Peace Department&quot;, wrote, published and distributed a proposal for a cabinet-level Department of Peace and secretary of peace.
* 1935: Senator Matthew M. Neely (D-West Virginia) wrote and introduced the first bill calling for the creation of a United States Department of Peace. Reintroduced in 1937 and 1939.
* 1943: Senator Alexander Wiley (R-Wisconsin) spoke on the Senate floor calling for the United States of America to become the first government in the world to have a secretary of peace.
* 1945: Representative Louis Ludlow (D-Indiana) re-introduced a bill, S. 1237, to create a United States Department of Peace.
* 1946: Senator Jennings Randolph (D-West Virginia) re-introduced a bill to create a United States Department of Peace.
* 1947: Representative Everett Dirksen (R-Illinois) introduced a bill for “A Peace Division in the State Department”.
* 1955 to 1968: Eighty-five Senate and House of Representative bills were introduced calling for a United States Department of Peace.
* 1969: Senator Vance Hartke (D-Indiana) and Representative Seymour Halpern (R-New York) re-introduced bills to create a U.S. Department of Peace in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 14 Senate cosponsors of S. 953, the &quot;Peace Act&quot;, included Birch Bayh (D-IN), Robert Byrd (D-WV), Alan Cranston (D-CA), Daniel Inouye (D-HI) and Edmund Muskie (D-ME). The 67 House cosponsors included Ed Koch of New York, Donald Fraser of Minnesota, and Abner Mikva of Illinois, as well as Republican Pete McCloskey of California. The bill would have established a cabinet-level called for the new department to develop &quot;plans, policies and programs designed to foster peace,&quot; coordinate all U.S. government activities affecting &quot;the preservation or promotion of peace,&quot; to cooperate with other governments in planning for peaceful conflict resolution, and promote the exchange of ideas between private parties in the U.S. and other countries. The bill further provided for establishment of an International Peace Institute that would train citizens for service, a Peace by Investment Corporation, and the transfer of agencies such as the Peace Corps, Agency for International Development, and the International Agricultural Development Service, to the new department. The bill received popular support from anti-war groups, Catholic and Baptist publications, author Norman Cousins, and others.
* 1979: Senator Spark Matsunaga (D-Hawaii) re-introduced a bill, S. 2103, &quot;Department of Peace Organization Act of 1979&quot; to create a U.S. Department of Peace.
* 2001: Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) introduced a bill to create a U.S. Department of Peace. A version of this bill was introduced in each session of Congress from 2001 to 2011. The bill was cosponsored by 76 members of Congress in 2007. In July 2008, the first Republican cosponsor, Rep. Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD) signed on.
* 2005: Senator Mark Dayton (D-Minnesota) introduced legislation in the Senate to create a cabinet-level Department of Peace a week after Dennis Kucinich introduced a similar bill in the House.
* 2013: Representative Barbara Lee (D-California) introduced a substantially similar bill to the Kucinich bill.

==Support==

The Peace Alliance and the Student Peace Alliance organizations support the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace. Both are national nonprofit organizations and independent grassroots political movements that operate autonomously. The ongoing movement is supported by several members of Congress, the late former &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor Walter Cronkite and author Marianne Williamson. Also joining the increasing list of national endorsements are Yoko Ono, Joaquin Phoenix, Frances Fisher and Willie Nelson. This movement actively lobbies for the endorsements of congressional leaders and is active in soliciting and receiving a growing list of bipartisan endorsements from city councils in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico and Ohio. Local grassroots chapters have been formed in all 50 states.

==Fiction==
The novel &quot;1988&quot; (a fictional work about the upcoming 1988 presidential election published in 1985) by then-Governor of Colorado Richard Lamm, includes a very similar proposal where the third-party presidential candidate in the novel proposes a cabinet-level Agency for U.S. Peace and Conflict Resolution with a secretary of peace who could challenge the secretary of defense when necessary.

<text>Étienne Jules Adolphe Desmier de Saint-Simon, Vicomte d&#x27;Archiac (24 September 180224 December 1868) was a French geologist and paleontologist.

==Early life==
He was born at Reims and educated at the Military School of St. Cyr. He served for nine years as a cavalry officer until 1830, when he retired from the service. Prior to this he had published an historical romance (&quot;Zizim, ou les Chevaliers de Rhodes, roman historique du XVe siècle&quot;); but now geology became his primary focus. In his earlier scientific works, which date from 1835, he described the Tertiary and Cretaceous formations of France, Belgium and England, and dealt especially with the distribution of fossils geographically and in sequence. Later on he investigated the Carboniferous, Devonian and Silurian formations.

==Magnum opus==
His best work was &quot;&quot;Histoire des progrès de la géologie de 1834 à 1859&quot;, published in eight volumes (1847–1860). In 1853 the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London was awarded to him. In the same year, with Jules Haime (1824–1856), he published a monograph on the Nummulitic formation of India. In 1857 he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1861 he was appointed professor of paleontology in the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris. His better known later works include &quot;Paléontologie stratigraphique&quot;, in three volumes (1864–1865); &quot;Géologie et paléontologie&quot; (1866); and his paleontological contributions to de Tchihatcheff&#x27;s &quot;Asie mineure&quot;&quot; (1866).

==Death==
While suffering from severe depression he committed suicide by throwing himself into the River Seine on Christmas Eve, 1868.

<doc id="497824" wikidata="Q366054" url="?curid=497824" title="Gustavs Zemgals">
<text>Gustavs Zemgals (12 August 1871 – 6 January 1939) was a Latvian politician and the second President of Latvia. He also was twice the mayor of Riga.

Zemgals was born in Džūkste in the Courland Governorate (now Tukums Municipality, Latvia). He attended elementary school in a small parish of Saka, and later continued education in Riga Nikolai Gymnasium. He graduated from Moscow University in 1899 with a degree in law. He then returned to Latvia and was a lawyer, a newspaper editor and a political activist. 

In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Zemgals was mobilised and sent to the front, where he spent a year and a half and was promoted to the rank of captain.

After his return to Latvia in 1905, Zemgals became one of the creators of a new liberal newspaper &quot;Jaunā Dienas Lapa&quot; (New Day&#x27;s Page) and proceeded to become an editor of this paper. He was also an editor in the newspaper that succeeded &quot;Jaunā Dienas Lapa&quot; -&quot;Mūsu Laiki&quot; (Our Times). In July 1907, the Riga district court sentenced Zemgals to a three months long arrest for his work at &quot;Mūsu Laiki&quot;. Soon after that, Zemgals created the Latvian democratic party together with some other political activities. In the time period between 1912 and 1914 Zemgals also worked on a magazine &quot;Domas&quot; (Thoughts).

When World War I began, Zemgals was once again mobilised and initially assigned to an infantry division in the middle part of Latvia, but later he was sent to Finland. After his return to Riga, Zemgals was elected as the chairman of the city on 23 April 1917. In autumn 1917 the Riga Temporary Council repeatedly elected Zemgals as the chairman of the city. At this time, he was active in the Latvian radical-democratic party.

From 1918, Zemgals became active in the Latvian Provisional National Council, where he worked on matters related to occupied Latvian territories. As a member of the Latvian radical-democratic party, he became the second deputy of the chairman of Tautas Padome (People&#x27;s Council), a representative body (council) of Latvian political parties and organizations. Holding this office, he chaired the 18 November 1918 meeting of Tautas Padome, which declared the independence of Latvia. On 3 December 1918 he was elected as the chair of Riga City Council.

When the bolsheviks were gaining power and approaching Latvia, the Tautas Padome sent Jānis Čakste and Zemgals abroad to represent Latvian interests. Cakste, Zemgals and several other people from the government went to Copenhagen on a British warship, but Zemgals returned to Latvia just two months later, where he tried to restore the Tautas Padome, but Zemgals along with a group of loyal politicians was arrested by the German army.

Later, he was a member of Latvian parliament (Saeima) from the Democratic Centre and a minister in several governments. In 1927, after the death of Jānis Čakste he was elected the president of Latvia. As the president, he interfered very little with the Saeima&#x27;s work on laws, only returning a law for review to the Saeima once; Zemgals, however, frequently used his rights to grant amnesty. During his time as president, Zemgals granted amnesty to 648 persons, 172 of which received complete amnesty. He served as president until 1930, when his term expired, and he refused to run for a second term, despite having been asked by many to do so.

After his presidency ended, Zemgals continued his political activities and was elected in the fourth Saeima where he was a member of the foreign and finance, trade and industry commissions. From 1931 to 1932 he was also the Minister of Finance.

In 1924, the French government awarded Zemgals the Legion of Honour (the highest French order of merit), Commander cross (Commandeur). In 1926, he was awarded the Three Star Order (the highest Latvian national award), Third or &quot;Commander&quot; class (Fifth class being the lowest and First class the highest). In 1929, he was awarded the Three Star Order, First class with chain or &quot;Commander Grand Cross with chain&quot;, a distinction only awarded 14 people in the pre-World War II era.

During the thirties, Zemgals published articles in the newspaper &quot;Jaunākās Ziņas&quot; (Latest News).

On 6 January 1939 Zemgals died and was buried in Riga. In 1990, a monument to Zemgals was constructed in Džūkste, place of his birth.

<doc id="497834" wikidata="Q1068085" url="?curid=497834" title="Closed graph theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the closed graph theorem may refer to one of several basic results characterizing continuous functions in terms of their graphs. 
Each gives conditions when functions with closed graphs are necessarily continuous.

A blog post by T. Tao lists several closed graph theorems throughout mathematics.

== Graphs and maps with closed graphs ==
If formula_1 is a map between topological spaces then the graph of formula_2 is the set formula_3 or equivalently,
formula_4
It is said that the graph of formula_2 is closed if formula_6 is a closed subset of formula_7 (with the product topology).

Any continuous function into a Hausdorff space has a closed graph (see )

Any linear map, formula_8 between two topological vector spaces whose topologies are (Cauchy) complete with respect to translation invariant metrics, and if in addition (1a) formula_9 is sequentially continuous in the sense of the product topology, then the map formula_9 is continuous and its graph, , is necessarily closed. Conversely, if formula_9 is such a linear map with, in place of (1a), the graph of formula_9 is (1b) known to be closed in the Cartesian product space formula_7, then formula_9 is continuous and therefore necessarily sequentially continuous. 

=== Examples of continuous maps that do &quot;not&quot; have a closed graph ===

If formula_15 is any space then the identity map formula_16 is continuous but its graph, which is the diagonal formula_17, is closed in formula_18 if and only if formula_15 is Hausdorff. In particular, if formula_15 is not Hausdorff then formula_16 is continuous but does have a closed graph. 

Let formula_15 denote the real numbers formula_23 with the usual Euclidean topology and let formula_24 denote formula_23 with the indiscrete topology (where note that formula_24 is Hausdorff and that every function valued in formula_24 is continuous). Let formula_1 be defined by formula_29 and formula_30 for all formula_31. Then formula_1 is continuous but its graph is closed in formula_7.

== Closed graph theorem in point-set topology ==

In point-set topology, the closed graph theorem states the following:

If &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; are compact Hausdorff spaces, then the theorem can also be deduced from the open mapping theorem for such spaces; see .

Non-Hausdorff spaces are rarely seen, but non-compact spaces are common. An example of non-compact formula_24 is the real line, which allows the discontinuous function with closed graph formula_35.

Also, closed linear operators in functional analysis (linear operators with closed graphs) are typically not continuous.

=== For set-valued functions ===

== In functional analysis ==
If formula_36 is a linear operator between topological vector spaces (TVSs) then we say that formula_37 is a closed operator if the graph of formula_37 is closed in formula_7 when formula_7 is endowed with the product topology.

The closed graph theorem is an important result in functional analysis that guarantees that a closed linear operator is continuous under certain conditions. 
The original result has been generalized many times. 
A well known version of the closed graph theorems is the following.

The theorem is a consequence of the open mapping theorem; see below (conversely, the open mapping theorem in turn can be deduced from the closed graph theorem).

== Relation to the open mapping theorem ==
Often, the closed graph theorems are obtained as corollaries of the open mapping theorems in the following way. Let formula_1 be any map. Then it factors as
:formula_42.
Now, formula_43 is the inverse of the projection formula_44. So, if the open mapping theorem holds for formula_45; i.e., formula_45 is an open mapping, then formula_43 is continuous and then formula_2 is continuous (as the composition of continuous maps).

For example, the above argument applies if formula_2 is a linear operator between Banach spaces with closed graph, or if formula_2 is a map with closed graph between compact Hausdorff spaces.

<text>Augustus Mongredien (1807–1888) was a corn merchant, also known as a political economist and writer. He was a leading amateur British chess master.

==Life==
He was born in London in 1807, of French parents. His father was a French officer who fled to England after Bonaparte&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1798. 

He was educated in the Roman Catholic college at Penn, Buckinghamshire, and continued his studies long after leaving the institution. 
He entered commercial life at an early age, and was the owner of the first screw steamers to the Levant. 

In 1859, he became a member of the firm of H. J. Johnston &amp; Co., and when it was broken up in 1864 he began as a cornbroker on his own account. 
In 1862, he purchased Heatherside, Surrey. 

Gradually he withdrew from business and devoted most of his attention to literary pursuits. 
He had joined the National Political Union in 1831, as well as a spinoff organization, The Radical Club, in 1833 and in 1872 he was elected a member of the Cobden Club, under the auspices of which society several of his treatises were published. 

He thoroughly grasped the free-trade question, and expounded his views on the most difficult problems of political economy with great lucidity. 
He was a good musician and an excellent botanist. He was elected president of the Chess Club in 1839. He had a colloquial knowledge of seven languages, could recite many pages of the Koran, and spoke modern Greek like a native. 
Mr. Gladstone, in recognition of his merits, placed his name on the Civil Pension List. 

Mongredien died at Forest Hill, London, on 30 March 1888. 

==Chess career==
In 1859 Mongredien played a chess match against Paul Morphy. After drawing the first game, he lost the next seven on the trot, losing the match 7.5-0.5. In 1862 he played in chess&#x27;s first international round-robin tournament (in which each participant plays every other) in London, finishing 11th of 14 with 3/13.

==Works==
Mongredien wrote on free trade and botanical subjects. 
His principal works are : 
# &quot;Trees and Shrubs for English Plantations; a selection and description of the most Ornamental Trees and Shrubs, Native and Foreign, which will flourish in the Open Air in our Climate ... with Illustrations,&quot; London, 8vo.

<text>Dublin Bus () is an Irish state-owned bus operator providing services in Dublin. By far the largest bus operator in the city, it carried 145 million passengers in 2023. It is a subsidiary of Córas Iompair Éireann.

==History==

Dublin Bus was established on 2 February 1987, when Córas Iompair Éireann was split into 3 subsidiaries, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail. Dublin&#x27;s main bus operator was formerly the Dublin United Transport Company. This company was incorporated into CIÉ in 1945.

In September 2011, Dublin Bus received a significant technological upgrade with its introduction of real time passenger information.

==Services==


Dublin Bus operates an extensive network of 110 radial, cross-city and peripheral routes and 18 nighttime routes in the city of Dublin and the Greater Dublin Area. The company carries around 325,000 people each day. The main radial routes are focused upon Dublin&#x27;s sixteen Quality Bus Corridors which provide buses with prioritised access, daytime on some routes, 24 hours on others, to the city centre. Express buses (branded &quot;Xpresso&quot;) operate on similar routes but have a limited number of stops and a higher minimum fare. These services run Monday to Friday at peak times and do not operate on public holidays; no bus services operate at all on Christmas Day.
Dublin Bus also runs a &quot;Ghost Bus Tour&quot; passing some of the supposedly haunted places in the city including St Kevin&#x27;s Church and St Audoen&#x27;s Church. The tour usually runs in the evening time and includes two stops where passengers leave the bus behind and visit locations where ghosts have allegedly been seen. (The term &quot;ghost bus&quot; is also used for the unrelated phenomenon of normal scheduled services that fail to arrive.)

In April 2010, Dublin Bus announced it would be simplifying many of its routes around the city in order to create better efficiency. This programme was called Network Direct. However, as part of these measures, the company also announced that 150 jobs would be lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/9/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010s, Dublin Bus rolled out an RTPI system (Real Time Passenger Information) at certain stops, which shows the amount of time before a bus arrives directly to the user.

In 2016, the company carried 125 million passengers, which was a reduction of 14% compared to 2005 numbers (first full year of the Luas, which has seen an increase of 33.6% passengers in the same period).

Between September 2018 and March 2019, 24 Dublin Bus routes and 125 buses were progressively taken over by Go-Ahead Ireland after the National Transport Authority put their operation out to tender, however an equivalent number of new buses were provided to Dublin Bus to retain existing fleet numbers, with increased services and new routes or route variations introduced on the same day as Go-Ahead took over each route batch.

In October 2023, route 99 began operating as a shuttle service between Parkgate Street and the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre. The 99 is the first Dublin Bus route to serve Chesterfield Avenue and important Phoenix Park sites such as Áras an Uachtaráin. This route was not included in the BusConnects network, and was not introduced as part of a BusConnects phase.

In September 2024, route 65a between Tallaght and Blessington was inaugurated as part of service improvements in the Blessington area. This route was also implemented separate to BusConnects.

===Nitelink===
On 6 December 1991 Dublin Bus launched its first &#x27;Nitelink&#x27; service aimed at facilitating Christmas revellers returning home from the city centre. The trial service operated from 6 December 1991 to 4 January 1992 (except for certain holidays) on a Mon-Sun basis and cost a flat fare of £2 per person irrespective of how long or short their journey. Nitelink initially consisted of only four routes serving 12 suburban destinations in total with buses leaving on the hour every hour until 3am, from College Street, D&#x27;Olier Street and Westmoreland Street. Nitelink is an express service, meaning passengers may only board the buses at the city centre termini and other select locations along the way, although they may disembark at any normal bus stop along the route. Upon completing the journey the buses return to the city centre without passengers.

Over the years the Nitelink service increased to 18 routes overnight, and, until January 2009 ran between Monday and Saturday, with the greatest service frequency being on Friday and Saturday nights. Due to cutbacks necessitated by the 2008 economic downturn in Ireland, the midweek schedule was scrapped. By 2014 there were 18 Nitelink routes running again. Nitelink routes 15n and 41n were discontinued on the 1 December 2019 when 24-hour services on routes 15 and 41 came into effect. Some other areas previously served by the 15n and 41n Nitelinks (but not by the 15 or 41) became incorporated into other Nitelink services. A year later on 13 December 2020, Nitelink route 39n was similarly discontinued when daytime route 39a began operating on a 24-hour basis. Route 25n was discontinued on 16 October 2022 as part of Phase 4.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nitelink services were paused between March 2020 and January 2022 with a brief respite between Fri 22 Oct 2021 and 19 December 2021 during which time services resumed. The service was halted again on Sun 19 December 2021 when an 8pm curfew was put in place on the hospitality industry due to an increase in COVID-19 cases. Dublin City Councillor Colm O&#x27;Rourke criticised the move, noting &quot;The Nitelink is not just for clubbers; it&#x27;s for workers and anyone else who needs a low-cost service to get home safely – including people on low wages or perhaps students who work the weekend&quot;. Nitelink services eventually returned to full operating hours from Friday 28 January 2022.

Currently, as of October 2022 the Nitelink service operates on Friday and Saturday nights only (technically the early hours of Saturday and Sunday) and consists of 12 separate routes that depart between the hours of 00:00 and 04:00 from the Dublin city centre locations of D&#x27;Olier Street, Westmoreland Street and Aston Quay. Each of the route numbers is suffixed by the letter &#x27;n&#x27; to denote their night status.

Special (higher) fares apply on Nitelink buses than regular daytime bus services. On 2 September 2022 TFI announced that Nitelink fares across all 13 routes were being reduced with immediate effect; Leap fares by 33% and cash fares by 43%. Sorin Costica, Head of Operations at Dublin Bus said the reduction in fares would &quot;...help reduce night-time carbon emissions by encouraging people to take the bus as opposed to travelling by car.&quot;

===24-hour services===
In 2014, Dublin Bus began looking to expand their Nitelink network and also introduce a new dedicated all-night service in the city. By late 2016, Dublin Bus &#x27;Media and Communications Officer&#x27; Jennifer O&#x27;Brien stated that the company was looking at the possibility of introducing a 24-hour bus service in Dublin from 2017 in conjunction with the National Transport Authority on a phased basis. That same year, Dublin City Councillor Ciarán Cuffe (who also chaired the council&#x27;s transport committee) said Dublin needed to look at extending the public-transport service at night noting that the last regular bus left the city at around 11:30pm each weeknight and the last Luas at around half past twelve, or midnight on Sundays.

In December 2019, the first of Dublin&#x27;s 24-hour services were eventually rolled out. As of June 2023, the company operates ten such routes (which run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week), consisting of routes 15, 39a, 41, C1, C2, C5, C6, N4, G1 and G2. Speaking of the 24/7 buses, Dublin Bus have noted that &quot;They are some of our busiest routes, showing the clear appetite for all day and all-night bus services in Dublin.&quot; It has been noted, however, that the service frequency on some of the 24-hour routes at night is insufficient, leading to buses to become filled to capacity. The failure of scheduled buses showing up at night has also been flagged as an issue.

====15 and 41====
At midnight on 1 December 2019, routes 15 and 41 began operating on a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week basis with no difference in fare, marking the first time Dublin had a regular night bus service. These buses depart their terminals at intervals of 30 minutes between the hours of 11.30pm and 05:00am. Announcing the change, the NTA CEO Anne Graham explained &quot;The patterns of work and socialising have changed. For instance, the success in attracting to the city, major employers who are headquartered many time-zones away, serving markets around the world, means that commercial and economic activity in Dublin continues around the clock&quot;.

In June 2022, chief executive of Dublin Bus Ray Coyne told &#x27;Breakfast Business&#x27; on Newstalk radio that of the six 24-hour services the company was currently running, route number 15 was &quot;probably the most successful one&quot;. He added &quot;We&#x27;re looking to see if we can increase the frequency on those (six 24-hour services)... the demand is extremely high&quot;. Commenting on the 24-hour services in Sep 2022, Gary Kelly, Chief Inspector with Dublin Bus explained how they were a &quot;huge success&quot; witnessing a &quot;a big demand&quot;. He explained &quot;The 41 from Abbey Street to Swords will often be full at 4am in the morning with workers on their way to Dublin Airport and revellers heading home to Swords [..] That one was badly needed over the years. Two years ago, all those workers would have (had) to drive to the airport and pay for parking, or take a taxi. I can&#x27;t even imagine&quot;.

====39a====
Route 39a began 24-hour operation on 13 December 2020.

====C Spine (C1, C2, C5, C6) ====
On 28 November 2021 the National Transport Authority implemented Phase 2 of the rollout of its latest Dublin network with the C Spine, that consists of new C1-C4 routes serving the west of the city. The C1 and C2 services operate 24-hours a day, while the C3 and C4 buses turn into the C5 and C6, that operate through Chapelizod village instead of via the Chapelizod bypass at night. The night-time routes operate every hour, starting between 11:36pm and 00:35am every night of the week, and ending at 4am when normal services commence. Upon the introduction of the C Spine, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said that it &quot;provides the communities on its route not just increased frequency, but also a night service offering commuters 24-hour bus connections.&quot;

====N4====
As part of BusConnects Phase 3, the N4 (Blanchardstown Shopping Centre – Point Village via Collins Avenue), came into operation on 29 May 2022. The route was originally supposed to begin in January 2022 but was delayed due to driver shortages. Driver shortages would also delay the rollout of the G-Spine routes later in the year. Anne Graham, CEO of the NTA, stated that &quot;Today&#x27;s launch is one further step in the delivery of an effective and efficient bus service for the Dublin city region. The network is beginning to take shape and we are confident that this Phase will be just as successful as the previous ones.&quot;

====G Spine (G1, G2)====
Phase 4 consisting of the G-Spine of routes G1 and G2 (both 24-hour), and daytime route 60, was launched on 16 October 2022. The phase was originally planned to launch on 28 August 2022 but needed to be pushed back until October 2022 due to driver shortages. Route G1 runs from the Red Cow Luas stop to Spencer Dock via Ballyfermot and the city centre, and G2 operates much the same route but instead connects Liffey Valley Shopping Centre with Spencer Dock, via Ballyfermot and the city centre. Overnight, the G1 and G2 run every hour between 12pm and 5am. One week after the routes launched, Senator Mary Seery Kearney noted she had already received numerous complaints concerning the new routes, with instances of buses not turning up and buses being full. Seery Kearney explained she had contacted the Oireachtas Transport Committee to urgently seek a meeting to review the situation.

====Proposed developments====

In May 2022, Dublin Bus announced it was considering the expansion of a 24-hour service to include a route that serves Bray. In his submission to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, Ray Coyne (Chief Executive of Dublin Bus) said &quot;24/7 bus services are needed to deliver a truly all-day and all-night city [and] the broader economic needs of the city justify accelerating the introduction of 24/7 services on routes such as 46a, 155 and others&quot;.

In June 2022, Ray Coyne mentioned that Dublin Bus wanted to increase the frequency of buses operating on their six 24-hour routes. He particularly mentioned the success of the route 15, but added that &quot;demand is extremely high&quot; across all the night routes.

Speaking to &quot;TheJournal.ie&quot; in August 2022, a spokesperson for the Department of Transport noted that 24-hour services on the planned E-Spine, F-Spine and O-orbital routes set to start in 2023 are under consideration. The E and F routes are proposed to serve the Charlestown Shopping Centre and Northwood areas, the city centre, Bray and Dún Laoghaire. The O-orbital route are due to serve the North and South Circular Road areas. In addition, they noted that &quot;the NTA has indicated that there is potential for each of the spine groups to have at least one route running 24 hours, but final decisions will be made closer to the time of each rollout&quot;.

Dublin Bus&#x27;s official website includes an un-dated article named &quot;Working Together To Build a Truly 24-Hour Dublin&quot; which outlines their intention to introduce additional 24-hour routes to Dublin in advance of BusConnects&#x27; full implementation. Conscious of the fact that County Dublin&#x27;s population is set to reach two million by 2030, the company acknowledged that Dublin is at the cusp of a transformational era as it develops into a truly 24-hour city. The company noted the challenges facing commuters in post-COVID Dublin, but also the opportunities: &quot;Thousands of taxis have left the market. At the same time many new businesses are opening in our capital. Our hospitality sector is recovering strongly from the pandemic, and we are seeing the welcome return of large-scale events like concerts. So, we are confident that the customer demand is there for further 24-hour services&quot;.

In late September 2022, Transport for Ireland launched a campaign named &quot;Around the city, around the clock&quot; aimed at highlighting night-time bus services in Dublin in the run up to Christmas. Acting CEO of Dublin Bus, Andrea Keane, emphasised the economic importance of the service in 2022 noting that &quot;The night-time economy in Dublin is growing post-pandemic and the TFI Network is expanding to reflect that. Night-time commuters can now hop on Dublin Bus services to get home affordably&quot;.

==BusConnects==
As part of the National Transport Authority&#x27;s BusConnects network redesign project, in 2017 and 2018 a US-based consulting firm (Jarrett Walker + Associates) were employed to review and redesign the daytime bus network in and around Dublin. The purpose of the network redesign was to improve network functionality and increase bus ridership in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, an area which encompasses over 1.4 million people over several counties. It was noted that the traditional Dublin Bus network was good for many radial routes (i.e. taking people from the suburbs into the city core) but lacked orbital accessibility (i.e. getting from suburb to suburb). The initial network proposal was released for public consultation in summer 2018, and the revised proposal was released for public comment by October 2019. The NTA began implementing the new network in stages, starting in 2021. The company drew similarities between their proposed Dublin transport plan to that in place in Copenhagen, a city of comparable size and shape. As part of their contract, Jarrett Walker + Associates were not tasked with the expansion of 24-hour and night-time bus services in Dublin, as this was a separate decision taken by the NTA without their involvement.

On 27 June 2021, Phase 1 of the Bus Connects program was rolled out with routes 29a, 31/a/b and 32 being replaced by the &quot;H Spine&quot; routes H1, H2 and H3. Route 6 was also introduced to replace routes 31a and 31b in Howth. Increased frequency, particularly at weekends and earlier and later services, were also added with these changes.

Phase 2 of the BusConnects Network Redesign launched on 28 November 2021 in West Dublin and East Kildare. It involved the introduction of the C-Spine (C1, C2, C3, C4), route 52, eight peak-only routes (P29, X25, X26, X27, X28, X30, X31 and X32), six local routes (L51, L52, L53, L54, L58 and L59) and the two night-time routes of the C5 and C6. The Phase 2 routes are operated by Dublin Bus, with the exception of the L51 and L52 which are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. A number of old Dublin Bus routes were discontinued with the introduction of the redesign, including the 25 and 66.

Phase 3, consisting of the N4 and N6 north Dublin orbitals, came into effect on 29 May 2022. The N4 travels from Point Village to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre serving Killester, Whitehall, DCU, Finglas and Connolly Hospital. The N6 travels from Kilbarrack to Finglas Village, serving Coolock, Beaumont and Ballymun. There is a 10-minute frequency on both the N4 and N6 at most times on weekdays and Saturdays, with the addition of a 24-hour service on the Route N4, running every 30 minutes every night of the week.

Phase 4 consisting of the G-Spine of routes G1 and G2 (both 24-hour), and route 60, launched on 16 October 2022, replacing routes 79/a and the western branch of route 40, which was curtailed to Earlsfort Terrace.

Phase 5b of the programme was launched on 26 November 2023, consisting of new orbital routes, local routes, and radials, with the cessation of route 61 and the introduction of routes 74, L25, and S2.

Phase 6a introduced Route N2 on 29 September, operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. The rest of the phase was delayed from early December 2024 and actually commenced on 26 January 2025 with the introduction of the E Spine consisting of two 24 hour routes, the E1 and E2, as well as the radial route 19, and local routes L12 and L14. This phase also saw the cessation of routes 46a/e, 84/a, 145, 155 and the express 84x route. The northbound termini of routes 11, 4 and 13 were all changed in this phase alongside the new routes. Route 11 to Phoenix Park, route 4 to Heuston Station, and route 13 to Mountjoy Square

==Impact of COVID-19==
The COVID-19 pandemic led to the suspension of Airlink, Nitelink and some Xpresso services in March 2020; Airlink services were later permanently suspended five months later. With the easing of restrictions in January 2022, Dublin Bus announced all Nitelink services would return to normal from Friday 28 January 2022. The use of facemasks onboard became optional from Monday 28 February 2022.

==Route map==

Uniquely for a capital city&#x27;s primary transit network, no full system-wide street and route map is available online. Dublin Bus cites high licensing fees from fellow state-owned company, Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI). OSI historically published a printed street map, reissued every two to five years, which included bus routes. However, the edition published June 2011 omitted these for the first time.

Dublin Bus&#x27;s Core Route Map does, however, provide some visual information about key routes in the city.

Dublin Bus previously employed international design company &#x27;Applied&#x27;, and a Dublin consultancy, to assist in making its route maps more legible. The aim was to develop clearer route information, with the aim of improving access and encouraging the visitor economy.

==Fares==
In 2021, Dublin Bus fares migrated to a simplified system, with a short journey fare for journeys of up to three &quot;fare stages&quot; (roughly 2–3 km) and a normal fare for longer trips. Paying the normal fare using a TFI Leap Card allows free transfers to other Dublin Bus, Luas, and certain Iarnród Éireann services for a 90-minute period. Transfers are not available on paper tickets. Higher fares apply to limited-stop peak time Xpresso services (route numbers prefixed/suffixed with X) and to late-night Nitelink services (route numbers suffixed with N).

In general, Dublin Bus encourages prepaid or reloadable ticket use, and for cash payment it operates an &#x27;exact fare&#x27; policy. Passengers must place the exact fare in coins (notes are not accepted) in a &quot;fare box&quot; at the driver&#x27;s cabin, and the ticket is issued. In case of overpayment, no change is given and a system of issuing &#x27;refund due&#x27; receipts, which operated for many years, ended in September 2018.

The wide variety of pre-paid tickets historically issued for Dublin Bus services has been withdrawn over time. Fare capping applies to frequent use of the same Leap card within a day or calendar week (Monday to Sunday), and a &quot;rambler&quot; pack of five or 30 non-consecutive one-day unlimited travel can be purchased and loaded to a Leap card for a slight discount. Monthly and annual season tickets are also offered.

Prepaid tickets must be validated in a machine by the door of the bus at the start of each journey, although the validation process for leap cards differs depending on the distance being travelled and the ticket being used.

Old age pensioners and children aged five and under (as of 1 December 2017) are allowed to travel free of charge; this is part of the national &quot;Free Travel Pass&quot; system operated by the Department of Social Protection.

Passengers who choose not to pay a fare or who travel beyond the limit paid for may be issued a fine, called a &quot;standard fare&quot;, of €100

==Fleet==
As of November 2024, the fleet consisted of 1,122 buses.

Also, Dublin Bus has a fixed lifespan of 14 years for any bus. They are gradually phased out. Types of significance such as the GAC Ireland have been preserved by the National Transport Museum of Ireland who house R1 (the first Dublin United Tramways Leyland double-decker service bus in Dublin). Many ex-CIÉ and Dublin Bus types have been acquired by private preservationists, some of whom associated with the Transport Enthusiasts Club (TEC). The vehicles are garaged, restored and run by the owners without state funds and take part in films, television programs and in vintage rallies.
==Incidents==

===Christchurch===
In 1989, a youth grabbed the steering wheel of a Tallaght bound double decker as it turned the corner opposite Christchurch and the bus crashed onto its side. Multiple passengers were injured but none were seriously injured.

===Wellington Quay===
On 21 February 2004, at Wellington Quay, Dublin, a bus mounted on pavement and crashed into a queue of 30 people, killing five and injuring 14. The driver was tried for dangerous driving causing death. His trial began in February 2007 at Dublin Circuit Court, but he was acquitted.

===North Strand Road===

On 5 February 2009, a bus en route from Abbey Street to Artane collided with a tree on North Strand Road and the entire roof section was torn off. The driver was treated in hospital for shock but there were no other injuries as no passengers were seated in the upper deck.

===Dublin City Centre===
On 16 September 2009, a collision between a Red Line Luas tram and a number 16 Dublin Bus from Ballinteer to Dublin Airport in Dublin City Centre at the intersection of Abbey Street and O&#x27;Connell Street injured 21 people. Three people, including the Luas driver, were cut out of the wreckage. The Luas was derailed in the accident. Two female passengers remained trapped on the bus for up to 45 minutes after the crash.

===Smithfield===
On 16 March 2019, an out of service double-decker bus (VG1) collided with a tram at the junction at Queen Street near the Smithfield Luas stop. Several people were hospitalised with non-life-threatening injuries.

===Ballsbridge===
On 2 October 2020, a double-decker operating on route 7A was involved in a serious collision with a stolen car at the junction of Northumberland Road and Haddington Road in Ballsbridge, resulting in the bus hitting a tree. Eight people were hospitalised, with two bus passengers requiring intensive care.

===2023 Dublin riot===

On 23 November 2023, four Dublin Bus buses were hijacked and set on fire amid anti-immigrant unrest in Dublin city centre following a stabbing outside a primary school earlier in the day.

<text>TradeStation Group, Inc. is the parent company of online securities and futures brokerage firms and trading technology companies. It is headquartered in Plantation, Florida, and has offices in New York; Chicago; Richardson, Texas; London; Sydney; and Costa Rica. TradeStation is best known for the technical analysis software and electronic trading platform it provides to active traders and certain institutional trader markets. TradeStation Group was a Nasdaq GS-listed company from 1997 to 2011, until it was acquired by Monex Group, a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed parent company of one of Japan&#x27;s leading online securities brokerage firms.

==History==
TradeStation was founded by Cuban-born brothers William (Bill) and Rafael (Ralph) Cruz, who sought to create a way to design, test, optimize, and automate their own custom trading strategies. Bill started studying trading at the age of 16, and two years later, the brothers pooled $2,400 to open a futures trading account. They gathered trading data to create charts, which were used to test trading ideas. Bill began to test strategies himself without the benefit of formal coding knowledge, a process that resulted in the development of EasyLanguage, the company&#x27;s proprietary coding language for non-specialists.

Bill and Ralph decided to start their own company, then known as Omega Research. The brothers focused on selling tools that would give clients without a technical or computer programming background the ability to program and test their own trading strategies. In 1987, they released System Writer, a software product that enabled users to develop and “back-test” their own trading ideas using historical market data. In 1989, System Writer Plus was released with new and innovative charting features, which the publication Commodity Trader Consumer Reports likened to “the system trading software equivalent of putting a man on the moon.”

In 1991, Omega Research released TradeStation and, three years later, struck a licensing deal with Dow Jones Telerate to offer TradeStation as a premium service to Telerate&#x27;s institutional clients worldwide. In 1997, Omega Research conducted an IPO and became listed on the Nasdaq National Market. The company launched an online version of its product in 1999. In 2001, the company converted itself from a trading software company to an online securities brokerage and renamed itself “TradeStation”. The software&#x27;s back-testing, order-generation and trade execution capabilities were fully integrated for both securities and futures markets in 2003. In 2004 and 2005, TradeStation became a self-clearing equities and options firm. An entire industry eventually grew up around TradeStation&#x27;s software, including seminars, publications, and user networks.

* 1982 - company is formed under the name Omega Research, Inc.
* 1991 - TradeStation, the company&#x27;s flagship product, is launched.
* 1996 - OptionStation, an options trading analytics product that enables traders to explore complex options trading strategies, is launched.

* 2000 - TradeStation 6, the Internet-based trading platform that serves as the foundation of the company&#x27;s direct-access brokerage service, is launched; the company also acquires a direct-access securities brokerage, Onlinetrading.com, which is subsequently renamed TradeStation Securities, Inc.
* 2001 - TradeStation Group replaces Omega Research as publicly-traded Nasdaq company as a parent of two operating subsidiaries – TradeStation Securities, Inc. (formerly onlinetrading.com) and TradeStation Technologies, Inc. (formerly Omega Research); trading symbol on Nasdaq is changed from OMGA to TRAD.
* 2006 - TradeStation Europe Limited (now TradeStation International Ltd) receives approval from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as an introducing broker.
* 2011 - TradeStation Group is acquired by Japan&#x27;s Monex Group;

==TradeStation analysis and trading platform==
The TradeStation analysis and trading platform is a professional electronic trading platform for financial market traders. It provides extensive functionality for receiving real-time data, displaying charts, entering orders, and managing outstanding orders and market positions. Although it comes with a large number of pre-defined indicators, strategy components, and analysis tools, individuals can modify and customize existing indicators and strategies, as well as create their own indicators and strategies using TradeStation&#x27;s proprietary object-oriented EasyLanguage programming language. Traders can also access hundreds of TradeStation-compatible products created by independent third-party developers through the &quot;TradeStation TradingApp Store&quot;, as well as access strategy trading ideas submitted by the TradeStation community in the EasyLanguage Library.

TradeStation supports the development, testing, optimizing, and automation of all aspects of trading. Trading strategies can be back-tested and refined against historical data in simulated trading before being traded &quot;live&quot;. TradeStation can be used either as a research and testing tool or as a trading platform.

==Add-on products==
A large number of third-party developers develop TradeStation-compatible products. Since Tradestation is a development platform, a custom trading program can be developed called a trading system or trading strategy. If any trader has an analysis technique or potentially profitable strategy he would like to have developed, he can either write his own strategy in EasyLanguage or have his trading system developed by third-party developers. Traders can also take advantage of the &quot;TradeStation TradingApp Store&quot;, an online marketplace of ready-to-use add-on products built to run on the TradeStation platform by independent developers.

<text>Peter Martin Duncan FRS (20 April 1821 – 28 May 1891) was an English palaeontologist.

==Biography==
Duncan was born at Twickenham on 20 April 1821, his father, Peter King-Duncan, a descendant of an old Scottish family, being a leather merchant; his mother was daughter of Captain R. Martin, R.N., of Ilford, Essex. He received his earlier education first at the grammar school, Twickenham, next at Nyon, by the lake of Geneva, after which he was apprenticed in 1840 to a medical practitioner in London.

In 1842, Duncan entered on the medical side at King&#x27;s College, London, passing through it with distinction, and being elected an associate in 1849, after graduating as M.B. at the university of London in 1846. For a time he was assistant to Dr. Martin at Rochester, and in 1848 took a practice at Colchester. Here he was also active in municipal affairs, and in 1857 was elected mayor, holding the office for a second time. The natural history and archaeology of the district also greatly attracted him, and the arrangement of the town museum was largely his work. 
His first scientific paper, &quot;Observations on. the Pollen Tube,&quot; was published in 1856 in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the Edinburgh Botanical Society, but it was soon followed by others. In 1860 he removed to Blackheath, thus obtaining more time for science, and devoting himself especially to the study of corals.
More complete freedom was obtained by election to the professorship of geology at King&#x27;s College in 1870, of which he became a fellow in the following year, and shortly afterwards he was appointed professor of geology at Cooper&#x27;s Hill College. In 1877 he settled in London near Regent&#x27;s Park, residing there till 1883, when he removed to Gunnersbury.
Duncan became a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1849, was secretary from 1864 to 1870, and president 1876 to 1878, receiving the Wollaston Medal in 1881. He was president of the geological section of the British Association at the meeting in 1879; was also a fellow of the Zoological and the Linnean Societies, holding office in both, and an active member of the Microscopical Society, being president from 1881 to 1883. He was elected F.R.S. on 4 June 1868.
Duncan&#x27;s industry was so unflagging that he got through a great amount of work, of both a popular and a scientific character, besides lecturing and examining. He was editor of Cassell&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (6 vols. 1876-82), to which he contributed several important articles. He wrote a &quot;Primer of Physical Geography&quot; (1882) ; a small volume of biographies of botanists, geologists, and zoologists entitled &quot;Heroes of Science&quot; (1882) ; another on &quot;The Sea-shore&quot; (1879); and an &quot;Abstract of the Geology of India,&quot; 1875, which reached a third edition in 1881; besides contributing to various periodicals, assisting in preparing the third edition of Griffith and Henfrey&#x27;s &quot;Micrographic Dictionary&quot; (2 vols. 1875), and revising the fourth edition of Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Student&#x27;s Elements of Geology&quot; (1885).

His separate scientific papers are not less than a hundred in number, and his &#x27;Supplement&#x27; to the &quot;Tertiary and Secondary Corals&quot; forms a volume in the publications of the Palaeontographical Society. The &#x27;Tertiary Echinoidea of India&#x27; (of which he was joint author) appeared in &quot;Palæontologia Indica,&quot; 1882-6.
He made a special study of the corals and echinids, taking also much interest in the ophiurids, sponges, and protozoa, regarding all questions from the point of view not only of the philosophical zoologist, but also of one who applied the distribution of species to elucidate ancient physical geography. 
He described the fossil coral fauna of Malta, Java, Hindustan, Australia, Tasmania, and the West Indies, the echinids of Sind, and of other countries. The results of these researches were summed up in two very valuable papers, &#x27;Revision of the Madreporaria,&#x27; published by the Linnean Society in August 1884, and &#x27; Revision of the Genera and Great Groups of the Echinoidea,&#x27; published by the same society in 1889. Others papers on the &#x27;Physical Geology of Western Europe during Mesozoic and Camozoic Times, elucidated by the Coral Fauna,&#x27; on &#x27;The Formation of Land Masses&#x27;, and the remarkable paper &#x27;On Lakes and their Origin&#x27;, were also important contributions to science.
Duncan&#x27;s health began to fail about two years prior to his death, which closed a painful illness on 28 May 1891. 
He was buried in Chiswick churchyard.

==Family==
He was twice married: in 1851 to Jane Emily Cook, and in 1869, not long after her decease, to Mary Jane Emily Liddel Whitmarsh, who survived him with one son by her. Four sons and seven daughters by the first marriage also survived him. His son Francis became a zoologist, writing many popular works of natural history and making pioneering natural history films for producer Charles Urban in the 1900s.

<text>Beith (locally ) is a small town in the Garnock Valley, North Ayrshire, Scotland approximately south-west of Glasgow. The town is situated on the crest of a hill and was known originally as the &quot;&quot;Hill o&#x27; Beith&quot; (hill of the birches) after its &quot;Court Hill&quot;.

==History==
===Name===
Beith&#x27;s name is thought to emanate from Ogham, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Celtic Tree Alphabet&quot;&quot;, ascribing names of trees to individual letters. &quot;Beithe&quot; in Old Irish means &quot;Birch-tree&quot; (cognate to Latin &quot;betula&quot;). There is reason to believe that the whole of the district was covered with woods. The town of Beith itself was once known as &#x27;Hill of Beith&#x27; as this was the name of the feudal barony and was itself derived from the Court Hill near Hill of Beith Castle.

Alternatively, Beith may be derived from Cumbric &quot;*baɣeδ&quot;, &#x27;boar&#x27; (Welsh &quot;baedd&quot;). The local pronunciation of the name would favour this theory.

The Wood of Beit, now the &#x27;Moor of Beith&#x27;, has been identified as an Arthurian site where according to Taliessin in a poem under the name of &#x27;Canowan&#x27; it was the site of a &quot;battle in the wood of Beit at the close of the day.&quot;

===Saint Inan===
Beith is said to have been the occasional residence of Saint Inan, a confessor of some celebrity, whose principal place of abode was Irvine. He flourished about 839. Although he is said to have been a hermit, according to tradition Saint Inan often visited Beith, frequenting Cuff Hill with its Rocking Stone and various other prehistoric monuments. A cleft in the west-front of Lochlands Hill is still known as &quot;St. Inan&#x27;s Chair&quot; and said to have been used by the saint as a pulpit. An unsuccessful search for the saint&#x27;s writings which were said to be preserved in the library of Bonci, Archbishop of Pisa, was made by Colonel Mure of Caldwell in the 19th century.

Saint Inan is said to have preached to the assembled people from the chair on the hill. There was not a great population in the area at that time and the people were located not in Beith, but up on the top of the Bigholm near to the old Beith water dams. The first settlements were in the heavily wooded areas around the dams where people were safe from attack and could get food from the land, and fish in the lochs. The Saints of old went where the people were, and they also tended to go where there had been worship of heathen gods. It has been suggested that High Bogside Farm, which used to be called Bellsgrove, was really &quot;Baalsgrove&quot;, which fits in with the story of Saint Inan going to where the pagan gods were.

There is an annual civic fete held in the town bearing Saint Inan&#x27;s name.

===Alexander Montgomerie===
The sixteenth century poet Alexander Montgomerie was probably born in Hazelhead (now Hessilhead) Castle, which is on the outskirts of Beith, beyond Gateside. Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest of Middle Scots poets, and perhaps the greatest Scottish exponent of the sonnet form.

===Smugglers===
Beith has a historical connection to smuggling and built a reputation during the 18th century as being a town which harboured those whose intentions were not always lawful. In 1733 forty or fifty Beith smugglers sacked the Irvine Customs House, escaping with a rich booty of confiscated contraband goods and by 1789 a company of 76 soldiers were quartered in the town dealing with the continuing illicit trade in tea, tobacco, and spirits. This caused great inconvenience to the law-abiding citizens on whom the soldiers were billeted. The town was policed in this fashion for some time thereafter. Hence, the Main Street&#x27;s popular public house is still called the Smugglers Tavern, recalling the days when Beith&#x27;s location between the coast and Paisley and Glasgow, made it a convenient stopping off point for those involved in nefarious activities.

A possible relic of the smuggling days of Beith is the ley tunnel that is said to run from Eglinton Street to Kilbirnie Loch.

===Morrishill and James Montgomery===
Now a small housing estate, the house and land of Morrishill stood a short distance south of Beith. It commanded an excellent view and was well sheltered with trees. Owned by Robert Shedden, who purchased the land in 1748, it is notoriously linked to the case of James Montgomery.

James Montgomery, an enslaved African, was brought from Virginia to Beith by Shedden. He wanted Montgomery, then called &quot;Shanker&quot;, apprenticed to a joiner so that he would learn a skill and could then be sold for a large profit back in Virginia. James was trained in carpentry by Robert Morrice, husband of Shedden&#x27;s sister Elizabeth Montgomery. When &quot;Shanker&quot; was baptised in Beith Parish Church (by the Rev. John Witherspoon) with the name James Montgomery in April 1756, Shedden objected. Montgomery was dragged nearly to Port Glasgow behind horses to be taken back to Virginia but escaped to Edinburgh before the ship sailed. Montgomery sought justice but before a decision could be made by judges he died in Tolbooth Gaol.

===Rev. John Witherspoon===
A signatory of the American Declaration of Independence, the Rev. John Witherspoon, was a former minister of one its Church of Scotland parishes between 1745 and 1757. In 1745 he led the men of Beith to Glasgow to defend King George III against the Young Pretender in the &#x27;45 rebellion. Despite receiving orders to return to Beith, Witherspoon carried on, was captured at the Battle of Falkirk and imprisoned for a time in Doune Castle. He later emigrated and became a member of the US congress and in July 1776 he voted for the &quot;Resolution for Independence&quot;. In answer to an objection that the country was not yet ready for independence, according to tradition, he replied that it &quot;was not only ripe for the measure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.&quot; Witherspoon was also the sixth president of Princeton University and showed great commitment to liberal education and republican government. He died in 1794 on his farm that he had built&quot;Tusculum,&quot; just outside Princeton, and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery. –His direct descendants include actress Reese Witherspoon, and he is commemorated by statues in Washington D.C., at the University of the West of Scotland in Paisley, and a plaque, placed by DSDI in 2009 in Beith town centre.

===Robert Tannahill===
The Scottish Poet Robert Tannahill&#x27;s relatives lived at Boghall Farm near Gateside. His mother, Janet Pollock, came from Boghall although she spent much of her life at the home of her uncle, Hugh Brodie, who farmed at Langcroft at the foot of Calder Glen, near Lochwinnoch. Robert Tannahill (3 June 1774 - 17 May 1810), was known as the &#x27;Weaver Poet&#x27;, his music and poetry is contemporaneous with that of Robert Burns and they both died when relatively young.

===Henry Faulds===
Henry Faulds, the originator of the concept of forensic use of fingerprinting, was born in Beith in 1843. A well-travelled man, he explained the suitability of fingerprinting for the identification of criminals and also wrote to Charles Darwin to forward his ideas. The letter was never published and he died in 1930, aged 86, bitter at the lack of recognition he had received for his work. His work in Japan is remembered by a memorial stone in Tokyo. In 2007 a memorial was also placed in view in &quot;Woolstanton&quot; near to St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard, where he was laid to rest.

On 12 November 2004 a substantial memorial stone with interpretation plaques were dedicated to his memory in Beith town centre close to the site of the house in New Street where he was born.

===Robert Aitken===
Aitken was a land surveyor and cartographer who published in Beith a New Parish Atlas of Ayrshire in 1829.

==Industry==
===Textiles===
About the time of the Act of Union, trade in linen cloth was introduced to Beith, which became so considerable, that the Beith markets were frequented by merchants from the neighbouring towns every week. By the 1730s, the declining linen cloth business was being succeeded by considerable trade in linen yarn. Crawford Brothers, flax spinners and makers of linen thread and shoe thread opened in Crummock in 1775 and moved to a factory at Barr Farm, Barrmill in 1836. The factory changed hands, continuing in production as the English Sewing Company until 1946. Beith merchants purchased the yarn made in the local area, and sold it to Paisley and Glasgow manufacturers. The demand for the commodity encouraged local farmers to raise great quantities of flax, and the linen yarn trade peaked around 1760. The manufacture of silk gauze superseded both trades and, from 1777 to 1789, the number of looms in the town producing the gauze peaked at approximately 170.

===Furniture making===
From 1845 until the 1980s, Beith had the honour of being the most important furniture-manufacturing town in Scotland with a reputation for high-quality furniture. The origins of the industry can be traced back to Mathew Dale who started by making hand-built furniture for local people in 1845. A former employee of Dale, Matthew Pollock progressed the manufacturing by introducing machinery in a factory setting outside of the town at Beith North railway station. After approximately twelve years, Pollock and his brothers sold the factory to Robert Balfour, and moved into the town to expand their business. Balfour suffered the same problems as the Pollock Brothers in being unable to attract employees from the town willing to walk the to work. In 1872, he built a factory near the Beith Town railway station and persuaded the railway company to build a siding to allow easy transportation of raw materials and finished products.

The industry expanded across the local area making it a centre of excellence in furniture manufacturing, and building its reputation throughout the world. In the late-1920s, transportation switched away from the railway but the industry continued to burgeon with many companies producing high-quality furniture: Macneill Bros, specialised in board room and library fittings, Stevenson and Higgins made lift cages, which were fitted in many hotels and department stores, Balfours were for a number of years the main manufacturers of mantlepieces in Scotland, some were designed in the elegant style, and required the skill of expert woodcarvers. Matthew Pollock Ltd supplied furniture to both the and the . I am from beith and believe it was beithcraft who supplied furniture for the RMS Queen Elizabeth II

Furniture is no longer produced in Beith due to the closure of the various manufacturing firms. The closures were caused by a multitude of problems such as the economic downturn, and an inability to compete with self-assembly furniture firms and their increase in popularity. The last major furniture manufacturer to close was &quot;Beithcraft&quot; (formerly Balfours) which finished in 1983 (after a major fire a few years earlier, which destroyed large sections of the plant) with the loss of 420 jobs. With this final closure came the end of Beith&#x27;s reputation for being one of the main furniture manufacturers in the country.

This history of carpentry is remembered in the nickname of the local football team, Beith Juniors, who are commonly referred to as &quot;The Cabes&quot; (Cabinet Makers).

===DM Beith===
A large Defence Munitions (DM) centre is located between Beith and Barrmill. The site was originally developed in 1943 as a conventional Royal Naval Armaments Depot, munitions store, for the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence continues to maintain the armament depot, DM Beith, in the area.

As part of Ministry of Defence reorganisation plans in 2005, the 360 posts at DM-Beith were cut by 60. This was attributed to changes in the way equipment and supplies were stored and distributed, and it was hoped at the time, that it would reduce costs by £50m a year by 2010.

===Regional industries===
Historically in recent times, the major employers in the area were the Glengarnock Steelworks and the Linwood car manufacturing plant. Outwith the furniture industry, a large proportion of the local population were employed within these industries. At its peak, the local &quot;Steelworks&quot; had 3,000 employees, but by the time it closed in 1985 it had been reduced to 200. The Linwood car plant manufactured the Hillman Imp, a competitor to BMC&#x27;s Mini, and provided up to 9,000 jobs during peak production but was closed by Peugeot-Citroen in 1981. It has been estimated that 13,000 workers were left jobless in the region as both direct and indirect consequences of the Linwood closure.
==Beith today==
In 1966 a local survey estimated that 48% of the population worked outside the town whilst today the figure is more likely to be around 80%. The current population is around 6,000 helped by the completion of ten private housing estates dating from 1966 to the present and by redevelopment of sites within the town. The town has good transport links to Glasgow.

===Deprivation and regeneration===
North Ayrshire is ranked fifth highest in Scotland in terms of percentage of the population living in the most deprived areas. These areas have been targeted for regeneration by the local authority. This involves the targeting of activity and resources by the community planning partnership in relation to housing, crime, income, employment, health, skills and training and access to services.

A small area of Beith is one of three regeneration areas in the Garnock Valley. These are the smallest regeneration areas in Ayrshire. This is partly because rural deprivation tends to be less geographically concentrated than urban deprivation, and so it remains more hidden, being experienced by individuals and households rather than the larger communities. The area of Beith targeted for regeneration amounts to 359 households and 635 people (approximately 10% of the town&#x27;s population).
==Town landmarks==
===The Auld Kirk===

The Beith Auld Kirk began as a parish church in 1593. It was built in the form of a cross and was dedicated to Saint Inan. A bell tower and clock were added in 1800. The old bell still stands, and bears this inscription: &quot;&quot;This bell was given by Hew Montgomerie, sone of Hessilhead, anno 1614, and refounded by the Heritors of Beith, anno 1734&quot;″.
The kirk had been built in a rather precarious position on a cliff-side, and from 1807 to 1810 it was rebuilt a little further up the hill as the new Parish Church. The Heritors then moved the older portions of the Auld Kirk to the new one, leaving only the front door, the clock and the belfry.
There was not much left of the old kirk after that, and it came to be used as a burial ground for the Woodside family. Later on, however, it was closed for further burials and partly renovated, with the old high wall replaced by railings and paths dugs over the ground. Presently, there are no sepulchres of the old baronial families left standing, and the earliest graves date back only until 1710.

There are a number of memorials to the Spier and Dobie families within the grounds of the Auld Kirk, and also a memorial to Robert Patrick of Hazelhead (Inspector General of Army Hospitals). A sundial dating from the 1840s is also visible, and a stone coat of arms thought to originate from the Auld Kirk manse can be seen nearby, in Reform Street.

===The Townhouse===

Beith Townhouse was built by public subscription in 1817; the lower part of the building originally consisted of two shops, one of which was an ironmonger&#x27;s operated by George B. Inglis from 1862 until around 1900. There was also a small room where prisoners were kept prior to their appearance in the upper hall which was used as a JP Court, Sheriff Small Debt Circuit Court, meeting of the road trustees and as a public meeting room. It was also used as a public reading room. For the first twenty years the management of the Town House was in the hands of the JPs of Beith, Dalry, and Kilbirnie, the heritors of the parishes, the propietors of certain houses in Beith, and finally tenants of said houses within of the cross.

===Places of worship===
Beith hosts three &quot;listed&quot; 19th-century churches: Two Beith Parish Churches of the Church of Scotland, and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour.

The Trinity Church was built in 1883, designed by architect Robert Baldie. The chief external feature is a graceful octagonal tower. The interior was destroyed by fire in 1917, and rebuilt in 1926. Gothic style, with rectangular nave, Gothic arched chancel and one transept on the east side. The stained glass windows are by John C Hall &amp; Co. Organ 1937 by Hill, Norman &amp; Beard. The church is a category C listed building.

The Beith High Church was built in 1807 and extended in 1885. Gothic T-plan kirk dominated by the tall five-stage tower. Stained glass by Gordon Webster. Harrison &amp; Harrison pipe organ 1885. The High Church is a category B listed building.

Our Lady of Perpetual Succour RC Church was built with a churchyard, in 1816, to replace the 1761 building on a different site. Re-built in 1910, it became a Roman Catholic place of worship in 1921.

===Scapa Cottage===
Scapa Cottage is known locally as &quot;&quot;Dummy Cottage&quot;. The entire outside of the sandstone building is indented with marks giving it a most unusual appearance; in earlier years it was a Toll House. A deaf-and-dumb young man lived in the cottage in earlier times, hence the unfortunate acquired name &quot;Dummy Cottage&quot;&quot;.

== Local landmarks ==
===Kilbirnie Loch===

Kilbirnie Loch (NS 330 543), is in the floodplain of between Kilbirnie, Glengarnock and Beith, and runs south-west to north-east for almost , is about wide for the most part and has an area of roughly . The loch is fed mainly by the Maich Water and is drained by the Dubbs Water that runs into Castle Semple Loch. Early authors often use the term &quot;Garnoth&quot; or &quot;Garnott&quot; and may be referring to a single large loch incorporating Kilbirnie Loch and Loch Winnoch (Barr and Castle Semple Lochs). Boece in his book of 1527 the &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot; (History of the Scottish People), says that this one entity was &quot;nocht unlike the Loch Doune full of fische&quot;.

There is a long history of drainage schemes and farming operations in the Lochwinnoch area, with co-ordinated attempts dating from about 1691 by Lord Sempill, followed by Colonel McDowal of Castle Sempil in 1774, James Adams of Burnfoot, and by others. Until these drainage works Loch Winnoch and Kilbirnie Loch nearly met and often did during flooding, to the extent that, as stated, early writers such as Boece, Hollings and Petruccio Ubaldini regarded the lochs as one, using the name &quot;Garnoth&quot; or &quot;Garnott&quot;.
===Spier&#x27;s school===

Spier&#x27;s (pron. &quot;Speers&quot;) school stood on the Barmill Road near the old Marshalland Farm. It was built for Mrs Margaret Spier of the Marshalland and Cuff estate in 1887 to commemorate John Spier, her son, who had died at the age of 28, the last of her ten children. It was designed by Campbell Douglas. The school started as a fee paying day and boarding school, becoming part of the county education system in 1937. Following the construction of Garnock Academy, Spier&#x27;s school closed in 1973 and the buildings were demolished in 1984. Robert Spier and family lived in Beith at number 62 Eglinton Street, formerly Whang Street, and they unusually had their own private chapel in the grounds.

The of woodland and gardens remain a popular site for dog walkers, bird watchers, and those out to enjoy the rural surroundings. There are a number of memorials to the Spier&#x27;s family in the Auld Kirk grounds and in the local area.
The Spier&#x27;s family left a trust for providing financial help to those from the Garnock Valley pursuing further education. The Trust is a committee of North Ayrshire council. The trust committee decided in 2007 to investigate ways of making better use of the assets of the trust in particular the former school grounds and the council worked in partnership to set up a Friends of Spiers (FoS) organisation to develop ideas and seek funding. North Ayrshire Council was successful in an application to the Forestry Commission to provide funding for a footpath network around the woodland area.

===Geilsland House===

William Fulton Love, writer and bank agent in Beith, built Geilsland House and developed this small estate near Gateside in the 19th century although the deeds go back to the 17th century. Geilsland was a special school, run by the Church of Scotland as part of its &quot;CrossReach&quot; initiative.

===Crummock House===
This mansion house and estate stood on the outskirts of Beith in an area now cut through by the main Dalry to Glasgow road. Built for the Kerr family in the 18th century, Crummock was sold in 1815 to William Wilson, who added to the house and improved the grounds. James Dobie, the historian and author, and his family lived here from 1836. Now demolished and a housing estate built on the site, some boundary walls and a cottage remain. Historic stones which had been built into the kitchen garden were donated to the North Ayrshire Heritage Centre, including the arched stone known as the &quot;shrine&quot;. Images of these shrine stones can be viewed in &quot;The Gallery&quot; section below. A plaque remembering James Dobie resides in Beith Auld Kirk.

===The Court Hill===
The &quot;Court Hill&quot; is near Hill of Beith, below the site of Hill of Beith Castle, Gateside, in the old Barony of Beith. Dobie states that this is the moot hill on which the Abbot of Kilwinning used to administer justice to his vassals &amp; tenants. It is a sub-oval, flat-topped mound, situated at the foot of a small valley. A number of large stones are visible in the sides of the mound. It is turf-covered, probably situated on a low outcrop, and is mostly an artificial work. Pre-dating the channelling of the burn which detours around it, the mound was probably isolated in this once marshy outflow of the former Boghall Loch (see NS35SE 14).

In the 12th century the Barony of Beith was given to the Tironensian monks of Kilwinning Abbey by the wife of Sir Richard de Morville. The farm or Grange of the monks is indicated by the name Grange Hill and a castellated tower indicated as once existing in the area may have been the local dwelling of the Abbot of Kilwinning when he was visiting the barony to deliver justice at the &quot;Court Hill&quot; or attend to other business and later the local laird. No clearly undisputed remains have been found of the tower or grange buildings, however the New Statistical Account of 1845 written by the local minister, George Colville, states that the castle stood close to the Court Hill.

===Boghall Loch===

Loch Brand or Bran was the name by which Boghall Loch was formerly known. The loch, now almost completely drained, is the main source of the Powgree Burn and partly lay on the lands of Boghall. On or around the margin of the loch piles or stakes of oak or elm have been discovered and it is thought that these may be the remains of crannogs.

===Beith Rocking Stone===
The Beith Rocking Stone, sits on top of Cuff Hill. According to local folklore, Saint Inan frequented the stone. Legend states that the stone rocked from side to side on an unseen fulcrum, however this is no longer the case and the stone is now fully set into the ground. An article was published in Cumnock Chronicle in 1907 on the reason for the stone being dislodged. Signed by a Messer&#x27;s Robert Boyle &amp; Robert Currie.

===Willowyards (Angel&#x27;s Share fungus)===
The area surrounding Willowyards and its whisky bond are characterised by a black staining that covers all living and non-living surfaces to varying degrees. The research that first led to the scientific identification of the organism causing this black and velvety encrustation was partly carried out using samples from Willowyard. The organism causing what is commonly known as &#x27;Warehouse Staining&#x27;, is a black fungus, &quot;Baudoinia compniacensis&quot; which is harmless and feeds upon the &#x27;Angels&#x27;s Share&#x27; of alcohol evaporating from the whisky barrels.
==Demographics==
According to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011 Census estimates, 91.2 per cent of the 6,200 inhabitants of Beith were born in Scotland, with 6.9 per cent born in the United Kingdom, 0.8 per cent from other countries in the European Union and 1.2 per cent classified as other country.

The 2011 Scotland census reported 99.2 (6,156) per cent of people from Beith being White, 0.4 per cent are Asian, followed by mixed/multiple descent being 0.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent reported &quot;Other&quot; origins.

==Social and cultural life==
===Saint Inan&#x27;s Fete===
There is an annual celebration that parades through the town each summer. It normally commences outside the town&#x27;s Community Centre, going through the town and ending in the grounds of the Primary School for the Fete in the afternoon. A gala dance is normally held in the evening.

===Friends of Spiers (FoS)===

 This is a support group, affiliated to The Conservation Volunteers (TCV), which works with the Spier&#x27;s Trust, North Ayrshire Council Ranger Service &amp; Beith Cultural &amp; Heritage Society.

The first substantial signs of the regeneration of the site was the construction of the Spier&#x27;s Commemorative Wall, erected in 2010, resurfacing of the paths and roads within the site and the restoration of the Coronation Garden, completed in 2011.

===Youth Making Beith Better (YMBB)===
The YMBB youth group was set up by members of the community to give the young people of Beith and district an opportunity to involve themselves in improving their town and the surrounding area, whilst at the same time providing a forum for learning additional skills, sharing ideas and socialising with their peers. The group was closely involved with the Saint Inan&#x27;s parade and other local events.

YMBB met in the Beith Community Centre twice a week, supervised by adults from the NAC Youth Services. The YMBB committee included youth members, adults from the community and local councillors who assist in the overview of the group and with forward planning.

===Beith Theatre Group===
Beith Theatre Group began in 1990 and started out as Beith High Drama, as part of Beith High Church raising funds for roof repairs.

When Beith High Church and Beith Trinity Church joined in the late 2000s, Beith High Drama changed its name to Beith Amateur Dramatics, subsequently changing its name to Beith Theatre Group post Covid lockdown in 2022 to reflect the new direction the group has taken.

Beith Theatre Group performs for the community of Beith and the wider community of the Garnock Valley, producing two to three productions a year, all culminating to the widely anticipated annual pantomime performed at the end of the second week of December.

Beith Theatre Group is a charity run under the auspices of Beith Parish Church. It has its own Committee charged with the day-to-day management of the group.

It is a community based group bringing together many from across Ayrshire to perform light-hearted entertainment in Beith, in a safe, inclusive environment where all are encouraged to give it their all.

Beith Theatre Group meets twice weekly on a Wednesday evening and Sunday afternoon, any one above the age of 11 can join.

==Transport==

The town was once served by two railway stations: Beith North, commonly referred to as &quot;the Low station&quot;&quot; and Beith Town. Beith North closed in 1951 and the Beith Town station closed in 1962. The nearest railway station is just over away, at Glengarnock which provides direct rail links to Glasgow Central station and services to the Clyde coast and Glasgow Prestwick airport.

Beith is approximately south-west of Glasgow International Airport, north of Glasgow Prestwick airport and west of Edinburgh Airport.

==Leisure and sport==
===Football===
The local football club, Beith Juniors, formed in 1938 to succeed Beith who had played in the Scottish Football League in the 1920s. The team participate in the and play their home games at Bellsdale Park, which is famous for its &quot;slope&quot;. The club&#x27;s most famous former player is Steve Clarke, who went on to play for St Mirren and Chelsea, and has been the manager of West Bromwich Albion, Reading and Kilmarnock. He is the current manager of the Scotland national team.

===Beith Astro===

Beith Astro was generated through the enabling efforts of the Beith Trust. As a result of campaigning and lobbying throughout 2010, North Ayrshire Council committed £300,000 towards the refurbishment of the synthetic pitch in advance of the facilities coming under community management in April 2012. Beith Trust also enabled community ownership of two grass pitches, and changing pavilions.

Beith Astro is an eleven-a-side, full-size synthetic astro pitch now used by not only the trust and its affiliated community programmes and groups but also Beith Juniors Football Club and all twelve Beith Community Football Clubs.

===Rugby===
Beith&#x27;s only rugby football club, &quot;Old Spierians&quot; was amalgamated, along with &quot;Dalry High School FP&quot; into Garnock RFC in 1972 when &quot;Spier&#x27;s School&quot;, &quot;Dalry High&quot;, &quot;Kilbirnie Central&quot; and &quot;Beith Academy&quot; schools were closed to form &quot;Garnock Academy&quot;. The &quot;Old Spierians&quot; club had been founded in the early years of the 20th century and joined the Scottish Rugby Union in 1911. &quot;Garnock&quot; play their home games at &quot;Lochshore&quot; on the banks of Kilbirnie Loch and currently (2010) participate in the &quot;Scottish Hydro Premier League 3&quot;.

===Golf===
Beith also has its own 18-hole, 68-par golf course, in the Bigholm area just east of the town, a short walking distance from Saint Inan&#x27;s chair at Lochland&#x27;s Hill.

===Cinema===
The town&#x27;s &quot;George&quot; cinema was put up for sale in the autumn of 1982, but a surprisingly good run of E.T. over that Christmas period helped keep it open until the following summer. It finally closed on 25 June 1983 for conversion to a snooker club, although the building has since been demolished.

<doc id="497852" wikidata="Q1967458" url="?curid=497852" title="Planned obsolescence">
<text>In economics and industrial design, planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is the concept of policies planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life or a purposely frail design, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain predetermined period of time upon which it decrementally functions or suddenly ceases to function, or might be perceived as unfashionable. The rationale behind this strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as &quot;shortening the replacement cycle&quot;). It is the deliberate shortening of the lifespan of a product to force people to purchase functional replacements.

Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an oligopoly. Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the customer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them in the form of brand loyalty. In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an information asymmetry between the producer, who knows how long the product was designed to last, and the customer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase. For example, when Japanese vehicles with longer lifespans entered the American market in the 1960s and 1970s, American carmakers were forced to respond by building more durable products.

== History ==

In 1924, the American automobile market began reaching saturation point. To maintain unit sales, General Motors executive Alfred P. Sloan Jr. suggested annual model-year design changes to convince car owners to buy new replacements each year, with refreshed appearances headed by Harley Earl and the Art and Color Section. Although his concept was borrowed from the bicycle industry, its origin was often misattributed to Sloan. Sloan often used the term &quot;dynamic obsolescence&quot;, but critics coined the name of his strategy &quot;planned obsolescence&quot;.

This strategy had far-reaching effects on the automobile industry, product design field and eventually the whole American economy. The smaller players could not maintain the pace and expense of yearly re-styling. Henry Ford did not like the constant stream of model-year changes because he clung to an engineer&#x27;s notions of simplicity, economies of scale, and design integrity. GM surpassed Ford&#x27;s sales in 1931 and became the dominant company in the industry thereafter. The frequent design changes also made it necessary to use a body-on-frame structure rather than the lighter, but less easy to modify, unibody design used by most European automakers.

The origin of the phrase &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; goes back at least as far as 1932 with Bernard London&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence&quot;. The essence of London&#x27;s plan would have the government impose a legal obsolescence on personal-use items, to stimulate and perpetuate purchasing. However, the phrase was first popularized in 1954 by Brooks Stevens, an American industrial designer. Stevens was due to give a talk at an advertising conference in Minneapolis in 1954. Without giving it much thought, he used the term as the title of his talk. From that point on, &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; became Stevens&#x27; catchphrase. By his definition, planned obsolescence was &quot;Instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary.&quot;

The phrase was quickly taken up by others, but Stevens&#x27; definition was challenged. By the late 1950s, &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; had become a commonly used term for products designed to break easily or to quickly go out of style. In fact, the concept was so widely recognized that in 1959 Volkswagen mocked it in an advertising campaign. While acknowledging the widespread use of planned obsolescence among automobile manufacturers, Volkswagen pitched itself as an alternative. &quot;We do not believe in planned obsolescence&quot;, the ads suggested. &quot;We don&#x27;t change a car for the sake of change.&quot; In the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign by Doyle Dane Bernbach, one advert showed an almost blank page with the strapline &quot;No point in showing the 1962 Volkswagen, it still looks the same&quot;.

In 1960, cultural critic Vance Packard published &quot;The Waste Makers&quot;, promoted as an exposé of &quot;the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals&quot;. Packard divided planned obsolescence into two sub categories: obsolescence of desirability and obsolescence of function.

&quot;Obsolescence of desirability&quot;, also known as &quot;psychological obsolescence&quot;, referred to marketers&#x27; attempts to wear out a product in the owner&#x27;s mind. Packard quoted industrial designer George Nelson, who wrote:

Design ... is an attempt to make a contribution through change. When no contribution is made or can be made, the only process available for giving the illusion of change is &quot;styling&quot;!

== Variants ==

There are several variants of planned obsolescence. They are listed in the order of increasing severity:

===Contrived durability===
Contrived durability is a strategy of shortening the product lifetime before it is released onto the market, by designing it to deteriorate quickly. The design of all personal-use products includes an expected average lifetime permeating all stages of development. Thus, it must be decided early in the design of a complex product how long it should last so that each component can be made to those specifications. Due to natural degradation, most products will ultimately break down, no matter what steps are taken. Limited lifespan is only a sign of planned obsolescence if the limit is made artificially short.

The strategy of contrived durability is generally not prohibited by law, and manufacturers are free to set the durability level of their products. While often considered planned obsolescence, it is often argued as its own field of anti-customer practices.

A possible method of limiting a product&#x27;s durability is to use inferior materials in critical areas, or suboptimal component layouts which cause excessive wear. Using soft metal in screws and cheap plastic instead of metal in stress-bearing components will increase the speed at which a product will become inoperable through normal usage and make it prone to breakage from even minor forms of abnormal usage. For example, small, brittle plastic gears in toys are extremely prone to damage if the toy is played with roughly, which can easily destroy key functions of the toy and force the purchase of a replacement. The short life expectancy of smartphones and other handheld electronics is a result of constant usage, fragile batteries, and the ability to easily damage them.

==== Screens ====

Samsung AMOLED displays used in mobile phones have suboptimal ribbon cables that deteriorate over time, resulting in the screen turning completely white. Another point of failure is the degraded TFT layer which causes green or purple lines to appear on the display. Both issues can be triggered by a software update. They render the device unusable, requiring the user to repair or replace the display or to upgrade to a new device sooner than they had needed to. These issues are well known to the public thanks to Samsung&#x27;s own Galaxy S20 series of mobile phones.


====Batteries====
Throughout normal use, batteries lose their ability to store energy, output power, and maintain a stable terminal voltage, which impairs computing speeds and eventually leads to system outages in portable electronics.

Some portable products highly relied upon in the post-PC era, such as mobile phones, laptops, as well as electric toothbrushes, are designed in a way that denies end-users the ability to replace their batteries after those have worn down, therefore leaving an aging battery trapped inside the device, which limits the product lifespan to its shortest-lived component.

While such a design can help make the device thinner, it makes it difficult to replace the battery without sending the entire device away for repairs or purchasing an entirely new device. On a device with a sealed back cover, a manual battery replacement might induce permanent damage, including loss of water-resistance due to damages on the water-protecting seal, as well as risking serious, even irreparable damage to the phone&#x27;s main board as a result of having to pry the battery free from strong adhesive in proximity to delicate components. Some devices are even built so that the battery terminals are covered by the main board, requiring it to be riskily removed entirely before disconnecting the terminals.

The practice in phone design started with Apple&#x27;s iPhones and has now spread out to most other mobile phones with, as of 2022, the exception of Fairphone and Shiftphone offerings. Earlier mobile phones (including water-resistant ones) had back covers that could be opened by the user in order to replace the battery. On December 9, 2022, the EU Parliament reached an agreement to require, from 2026, manufacturers to design all electrical appliances sold in the EU (and not used predominantly in wet conditions) so that consumers can easily remove and replace batteries themselves.

===Prevention of repairs===

The ultimate examples of such design are single-use versions of traditionally durable goods, such as disposable cameras, where the customer must purchase entire new products after using them just once. Such products are often designed to be impossible to service; for example, a cheap throwaway digital watch may have a case which is sealed in the factory, with no designed ability for the user to access the interior without destroying the watch entirely. Manufacturers may make replacement parts either unavailable or so expensive that they make the product uneconomic to repair. For example, Canon and some HP inkjet printers incorporate a replaceable print head which eventually fails. However, the high cost of a replacement forces the owner to scrap the entire device.

Other products may also contain design features meant to frustrate repairs, such as Apple&#x27;s &quot;tamper-resistant&quot; pentalobe screws that cannot easily be removed with common personal-use tools, overuse of glue, as well as denying operation if any third-party component such as a replacement home button has been detected.

Front loading washing machines often have the drum bearinga critical and wear-prone mechanical component permanently molded into the wash drum, or even have a sealed outer drum, making it impossible to renew the bearings without replacing the entire drum. The cost of this repair may exceed the residual value of the appliance, forcing it to be scrapped.

Bosch, despite the up to 10-year availability of spare parts declared on websites, assembles in the popular MaxoMixx mixers an easily breaking plastic latch, refusing to sell the replacement latch to the user and instead proposing to replace the entire drive consisting of many elements as a single spare part, which is almost equivalent to buying a new device.

According to Kyle Wiens, co-founder of online repair community iFixit, a possible goal for such a design is to make the cost of repairs comparable to the replacement cost, or to prevent any form of servicing of the product at all. In 2012, Toshiba was criticized for issuing cease-and-desist letters to the owner of a website that hosted its copyrighted repair manuals, to the detriment of the independent and home repair market.

One way is that a store can sell a part which is incompatible with the products they sell on their own, so customers would try it and think their product is just broken, and then buy a whole new product. One example is that a ceiling fan pull chain The Home Depot or Lowe&#x27;s sell at their stores wouldn&#x27;t work out perfectly on most of the ceiling fans, including the ones they sell at their stores. The pull chain they sell is for a ceiling fan with a 3 speed motor and a single capacitor, which is rarely the case of ceiling fans sold today, and would cause ceiling fans with triple capacitor to not work well on medium and would cause ceiling fans with dual capacitor to not spin at all. 

===Systemic obsolescence===

Planned systemic obsolescence is caused either by the withdrawal of investment, or a product becoming obsolete through continuous development of the system in which it is used in such a way as to make continued use of the original product difficult. Common examples of planned systemic obsolescence include changing the design of screws or fasteners so that they cannot easily be operated on with existing tools, thereby frustrating maintenance. This may be intentionally designed obsolescence, a withdrawal of investment or standards being updated or superseded. For example, serial ports, parallel ports, and PS/2 ports have largely been supplanted or usurped by USB on newer PC motherboards since the 2000s.

===Programmed obsolescence===
In some cases, notification may be combined with deliberate artificial disabling of a functional product to prevent it from working, thus requiring the buyer to purchase a replacement. For example, inkjet printer manufacturers employ smart chips in their ink cartridges to prevent them from being used after a certain threshold (number of pages, time, etc.), even though the cartridge may still contain usable ink or could be refilled (with ink toners, up to 50 percent of the toner cartridge is often still full). This constitutes &quot;programmed obsolescence&quot;, in that there is no random component contributing to the decline in function.

In the Jackie Blennis v. HP class action suit, it was claimed that Hewlett-Packard designed certain inkjet printers and cartridges to shut down on an undisclosed expiration date, and at this point customers were prevented from using the ink that remained in the expired cartridge. HP denied these claims, but agreed to discontinue the use of certain messages, and to make certain changes to the disclosures on its website and packaging, as well as compensating affected customers with a total credit of up to $5,000,000 for future purchases from HP.

Samsung produces laser printers that are designed to stop working with a message about imaging drum replacing. There are some workarounds for users, for instance, that will more than double the life of the printer that has stopped with a message to replace the imaging drum.

In 2021, Canon disabled the scanning function of its Canon Pixma MG6320 all-in-one printers whenever an ink cartridge was out of ink. A class action lawsuit was filed by David Learcraft and his law firm Levi &amp; Korsinsky.

==== Software degradation and lock-out ====
Another example of programmed obsolescence is making older versions of software (e.g. Adobe Flash Player or YouTube&#x27;s Android application) deliberately unserviceable, even though they would still technically, albeit not economically, be able to function as intended.

Where older versions of software contain unpatched security vulnerabilities that could pose a threat, such as banking and payment apps, deliberate lock-out may be a risk-based response by the software vendor to prevent the proliferation of malware in those older versions by forcing users to update or upgrade their software. If the original vendor of the software is no longer in business, then disabling may occur by another software author as in the case of a web browser disabling a plugin. Otherwise, the vendor who owns a software ecosystem may disable an app that does not comply with a key policy or regulation, such as the format of processing of personal data to protect user privacy, though in other cases this does not exclude the possibility of &quot;security reasons&quot; being used for fearmongering, thereby forcing the user to upgrade. However, because some devices, despite being equipped with appropriate hardware, might not be able to support the newest update without modifications such as custom firmware, this could pose a severe inconvenience and undue stress upon the user. Additionally, updates to newer versions might have introduced undesirable side effects, such as removed features, compulsory changes, or backwards compatibility shortcomings which may be unsolicited and undesired by users.

Software companies sometimes deliberately drop support for older technologies as a calculated attempt to force users to purchase new products to replace those made obsolete. Most proprietary software will ultimately reach an end-of-life point at which the supplier will cease updates and support, usually when and because the cost of code maintenance, testing and support exceed the revenue generated from the old version. As free software and open source software can generally be updated and maintained at lower cost, the end of life date can be much later, and sustained through 3rd-party outsourcing and forking. Software that is abandoned by the manufacturer with regard to manufacturer support is sometimes called &quot;abandonware&quot;.

===Legal obsolescence===
&quot;Legal obsolescence&quot; refers to the undermining of product usability through legislation, as well as facilitating the purchase of a new product by offering benefits for upgrading.

Famously, the United States&#x27; Car Allowance Rebate System (popularly known as &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot;) offered government subsidies to encourage its citizens to upgrade to a newer, more fuel-efficient car when trading in their old ones in an attempt to stimulate economic growth during and following the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and the associated US automotive industry crisis. More recently, the United States has given a $7,500 federal tax credit to incentivize purchase of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles as continuation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) until a manufacturer has produced over 200,000 vehicles. However, this is likely to soon be repealed under Donald Trump&#x27;s administration.

Several cities such as London, Berlin, Paris, Antwerp and Brussels have introduced low-emission zones (LEZ) banning older diesel cars. Many European cities have also gone as far as to ban all emissions vehicles from city centers and instead rely on walking, quadricycles, or E-bikes.

== Alternatives ==

===Perceived obsolescence===
Obsolescence of desirability or stylistic obsolescence occurs when designers change the styling of products so trendsetting customers will purchase the latest styles. Although similar; it is a result of consumer perception rather than premeditated (planned) by the designer.

Many products are primarily desirable for aesthetic rather than functional reasons. An example of such a product is clothing. Such products experience a cycle of desirability referred to as a &quot;fashion cycle&quot;. By continuously introducing new aesthetics, and retargeting or discontinuing older designs, a manufacturer can &quot;ride the fashion cycle&quot;, allowing for constant sales despite the original products remaining fully functional. Sneakers are a popular fashion industry where this is prevalent—Nike&#x27;s Air Max line of running shoes is a prime example where a single model of shoe is often produced for years, but the color and material combination (&quot;colorway&quot;) is changed every few months, or different colorways are offered in different markets. This has the upshot of ensuring constant demand for the product, even though it remains fundamentally the same.

Motor vehicle platforms typically undergo a midlife facelift —a primarily cosmetic rather than an engineering change for the purpose of cost effectively increasing customer appeal by making previously manufactured versions of the same fundamental product less desirable, though sometimes these also introduce updated or new powertrains. The most simplistic way to achieve this outcome is to offer new paint colors, though most automakers will also update the interior and exterior design along it.

To a more limited extent this is also true of some personal-use electronic products, where manufacturers will release slightly updated products at regular intervals and emphasize their value as status symbols. The most notable example among technology products are Apple products. New colorways introduced with iterative &quot;S&quot; generation iPhones (e.g. the iPhone 6S&#x27;s &quot;Rose Gold&quot;) entice people into upgrading and distinguishes an otherwise identical-looking iPhone from the previous year&#x27;s model.

Some smartphone manufacturers release a marginally updated model every 5 or 6 months compared to the typical yearly cycle, leading to the perception that a one-year-old handset can be up to two generations old. A notable example is OnePlus, known for releasing T-series devices with upgraded specifications roughly 6 months after a major release device. Sony Mobile utilised a similar tactic with its Xperia Z-series smartphones, and Samsung usually releases a Fan Edition (FE) model of its Galaxy phone at the midlife cycle with some less important features omitted and at a lower price point. 

== Laws and regulations ==
===Europe ===
In 2015, the French National Assembly established a fine of up to €300,000 and jail terms of up to two years for manufacturers planning the failure of their products. The rule is relevant not only because of the sanctions that it establishes but also because it is the first time that a legislature recognized the existence of planned obsolescence. These techniques may include &quot;a deliberate introduction of a flaw, a weakness, a scheduled stop, a technical limitation, incompatibility or other obstacles for repair&quot;.

In 2015, as part of a larger movement against planned obsolescence across the European Union, France passed legislation requiring that appliance manufacturers and vendors declare the intended product lifespans, and to inform purchasers how long spare parts for a given product will be produced. From 2016, appliance manufacturers are required to repair or replace, free of charge, any defective product within two years from its original purchase date. This effectively creates a mandatory two-year warranty.

The European Union is also addressing the practice. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), an advisory body of the EU, announced in 2013 that it was studying &quot;a total ban on planned obsolescence&quot;. It said replacing products that are designed to stop working within two or three years of their purchase was a waste of energy and resources and generated pollution. The EESC organised a round table in Madrid in 2014 on &#x27;Best practices in the domain of built-in obsolescence and collaborative consumption&#x27; which called for sustainable consumption to be a customer right in EU legislation. Carlos Trias Pinto, president of the EESC&#x27;s Consultative Commission on Industrial Change supports &quot;the introduction of a labeling system which indicates the durability of a device, so the purchaser can choose whether they prefer to buy a cheap product or a more expensive, more durable product&quot;. In 2023, the EU voted to support a directive to ban planned obsolescene. In 2024, the EU Council clarified the liability of retailers with regard to information, unnecessary software upgrades and unjustified obligation to purchase replacement parts from the original manufacturer.

The UK adopted the &quot;Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products and Energy Information Regulations 2021&quot; in mid-2021.

=== North America ===
In June 2023, the Québécois Minister of Justice introduced &quot;Bill 29: An Act to protect consumers against planned obsolescence and to promote the durability, repairability and maintenance of goods&quot;, which proposed amendments to the Consumer Protection Act. Quebec adopted this Bill in October 2023, prohibiting the creation or sale of an item with planned obsolescence through any technique which would reduce its normal operating life.

In the US, planned obsolescence is being tackled through Right to Repair laws which have been enacted by several states, including California, Minnesota, New York and Colorado. This issue is mainly seen as one of intellectual property rights in areas such as electronics and software.

==Critics and supporters==
Shortening the replacement cycle has critics and supporters. Philip Kotler argues that: &quot;Much so-called planned obsolescence is the working of the competitive and technological forces in a free society - forces that lead to ever-improving goods and services.&quot;

Critics such as Vance Packard argues the process is wasteful and exploits customers. With psychological obsolescence, resources are used up making changes, often cosmetic changes, that are not of great value to the customer. Miles Park advocates new and collaborative approaches between the designer and the purchaser to challenge obsolescence in fast-moving sectors such as personal-use electronics. Some people, such as Ronny Balcaen, have proposed to create a new label to counter the diminishing quality of products due to the planned obsolescence technique.

The Environmental Law Institute writes that planned obsolescence &quot;contributes to a culture of wastefulness by perpetuating a &#x27;buy new and buy often&#x27; mentality and limiting consumer autonomy to keep products longer by hard-wiring a &#x27;self-destruct&#x27; button in products&quot;. Bisschop et al. (2022) have said that the practice limits the &quot;usable life of products to bolster private profit at the expense of consumer interests and environmental sustainability&quot;, stating it should be considered a corporate crime against the environment.

== In academia ==
Russell Jacoby, writing in the 1970s, observed that intellectual production has succumbed to the same pattern of planned obsolescence used by manufacturing enterprises to generate ever-renewed demand for their products.
