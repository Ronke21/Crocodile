<text>The Cypress Hills are a geographical region of hills in southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, Canada. The hills are part of the Missouri Coteau upland. The hills cover an area of approximately . About or 16% of this area is an interprovincial park.

The highest point in the Cypress Hills is at Head of the Mountain in Alberta at . The highest point in Saskatchewan is , in a farmer&#x27;s field in the Cypress Hills, at .

==Name==

The Cypress Hills have been known by a wide number of Indigenous and European names throughout their history. An 1882 Blackfoot–English dictionary written by C. M. Lanning provided the Blackfoot language name , which translates as &quot;striped earth&quot; or &quot;earth over earth&quot;. The Cree language name, in use at the same time, is , (spelled in a variety of anglicized forms including &quot;Mun-a-tuh-gow&quot;), sometimes said to mean &quot;beautiful upland&quot; but more accurately referring to &quot;an area to be respected, protected, taken care of and/or taken care with&quot;. The Assiniboine language name is . The Gros Ventre language name is &quot;&quot; &quot;pine trees&quot;. Early Métis hunters, who spoke Métis French, called the hills , in reference to the abundance of Lodgepole Pine trees. In the Canadian French spoken by the Métis, the pine is called , although it is not a true cypress tree. The English translation is Cypress Hills.

==Geology and geomorphology==
The Cypress Hills reach a maximum elevation of , rising about above the surrounding plains. This makes the Cypress Hills the highest point between the Rockies and Labrador They are the remnant of a more widespread plateau, most of which has been removed by erosion. The plateau is capped by the resistant conglomerate and sandstone beds of the Cypress Hills Formation. That formation was deposited by rivers that flowed from the mountains of southwestern Alberta and northwestern Montana during late Eocene to middle Miocene time, and is known for its wealth of vertebrate fossils.

During the Pleistocene, the top of the Cypress Hills was not overridden by the Laurentide Ice Sheet and remained unglaciated. As the ice sheet paused periodically during its final retreat, a series of morainal ridges of glacial till built up around the hills. Rivers of meltwater cut large channels through the area as the retreat continued, and smaller streams carved coulees and areas of badlands.

Today the Cypress Hills are part of a major drainage divide that separates rivers that drain south to the Gulf of Mexico via the Missouri River system from those that drain to northeast to Hudson Bay via the Nelson River system. At the Dividing Springs Ranch northwest of Eastend, Saskatchewan, the water from a spring goes both south to Gulf of Mexico and northeast to Hudson Bay.

==Ecology==

Due to their higher elevation, the upper slopes and summit of the Cypress Hills experience cooler temperatures and greater rainfall than the surrounding semi-arid plains, and they support a flora and fauna that is much like that of the mountains south of the Canada–United States border in Montana and Wyoming.

===Flora===
The north-facing slopes and some of the valleys host forests of aspen, lodgepole pine, and white spruce. The remainder of the area is covered by mixed grass prairie, with fescue prairie in higher areas. Wildflowers include prairie crocus, three-flowered avens, lupine, blue bells, and prairie rose. There are fourteen species of orchids, including the Venus&#x27;s slipper orchid and the striped coralroot orchid, which are found primarily in wooded areas and along the banks of springs and streams. Case studies have detected vegetation changes through woody plant encroachment, with an annual increase of shrub cover of 1 per cent.

===Fauna===
Small mammals of the area include a wide variety of rodents, as well as shrews, bats, jackrabbits, skunks, mink, weasels, foxes, bobcats, Canada lynx, and others. Large mammals include moose, elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, coyotes, cougars, and more. There are several species of snakes, including the prairie rattlesnake, as well as lizards and turtles. The many species of birds range from mountain bluebird and greater sage-grouse to the great horned owl and other birds of prey. Fish in Elkwater Lake and other lakes and streams in the area include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, several species of trout, and others.

==History==

Historically the Cypress Hills were a meeting and conflict area for various Native Americans and Indigenous Canadians (First Nations) including the Cree, Assiniboine, Atsina, Blackfoot Confederacy, Saulteaux, Sioux, Crow, and others. During the 19th century Métis settled in the hills, hunting and often wintering there. The Cypress Hills Massacre, a key event in Canadian history leading to the creation of the North-West Mounted Police, occurred in the hills when a group of American wolf hunters, known as wolfers, from Montana massacred an Assiniboine encampment. Fort Walsh was established to bring law and order to the Canada–United States border region.

== Interprovincial park ==

Cypress Hills Provincial Park – one of the six original provincial parks of Saskatchewan – was established in 1931. In 1951, it was extended into neighbouring Alberta. Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park was created in 1989, which joined the two parks on either side of the provincial border.

The Saskatchewan side of the park is divided into two blocks: Centre Block, which has fully developed year round tourist facilities, and West Block Wilderness area, with rustic camping and the location of Fort Walsh National Historic Site. Centre Block is located south of Maple Creek on Highway 21. West Block is located southwest of Maple Creek on Highway 271.

The Alberta portion of the Cypress Hills contains the tourist destination of Elkwater, a community with campground facilities located on the southern shore of Elkwater Lake. The townsite is mainly made up of summer cabins. Elkwater is located about southeast of Medicine Hat.

==Climate==
Cypress Hills has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) bordering on a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) due to its elevation above the surrounding area. Summer days are mild to warm coupled with cool nights, while winters are cold and snowy with annual snowfall averaging . It is also considerably more moist than the surrounding prairies. Precipitation peaks during the month of June, where thunderstorms are common. Chinook winds can raise the temperature in an hour, with it not being uncommon for the temperature to go from in a 12-hour period. The highest single day snowfall is which occurred on 28 May 1982. The highest snow depth recorded is on 28 February 1994. The highest temperature recorded is and occurred on 29 May 1988. The lowest temperature recorded is and occurred on 13 January 2005.

==In popular culture==
The Cypress Hills region is featured in Saskatchewan-based country singer Colter Wall&#x27;s 2022 single &quot;Cypress Hills and the Big Country&quot;.

<text>Fairfield University is a private Jesuit university in Fairfield, Connecticut. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1942. In 2023, the university had about 5,000 full-time undergraduate students and 1,200 graduate students, including full-time and part-time students. It offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees through its five schools and colleges.

==History==
In 1941, James H. Dolan, Provincial for the New England Province of the Society of Jesus, received written permission from Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe of the Hartford Archdiocese to establish a Jesuit high school and college in the southwestern area of Connecticut. Fairfield University was officially founded in 1942 when the Jesuits acquired the two contiguous estates of the Brewster Jennings and Walter Lashar families. Upon its founding, it became the 26th Jesuit college/university in the United States.

In the same year, Dolan appointed John J. McEleney as the first president of the Fairfield University of St. Robert Bellarmine and Vicar of the Fairfield College Preparatory School. In 1944, Dolan became the second president. During his tenure, the State of Connecticut chartered Fairfield University to grant degrees in 1945. In 1947, the College of Arts and Sciences admitted its first class of 303 male students. The State of Connecticut accredited the College of Arts and Sciences and the university held its first summer session of undergraduate courses in 1949.

In 1970, Fairfield became co-educational, admitting its first undergraduate class of women. In the same year, the School of Nursing, which is now part of the Marion Peckham Egan School of Nursing and Health Studies was formed, offering four year undergraduate programs.

The 1971 Supreme Court case &quot;Tilton vs. Richardson&quot; established an important legal precedent concerning the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and government financial assistance to religious-based colleges and universities. This landmark court case questioned the legality of Fairfield and three other Connecticut religious-based institutions securing federal construction grants under the &quot;Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963&quot;. An appeal by the plaintiffs was denied by the Supreme Court on June 28, 1971, ensuring Fairfield a significant amount of federal money which contributed to the construction of the Nyselius Library (1968) and Bannow Science Center (1971).

In 1978, the School of Business, now known as the Dolan School of Business, was established, as a separate and standalone school. Prior to this the Department of Business was part of the College of Arts and Sciences. At the same time, the school began offering its first graduate business degree program, a Master of Science in Financial Management.

Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J., was installed as the school&#x27;s seventh president in 1979. He has been Fairfield&#x27;s longest serving leader, presiding over the school for 25 years. During his tenure, the relatively young school enjoyed a period of expansive growth. This period saw the construction of dozens of new campus buildings, the addition of multiple new undergraduate and graduate degree programs, and an increase the institution&#x27;s endowment from under $2 million in 1979 to $131 million by 2003.

Under Kelley, the School of Engineering was formed after the acquisition of Bridgeport Engineering Institute in August 1994, offering both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The university was accepted as a member institution into Phi Beta Kappa in 1995.

In 2004, Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J. became the eighth president of the university, having served as an administrator at fellow Jesuit institutions in Georgetown University and Fordham University prior. That year von Arx launched the capital campaign, &quot;Our Promise: The Campaign for Fairfield University,&quot; which raised a then record of $137.9 million. The capital raised resulted in the construction and renovation of seven buildings, the creation of four new academic chairs, and the significant increase in the university&#x27;s endowment. In October 2006, the school opened the Aloysius P. Kelley. S.J. Center, named in honor of its longtime president. The building in the center of campus is an environmentally friendly welcoming center and administrative center.

After a twelve-year tenure, von Arx announced he would be leaving his position in 2016. A national search for his replacement followed, 
and on July 1, 2017, the school announced the appointment of Mark R. Nemec, who became the first lay president in the history of the university. Prior to Fairfield, Nemec was the Dean of the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies at the University of Chicago.

==Academics==
Fairfield University is composed of five schools and colleges: the Fairfield University College of Arts and Sciences, the Charles F. Dolan School of Business, the School of Engineering, the Marion Peckham Egan School of Nursing and Health Studies, and the School of Education and Human Development (formerly the Graduate School of Education and Allied Professions).

The university offers 43 majors and 19 minors for undergraduate students, as well as 41 different graduate programs. In 2016–17, the university awarded 930 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 367 master&#x27;s degrees, and 36 doctoral degrees. Since 1993, 65 Fairfield students have been awarded Fulbright Scholarships.

Academic and spiritual centers at the university include the Center for Faith and Public Life, the Center for Catholic Studies, the Center for Ignatian Spirituality, and the Carl and Dorothy Bennett Center for Judaic Studies.

Among undergraduates, the most popular majors ranked in order of popularity are Nursing, Finance, Marketing, Accounting, Communication, Psychology, Biology, and English. The current freshman retention rate is 90%, and the four year graduation rate among the most recent graduating class was 83%.

In the fall of 2017, the faculty to student ratio was 12:1. The average class size was 22 students and 80% of classes had under 30 students in them. There were 270 full-time and 319 part-time faculty members. Of the full-time faculty, 90% had a doctorate, 3% had a terminal master&#x27;s, and 7% had a master&#x27;s.

===Rankings===
* Ranked tied for 132rd overall for 2025 among &quot;National Universities&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, 45th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;, second for &quot;Most Innovative&quot;, and 131st for &quot;Best Value&quot; in the National category.
* For 2021, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Fairfield University 122nd among 614 Master&#x27;s universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.
* &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Fairfield 41st in its 2019 ranking of the 177 best value private universities in the United States.

===Undergraduate admissions===
According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Fairfield is deemed a &quot;More Selective&quot; university. The school accepts the Common Application for admission. In the Fall of 2010, the school moved to a &quot;test optional&quot; admissions policy but recommended scheduling an interview for students who do not submit standardized test scores. Approximately 90% of students receive some type of financial assistance. Fairfield has the lowest percentage of Pell Grant recipients of any college in the United States.

For fall 2019, Fairfield received 12,315 freshmen applications; 7,035 were admitted (57.1%), and 1,176 enrolled. The average GPA of the enrolled freshmen was 3.64, while the middle 50% range of composite SAT scores were 1220–1340, 610-670 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 600-680 for math. The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 26–30.

==Region and campus==
The Fairfield University campus area is a census-designated place (CDP); it first appeared as a CDP in the 2020 Census with a population of 2,884.

===Town of Fairfield===
Fairfield University is located in Fairfield, Connecticut, a coastal town along Long Island Sound. It is less than 60 miles from New York City and approximately 1 hour 20 minutes away by Metro-North Railroad. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 59,404. Fairfield is known for its historic downtown, and its beaches - Jennings and Penfield Beach - which are only a few miles from the university campus.

===Main campus===
Fairfield&#x27;s campus consists of 35 buildings anchored by the three manor homes of the original estates: Bellarmine Hall (1921), formerly the Lashar&#x27;s &#x27;Hearthstone Hall&#x27;, renamed to honor Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J; McAuliffe Hall (1896), originally O.G. Jennings&#x27; &#x27;Mailands&#x27;, renamed for Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe, who sanctioned the creation of Fairfield University; and David J. Dolan House, Lawrence Jenning&#x27;s &#x27;Larribee&#x27;, dedicated to honor the uncle of Charles F. Dolan who made the 1989 acquisition of Dolan Campus possible.

Bellarmine Hall, the main administration building on campus, is named in honor of Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J. Many of the classrooms and residence halls on the campus are named in honor of Jesuit priests. Behind each building name is a story of a Jesuit priest who was an exemplar of the Jesuit mission and their pursuit of educational and intellectual contributions, human rights, and social justice.

The Barone Campus Center (named in honor of university Provost and Chemistry Professor Dr. John Barone), is the home for student life including the Tully Dining Commons, the Oak Room, the Main Dining Hall, offices for FUSA, StagCard, WVOF, Residence Life, and Student Affairs.
Built in 1968, the DiMenna-Nyselius Library originally was named the Nyselius Library in honor of benefactors Gustav and Dagmar Nyselius. They were Swedish immigrants who had settled in Stamford and wanted to make a donation to Fairfield University. In 2001, the Library underwent a major renovation and expansion and was renamed the DiMenna-Nyselius Library in recognition of a donation from alumnus Joseph A. DiMenna, Jr. &#x27;80.

The campus is home to Fairfield College Preparatory School (Fairfield Prep), which is a 900-student all-male preparatory high school that has been aligned with the college since its founding in 1942. It is located at the southeastern corner of the campus, near the entrance on North Benson Road.

===Environmental sustainability===

In 2007, the university opened a $9.5 million combustion turbine-based combined heat and power plant on its campus with a capacity of 4.6 MW; the university was honored by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a 2010 Energy Star CHP Award for the project. 
In 2008, university president von Arx signed the American College &amp; University Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment, a high-visibility effort to address global warming by garnering institutional commitments to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions, and to accelerate the climate change mitigation efforts in research and education.

In 2011, a $12.5 million, 22,000-square-foot contemporary-style home for the Jesuit priests of Fairfield University (then numbering 22) was completed; the building is located near the center of campus and contains sustainable elements. In August 2009, Fairfield University became the first university in the United States to install Tomra UNO reverse vending machines (RVM), an all-in-one recycling machine for bottle deposits.

==Student life==

===Community service===
The goal of Jesuit education is &quot;homines pro aliis&quot;, &quot;men and women for others&quot;. As a result, Fairfield students are involved in many community service opportunities. Fairfield was among 119 colleges in the United States named to the Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement in 2008. The university was named to the 2009 and 2010 President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll by the Learn and Serve America Program of the Corporation for National and Community Service.

The Annual Hunger Clean Up is a one-day service-a-thon where the university community works at 40-plus local agency sites throughout Fairfield County and to raise money for local and national hunger and homelessness causes. The Fairfield chapter of Colleges Against Cancer hosts an annual American Cancer Society Relay for Life, an overnight event designed to spread awareness of cancer prevention, treatments and cures, celebrate cancer survivors and raise money for cancer research. The Adrienne Kirby Family Literacy Project, recognized as a model program by the Corporation for National and Community Service, involves about 175 Fairfield student-volunteers a year in providing individual tutoring to preschool children at the Action for Bridgeport Community Development&#x27;s Early Learning/Head Start Program.

Internationally, &#x27;Ignatian Solidarity Corps volunteers annually participate in two-week international service trips during their spring and winter breaks traveling to Ecuador, Mexico, Jamaica, Belize and Haiti. In 2004, Mikaela Conley &#x27;06 and Aamina Awan &#x27;07 founded The Afghan Children&#x27;s Project to raise awareness and funds for children who have suffered the effects of war, violence, and poverty in Afghanistan. Both were interviewed on CNN Daybreak in August 2005 for their work in funding the building of a water well for Aloudine, a small village outside Kabul. And in 2008, nine Fairfield students, inspired by 2006 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, started Sustainable Equity for Women, a micro-lending project designed to raise and invest money in small businesses run by women in developing countries in conjunction with
Kiva Microfunds.
===Fairfield University Student Association===
The Fairfield University Student Association (FUSA) is the official student association for full-time undergraduate students and is the largest student organization on campus. The association exists to represent student issues and concerns to the faculty and administration and to sponsor a multitude of student programs and activities. All full-time undergraduate students are members. The association is organized into three branches – legislative, executive, and the judiciary (FUSA Court). The legislative branch consists of the Student Senate, comprising 20 elected representatives (5 from each undergraduate class year). The executive branch is headed by the popularly elected President of FUSA, who serves as the official spokesperson for undergraduate students in addition to administering the student association on a daily basis. In 2002, Karen Donoghue &#x27;03 became the first woman elected President of FUSA. The FUSA President is assisted by a popularly elected vice president, elected class officers, and a number of other appointed officers, including the Director of Programming, the Director of the Club Operations and Student Organisations(COSO), the Director of Marketing &amp; Public Relations, the Director of the Treasury, and the Director of Diversity and Inclusion. The judicial branch, known as the FUSA Court, facilitates elections, serves as a hearing body in appeals, as well as performing the judicial functions required for the student association.

===Student activism===
A central tenet of a Jesuit education is the promotion of the values of peace and social justice. In 1988, 1989 and 1990, the Coalition for a Better World constructed &quot;Cardboard City&quot; and held a 36-hour vigil, and again in 2008, the Students for Social Justice constructed &quot;Homeless Village&quot; and hosted the &quot;Oxfam Hunger Banquet&quot; to raise awareness of the plight of the homeless in the United States. In 1999, students staged an 11-hour sit-in at the home of the university president and later a hunger strike to protest a contracting company used by the university that the students said was anti-union and paid janitors poorly. Each year, the Students for Social Justice travel to Columbus, Georgia for the annual School of the Americas Watch protest at a combat training school for Latin American soldiers now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. The date of the protest marks the anniversary of the murder of six Jesuit priests, their maid, and her daughter in El Salvador at the hands of soldiers trained at the School of the Americas. And in 2008, Fairfield for Peace NOW created &quot;Hope Trail&quot;, a pathway of flags around campus symbolizing the cost in life and casualties from the Iraq War, and &quot;A Cry For Peace&quot;, a play written and performed with Theatre Fairfield demonstrating the toll of the Iraq War on the families of soldiers back in the United States.

<text>The alb (from the Latin &quot;albus&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot;) is one of the liturgical vestments of Western Christianity. It is an ample white garment coming down to the ankles and is usually girdled with a cincture (a type of belt, sometimes of rope similar to the type used with a monastic habit, such as by Franciscans and Capuchins). It resembles the long, white linen tunic used by ancient Romans.

As a simple derivative of ordinary first-century clothing, the alb was adopted very early by Christians, and especially by the clergy for the Eucharistic liturgy. In early-medieval Europe secular clergy also normally wore the alb in non-liturgical contexts.

Nowadays, the alb is the common vestment for all ministers, both clerics and laypersons (acolytes and lectors), at Mass. It is worn over the cassock, but underneath any other special vestments, such as the stole, dalmatic or chasuble. If the alb does not completely cover the collar, an amice is often worn underneath the alb. Shortening of the alb has given rise to the surplice, and to its cousin the rochet, worn by canons and bishops. Following the Council of Trent (1545-1563), post-Tridentine albs often featured liturgical lace. Since then, this detail has fallen out of style, except in parts of the Anglo-Catholic movement and in some very traditional Arab Catholic parishes.

The alb corresponds to the Eastern Orthodox &quot;sticharion&quot;.

==Variants==
A chasuble-alb is a contemporary Eucharistic vestment that combines features of the chasuble and alb. In the Roman Catholic Church, it was first adopted in France, though without official approval. In France it is no longer fashionable, but it has been officially approved in some tropical countries such as the Philippines, and in Hawaii in the United States. It is always white in colour. A stole of the colour appointed for the Mass of the day is worn outside it, in place of the normal white alb and coloured chasuble.

A cassock-alb is a vestment that combines features of the cassock and alb. It developed as a more convenient undergarment worn by clergy and as an alternative to the alb for deacons and acolytes.

<text>Leon Jerry &quot;Jack&quot; Guthrie (November 13, 1915 – January 15, 1948) was an American songwriter and performer whose rewritten version of the Woody Guthrie song &quot;Oklahoma Hills&quot; was a hit in 1945. The two musicians were cousins.

== Early life ==
Born in Olive, Oklahoma, Guthrie was a cousin of Woody Guthrie. He grew up around horses and musical instruments before the family moved to California in the mid-1930s, where he took on the nicknames &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, and &quot;Oke&quot;. He competed in rodeo as a bucking-horse rider and in 1937 traveled with Woody to Los Angeles where they landed on &quot;The Oke &amp; Woody Show&quot; on KFVD radio in Hollywood.

== Career ==
Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;Oklahoma Hills&quot; (Capitol 201) reached No. 1 in 1945, staying on the charts for 19 weeks. The b side, &quot;I&#x27;m A Brandin&#x27; My Darlin&#x27; With My Heart&quot;, reached No. 5 later that year. At the time the record became a hit Jack Guthrie was in the U.S. Army and stationed in the Pacific Theater. As soon as he got out of the service he wrote and recorded more songs, played live gigs up and down the West Coast. In July 1947 he was admitted to a hospital with tuberculosis. He died in 1948 in Livermore, California.

Guthrie&#x27;s style was influenced by Jimmie Rodgers and adapted to fit his cowboy image. Although the labels listed &#x27;Jack Guthrie &amp; His Oklahomans&#x27; as the artist, in reality Guthrie had no working band. The studio brought in some of its better musicians to back Guthrie. Many of them, like Porky Freeman, Red Murrell, Cliffie Stone, and Billy Hughes were recording artists in their own right.

<doc id="493716" wikidata="Q1138877" url="?curid=493716" title="Cranial electrotherapy stimulation">
<text>Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a form of neurostimulation that delivers a small, pulsed, alternating current via electrodes on the head. CES is used with the intention of treating a variety of conditions such as anxiety, depression and insomnia. CES has been suggested as a possible treatment for headaches, fibromyalgia, smoking cessation, and opiate withdrawal, but there is little evidence of effectiveness for many of these conditions and the evidence for use in acute depression is not sufficient to justify it.

==Medical uses==
A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether or not CES with alternating current is safe and effective for treating depression. The FDA came to the same conclusion in December 2019.

A 2018 systematic review found that evidence is insufficient that CES has clinically important effects on fibromyalgia, headache, neuromusculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint pain, depression, or insomnia; low-strength evidence suggests modest benefit in patients with anxiety and depression.

==Description==
Electrodes are placed on the earlobes, maxilla-occipital junction, mastoid processes or temples.

Despite the long history of CES, its underlying principles and mechanisms are still not clear.

CES stimulation of 1 mA (milliampere) has shown to reach the thalamic area at a radius of 13.30 mm. CES has shown to induce changes in the electroencephalogram, increasing alpha relative power and decreasing relative power in delta and beta frequencies.

CES has also shown to reach cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, in electromagnetic tomography and functional MRI studies. CES treatments have been found to induce changes in neurohormones and neurotransmitters that have been implicated in psychiatric disorders: substantial increases in beta endorphins, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and serotonin; moderate increases in melatonin and norepinephrine, modest or unquantified increases in cholinesterase, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and dehydroepiandrosterone, and moderate reductions in cortisol.

==History==
Low intensity electrical stimulation is believed to have originated in the studies of galvanic currents in humans and animals as conducted by Giovanni Aldini, Alessandro Volta and others in the 18th century. Aldini had experimented with galvanic head current as early as 1794 (upon himself) and reported the successful treatment of patients with melancholia using direct low-intensity currents in 1804.

CES was initially studied for insomnia and called electrosleep therapy; it is also known as cranial-electro stimulation and transcranial electrotherapy.

Due to the rise of pharmaceutical treatments for depression, anxiety and insomnia, such as Prozac in the 1980s and Ambien in the 1990s, CES was not a well-known treatment for doctors and patients. During the mid-2000s, the combination of pharmaceutical brands becoming generic and Internet advertising caused CES devices to gain popularity. In 2011, the devices received media attention from the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==Regulation==
In the United States, CES technology is classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class III medical device and must be dispensed by or on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioner, i.e., a physician, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, psychologist, physician assistant, or occupational therapist who has an appropriate electrotherapy license, dependent upon state regulations. The United States requires a prescription for CES devices from a licensed healthcare practitioner. The FDA says that there are 11 CES devices cleared for marketing in the United States.

In June 2014, the FDA announced that it &quot;has determined that there is sufficient information to establish special controls, and that these special controls, together with general controls, will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for CES devices. In this action, FDA is withdrawing the proposed rule and proposed order to call for PMAs [premarket approvals] for CES devices. FDA plans to issue a proposed order in the future for the reclassification of the CES device into class II.&quot;

In December 2019, the FDA announced that there is no valid evidence for CES as a treatment for depression, and request new trials to be made. &quot;FDA concluded that the four studies published after January 1, 2016, through November 1, 2019, did not contribute sufficient information in the form of valid scientific evidence to demonstrate that the subjects met the criteria for any recognized depressive disorder, as defined in DSM-5&quot;

<doc id="493717" wikidata="Q7378221" url="?curid=493717" title="Rugby League War of the Roses">
<text>The War of the Roses (also known in its later years as the County of Origin Series) was the annual inter-county rugby league match between Lancashire and Yorkshire. The fixture began in 1895 as part of the County Championship until 1983, and continued as a stand-alone fixture until 2003 when the game was last play.

==History==
Lancashire and Yorkshire first began contesting rugby league fixture in 1895 – the year of the sport&#x27;s creation. The games were played as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Inter-County Championship, a competition played every year with exceptions for the two world wars (1914–1918 and 1939–1945) and 1977–1978, until the competition was abandoned in 1983. During this time, the fixture became known as the &quot;War of the Roses&quot;. Eligibility to play was established either by county of birth or in which county players had originally played the sport professionally.

The Lancashire vs Yorkshire fixture was often the most popular and highest attended, reflecting the sport&#x27;s higher popularity in these two counties. As a result, the fixture returned to the British rugby league calendar as a stand-alone match in 1985 and was sponsored by Rodstock. The series lasted until 1991, when it was scrapped due to lack of interest.

In 2001, the fixture was revived under the name of the &quot;County of Origin&quot; series, inspired by the success of Australia&#x27;s State of Origin series between New South Wales and Queensland. After three years, the Origin series games were discontinued due to a failure to attract high match attendances.

The War of the Roses fixture was proposed for a return for a mid-season clash in 2025. The clubs decided not to go ahead with a fixture in 2025 but would consider re-introducing the fixture in 2026.

==Results==
The two teams have met in 91 competitive matches with each team having won 44 and three games ending in draws. In addition there have been a number of exhibition matches during the First and Second World Wars when the County Championship was suspended.

==Women&#x27;s Roses==
===Foundations===

In 2014, a pilot County Origin game between Lancashire Ladies and Yorkshire Ladies was held in Wigan. The trophy was won by Lancashire. The following year, the RFL announced that the 2015 County Origin Series would take place at Thatto Heath Crusaders, St. Helens, with the competition being played as an annual fixture until 2020 with the exception of 2017.

The 2015 game saw the sides share the honours after a 22–22 draw, with an attendance of around 500. The match, held on 18 October 2015, followed a Lancashire Girls vs Yorkshire Girls under 18s match, which finished 34–0 in favour of the Yorkshire side.

====Results====
===England selection===
The series ceased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The County of Origin fixture returned in 2024 ahead of England&#x27;s mid-season friendly again France. England head coach, Stuart Barlow, selected Lancashire and Yorkshire squads and ran regional training sessions with each culminating in the Origin fixture a week before the England fixture. Match day performances in Origin, and performances in regional training were used to selected the national squad going into the final of England training. The same process was used for England&#x27;s post-season friendly against Wales.

<doc id="493720" wikidata="Q3503790" url="?curid=493720" title="Basilar membrane">
<text>The basilar membrane is a stiff structural element within the cochlea of the inner ear which separates two liquid-filled tubes that run along the coil of the cochlea, the scala media and the scala tympani. The basilar membrane moves up and down in response to incoming sound waves, which are converted to traveling waves on the basilar membrane. 

== Structure ==
The basilar membrane is a pseudo-resonant structure that, like the strings on an instrument, varies in width and stiffness. But unlike the parallel strings of a guitar, the basilar membrane is not a discrete set of resonant structures, but a single structure with varying width, stiffness, mass, damping, and duct dimensions along its length. The motion of the basilar membrane is generally described as a traveling wave.

The properties of the membrane at a given point along its length determine its characteristic frequency (CF), the frequency at which it is most sensitive to sound vibrations. The basilar membrane is widest (0.42–0.65 mm) and least stiff at the apex of the cochlea, and narrowest (0.08–0.16 mm) and stiffest at the base (near the round and oval windows). High-frequency sounds localize near the base of the cochlea, while low-frequency sounds localize near the apex. This is because the resonant frequency of the membrane depends on its own width and stiffness, not on the diameter of the cochlea at each point.

== Function ==

=== Endolymph/perilymph separation ===

Along with the vestibular membrane, several tissues held by the basilar membrane segregate the fluids of the endolymph and perilymph, such as the inner and outer sulcus cells (shown in yellow) and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti (shown in magenta). For the organ of Corti, the basilar membrane is permeable to perilymph. Here the border between endolymph and perilymph occurs at the reticular lamina, the endolymph side of the organ of Corti.

===A &quot;base&quot; for the sensory cells===

The basilar membrane is also the &quot;base&quot; for the hair cells. This function is present in all land vertebrates. Due to its location, the basilar membrane places the hair cells adjacent to both the endolymph and the perilymph, which is a precondition of hair cell function.

===Frequency dispersion===

A third, evolutionarily younger, function of the basilar membrane is strongly developed in the cochlea of most mammalian species and weakly developed in some bird species: the dispersion of incoming sound waves to separate frequencies spatially. In brief, the membrane is tapered and it is stiffer at one end than at the other. Furthermore, sound waves travelling to the &quot;floppier&quot; end of the basilar membrane have to travel through a longer fluid column than sound waves travelling to the nearer, stiffer end. Each part of the basilar membrane, together with the surrounding fluid, can therefore be thought of as a &quot;mass-spring&quot; system with different resonant properties: high stiffness and low mass, hence high resonant frequencies at the near (base) end, and low stiffness and high mass, hence low resonant frequencies, at the far (apex) end. This causes sound input of a certain frequency to vibrate some locations of the membrane more than other locations. The distribution of frequencies to places is called the tonotopic organization of cochlea. 

Sound-driven vibrations travel as waves along this membrane, along which, in humans, lie about 3,500 inner hair cells spaced in a single row. Each cell is attached to a tiny triangular frame. The &#x27;hairs&#x27; are minute processes on the end of the cell, which are very sensitive to movement. When the vibration of the membrane rocks the triangular frames, the hairs on the cells are repeatedly displaced, and that produces streams of corresponding pulses in the nerve fibers, which are transmitted to the auditory pathway. The outer hair cells feed back energy to amplify the traveling wave, by up to 65 dB at some locations. In the membrane of the outer hair cells there are motor proteins associated with the membrane. Those proteins are activated by sound-induced receptor potentials as the basilar membrane moves up and down. These motor proteins can amplify the movement, causing the basilar membrane to move a little bit more, amplifying the traveling wave. Consequently, the inner hair cells get more displacement of their cilia and move a little bit more and get more information than they would in a passive cochlea.

=== Generating receptor potential ===

The movement of the basilar membrane causes hair cell stereocilia movement. The hair cells are attached to the basilar membrane, and with the moving of the basilar membrane, the tectorial membrane and the hair cells are also moving, with the stereocilia bending with the relative motion of the tectorial membrane. This can cause opening and closing of the mechanically gated potassium channels on the cilia of the hair cell. The cilia of the hair cell are in the endolymph. Unlike the normal cellular solution, low concentration of potassium and high of sodium, the endolymph is high concentration of potassium and low of sodium. And it is isolated, which means it does not have a resting potential of −70mV comparing with other normal cells, but rather maintains a potential about +80mV. However, the base of the hair cell is in the perilymph, with a 0 mV potential. This leads to the hair cell have a resting potential of -45 mV. As the basilar membrane moves upward, the cilia move in the direction causing opening of the mechanically gated potassium channel. The influx of potassium ions leads to depolarization. On the contrary, the cilia move the other way as the basilar membrane moves down, closing more mechanically gated potassium channels and leading to hyperpolarization. Depolarization will open the voltage gated calcium channel, releasing neurotransmitter (glutamate) at the nerve ending, acting on the spiral ganglion cell, the primary auditory neurons, making them more likely to spike. Hyperpolarization causes less calcium influx, thus less neurotransmitter release, and a reduced probability of spiral ganglion cell spiking.

<doc id="493721" wikidata="Q1849502" url="?curid=493721" title="Humeral veil">
<text>The humeral veil is one of the liturgical vestments of the Roman Rite, also used in some Anglican and Lutheran churches. It consists of a piece of cloth about long and wide draped over the shoulders and down the front, normally of silk or cloth of gold. At the ends there are sometimes pockets in the back for hands to go into so that the wearer can hold items without touching them with the hands.

There is no clarity on when the humeral veil first appeared, though it was certainly in use in the continental Tridentine Rite and in other pre-Reformation usages including the Sarum Rite.

The humeral veil is of the liturgical colour of the day on which it is used, or else is white or cloth of gold.

The humeral veil is most often seen during the liturgy of Exposition and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. When priests or deacons bless the people with the monstrance, they cover their hands with the ends of the veil so that their hands do not touch the monstrance as a mark of respect for the sacred vessel and as an indication that it is Jesus present in the Eucharistic species who blesses the people and not the minister.
The humeral veil is also seen at the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper of the Catholic Church. It is used when the Ciborium containing the Blessed Sacrament is taken in procession to the place of reposition, and again when it is brought back to the altar without solemnity during the Good Friday service. The ritual for Requiem masses does not require the use of a humeral veil. The exception to this is the Dominican Rite which has a number of distinctive liturgical customs.

In the High Mass form of Tridentine Mass, the subdeacon uses a humeral veil when carrying the chalice, paten, or other sacred vessels, which should be touched only by a deacon or another man in major orders.

There are several ways to fold the humeral veil; it can be folded so that each side is folded individually like an accordion (with the folds either on top of the center or underneath the center of the humeral veil), or it can be folded by folding both sides simultaneously in an accordion style (after offsetting one side).

The humeral veil should not be confused with the vimpa, which is of a similar but narrower design. The vimpa is sometimes used when a bishop celebrates Mass. In the Roman Rite, if the bishop uses a mitre and crosier, the altar servers assigned to the task of holding those items cover their hands with the vimpa when holding them, symbolizing that the items do not belong to them. The vimpa may be in the color of the day or alternatively of a simple material in white or green.

In Imperial Roman court ceremonial, a similar veil, or sudarium, was used by attendants approaching the Emperor to cover their hands, presumably in case he handed them something. In art, angels adjacent to Christ often have such a cloth in Late Antique and Early Medieval art.

<doc id="493722" wikidata="Q715566" url="?curid=493722" title="Ray Bourque">
<text>Raymond Jean Bourque (born December 28, 1960) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He holds records for most career goals, assists, and points by a defenceman in the National Hockey League (NHL). He won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best defenceman five times, while finishing second for that trophy a further six times. He also twice finished second in the voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy, a rarity for a defenceman. He was named to the end-of-season All-Star teams 19 times, 13 on the first-team and six on the second-team.

Bourque was also an Olympian with Canada and became nearly synonymous with the Boston Bruins franchise, for which he played 21 seasons and became Boston&#x27;s longest-serving captain. Bourque finished his career with the Colorado Avalanche, with whom he won his only Stanley Cup championship in his final NHL game. In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players.

==Early life==
Bourque was born in Saint-Laurent, Quebec, the son of Raymond Bourque Sr. and Anita Allain. Both of his parents were originally from New Brunswick, and moved to Montreal in the 1950s. His mother died from cancer when he was 12 years old, while his father died in 2009. Bourque was raised bilingual, speaking both English and French at home, though he went to a French school.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Bourque was the third-round pick of the Trois-Rivières Draveurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL; now known as the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League). Halfway through his rookie season, head coach and general manager (GM) Michel Bergeron traded Bourque to Sorel for high-scoring Benoît Gosselin. After a stellar junior career with Sorel and Verdun of the QMJHL, in which he was named the league&#x27;s best defenceman in 1978 and 1979, Bourque was drafted eighth overall by the Bruins in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, with a first-round draft choice obtained from the Los Angeles Kings in a 1977 trade for goaltender Ron Grahame. Boston GM Harry Sinden had intended to select defenceman Keith Brown, but Brown was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks immediately prior to Boston&#x27;s selection. Panicking, the Bruins settled on Bourque, allegedly against their better judgment.

===Boston Bruins===

Bourque made an immediate impact in Boston during his rookie season of 1979–80, scoring a goal in his first game while facing the Winnipeg Jets. Bourque asserted himself from the start as one of the best defensemen in the league, winning both the Calder Memorial Trophy as Rookie of the Year and a First Team All-Star selection, the first time in NHL history a rookie non-goaltender had ever achieved the distinction. His 65 points that season was a record at the time for a rookie defenseman.

In 1985, upon the retirement of Bruins&#x27; captain Terry O&#x27;Reilly to coach the club, Bourque and veteran Rick Middleton were named co-captains of the team, Middleton to wear the &quot;C&quot; during home games and Bourque for road games. Upon Middleton&#x27;s retirement in 1988, Bourque became the team&#x27;s sole captain, and retained the position for the remainder of his Bruins&#x27; tenure. In so doing, he passed Dit Clapper as the longest-tenured Bruins&#x27; captain in history, as well as passing Alex Delvecchio of the Detroit Red Wings as the longest-serving team captain in NHL history, a mark since surpassed by Steve Yzerman of the Red Wings.

Bourque proved a solid force for Boston for 21 seasons (1979–2000), famous for combining offensive prowess at a level that few defencemen in league history had ever achieved—he was a perennial shot accuracy champion at All-Star Games—and near-unparalleled defensive excellence. Bourque won five Norris Trophies as the league&#x27;s top defenceman and finished second to Mark Messier in 1990 in the closest race ever for the Hart Memorial Trophy, the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. The Bruins&#x27; reliance on Bourque&#x27;s on-ice mastery was so total that—while Bourque was very durable throughout much of his career—the team was seen by many to flounder whenever he was out of the lineup.

During Bourque&#x27;s tenure with the Bruins, the team continued what would be a North American professional record twenty-nine consecutive seasons in the playoffs, a streak that lasted through the 1996 season. In the playoffs, Bourque led the team to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Edmonton Oilers in both 1988 and 1990, where the Bruins lost in both series. In the 1996–97 season, Bourque missed the playoffs for the only time in his career, when the Bruins finished with the NHL&#x27;s worst record that season.

Bourque was also popular among Bruins fans because of his willingness to re-sign with Boston without any acrimonious or lengthy negotiations. He passed over several opportunities to set the benchmark salary for defencemen; instead, he usually quietly and quickly agreed to terms with the Bruins, and this stance irritated the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), which had been pushing to drive up players&#x27; wages.

===Colorado Avalanche===
The Bruins&#x27; record for most consecutive seasons in the playoffs by any team in North American professional sports was ended at 29 seasons in the 1996–97 season. The next two seasons, the Bruins returned to the playoffs and in 1999, they won a playoff series for the first time since 1994.

Despite a nucleus of young talent and high expectations for 1999–2000, injuries caused the Bruins to plummet to the bottom of their division, and they went on track to miss the playoffs. This was further exacerbated by negative attention over teammate Marty McSorley&#x27;s hit on Donald Brashear. With his career nearing an end and the team going in the wrong direction, Bourque requested a trade from the fading Bruins so he would have a chance to win the Stanley Cup. Bourque and fellow veteran Dave Andreychuk were sent to Colorado in exchange for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Samuel Påhlsson and a first-round draft pick (2000 draft, 27th overall, Martin Samuelsson).

Although Bourque played just one-and-a-half seasons with the Avalanche, he proved to be a force both on the ice and in the locker room. In 2000, he helped the struggling Avalanche improve their form and capture their division. During the playoffs, they advanced to the conference finals, where they lost to the Dallas Stars in a hard-fought series, with Bourque hitting the post in the last minutes of Game 7, which would have tied the game after his team rallied from a 3–0 deficit in the third period to 3–2.

Bourque returned to the Avs for the 2000–01 season and was named as an alternate captain. He led all Colorado defencemen in scoring and formed a solid defensive pairing with Adam Foote and Rob Blake, the latter of whom the Avs received from the Los Angeles Kings in a trade. Bourque was named to the post-season First All-Star team, finishing as runner-up to the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Nicklas Lidström for the Norris Trophy.

The Avalanche advanced all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals, where Bourque scored the game-winning goal in Game 3 against the New Jersey Devils. Colorado took the series in seven games to win their second Stanley Cup. During the post-game presentation that followed the Avalanche&#x27;s victory in the decisive seventh game, team captain Joe Sakic broke with tradition and gave the Cup to Bourque so he could skate with it first. Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy, whose fourth championship had come the same day as Bourque&#x27;s first, said of the Stanley Cup and his teammate, &quot;A name was missing from that [Cup], and today it is back to normal.&quot; Bourque had waited longer to win his first Cup than any other Cup-winning player had in the 108-year history of the Stanley Cup, having played 1,612 regular season and 214 playoff games before winning the ultimate prize.

On June 12, 2001, three days after the Cup victory, Bourque brought the Cup back to Boston for an emotional rally attended by some 20,000 fans at Boston&#x27;s City Hall Plaza. Bourque retired shortly thereafter, having set defensive regular-season records in goals (410) and assists (1169) for 1579 points. During the 2000–01 season, which would be the last for both players, Bourque surpassed Paul Coffey (who had just been acquired by the Bruins) to become the all-time leader in goals, assists and points for a defenceman at any senior professional level.

==International play==
Bourque played for Team Canada in the Canada Cup in 1981, 1984 and 1987. However, he did not play in the 1991 edition, despite attempts by Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier to persuade him to take part. Bourque also played for the NHL All-Stars in Rendez-vous &#x27;87 against the Soviet Union, and played for the Canadian team in the 1998 Winter Olympics, leading all defencemen in scoring with one goal and two assists in six games.

==Jersey number==
For a majority of his NHL career, Bourque wore jersey number 77. After he retired following the 2000–01 season, both the Bruins and the Avalanche honored him by retiring number 77.

When he was initially called up to the Bruins, Bourque was assigned the number 7, which had been worn by former Bruins star forward Phil Esposito from the time he was acquired by the team in 1967 until he departed in 1976 via trade. Bourque was the third player to be issued the number following Esposito&#x27;s departure, following Sean Shanahan and Bill Bennett.

In 1987, six years after Esposito&#x27;s retirement, and three years after he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Bruins decided to retire number 7 in his honor. Bourque, thus, would be the last Bruin to wear number 7 and was permitted to do so as long as he desired to even after Esposito&#x27;s retirement ceremony, which was scheduled for December 3 of that year. Bourque, however, came up with his own way to honor the veteran Bruin and did so at the ceremony.

As the Bruins were dressing for that night&#x27;s game, Bourque put on two jerseys with his normal number 7 as the top layer. When the team came out for the retirement ceremony, Bourque skated over to Esposito just before he was about to speak to the Boston crowd. He removed his number 7 jersey and handed it to Esposito, a move that was seen as &quot;surrendering&quot; the number to him. In doing this, Bourque also revealed his new number to the crowd, as the jersey he had been wearing underneath his number 7 bore the number 77 he would wear for the remainder of his career.

==Retirement==

Bourque was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004, his first season of eligibility. His uniform number 77 has been retired by both the Bruins and the Avalanche; he is one of only nine players whose jersey has been retired by more than one club. His birthplace of Saint-Laurent named the &quot;Aréna Raymond-Bourque&quot; in his honour.

Bourque and his wife Christiane still live in Massachusetts, where they are active in several local charities. Bourque was named a Bruins team consultant on November 3, 2005. He is also the co-owner of an Italian restaurant called Tresca in Boston&#x27;s North End. Bourque founded the Bourque Family Foundation in the summer of 2017.

Bourque&#x27;s younger brother Richard was also a hockey player and was drafted by the Bruins in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft in the tenth round, but never played professional hockey. Bourque&#x27;s eldest son, Christopher, was drafted by the Washington Capitals in 2004. Christopher played for the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 2007 season and made his NHL debut for the Capitals in 2007. Chris then joined the Boston Bruins on May 26, 2012, and has his number retired by the Bears. His younger son, Ryan, was a third-round draft choice of the New York Rangers in 2009, and was a member of the USA&#x27;s 2010 gold-medal, World Junior Championship team, earning three assists during the tournament. and was an alternate captain for the USA&#x27;s 2011 World Junior Championship team, in which he again earned three assists as the team won the bronze medal.

Since retiring, Bourque has worked in the restaurant industry as the owner of Tresca, an Italian restaurant in Boston&#x27;s North End neighborhood, and manages the Bourque Family Foundation, which supports charitable events around the Boston area.

==Awards and achievements==

Bourque&#x27;s exceptional talent as a player has led him to become one of the most honored players in hockey history. During his career, he was selected to thirteen NHL First Team (the most in history) and six Second Team All-Star squads, second in total in league history only to Gordie Howe and most amongst defencemen. He won the Norris Trophy as the top defenceman in the league five times, fourth all-time after Bobby Orr, Doug Harvey and Nicklas Lidström.

<doc id="493727" wikidata="Q155899" url="?curid=493727" title="Aero L-39 Albatros">
<text>The Aero L-39 Albatros is a high-performance jet trainer designed and produced by Aero Vodochody in the Czech Republic. In addition to performing basic and advanced pilot training, it has also flown combat missions in a light-attack role. Unusually, the aircraft never received a NATO reporting name.

The L-39 Albatros was designed during the 1960s as a successor to the Aero L-29 Delfín, an early jet-powered principal training aircraft. Performing its maiden flight on 4 November 1968, it became the first trainer aircraft in the world to be equipped with a turbofan powerplant. Quantity production of the L-39 Albatros proceeded in 1971; one year later, it was formally recognized by the majority of the Warsaw Pact countries as their preferred primary trainer. Accordingly, thousands of L39s would be produced for various military customers in Eastern Europe. Additionally, it was exported to a range of countries across the world both as a trainer and a light-attack aircraft. Since the 1990s, it has also become popular among civilian operators. By the end of the century, in excess of 2,800 L-39s had served with over 30 air forces.

Several derivatives of the L-39 Albatros were developed. During the 1980s, Aero Vodochody used it as the basis for the L-59 Super Albatros, an enlarged and updated model. Furthermore, the L-39 lineage would be extended to the L-139, a prototype L-39 fitted with a Western-sourced Garrett TFE731 engine. A combat-oriented development of the aircraft, designated as the L-159 ALCA, entered production in 1997, and has since been procured by a range of export customers. Production of the original L-39 came to an end during the mid-1990s, orders having declined substantially following the end of the Cold War. At the Farnborough Airshow in July 2014, Aero Vodochody announced the launch of the L-39NG, an upgraded and modernised version of the L-39; this programme is set to produce new-build aircraft alongside the extensive rebuilding of existing aircraft. In 2023, production of the L-39NG resumed under the name &quot;Skyfox&quot;, with 34 aircraft on order.

==Development==
In 1964, the Czechoslovak aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody embarked on a new design project to meet the specified requirements for a &quot;C-39&quot; (C for &quot;cvičný&quot; – trainer), setting up a design team under the leadership of . This aircraft was to serve as a replacement for the Aero L-29 Delfín, an early jet-powered trainer, as a principal training aircraft. Vlcek envisioned the type, a twin-seat single-engine aircraft, being adopted as the primary trainer throughout the Warsaw Pact nations.

On 4 November 1969, the L-39 (under the designation &quot;Prototype X-02&quot; – the second airframe to be built) conducted its maiden flight, for which it was piloted by Rudolf Duchoň, the factory&#x27;s test pilot. Serial production of the initial model of the L-39, designated &quot;L-39C&quot;, commenced in 1971. During 1972, the L-39 Albatros was formally recognized by the majority of the countries comprising the Warsaw Pact as their preferred primary trainer, after which point, sizable orders from military customers throughout the bloc proceeded, many of which were from the Soviet Air Forces. In 1974, the first L-39 trainer entered service with the Czechoslovak Air Force.
Several specialised variants of the base L-39 design were quickly introduced. In 1972, a purpose-built target tug variant, the L-39V, conducted its initial flight. During 1975, the first L-39ZO training/light combat model, which was equipped with four underwing hardpoints as well as a strengthened wing and modified landing gear, performed its first flight. In 1977, the first L-39ZA light combat variant, which was fitted with a single Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 cannon mounted underneath the fuselage in addition to the four hardpoints and strengthening of the L-39ZO, made its maiden flight.

According to aerospace publication Flight International, roughly 200 L-39s were being sold each year in the jet trainer market during the late 1980s. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 1993, the total export orders gained for the L-39 represented 80 per cent of the value of all Czech military product export sales made for that year. During the 1990s, shortly following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, Aero Vodochody decided to develop versions of the Albatros equipped with Western-sourced avionics, engines, and weapon systems. Around the same time, Aero Vodochody formed an active partnership with Elbit Systems of Israel, under which a number of L-39s were delivered to Elbit to be equipped with modern electronics and onboard systems before being re-exported to end users such as the Royal Thai Air Force.

Sales of the L-39 declined during the 1990s. This downturn has been attributed to the loss of the captive Warsaw Pact trainer market, to which a substantial proportion of the total aircraft manufactured had been historically sold; allegations about Czechoslovak banks being unable to finance the defense industry and inaction on the part of the Czechoslovak government; and concerns over the quality of manufacturing standards. In 1996, production of the L-39 came to an end. Since the end of production, Aero Vodochody has developed several improved variants of the L-39 to take its place, and has continued extensive support and overhaul operations for existing L-39 customers.

One of the replacements for the L-39 Albatros was the Aero L-159 Alca, a modernised version of the L-39. Originally, Aero Vodochody had intended to develop the L-159 in partnership with Elbit, but the Czech Ministry of Defense instead selected Rockwell Collins to partner on the program. The limited success of the L-159 led Aero to announce at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow that it was developing an upgraded version of the L-39, designated L-39NG (&quot;Skyfox&quot;), to compete with the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 and British Aerospace Hawk. The L-39 Skyfox replaces the AI-25 turbofan with a Williams FJ44 engine; the airframe is modified, the wingtip fuel tanks being eliminated, and a new suite of avionics will be provided. The first flight of the L-39 Skyfox was in December 2018, and final military type certification was granted by the Czech Military Aviation Authority in 2022. The first production L-39NG is expected to fly by the end of 2022.

The L-39 Albatros was designed to be a cost-effective jet-powered trainer aircraft, which is also capable of performing ground attack missions. For operational flexibility, simplicity, and affordability, the majority of onboard systems have been simplified to avoid incurring high levels of maintenance, as well as to minimize damage caused by mishandling when flown by inexperienced air crew. It could be readily flown from austere airstrips such as frozen lakebeds, enabled through the rugged design of the landing gear and favourable low landing speeds. The aircraft&#x27;s flying qualities are reportedly simple, which is made easier by way of a rapid throttle response, making it easier for students who had never previously flown a jet aircraft before to successfully control. As a training platform, the L-39 itself comprised part of a comprehensive system that also used flight simulators and mobile ground test equipment.
The low-set, straight wing has a double-taper planform, 2½-deg dihedral from the roots, a relatively low aspect ratio, and fuel tanks permanently attached to the wingtips. The trailing edge has double-slotted trailing edge flaps inboard of mass-balanced ailerons; the flaps are separated from the ailerons by small wing fences. An automatic trimming system was present, the flaps and the trim system being connected in order to counteract the potentially large pitch changes that would otherwise be generated by vigorous movements of the flaps. The tall, swept vertical tail has an inset rudder. Variable-incidence horizontal stabilizers with inset elevators are mounted at the base of the rudder and over the exhaust nozzle. Side-by-side airbrakes are located under the fuselage ahead of the wing&#x27;s leading edge. The flaps, landing gear, wheel brakes and air brakes are powered by a hydraulic system. Controls are pushrod-actuated and have electrically powered servo tabs on the ailerons and rudder. Operational g-force limits at are +8/-4 g.
A long, pointed nose leads back to the tandem cockpit, in which the student and instructor sit on Czech-built VS-1 ejection seats under individual canopies, which are opened manually and are hinged on the right. The rear seat, typically used by the instructor, is elevated slightly to readily enable observation and guidance of the student&#x27;s actions in the forward position. The design of the cockpit, panel layout and many of its fittings resemble or are identical in function to those of other commonly used Soviet aircraft; for example, the procedure for deploying the ejection seat is exactly the same as for the Mikoyan MiG-29. The cockpit is partially pressurized, requiring the air crew to wear oxygen masks when flying in excess of 23,000 feet. A gyro gunsight for weapon-aiming purposes is typically present in the forward position only.

A single turbofan engine, an Ivchenko AI-25TL (made in the Soviet Union) is positioned in the rear fuselage, fed through shoulder-mounted, semi-circular air intakes (fitted with splitter plates) just behind the cockpit and the tailpipe below the horizontal tailplane. The engine has a time between overhaul (TBO) of 1,000 flight hours; it is allegedly cheaper than the majority of turbine engines to overhaul. Five rubber bag fuel tanks are located in the fuselage behind the cockpit. Several heavy radio units are typically installed in an aft avionics bay; these are often removed on civilian-operated aircraft and replaced with a 70-gallon fuel tank. Additional fuel tanks can be fitted in the rear cockpit position and externally underneath the wings; the tip-tanks can also be expanded for a greater fuel capacity.

The aircraft is fitted with a hydraulically actuated retractable nosewheel undercarriage that is designed to allow operation from grass airfields. The main landing gear legs retract inward into wing bays while the nose gear retracts forward. The basic L-39C trainer has provision for two underwing pylons for drop tanks or practice weapons, but these are not usually fitted. It can be armed with a pair of K-13 missiles to provide a basic air defense capability. Light-attack variants have four underwing hardpoints for ground attack stores, while the ZA variant also has an underfuselage gun pod. Mock UB-16 rocket pods can also be installed for visual appearance only.

==Operational history==

===Georgia===
During the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993), Abkhaz separatist forces received several L-39s from Russia and Chechnya, which were used in combat against Georgian forces. On 10 January 1993, an Abkhaz L-39 was shot down by a Russian SA-11 Buk during a friendly-fire incident. The pilot, Oleg Chanba, who was commander of the Abkhaz separatist air force, was killed during the incident. On 1 April 1993, during the attack on civilian targets in Sokhumi, Georgian forces managed to damage an L-39, which fell into the sea.

In the spring of 2008, a number of Georgian drones were shot down by Abkhazian separatist forces over the Abkhazia region. The Abkhazian separatist forces claimed that one of its missile-equipped L-39s had shot down a Georgian Hermes 450 unmanned reconnaissance drone. Footage released later by Georgian authorities clearly shows a drone being brought down by a heat-seeking missile fired from a MiG-29. A UN investigation also concluded that the footage was authentic and that the drone was shot down by a Russian MiG-29 using a Vympel R-73 heat seeking missile.

===Afghanistan===
The Taliban Air Force had managed to obtain around five L-39C aircraft from the remnants of the former Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force; with foreign technical support and pilots, these were placed into combat operations during the later stages of the 1996–2001 phase of the Afghan civil war against the Northern Alliance. In early 2001, only two of these reportedly remained operational. Following the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, a number of L-39s were inducted into the Afghan Air Force.

===Azerbaijan===
A number of L-39s, along with older L-29s, were used extensively by Azeri forces to perform ground attack missions during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in the 1980s and early 1990s. A number of these were reportedly shot down by air defenses employed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army. In September 2015, Aero Vodochody sought a large order for the latest model of the L-39 to Azerbaijan; by this point, Azerbaijan had a total of 24 airworthy L-39s remaining in service.

===Chechnya===
The newly de facto independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria found itself with dozens of L-39s (as well as several L-29s, three MiG-17s, two MiG-15UTIs, helicopters and other transport and civilian aircraft) left at Khankala and Kalinovskaya airbases by the Soviet Air Force in 1992. Most of these, however, were reportedly abandoned or not in flyable condition, but during the August–November 1994 conflict between nationalist and pro-Russian forces L-39s were deployed and were possibly one of the few air attack (and possibly reconnaissance) elements on Dzhokar Dudayev&#x27;s forces. At least one was reported as shot down near Goragorsk on October 4 by a Strela-2 MANPADS fired by Doku Zavgayev&#x27;s pro-Russian militia. The pilot, Col. Ali Musayev and the co-pilot Dedal Dadayev were killed.

One of the main reasons that prompted the first Su-25 air raids that destroyed the Chechen air force on the ground, and started the Russian intervention, was preparations being made by Dudayev&#x27;s air force, which had been spotted by reconnaissance Sukhoi Su-24MRs. There were fears that these aircraft could slow or deter the Russian air and ground campaign, as well as the capability of several aircraft to conduct kamikaze attacks on Russian nuclear power plants (specifically via means of the ejection seat in most aircraft, notably the L-39, by filling them with explosives to act as improvised cruise missiles).

===Iraq===
Iraq became the first export customer for the L-39 Albatros. By mid 1970, the Iraqi Air Force had procured a considerable number of L-39 trainers, having transferred the bulk of their training activities onto the Czechoslovak aircraft. During the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, on 14 April 2003, a pair of United States Navy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets attacked several L-29 and L-39 aircraft on the ground at an airfield near the city of Tikrit; these had been believed to have been modified to perform as delivery platforms for weapons.

===Libya===
Libya acquired some 180 L-39ZOs around 1978, which served at Sabha and Okba Ben Nafi flying schools along with Yugoslav-made G-2 Galeb for advanced jet training and Italian-made SF.260s (for primary training).

The L-39s were deployed during the Chadian-Libyan conflict, mainly to Ouadi Doum air base. During the final Chadian offensive in March 1987, the Chadians captured Ouadi Doum along with several aircraft (11 L-39s included) and Soviet SAM systems and tanks. A Chadian report to the UN, reported the aforementioned capture on 11 L-39s and the destruction (or downing) of at least four of them.

In the midst of that conflict, on 21 April 1983, three LARAF Ilyushin Il-76TDs and one Lockheed C-130 Hercules landed at Manaus Airport, Brazil after one of the Il-76s developed technical problems while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft were then searched by the Brazilian authorities: instead of medical supplies – as quoted in the transport documentation – the crate of the first of 17 L-39s bound for Nicaragua together with arms and parachutes, to support the country&#x27;s war against US-backed Contras, were found. The cargo was impounded for some time before being returned to Libya, while the transports were permitted to return to their country. During the 1990s and 2000s, Libya made multiple attempts to get components and services for its air force in spite of an embargo placed upon the country by United Nations Security Council Resolution 748; by 2001, only half of Libya&#x27;s L-39s were serviceable as a consequence.

===Russia===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Russian Air Force in 1991, the newly formed service found itself with hundreds of L-39 aircraft, the majority of which were surplus to their training requirements. According to author Stephan Wilkinson, by 2005, Russia was seeking to potentially sell up to 800 of their L-39s, which were receiving only a basic level of maintenance once per month while their fate was being decided. Starting in the early 1990s, the Russian Air Force has pursued the development of a domestically built jet trainer, for which the Yakovlev Yak-130 was selected; the Yak-130 shall eventually replace the L-39 in Russian service within its operational roles.

===Syria===
The Syrian Arab Air Force has operated a number of armed L-39ZA light attack variants. Since the early stages of the Syrian civil war, the Syrian Air Force&#x27;s L-39 aircraft have been routinely deployed in counter-insurgency operations against various rebel ground forces, a number of these aircraft have also been shot down by ground fire. They were first used operationally during the Battle of Aleppo, launching several strikes upon rebel-held positions. It has been claimed the L-39 was the first fixed-wing aircraft to be employed against the rebels.

In February 2013, insurgents successfully captured a number of intact L-39s, along with their support equipment, after raiding and later taking over the Al-Jarrah airbase. In late 2013, reports emerged of claims by Islamist fighters that they had successfully flown two of the captured L-39s. In October 2014, the Syrian Government claimed that at least two rebel-held L-39s had been airworthy and had recently been destroyed by Syrian Air Force aircraft.

According to Reuters, by 2014, the L-39 had allegedly become one of the favoured platforms of the Syrian Air Force for performing ground attack missions due to its slower speed and higher agility over other aircraft in its inventory. In December 2015, following the securing of the Kweiris airbase by government forces, the resumption of ground-attack missions by L-39s in the vicinity of Aleppo commenced shortly thereafter.

On 26 December 2017, a Syrian L-39 was shot down near Hama airport.

On 3 March 2020, a Syrian Arab Army Air Force L-39 was shot down by a Turkish Air Force F-16 over Idlib province. Both Syrian and Turkish forces confirmed the downing.

During the Northwestern Syria offensive (2024), some L-39s were captured by Syrian opposition forces after the capture of Aleppo.

===Ukraine=== 
On 24 February 2022, a Ukrainian L-39 from the 39th Tactical Aviation Brigade (Ukraine) piloted by Dmytro Kolomiyets was shot down by a Russian aircraft in Khmelnytskyi during the opening hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 9 August 2022, Dmytro Kolomiyets was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Gold Star.

On 25 August 2023, two Ukrainian L-39s collided during a combat mission over Zhytomyr, killing three pilots. Among those killed was combat pilot Andrii Pilshchykov, an Order of Courage recipient more commonly known by his callsign &quot;Juice&quot;, who had become famous in the west for his articulate appeals early in the war for allies to supply F-16s to Ukraine.

===Civilian use===

While newer versions are now replacing older L-39s in service, thousands remain in active service as trainers, and many are finding new homes with private warbird owners all over the world. It has been claimed that the L-39&#x27;s desirability stems from the fact that it is &quot;the only available second-generation jet trainer&quot;. This trend is particularly evident in the United States, where their $200,000–$300,000 price puts them in range of moderately wealthy pilots looking for a fast, agile personal jet. Their popularity led to a purely L-39 Jet class being introduced at the Reno Air Races in 2002, though it has since been expanded to include other, similar aircraft.
In September 2012, there were 255 L-39s registered with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and four registered with Transport Canada. Several display teams use the L-39 such as the Patriots Jet Team (6 L-39s), the Breitling Jet Team (7 L-39s) and the Black Diamond Jet Team (5 L-39s). There are also several L-39s that have been made available for private jet rides by various operators in Australia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Spain and the US. These L-39s are mostly in private hands, but some also belong to government agencies, such as those in Vyazma, Russia. In March 2018 there were five L-39s on the civilian register in New Zealand. One registered as an L-39 and four others registered as L-39C.

Since 2004, the Defence &amp; MRO Division of Aero Vodochody has performed a general maintenance, repair and modernisation program of civil-operated L-39s, as well as performing the demilitarisation of ex-military aircraft. Services offered to civil operators include life-extension programs, support for civil registration/certification, training of ground/flight crew, logistics and analysis, customization, routine inspection, condition-based maintenance support, and providing general expertise/consultancy work.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
* On 26 September 1987, Mihai Smighelschi, a 21-year-old student of the Romanian Air Force Academy, flew an L-39ZA Albatros trainer to Turkey and requested political asylum. His aircraft was later recovered and onboard data recorders showed that he had flown no higher than above ground at to evade radar detection. Smighelschi had less than 100 hours at the time, including high-school glider training, and less than 3 hours on the L-39ZA. Without satellite navigation or any maps, he had navigated a straight line over Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey using only ground marks and the memory of a map of Europe present at the Academy. He eventually landed in Kirklareli, Turkey, on a street near several jeeps that seemed to have American insignia, damaging the aircraft&#x27;s front wheel and the nose.
* On 24 January 2001, Atlas Air Founder, Chairman, and CEO Michael A. Chowdry was killed when his Czech L-39 jet trainer crashed into an open field near Watkins, Colorado, US. Also killed was &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; aerospace reporter Jeff Cole. Chowdry and Cole were making a planned flight from Front Range Airport.
* On 2 June 2002, a brake failure on an L-39 landing at the Imperial War Museum Duxford caused the plane to run off the end of the runway and down an embankment onto the M11 motorway. The trainee pilot was killed when he ejected at ground level, but the instructor survived the accident and no vehicles on the motorway were involved.
* On 6 December 2015, an L-39 crashed while attempting to take-off at Apple Valley Airport, California, US; the pilot Mike Mangold and his passenger were both killed on impact, followed by an ensuing fire on the ground.
* On 25 August 2023 Major Andrii Pilshchykov died, along with two other pilots, Major Viacheslav Minka and Major Serhii Prokazin, when their two Ukrainian Air Force L-39M1 trainer planes collided in the air performing a whifferdill turn maneuver during dogfight training near , Zhytomyr Oblast.
* On 13 September 2024, Bulgarian Air Force L-39ZA crashed during an airshow rehearsal at Graf Ignatievo Air Base Bulgaria. Both pilots Major Petko D. Dimitrov and 1st Lieutenant Vencislav A. Dunkin were killed on impact.

<doc id="493733" wikidata="Q541116" url="?curid=493733" title="Cessna O-1 Bird Dog">
<text>The Cessna O-1 Bird Dog is a liaison and observation aircraft that first flew on December 14, 1949, and entered service in 1950 as the L-19 in the Korean War. It went to serve in many branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, was not retired until the 1970s in a number of variants, and also served in the Vietnam War. It was also called the OE-1 and OE-2 in Navy service, flying with the Marine Corps, and in the 1960s it was re-designated the O-1. It remains a civilian-flown warbird aircraft, and there are examples in aviation museums. It was the first all-metal fixed-wing aircraft ordered for and by the United States Army following the Army Air Forces&#x27; separation from it in 1947. The Bird Dog had a lengthy career in the U.S. military as well as in other countries, with over 3400 produced.

It was further developed into a turboprop-powered version in the 1970s, the SIAI-Marchetti SM.1019. An experimental variant was the Cessna 308, a one-off to explore the possibility of a 4-person liaison version.

==Design and development==

The U.S. Army was searching for an aircraft that could fly over enemy locations to collect information related to artillery fire target locations and distances, as well as perform liaison duties, and preferably be constructed of all metal, as the fabric-covered liaison aircraft used during World War II (primarily Stinson and Piper products) had short service lives. After the specification for a two-seat liaison and observation monoplane was issued, the Cessna Aircraft Company submitted the Cessna Model 305A, a development of the Cessna 170. The Cessna 305A was a single-engine, lightweight, strut-braced, high-wing monoplane with a tailwheel landing gear.

The greatest difference from the Cessna 170 was that the 305A had only two seats in tandem configuration (the largest tandem-seat aircraft Cessna ever produced), with angled side windows to improve ground observation. Other differences included a redesigned rear fuselage, providing a view directly to the rear (a feature later dubbed &quot;Omni-View&quot;, carried over to Cessna single-engine aircraft after 1964), and transparent panels in the wings&#x27; center-section over the cockpit (similar to those found on the Cessna 140 and the later Cessna 150 &quot;Aerobat&quot; model), which allowed the pilot to look directly overhead. A wider door was fitted to allow a stretcher to be loaded.

The Army held a competition in April 1950 for the contract, with contenders from Cessna, Piper, Taylorcraft, and Temco. Cessna&#x27;s entry was selected for service.

The U.S. Army awarded a contract to Cessna for 418 of the aircraft, which was designated the L-19A Bird Dog. The prototype Cessna 305 (registration N41694) first flew on 14 December 1949, and it now resides in the Spirit of Flight Center in Erie, Colorado. Deliveries began in December 1950, and the aircraft were soon in use fighting their first war in Korea from 1950 through 1953. An instrument trainer variant was developed in 1953, later versions had constant speed propellers, and the final version, the L-19E, had a larger gross weight.

Around 1950, U.S. Air Force (USAF) orders for sixty L-19A aircraft were diverted to the United States Marine Corps (USMC), which designated it OE-1 under the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system, took delivery from 1951 to 1953, and deployed the aircraft in Korea. In 1959, two L-19E aircraft transferred from the U.S. Army to the USMC were also designated OE-1. The USMC issued a requirement for a larger and faster version, prompting Cessna to adapt Cessna 180 wings and a more powerful Continental O-470-2 engine to the aircraft, which was designated OE-2; 27 of these improved aircraft were delivered, but the sharp price increase dissuaded the USMC from future orders.

Cessna produced 3,431 aircraft; it was also built under license by Fuji in Japan. Initially, 2486 were produced between 1950 thru 1954, and an additional 945 produced through 1958, and 60 more were produced in Japan.

The L-19 received the name Bird Dog as a result of a contest held with Cessna employees to name the aircraft. The winning entry, submitted by Jack A. Swayze, an industrial photographer, was selected by a U.S. Army board. The name was chosen because the role of the army&#x27;s new aircraft was to find the enemy and orbit overhead until artillery (or attack aircraft) could be brought to bear on the enemy. While flying low and close to the battlefield, the pilot would observe the exploding shells and adjust the fire via his radios, in the manner of a bird dog (gun dog) used by game hunters.

==Operational history==
===Military service===

The United States Department of Defense (DOD) ordered 3,200 L-19s that were built between 1950 and 1959, entering both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps inventories.  The aircraft were used in various utility roles such as artillery spotting, front-line communications, medevac, and training.

In U.S. service, the L-19 replaced the Piper L–4 Grasshoppers and Stinson L–5 Sentinels.

With the adoption of the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the Army L-19 and Marine Corps OE were redesignated as the O-1 Bird Dog, and soon entered the Vietnam War. During the early 1960s, the Bird Dog was flown by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF), U.S. Army, and U.S. Marines in South Vietnam and later by clandestine forward air controllers (e.g., Ravens) in Laos and Cambodia.  Because of its short takeoff and landing (STOL) and low altitude/low airspeed capabilities, the O-1 also later found its way into USAF service as a Forward Air Controller (FAC) aircraft for vectoring faster fighter and attack aircraft and supporting combat search-and-rescue operations recovering downed aircrews.

During the Vietnam War, the Bird Dog was used primarily for reconnaissance, target acquisition, artillery adjustment, radio relay, convoy escort, and the forward air control of tactical aircraft, including bombers operating in a tactical role.

Supplementing the O-1, then gradually replacing it, the USAF switched to the Cessna O-2 Skymaster and North American OV-10 Bronco, while the U.S. Marine Corps took delivery of the OV-10 to replace their aging O-1s. Both were faster twin-engine aircraft, with the OV-10 being a turboprop aircraft. Still, the U.S. Army retained the Bird Dog throughout the war, with up to 11 Reconnaissance Airplane Companies (RACs) deployed to cover all of South Vietnam, the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), and the southern edge of North Vietnam. Its quieter noise footprint, lower speed, tighter maneuverability, short runway ability, and better visibility (even to the rear) kept it highly valued by the ground units it supported and highly feared by enemy units it flew over. The last U.S. Army O-1 Bird Dog was officially retired in 1974.

During the Vietnam War, 469 O-1 Bird Dogs were lost to all causes. The USAF lost 178, the USMC lost 7, and 284 were lost from the U.S. Army, RVNAF, and clandestine operators. Three Bird Dogs were lost to enemy hand-held surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).

Two O-1 Bird Dogs were loaned to the Australian Army&#x27;s 161 Reconnaissance Flight operating out of Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province. One was lost to ground fire in May 1968, killing 161&#x27;s commanding officer. Another Bird Dog was built by this unit&#x27;s maintenance crew, using aircraft sections salvaged from dumps around Vietnam. It was test-flown and later smuggled back to Australia in pieces, contained in crates marked as &quot;aircraft spares&quot;. This aircraft now resides in the Museum of Army Flying at the Army Aviation Center at Oakey, Queensland.

As the USAF phased out the O-1 in favor of the O-2 and OV-10, many O-1s in the United States were sold as surplus. During the 1970s and 1980s, Ector Aircraft remanufactured many as the Ector Mountaineer with their original powerplants and as the Ector Super Mountaineer with the Lycoming O-540-A4B5.

In United States Service, it was mostly replaced by the O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco, although it lingered in many roles due to unique advantages.

===Civil Air Patrol service===
In the early 1970s, as the O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco replaced the O-1 in frontline USAF service, several former USAF O-1s were turned over to the USAF&#x27;s civilian auxiliary, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), for duties such as aerial search in support of domestic search and rescue (SAR) operations. However, since very few CAP pilots had prior training and experience as professional military aviators and/or significant experience with tailwheel aircraft, many CAP O-1 aircraft were damaged in ground loops and other takeoff, landing, or taxiing mishaps.

To reduce both risk and repair costs, the USAF directed CAP that all O-1 aircraft in CAP service be eventually replaced for safety reasons by single-engine tricycle-gear civilian Cessnas common to general aviation, primarily Cessna 172 and Cessna 182 aircraft. The only O-1 remaining in the CAP inventory is a permanent static display aircraft on a pylon in front of CAP Headquarters at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.

===Civilian use===

Many former USAF and former CAP O-1 and L-19 aircraft were sold to private owners as recreational aircraft, and others went to glider clubs in the U.S. as a reliable and robust vehicle to tow gliders into the air. As with most aircraft used for glider towing, the aircraft has also been outfitted with mirrors mounted to the struts. Others went to museums, where they are usually displayed in their military combat markings.

In Canada, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets use former CAF L-19 aircraft equipped with a towing rig to tow their Schweizer 2-33A gliders for the Air Cadet gliding program. These particular L-19 variants are used in the Atlantic, Eastern, and Pacific regions. They have been modified for noise reduction using a smaller-diameter, four-blade Hoffman composite propeller in all regions except the Pacific Region and exhaust modification. The fuel delivery system has also been modified from the original design, placing the fuel selector valve closer to the pilot. The L-19/O-1 is a popular warbird with private pilots.

In the U.S., the Franconia Soaring Association in Franconia, N.H., uses an O-1, tail number N4796G, to tow its gliders, including Schweizer SGS 1-26 gliders and Grob G103 Twin Astir and Pilatus B4-PC11 sailplanes, as of July 2012.

As of June 2009, more than 330 were registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration. Others are owned and operated outside the U.S. by individuals and flying organizations.

==Notable flights==
American television personality and actor Ed McMahon was a Marine Corps aviator who piloted an OE during the Korean War, flying 85 combat missions and earning six Air Medals in 1953.

Captain Sidney Harrison, U.S. Army, a decorated veteran of World War II and the Korean War, crashed his Cessna O-1 on a flight from Wichita, Kansas, to Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado, in 1952. The wreckage is still in the woods above Palmer Lake, Colorado, and can be reached by an hike.

Captain Hilliard A. Wilbanks, USAF, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for sacrificing his life on February 24, 1967, while supporting an ARVN Ranger Battalion at Di Linh, near Da Lat, South Vietnam. After knowing their ambush had been compromised and fighter support would soon come, the Viet Cong charged into the Rangers. Trying to slow them down, Wilbanks shot the rest of his phosphorus rockets at the enemy. After he ran out of rockets, he made strafing passes, firing his M16 rifle from the side window of the plane. After the third pass, he was wounded and crashed, and died while being evacuated by helicopter. 

On 29 April 1975, the day before the fall of Saigon during the Vietnam War, Republic of Vietnam Air Force Major Bung-Ly loaded his wife and five children into a two-seat Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and took off from Con Son Island. After evading enemy ground fire, Major Bung-Ly headed out to sea and spotted the aircraft carrier . With only an hour of fuel remaining, he dropped a note asking that the deck be cleared so he could land. As there was no other way to make room, &quot;Midway&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain (later Rear Admiral) Lawrence Chambers, ordered US$10 million worth of South Vietnamese Bell UH-1 Iroquois (&quot;Huey&quot;) helicopters to be pushed overboard into the South China Sea. The Bird Dog that Major Bung-Ly landed aboard &quot;Midway&quot; is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. A similar aircraft was restored in the markings of the aircraft flown by Major Bung-Ly for an exhibit at the USS &quot;Midway&quot; Museum in San Diego, California.

<text>A cardinal mark is a sea mark (a buoy or other floating or fixed structure) commonly used in maritime pilotage to indicate the position of a hazard and the direction of safe water.

Cardinal marks indicate the direction of safety as a cardinal (compass) direction (north, east, south or west) relative to the mark. This makes them meaningful regardless of the direction or position of the approaching vessel, in contrast to the (perhaps better-known) lateral mark system.

== Characteristics ==
The characteristics and meanings of cardinal marks are as defined by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities.

A cardinal mark indicates one of the four compass directions by:

* the direction of its two conical top-marks, which can both point up, indicating north; down, indicating south; towards each other, indicating west; or away from each other, indicating east
* its distinctive pattern of black and yellow stripes, which follows the orientation of the cones - the black stripe is in the position pointed to by the cones (e.g. at the top for a north cardinal, in the middle for a west cardinal)
* optionally, its distinctive sequence of flashing light, which consists of a sequence of quick or very quick flashes whose number gives the clockface position which corresponds to the direction of the cardinal (e.g. three for an east cardinal, nine for a west; north has continuous flashes, and south may be augmented with a long flash, to help distinguish it from a west in difficult conditions)

Either a quick or a very quick sequence of light flashes may be used; the choice allows for two similar nearby marks to be uniquely identified by their lights.

A cardinal mark may be used to accomplish the following:

*Indicate that the deepest water is an area on the named side of the mark
*Indicate the safe side on which to pass a danger
*Draw attention to a feature in a channel, such as a bend, junction, branch, or end of a shoal
*Draw attention to a new danger such as a grounded ship. In such cases two equal marks are often placed together to indicate that it&#x27;s a newly marked danger and is not yet printed in official charts.

Other uses:

*Sometimes a Cardinal Mark can be used instead of a Special mark to indicate a spoil ground, or an outfall pipe for example. A few examples can be seen on the South Coast of England and in Northern France.

==Mnemonics==
The north and south topmarks are self-explanatory (both cones pointing up, or both pointing down). Remembering the east and west marks can be more of a problem.

* The topmarks for east and west &quot;follow the Sun&quot;—the top cone points in the direction in which the Sun appears to move (rising for an east mark or setting for a west mark), while the bottom cone points in the direction in which its reflection on the ocean surface appears to move. The Sun and its reflection move away from each other on rising and toward each other on setting.
* East looks like an Easter egg. The western mark has a pinched waist: &quot;Western women have wasp waists&quot;.
* East looks like a classical letter E/epsilon. The western mark looks like a &quot;W&quot; on its side, or &quot;West winds wool&quot; (looks like a bobbin)
* East is larger around the middle: &quot;Equatorially enlarged&quot;. West is a woman&#x27;s waist.
* West looks like a wine glass with the narrow stem and wide top and bottom.

The colours can be remembered this way: &quot;The two conical top-marks always point to black&quot;.
*If the top-marks point to the top, black is at the top.
*If the top-marks point to the bottom, black is at the bottom.
*If the top-marks point to the middle, black is at the middle.
*If the top-marks point to the outside, black is at the outside.

<text>PRISM (Parallel Reduced Instruction Set Machine) was a 32-bit RISC instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was the outcome of a number of DEC research projects from the 1982–1985 time-frame, and the project was subject to continually changing requirements and planned uses that delayed its introduction. This process eventually decided to use the design for a new line of Unix workstations. The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) of the microPrism version had completed design in April 1988 and samples were fabricated, but the design of other components like the floating point unit (FPU) and memory management unit (MMU) were still not complete in the summer when DEC management decided to cancel the project in favor of MIPS-based systems. An operating system codenamed MICA was developed for the PRISM architecture, which would have served as a replacement for both VAX/VMS and ULTRIX on PRISM.

PRISM&#x27;s cancellation had significant effects within DEC. Many of the team members left the company over the next year, notably Dave Cutler who moved to Microsoft and led the development of Windows NT. The MIPS-based workstations were moderately successful among DEC&#x27;s existing Ultrix users but had little success competing against companies like Sun Microsystems. Meanwhile, DEC&#x27;s cash-cow VAX line grew increasingly less performant as new RISC designs outperformed even the top-of-the-line VAX 9000. As the company explored the future of the VAX they concluded that a PRISM-like processor with a few additional changes could address all of these markets. Starting where PRISM left off, the DEC Alpha program started in 1989.

==History==
===Background===
Introduced in 1977, the VAX was a runaway success for DEC, cementing its place as the world&#x27;s #2 computer vendor behind IBM. The VAX was noted for its rich instruction set architecture (ISA), which was implemented in complex microcode. The VMS operating system was layered on top of this ISA, which drove it to have certain requirements for interrupt handling and the memory model used for memory paging. By the early 1980s, VAX systems had become &quot;the computing hub of many technology-driven companies, sending spokes of RS-232 cables out to a rim of VT-100 terminals that kept the science and engineering departments rolling.&quot;

This happy situation was upset by the relentless improvement of semiconductor manufacturing as encoded by Moore&#x27;s Law; by the early 1980s there were a number of capable 32-bit single-chip microprocessors with performance similar to early VAX machines yet able to fit into a desktop pizza box form factor. Companies like Sun Microsystems introduced Motorola 68000 series-based Unix workstations that could replace a huge multi-user VAX machine with one that provided even more performance but was inexpensive enough to be purchased for every user that required one. While DEC&#x27;s own microprocessor teams were introducing a series of VAX implementations at lower price-points, the price-performance ratio of their systems continued to be eroded. By the later half of the 1980s, DEC found itself being locked out of the technical market.

===RISC===
During the 1970s, IBM had been carrying out studies of the performance of their computer systems and found, to their surprise, that 80% of the computer&#x27;s time was spent performing only five operations. The hundreds of other instructions in their ISAs, implemented using microcode, went almost entirely unused. The presence of the microcode introduced a delay when the instructions were decoded, so even when one called one of those five instructions directly, it ran slower than it could if there was no microcode. This led to the IBM 801 design, the first modern RISC processor.

Around the same time, in 1979, Dave Patterson was sent on a sabbatical from University of California, Berkeley to help DEC&#x27;s west-coast team improve the VAX microcode. Patterson was struck by the complexity of the coding process and concluded it was untenable. He first wrote a paper on ways to improve microcoding, but later changed his mind and decided microcode itself was the problem. He soon started the Berkeley RISC project. The emergence of RISC sparked off a long-running debate within the computer industry about its merits; when Patterson first outlined his arguments for the concept in 1980, a dismissive dissenting opinion was published by DEC.

By the mid-1980s practically every company with a processor design arm began exploring the RISC approach. In spite of any official disinterest, DEC was no exception. In the period from 1982 to 1985, no fewer than four attempts were made to create a RISC chip at different DEC divisions. Titan from DEC&#x27;s Western Research Laboratory (WRL) in Palo Alto, California was a high-performance ECL based design that started in 1982, intended to run Unix. SAFE (&quot;Streamlined Architecture for Fast Execution&quot;) was a 64-bit design that started the same year, designed by Alan Kotok (of Spacewar! fame) and Dave Orbits and intended to run VMS. HR-32 (&quot;Hudson, RISC, 32-bit&quot;) started in 1984 by Rich Witek and Dan Dobberpuhl at the Hudson, MA fab, intended to be used as a co-processor in VAX machine. The same year Dave Cutler started the CASCADE project at DECwest in Bellevue, Washington.

===PRISM===
Eventually, Cutler was asked to define a single RISC project in 1985, selecting Rich Witek as the chief architect. In August 1985 the first draft of a high-level design was delivered, and work began on the detailed design. The PRISM specification was developed over a period of many months by a five-person team: Dave Cutler, Dave Orbits, Rich Witek, Dileep Bhandarkar, and Wayne Cardoza. Through this early period, there were constant changes in the design as debates within the company argued over whether it should be 32- or 64-bit, aimed at a commercial or technical workload, and so forth.

These constant changes meant the final ISA specification was not complete until September 1986. At the time, the decision was made to produce two versions of the basic concept, DECwest worked on a &quot;high-end&quot; ECL implementation known as Crystal, while the Semiconductor Advanced Development team worked on microPRISM, a CMOS version. This work was 98% done 1985–86 and was heavily supported by simulations by Pete Benoit on a large VAXcluster.

Through this era there was still considerable scepticism on the part of DEC engineering as a whole about whether RISC was really faster, or simply faster on the trivial five-line programs being used to demonstrate its performance. Based on the Crystal design, in 1986 it was compared to the then-fastest machine in development, the VAX 8800. The conclusion was clear: for any given amount of investment, the RISC designs would outperform a VAX by 2-to-1.

In the middle of 1987, the decision was made that both designs be 64-bit, although this lasted only a few weeks. In October 1987, Sun introduced the Sun-4. Powered by a 16 MHz SPARC, a commercial version of Patterson&#x27;s RISC design, it ran four times as fast as their previous top-end Sun-3 using a 20 MHz Motorola 68020. With this release, DEC once again changed the target for PRISM, aiming it solely at the workstation space. This resulted in the microPRISM being respecified as a 32-bit system while the Crystal project was canceled. This introduced more delays, putting the project far behind schedule. 

By early 1988 the system was still not complete; the CPU design was nearly complete, but the FPU and MMU, both based on the contemporary Rigel chipset for the VAX, were still being designed. The team decided to stop work on those parts of the design and focus entirely on the CPU. Design was completed in March 1988 and taped out by April.

===Cancellation===
Throughout the PRISM period, DEC was involved in a major debate over the future direction of the company. As newer RISC-based workstations were introduced, the performance benefit of the VAX was constantly eroded, and the price/performance ratio completely undermined. Different groups within the company debated how to best respond. Some advocated moving the VAX into the high-end, abandoning the low-end to the workstation vendors like Sun. This led to the VAX 9000 program, which was referred to internally as the &quot;IBM killer&quot;. Others suggested moving into the workstation market using PRISM or a commodity processor. Still others suggested re-implementing the VAX on a RISC processor.

Frustrated with the growing number of losses to cheaper faster competitive machines, independently, a small skunkworks group in Palo Alto, outside of Central Engineering, focused on workstations and UNIX/Ultrix, entertained the idea of using an off-the-shelf RISC processor to build a new family of workstations. The group carried out due diligence, eventually choosing the MIPS R2000. This group acquired a development machine and prototyped a port of Ultrix to the system. From the initial meetings with MIPS to a prototype machine took only 90 days. Full production of a DEC version could begin as early as January 1989, whereas it would be at least another year before a PRISM based machine would be ready.

When the matter was raised at DEC headquarters the company was split on which approach was better. Bob Supnik was asked to consider the issue for an upcoming project review. He concluded that while the PRISM system appeared to be faster, the MIPS approach would be less expensive and much earlier to market. At the acrimonious review meeting by the company&#x27;s Executive Committee in July 1988, the company decided to cancel Prism, and continue with the MIPS workstations and high-end VAX products. The workstation emerged as the DECstation 3100.

By this time samples of the microPRISM had been returned and were found to be mostly working. They also proved capable of running at speeds of 50 to 80 MHz, compared to the R2000&#x27;s 16 to 20. Performance predictions based on these observations suggested a significant performance improvement over existing and announced RISC products from other vendors. However, without the accompanying floating-point unit, whose design had been halted, or the cache interface chip required for operating at such frequencies, which had been part of a cancelled project, floating-point performance predictions remained hypothetical.

===Legacy===
By the time of the July 1988 meeting, the company had swung almost entirely into the position that the RISC approach was a workstation play. But PRISM&#x27;s performance was similar to that of the latest VAX machines and the RISC concept had considerable room for growth. As the meeting broke up, Ken Olsen asked Supnik to investigate ways that Digital could keep the performance of VMS systems competitive with RISC-based Unix systems.

A group of engineers formed a team, variously referred to as the &quot;RISCy VAX&quot; or &quot;Extended VAX&quot; (EVAX) task force, to explore this issue. By late summer, the group had explored three concepts, a subset of the VAX ISA with a RISC-like core, a translated VAX that ran native VAX code and translated it on-the-fly to RISC code and stored in a cache, and the ultrapipelined VAX, a much higher-performance CISC implementation. All of these approaches had issues that meant they would not be competitive with a simple RISC machine.

The group next considered systems that combined both an existing VAX single-chip solution as well as a RISC chip for performance needs. These studies suggested that the system would inevitably be hamstrung by the lower-performance part and would offer no compelling advantage.

It was at this point that Nancy Kronenberg pointed out that people ran VMS, not VAX, and that VMS only had a few hardware dependencies based on its modelling of interrupts and memory paging. There appeared to be no compelling reason why VMS could not be ported to a RISC chip as long as these small bits of the model were preserved. Further work on this concept suggested this was a workable approach.

Supnik took the resulting report to the Strategy Task Force in February 1989. Two questions were raised: could the resulting RISC design also be a performance leader in the Unix market, and should the machine be an open standard? And with that, the decision was made to adopt the PRISM architecture with the appropriate modifications, eventually becoming the Alpha, and began the port of VMS to the new architecture.

When PRISM and MICA were cancelled, Dave Cutler left Digital for Microsoft, where he was put in charge of the development of what became known as Windows NT. Cutler&#x27;s architecture for NT was heavily inspired by many aspects of MICA.

==Design==

In terms of integer operations, the PRISM architecture was similar to the MIPS designs. Of the 32-bits in the instructions, the 6 highest and 5 lowest bits were the instruction, leaving the other 21 bits of the word for encoding either a constant or register locations. Sixty-four 32-bit registers were included, as opposed to thirty-two in the MIPS, but usage was otherwise similar. PRISM and MIPS both lack the register windows that were a hallmark of the other major RISC design, Berkeley RISC.

The PRISM design was notable for several aspects of its instruction set. Notably, PRISM included Epicode (&quot;extended processor instruction code&quot;), which defined a number of &quot;special&quot; instructions intended to offer the operating system a stable ABI across multiple implementations. Epicode was given its own set of 22 32-bit registers to use. A set of vector processing instructions were later added as well, supported by an additional sixteen 64-bit vector registers that could be used in a variety of ways.

<doc id="493750" wikidata="Q1395035" url="?curid=493750" title="Falukorv">
<text>Falukorv ( , ), or Falu sausage in English, is a sausage (&quot;korv&quot; in Swedish) which originates from Falun, Sweden. It is made of a grated mixture of smoked pork and beef or veal with potato starch flour, onion, salt and mild spices. Falukorv is a pre-cooked sausage, thus it can be eaten cold without any further preparation.

==History==
The history of falukorv reaches back to the Falun copper mine during the 16th and 17th century, where ox hide was used for ropes and some of the meat remaining after slaughter was salted and smoked and used for sausages.

The tradition of preparing the meat in this way was revitalised in the late 19th century by the butcher Anders Olsson, whose initiation led to the development of the modern falukorv, which uses a mixture of pork and beef or veal.

== Variants ==
=== TSG falukorv ===
A popular sausage, falukorv has Traditional Speciality Guaranteed-status in the EU, UK and Norway. Under EU law thus, restrictions apply to what may be labeled as &quot;falukorv&quot;. Only potato flour may be used as a binding agent, and the amount of meat may not fall short of 45%, although most brands of falukorv have a significantly higher meat percentage.
The TCS status does, however, not require the sausage to be manufactured in Falun.

=== Middagskorv ===
Because of its TSG status, only sausages made from a specific recipe may be called falukorv; it may not be made with any alternative ingredients. Manufacturers therefore use the term &quot;middagskorv&quot; (dinner sausage) to describe variations, such as sausages with a lower fat content of 9% instead of the standard 23%, chicken, or vegetarian versions made from soy, pea and potato protein or quorn.

==Typical falukorv meals==
* Sliced and fried with boiled, fried, or mashed potato
* Sliced and fried with elbow macaroni
* Sliced and fried, served with baked Swedish brown beans and fried egg
* Partially sliced and baked au gratin with cheese and mustard, often with onion or apple tucked in between the slices; served accompanied by roast or mashed potatoes.
* As a substitute for the beef in beef stroganoff – the resulting dish being known as &quot;Korv Stroganoff&quot;
* Diced and fried with potatoes and onions as a component of pyttipanna
* Sliced and on top of bread

<text>The Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union () was the supreme decision-making body of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Its meetings served as convention of all party delegates and their predecessors.

Between the congresses the party was ruled by the Central Committee. Over the course of the party&#x27;s history, the name was changed in accordance with the current name of the party at the time. The frequency of party congresses varied with the meetings being annual events in the 1920s while no congress was held at all between 1939 and 1952. After the death of Joseph Stalin, the congresses were held every five years.

<doc id="493753" wikidata="Q129252" url="?curid=493753" title="Helen Humes">
<text>Helen Humes (June 23, 1913 – September 13, 1981) was an American singer. She was a blues, R&amp;B and classic popular singer.

==Early life==
Humes was born on June 23, 1913, in Louisville, Kentucky, to Emma Johnson and John Henry Humes. She grew up as an only child. Her father was one of the first Black attorneys in her hometown, and her mother was a schoolteacher. In an interview, Humes recalled her parents singing to each other around the house and in a church choir.

Humes was introduced to music in the church, singing in the choir and getting piano and organ lessons given at Sunday school by Bessie Allen, who taught music to any child who wanted to learn. Humes began occasionally playing the piano in a small and locally traveling dance band, the Dandies. This constant involvement in music would lead to her singing career in the mid-1920s.

Humes attended Central High School in Louisville.

==Career==

===Early career===
Humes&#x27; career began with her first vocal performance at an amateur contest in 1926, singing &quot;When You&#x27;re a Long, Long Way from Home&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with You, That&#x27;s Why&quot;. Her talents were noticed by a guitarist in the band, Sylvester Weaver, who recorded for Okeh Records and recommended her to the talent scout and producer Tommy Rockwell. At the age of 14, Humes recorded in St. Louis in April 1927, singing four blues songs, though only two of the sides were ever issued. A second recording session was held in New York, and this time she was accompanied by pianist J. C. Johnson.
Despite this introduction to the music world, Humes did not make another record for another ten years, during which she completed her high school degree, took finance courses, and worked at a bank, as a waitress, and as a secretary for her father. She stayed home for a while, eventually leaving to visit friends in Buffalo, New York. While there, she was invited to sing a few songs at the Spider Web, a cabaret in town. This brief performance turned into an audition, which turned into a $35-a-week job. She stayed in Buffalo, singing with a small group led by Al Sears.

===Cincinnati Cotton Club===
While Humes was home in Louisville (she said she always returned home at least twice a year) she received a call from Sears, who was in Cincinnati. He wanted her to sing at Cincinnati&#x27;s Cotton Club. The Cotton Club was an important venue in the Cincinnati music scene. It was an integrated club which booked and promoted many black performers. Humes moved to Cincinnati in 1936 and sang with Sears&#x27;s band again at the Cotton Club.

Count Basie first heard and approached Humes while she was performing at the Cotton Club in 1937. He asked her to join his touring band to replace Billie Holiday. He told her that she would be paid $35 a week, and she responded, &quot;Oh shucks, I make that here and don&#x27;t have to go no place!&quot;
Not long after this encounter, Humes moved in 1937 to New York City, where John Hammond, a talent scout and producer, heard her singing with Sears&#x27;s band at the Renaissance Club. Through Hammond, she became a recording vocalist with Harry James&#x27;s big band. Her swing recordings with James included &quot;Jubilee&quot;, &quot;I Can Dream, Can&#x27;t I?&quot;, Jimmy Dorsey&#x27;s composition &quot;It&#x27;s the Dreamer In Me&quot;, and &quot;Song of the Wanderer&quot;. In March 1938, Hammond persuaded Humes to join Count Basie&#x27;s Orchestra, where she stayed for four years.

===The Count Basie Orchestra===
In the Count Basie Orchestra, Humes sang ballads and popular songs. While she was also a talented blues singer, Jimmy Rushing, another member of the orchestra at the time, held domain over the blues vocals. Her vocals with Basie&#x27;s band included &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;.

On December 24, 1939, Humes performed with the Count Basie Orchestra, and James P. Johnson, at the second &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall, produced by John Hammond. After this concert, most of her time with the Basie Orchestra was spent touring. In a 1973 oral history, she described life on tour: 
For these reasons, Humes left in 1942.

===Café Society and solo career===
While home again in Louisville in 1942, Humes was called by John Hammond and invited to sing at Café Society in New York. She performed frequently there, accompanied by the pianists Teddy Wilson and Art Tatum. During that year, she also performed at the Three Deuces, at the Famous Door with Benny Carter (February), at the Village Vanguard with Eddie Heywood, and on tour with a big band led by the trombonist Ernie Fields.

In 1944, Humes moved to Los Angeles, California, where she recorded and contributed to movie soundtracks. Some of the soundtracks she recorded were &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; and &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;. She appeared in the musical film &quot;Jivin&#x27; in Be-Bop&quot;, by Dizzy Gillespie. She also performed and toured with Jazz at the Philharmonic for five seasons. She recorded her most popular songs, two jump blues tunes, &quot;Be-Baba-Leba&quot; R&amp;B #3 (Philo, 1945) and &quot;Million Dollar Secret&quot; R&amp;B #6 (Modern, 1950). There was some controversy surrounding the single Be-Baba-Leba&quot; because it had been recorded first by singer Tina Dixon who held the initial copyright. Dixon&#x27;s version was released after Humes who popularized the tune. Despite her chart success, her career stagnated. From the late 1940s to the mid-1950s she made a few recordings, working with different bands and vocalists, including Nat King Cole, but was not nearly as active as she had been. In 1950, she recorded Benny Carter&#x27;s &quot;Rock Me to Sleep&quot;. She bridged the gap between big-band swing jazz and rhythm and blues.

In 1956, Humes toured Australia with the vibraphonist Red Norvo. Their tour was well received, and she returned again in 1962 and 1964. She performed at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1959 and the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1960 and 1962. She toured Europe with the first American Folk Blues Festival in 1962.

She returned to the United States in 1967 to take care of her ailing mother. At this point Humes viewed her singing career as a part of her past. She took a job at a local ammunition plant, sold her record player and her records and stopped singing. From 1967 to 1973, she did not work as a singer, until Stanley Dance persuaded her to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1973. This performance led to a revival of her career in music.
The festival was followed with multiple European engagements and some albums made in France for Black and Blue. She sang regularly at the Cookery in New York City from 1974 to 1977.

Humes subsequently performed occasionally in America and at European venues and festivals, including the prestigious Nice Jazz Festival in the mid-1970s. She recorded her final album, &quot;Helen&quot;, for Muse Records in 1980. She received the Music Industry of France Award in 1973 and the key to the city of Louisville in 1975.

Humes said of her career, &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to be a star! I want to work and be happy and just go along and have my friends – and that&#x27;s my career.&quot;

==Death==
Humes died of cancer in Santa Monica, California, on September 13, 1981, at the age of 68. Her family requested donations for cancer research instead of flowers at her funeral. She is buried at the Inglewood Park Cemetery, in Inglewood, California.

==Style and reviews==
Humes&#x27;s vocal range was from G3 to C5, as she stated in a letter to the arranger Buck Clayton in preparation for a European tour, along with a list of her preferred songs. According to many critics, her voice was versatile, suiting pop songs and ballads as well as blues.
She was compared to Ethel Waters and Mildred Bailey from early in her career and was often recorded singing the blues after her association with Basie. In an interview with the jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Humes explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve been called a blues singer, a jazz singer, and a ballad singer – well, I&#x27;m all three, which means I&#x27;m just a singer.&quot; 
A review from &quot;Downbeat Magazine&quot; of her albums &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;, &quot;Helen Comes Back&quot;, and &quot;Helen Humes with Red Norvo and His Orchestra&quot; said the following about her collaboration with Red Norvo: 
 Norvo&#x27;s sparkling vibes are the ideal complement to Helen&#x27;s lithe, light timbered clarity…Helen is in particularly fine voice…[with] an uncanny resemblance to early Ella [Fitzgerald] in her sound and phrasing.

The review of &quot;Helen Comes Back&quot; was not as positive but did not fault the singer:Blues dominates [the album]…[and] although her voice is delightful, the material is too simple to challenge her…Helen is a great deal more than a blues shouter.

Reviews in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of her last performances, in Maryland in 1978 and Washington, D.C., in 1980, described her as &quot;beaming and genial at 65&quot; (in 1978) and gave insight into her versatile vocals: &quot;her characteristically light voice [turning] rough as she belted out…&#x27;You Can Take My Man But You Can&#x27;t Keep Him Long&#x27;.&quot; The reviews also described her use of back phrasing, reminiscent of Billie Holiday&#x27;s signature style of phrasing a melody in an intimate, personal fashion.

<text>Aero Vodochody (commonly referred to as Aero) is a Czech aircraft company. Its main production facilities are located at Vodochody Airport in the Prague-East District, on the municipal territories of Vodochody and Odolena Voda.

During the Cold War era, the firm was well known for its range of jet-powered trainer aircraft, the L-29 Delfin and L-39 Albatros. It also developed derivatives of the L-39, the L-59 Super Albatros and the L-159 Alca military light combat jet. Aero Vodochody is believed to have handled the biggest aircraft industrial programme to take place across any of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) countries except for the Soviet Union itself. Following the fall of the communist government in Czechoslovakia during 1989, Aero Vodochody experienced a disruptive period of business, having lost a major portion of the market for its jet trainers. Sales noticeably declined during the 1990s in Eastern Europe as well as in NATO countries as a result of the peace dividend.

Between 1998 and 2004, Aero Vodochody was controlled by the American aerospace company Boeing. During October 2006, the company was privatised once again, being bought by Czech-Slovak investment group Penta Investments for roughly 3 billion CZK. Aero Vodochody continues to manufacture both whole aircraft and aerostructures for the aerospace industry. During the 2014 Farnborough Airshow, it announced the launch of the Aero L-39 Skyfox, an upgraded and modernised version of its ubiquitous L-39.

In year 2021 Penta Investments sold their business share to the HSC Aerojet Zrt.

==History==
Aero Vodochody has been active since its founding in 1919. Between 1929 and 1951, its subsidiary, Aero, manufactured a range of small and medium-sized cars with two-stroke engines, it also briefly produced the Škoda 150 truck between 1946 and 1947 under licence.

During the 1950s, Aero Vodochody developed the L-29 Delfin trainer aircraft; it was Czechoslovakia&#x27;s first indigenously designed jet-powered aircraft. The L-29 is believed to have likely been the biggest aircraft industrial programme to take place across any of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) countries except for the Soviet Union itself. During the course of the programme, in excess of 3,000 L-29s were produced; of these, around 2,000 were reported to have been delivered to the Soviet Union, where it served as the standard trainer for the Soviet Air Force. Of the others, which included both armed and unarmed models, many aircraft were delivered to the various COMECON countries while others were exported to various overseas nations, including Egypt, Syria, Indonesia, Nigeria and Uganda. Reportedly, the type has been used in active combat during several instances, perhaps the most high-profile being the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s and of Egyptian L-29s against Israeli tanks during the brief Yom Kippur War of 1973.

The L-39 Albatros was designed during the 1960s as a replacement for the Aero L-29 Delfín as a principal training aircraft. Several specialised variants of the base L-39 design were quickly introduced. In 1972, a purpose-built target tug variant, the L-39V, conducted its initial flight. During 1975, the first &quot;L-39ZO&quot; training/light combat model, which was equipped with four underwing hardpoints as well as a strengthened wing and modified landing gear, performed its first flight. In 1977, the first &quot;L-39ZA&quot; light combat variant, which was fitted with a single Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 cannon mounted underneath the fuselage in addition to the four hardpoints and strengthening of the L-39ZO, made its maiden flight. According to aerospace publication Flight International, roughly 200 L-39s were being sold each year upon the jet trainer market during the late 1980s. Sales of the L-39 declined during the 1990s. This downturn has been attributed to the loss of the captive Warsaw Pact trainer market, to which a substantial proportion of the total aircraft manufactured had been historically sold to; allegations about Czechoslovak banks being unable to finance the defense industry and inaction on the part of the Czechoslovak government; and concerns over the quality of manufacturing standards. During 1996, production of the L-39 was terminated.

Aero Vodochody has developed several improved variants of the L-39 to take its place, and has continued extensive support and overhaul operations for existing L-39 customers. The L-59 Super Albatros was derived from the L-39, being originally designated as the &quot;L-39MS&quot;. Aero only produced a handful of L-59s before discontinuing production. Another derivative of the L-39 Albatros was the L-159 Alca, a modernised combat-oriented version. Originally, Aero Vodochody had intended to develop the L-159 in partnership with Elbit, but the Czech Ministry of Defense instead selected Rockwell Collins to partner on the program.

During the 2010s, Aero Vodochody was engaged in the manufacture of the L-159 advanced light combat aircraft and the Sikorsky S-76 helicopter. It has also an active presence in the aerostructures sector, producing the center wing box of the Alenia C-27J Spartan airlifter, door subassemblies for the Embraer 170 and Embraer 190 airliners, the cockpit of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, gun bay doors for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter, subassemblies and various elements of the Airbus A320 family airliner, and fixed leading edge kits for the Boeing 767 airliner. The company is reportedly likely to upgrade the runway at its Vodochody Airport near Prague to international airport standards, allowing it to better serve the low-cost air carriers and charter flights that service Prague.

During July 2014, Aero Vodochody presented the L-39NG (&quot;Skyfox&quot;) programme at the Farnborough Airshow. By April 2015, a partnership had formed between Aero Vodochody, American defence contractor Draken International and engine manufacturer Williams International to undertake the programme and to properly prepare the L-39NG to compete on the North American market. The L-39NG is being developed and marketed in two stages. The L-39NG upgrade program (Stage 1) contains an installation of FJ44-4M engine and optionally the Stage 2 avionics to existing L-39 Albatros. The second phase (Stage 2) represents newly built L-39NG aircraft with the possible use of components from the previous upgrade to Stage 1, once the original airframe reaches the end of its life. The first stage was formally completed om 14 September 2015 with the maiden flight of the L-39NG technology demonstrator (L-39CW). On 20 November 2017, Aero Vodochody announced the completion of development of the L-39CW; on 14 March 2018, they announced that the L-39CW, equipped with both the new engine and the new avionics, had received type certification. The brand new L-39NG aircraft made first flight on December 22, 2018. in September 2020, less than two years later, the aircraft was certified by the Military Aviation Authority of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic.

In September, 2021, Aero Vodochody sale transaction was successfully completed. Based on an agreement signed in July 2021 Hungarian company HSC Aerojet Zrt. became the 100% owner of Aero. In HSC Aerojet Zrt. majority is held by Hungarian businessman Kristóf Szalay-Bobrovniczky and minority is held by Czech company OMNIPOL a.s. The sale also included Vodochody Airport.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s (Whitechapel Road) was a station on the District and Metropolitan lines of the London Underground. It was located between Whitechapel and Aldgate East stations, in the East End of London.

It was opened in 1884 on the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Joint Railway, and served initially, albeit briefly, by the South Eastern Railway, then and for much of its existence jointly by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway; the route is now served by the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. The station was closed in 1938 in advance of the relocation of Aldgate East to within minimal distance, rendering St. Mary&#x27;s inessential. The station building was severely damaged during the Blitz of the Second World War and subsequently was demolished.

==History==

Opened on 3 March 1884 as St. Mary&#x27;s (Whitechapel), the station was on the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Joint Railway, and initially used by the South Eastern Railway; this service was withdrawn on 1 October 1884 and one week later the services were taken over jointly by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway. The station was small and cramped, and was located very close to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East stations, just before the junction to the East London Line.

In 1938, Aldgate East was relocated further eastwards and given a new entrance only a few hundred yards from St. Mary&#x27;s (Whitechapel Road) rendering the latter surplus to requirements. It was permanently closed after the last train on 30 April 1938 in advance of the resiting of Aldgate East.
During the Second World War, the station site was leased from London Transport by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney for use as an air-raid shelter. The edges of the platforms were bricked up to separate the shelter areas from the still-used tracks. On 22 October 1940, during the early months of the Blitz, the street-level station building was hit by a bomb and severely damaged. Its temporary replacement was also hit a few months later. The structure was subsequently demolished, hence little evidence of the station&#x27;s existence now remains above ground, and its site is occupied by a car dealership.

The bricked-up platforms are still accessible to London Underground staff via an anonymous door off Whitechapel Road. Below ground, it is still possible to make out where the station was, as the barrel-vaulted roof and bricked-off platforms are still just visible from passing trains. Sometimes, trains travelling from Whitechapel to Aldgate East are held at signals, resulting in the train stopping abreast of the old St. Mary&#x27;s platform.

==St. Mary&#x27;s Curve==
The connection line leading to the old East London Line is still called the St. Mary&#x27;s Curve. For many years the line was only used to transfer rolling stock between the East London and Metropolitan lines. Loading gauge restrictions for the stock meant that, although the curve was double tracked, trains could only pass in one direction at any one time. When illuminated, it can easily be seen from the left-hand side of East London Line trains entering Whitechapel from the south and can still be seen from the right-hand side of District line trains entering the station from the west. Since re-opening as part of the London Overground in 2010, the former East London Line no longer shares rolling stock with the Metropolitan line. As a result, St. Mary&#x27;s Curve is no longer used, but the tunnel still exists. The points at St. Mary&#x27;s Curve were removed in 2009.

<text>The Cessna T-41 Mescalero is a military version of the popular Cessna 172, operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) and Army, as well as the armed forces of various other countries as a pilot-training aircraft. The T-41A, used by the USAF for introductory training of pilot candidates with little or no flying experience, was a commercial off-the-shelf 172 with few modifications. Upgraded versions of the T-41 with more powerful engines and more specialized equipment were based on the Cessna 175 (itself a 172 derivative), including the T-41B for the Army, T-41C for the USAF Academy, and the T-41D for the U.S. Military Aid Program. The single-engine piston T-41 entered service in the 1960s and was mostly withdrawn by the USAF by 1995, but some remain in limited military service today, and some military surplus examples are flown by civil owners.

==Design and development==

In 1964, the US Air Force (USAF) decided to use the commercial off-the-shelf Cessna 172F as a lead-in aircraft for student pilots rather than starting them out in the T-37 jet aircraft. The USAF ordered 237 T-41As from Cessna. The first USAF class (67-A) of students began training on the T-41 from the civilian airport in Big Spring, Texas, in August 1965.

The T-41B was the US Army version, with a Continental IO-360 engine and constant-speed propeller in place of the Continental O-300 and 7654 fixed-pitch propeller used in the 172 and the T-41A.

In 1968, the USAF acquired 52 of the more powerful T-41Cs, which used Continental IO-360 and a fixed-pitch climb propeller, for use at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).

In 1996, the aircraft were further upgraded to the T-41D, which included an upgrade in avionics and to a constant-speed propeller.

Beginning in 1993, the USAF replaced many of the T-41 fleet with the Slingsby T-3A Firefly for the flight-screening role, and for aerobatic training, which was outside the design capabilities of the T-41.

Four T-41s remained at the Air Force Academy for the USAFA Flying Team, as well as to support certain academic classes.

A number of air forces, including Saudi Arabia and Singapore, purchased various civilian models of the Cessna 172 for use in military training, transport, and liaison roles. While similar to the T-41 and named as such, these aircraft were not actually T-41s from a technical standpoint and were powered by the standard 172 powerplants available in the model year purchased, including the Continental O-300 in pre-1968 aircraft and the Lycoming O-320 in later 172s.

==Variants==

Variants of the T-41 other than the T-41A were built under the type certificate of the Cessna 175 Skylark. The 175 was a close derivative of the 172 and most parts aft of the firewall are interchangeable. The controversial Continental GO-300 engine from the civil 175 was never used in the T-41; the T-41B through D instead used the Continental IO-360. Cessna never offered a civil model directly analogous to these aircraft, but Cessna licensee Reims Aviation in France sold similar IO-360-powered models as the R172 Rocket and Hawk XP.

<text>New York is a suburban village in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, North East England. Approximately 4 miles from Whitley Bay, and 5 miles from the town of Tynemouth, it locally governed as part of the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside. It was named after New York, following the British capture of the city in 1777.

== History ==
There had been a settlement in existence on the location of New York since Anglo-Saxon England where it occupied a crossroads between Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey and docks for Lindisfarne Monastery. It did not have an official name until during the American War of Independence when it was named &quot;New York&quot; after New York City following the British capture of the city. It was also due to the village being formally founded then and being located near a now-vanished village that similarly shared a name from the Thirteen Colonies, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;.

New York had its own blacksmiths&#x27; forge from the 1760s until 2016, when the landowner sold the land that it was leased on for redevelopment. New York was located near Algernon Colliery, until the coal pits closed in 1966. The road to the pits crossed a disused London and North Eastern Railway line. The North Tyneside Steam Railway and Stephenson Railway Museum are located in New York. In 1969, it was considered by the government to be a part of a redevelopment project aimed at North Shields.

== War memorial ==
In 1921, New York constructed a war memorial to victims of the First World War. It was designed by local architect W.H. Endean and was constructed out of sandstone in the shape of a celtic cross. In 2012, it received grade II listed status for having a &quot;...strong cultural and historical significance within both a local and national context&quot;. In 2014, North Tyneside Council announced a £100,000 fund to repair local war memorials, including the New York War Memorial, in time for the centenary of the First World War.

<doc id="493760" wikidata="Q12599" url="?curid=493760" title="Ice sheet">
<text>In glaciology, an ice sheet, also known as a continental glacier, is a mass of glacial ice that covers surrounding terrain and is greater than . The only current ice sheets are the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. Ice sheets are bigger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers. Masses of ice covering less than 50,000 km2 are termed an ice cap. An ice cap will typically feed a series of glaciers around its periphery.

Although the surface is cold, the base of an ice sheet is generally warmer due to geothermal heat. In places, melting occurs and the melt-water lubricates the ice sheet so that it flows more rapidly. This process produces fast-flowing channels in the ice sheet — these are ice streams.

Even stable ice sheets are continually in motion as the ice gradually flows outward from the central plateau, which is the tallest point of the ice sheet, and towards the margins. The ice sheet slope is low around the plateau but increases steeply at the margins.

Increasing global air temperatures due to climate change take around 10,000 years to directly propagate through the ice before they influence bed temperatures, but may have an effect through increased surface melting, producing more supraglacial lakes. These lakes may feed warm water to glacial bases and facilitate glacial motion.

In previous geologic time spans (glacial periods) there were other ice sheets. During the Last Glacial Period at Last Glacial Maximum, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered much of North America. In the same period, the Weichselian ice sheet covered Northern Europe and the Patagonian Ice Sheet covered southern South America.

== Overview ==

An ice sheet is a body of ice which covers a land area of continental size - meaning that it exceeds 50,000 km2. The currently existing two ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have a much greater area than this minimum definition, measuring at 1.7 million km2 and 14 million km2, respectively. Both ice sheets are also very thick, as they consist of a continuous ice layer with an average thickness of . This ice layer forms because most of the snow which falls onto the ice sheet never melts, and is instead compressed by the mass of newer snow layers.

This process of ice sheet growth is still occurring nowadays, as can be clearly seen in an example that occurred in World War II. A Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane crashed in Greenland in 1942. It was only recovered 50 years later. By then, it had been buried under 81 m (268 feet) of ice which had formed over that time period.

== Dynamics ==

===Glacial flows===

Even stable ice sheets are continually in motion as the ice gradually flows outward from the central plateau, which is the tallest point of the ice sheet, and towards the margins. The ice sheet slope is low around the plateau but increases steeply at the margins. This difference in slope occurs due to an imbalance between high ice accumulation in the central plateau and lower accumulation, as well as higher ablation, at the margins. This imbalance increases the shear stress on a glacier until it begins to flow. The flow velocity and deformation will increase as the equilibrium line between these two processes is approached. This motion is driven by gravity but is controlled by temperature and the strength of individual glacier bases. A number of processes alter these two factors, resulting in cyclic surges of activity interspersed with longer periods of inactivity, on time scales ranging from hourly (i.e. tidal flows) to the (Milankovich cycles).

On an unrelated hour-to-hour basis, surges of ice motion can be modulated by tidal activity. The influence of a 1 m tidal oscillation can be felt as much as 100 km from the sea. During larger spring tides, an ice stream will remain almost stationary for hours at a time, before a surge of around a foot in under an hour, just after the peak high tide; a stationary period then takes hold until another surge towards the middle or end of the falling tide. At neap tides, this interaction is less pronounced, and surges instead occur approximately every 12 hours.

Increasing global air temperatures due to climate change take around 10,000 years to directly propagate through the ice before they influence bed temperatures, but may have an effect through increased surface melting, producing more supraglacial lakes. These lakes may feed warm water to glacial bases and facilitate glacial motion. Lakes of a diameter greater than ~300 m are capable of creating a fluid-filled crevasse to the glacier/bed interface. When these crevasses form, the entirety of the lake&#x27;s (relatively warm) contents can reach the base of the glacier in as little as 2–18 hours – lubricating the bed and causing the glacier to surge. Water that reaches the bed of a glacier may freeze there, increasing the thickness of the glacier by pushing it up from below.

===Boundary conditions===

As the margins end at the marine boundary, excess ice is discharged through ice streams or outlet glaciers. Then, it either falls directly into the sea or is accumulated atop the floating ice shelves. Those ice shelves then calve icebergs at their periphery if they experience excess of ice. Ice shelves would also experience accelerated calving due to basal melting. In Antarctica, this is driven by heat fed to the shelf by the circumpolar deep water current, which is 3 °C above the ice&#x27;s melting point.

The presence of ice shelves has a stabilizing influence on the glacier behind them, while an absence of an ice shelf becomes destabilizing. For instance, when Larsen B ice shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula had collapsed over three weeks in February 2002, the four glaciers behind it - Crane Glacier, Green Glacier, Hektoria Glacier and Jorum Glacier - all started to flow at a much faster rate, while the two glaciers (Flask and Leppard) stabilized by the remnants of the ice shelf did not accelerate.

The collapse of the Larsen B shelf was preceded by thinning of just 1 metre per year, while some other Antarctic ice shelves have displayed thinning of tens of metres per year. Further, increased ocean temperatures of 1 °C may lead to up to 10 metres per year of basal melting. Ice shelves are always stable under mean annual temperatures of −9 °C, but never stable above −5 °C; this places regional warming of 1.5 °C, as preceded the collapse of Larsen B, in context.

===Marine ice sheet instability===

In the 1970s, Johannes Weertman proposed that because seawater is denser than ice, then any ice sheets grounded below sea level inherently become less stable as they melt due to Archimedes&#x27; principle. Effectively, these marine ice sheets must have enough mass to exceed the mass of the seawater displaced by the ice, which requires excess thickness. As the ice sheet melts and becomes thinner, the weight of the overlying ice decreases. At a certain point, sea water could force itself into the gaps which form at the base of the ice sheet, and &quot;marine ice sheet instability&quot; (MISI) would occur.

Even if the ice sheet is grounded below the sea level, MISI cannot occur as long as there is a stable ice shelf in front of it. The boundary between the ice sheet and the ice shelf, known as the &quot;grounding line&quot;, is particularly stable if it is constrained in an embayment. In that case, the ice sheet may not be thinning at all, as the amount of ice flowing over the grounding line would be likely to match the annual accumulation of ice from snow upstream. Otherwise, ocean warming at the base of an ice shelf tends to thin it through basal melting. As the ice shelf becomes thinner, it exerts less of a buttressing effect on the ice sheet, the so-called back stress increases and the grounding line is pushed backwards. The ice sheet is likely to start losing more ice from the new location of the grounding line and so become lighter and less capable of displacing seawater. This eventually pushes the grounding line back even further, creating a self-reinforcing mechanism.

====Vulnerable locations====

Because the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet is grounded below the sea level, it would be vulnerable to geologically rapid ice loss in this scenario. In particular, the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers are most likely to be prone to MISI, and both glaciers have been rapidly thinning and accelerating in recent decades. As a result, sea level rise from the ice sheet could be accelerated by tens of centimeters within the 21st century alone.

The majority of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet would not be affected. Totten Glacier is the largest glacier there which is known to be subject to MISI - yet, its potential contribution to sea level rise is comparable to that of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Totten Glacier has been losing mass nearly monotonically in recent decades, suggesting rapid retreat is possible in the near future, although the dynamic behavior of Totten Ice Shelf is known to vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. The Wilkes Basin is the only major submarine basin in Antarctica that is not thought to be sensitive to warming. Ultimately, even geologically rapid sea level rise would still most likely require several millennia for the entirety of these ice masses (WAIS and the subglacial basins) to be lost.

==== Marine ice cliff instability ====

A related process known as &quot;Marine Ice Cliff Instability&quot; (MICI) posits that ice cliffs which exceed ~ in above-ground height and are ~ in basal (underground) height are likely to collapse under their own weight once the peripheral ice stabilizing them is gone. Their collapse then exposes the ice masses following them to the same instability, potentially resulting in a self-sustaining cycle of cliff collapse and rapid ice sheet retreat - i.e. sea level rise of a meter or more by 2100 from Antarctica alone. This theory had been highly influential - in a 2020 survey of 106 experts, the paper which had advanced this theory was considered more important than even the year 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Sea level rise projections which involve MICI are much larger than the others, particularly under high warming rate.

At the same time, this theory has also been highly controversial. It was originally proposed in order to describe how the large sea level rise during the Pliocene and the Last Interglacial could have occurred - yet more recent research found that these sea level rise episodes can be explained without any ice cliff instability taking place. Research in Pine Island Bay in West Antarctica (the location of Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier) had found seabed gouging by ice from the Younger Dryas period which appears consistent with MICI. However, it indicates &quot;relatively rapid&quot; yet still prolonged ice sheet retreat, with a movement of &gt; inland taking place over an estimated 1100 years (from ~12,300 years Before Present to ~11,200 B.P.)

In recent years, 2002-2004 fast retreat of Crane Glacier immediately after the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf (before it reached a shallow fjord and stabilized) could have involved MICI, but there weren&#x27;t enough observations to confirm or refute this theory. The retreat of Greenland ice sheet&#x27;s three largest glaciers - Jakobshavn, Helheim, and Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier - did not resemble predictions from ice cliff collapse at least up until the end of 2013, but an event observed at Helheim Glacier in August 2014 may fit the definition. Further, modelling done after the initial hypothesis indicates that ice-cliff instability would require implausibly fast ice shelf collapse (i.e. within an hour for ~-tall cliffs), unless the ice had already been substantially damaged beforehand. Further, ice cliff breakdown would produce a large number of debris in the coastal waters - known as ice mélange - and multiple studies indicate their build-up would slow or even outright stop the instability soon after it started.

Some scientists - including the originators of the hypothesis, Robert DeConto and David Pollard - have suggested that the best way to resolve the question would be to precisely determine sea level rise during the Last Interglacial. MICI can be effectively ruled out if SLR at the time was lower than , while it is very likely if the SLR was greater than . As of 2023, the most recent analysis indicates that the Last Interglacial SLR is unlikely to have been higher than , as higher values in other research, such as , appear inconsistent with the new paleoclimate data from The Bahamas and the known history of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

== Role in carbon cycle ==
Historically, ice sheets were viewed as inert components of the carbon cycle and were largely disregarded in global models. In 2010s, research had demonstrated the existence of uniquely adapted microbial communities, high rates of biogeochemical and physical weathering in ice sheets, and storage and cycling of organic carbon in excess of 100 billion tonnes.

There is a massive contrast in carbon storage between the two ice sheets. While only about 0.5-27 billion tonnes of pure carbon are present underneath the Greenland ice sheet, 6000-21,000 billion tonnes of pure carbon are thought to be located underneath Antarctica. This carbon can act as a climate change feedback if it is gradually released through meltwater, thus increasing overall carbon dioxide emissions.

For comparison, 1400–1650 billion tonnes are contained within the Arctic permafrost. Also for comparison, the annual human caused carbon dioxide emissions amount to around 40 billion tonnes of .

In Greenland, there is one known area, at Russell Glacier, where meltwater carbon is released into the atmosphere as methane, which has a much larger global warming potential than carbon dioxide. However, it also harbours large numbers of methanotrophic bacteria, which limit those emissions.

==In geologic timescales==

Normally, the transitions between glacial and interglacial states are governed by Milankovitch cycles, which are patterns in insolation (the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth). These patterns are caused by the variations in shape of the Earth&#x27;s orbit and its angle relative to the Sun, caused by the gravitational pull of other planets as they go through their own orbits.

For instance, during at least the last 100,000 years, portions of the ice sheet covering much of North America, the Laurentide Ice Sheet broke apart sending large flotillas of icebergs into the North Atlantic. When these icebergs melted they dropped the boulders and other continental rocks they carried, leaving layers known as ice rafted debris. These so-called Heinrich events, named after their discoverer Hartmut Heinrich, appear to have a 7,000–10,000-year periodicity, and occur during cold periods within the last interglacial.

Internal ice sheet &quot;binge-purge&quot; cycles may be responsible for the observed effects, where the ice builds to unstable levels, then a portion of the ice sheet collapses. External factors might also play a role in forcing ice sheets. Dansgaard–Oeschger events are abrupt warmings of the northern hemisphere occurring over the space of perhaps 40 years. While these D–O events occur directly after each Heinrich event, they also occur more frequently – around every 1500 years; from this evidence, paleoclimatologists surmise that the same forcings may drive both Heinrich and D–O events.

&quot;Hemispheric asynchrony in ice sheet behavior&quot; has been observed by linking short-term spikes of methane in Greenland ice cores and Antarctic ice cores. During Dansgaard–Oeschger events, the northern hemisphere warmed considerably, dramatically increasing the release of methane from wetlands, that were otherwise tundra during glacial times. This methane quickly distributes evenly across the globe, becoming incorporated in Antarctic and Greenland ice. With this tie, paleoclimatologists have been able to say that the ice sheets on Greenland only began to warm after the Antarctic ice sheet had been warming for several thousand years. Why this pattern occurs is still open for debate.

<doc id="493772" wikidata="Q2307169" url="?curid=493772" title="Marco Pirroni">
<text>Marco Francesco Andrea Pirroni (born 27 April 1959) frequently credited simply as Marco, is a British guitarist, songwriter and record producer. He has worked with Adam Ant, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Siouxsie and the Banshees and many others from the late 1970s to the present day.

== Early years ==
Born to Italian parents in Camden Town, London, Pirroni made his first appearance on stage with Siouxsie and the Banshees in their début gig, at 100 Club Punk Festival in 1976. Sid Vicious, future bassist for the Sex Pistols, was on drums. Pirroni also formed a short-lived punk rock band called the Models with future fellow Ants member Terry Lee Miall and future Wolfgang Press member Mick Allen, plus singer Cliff Fox. They recorded a Peel Session and released the single (the first of Marco&#x27;s career) &quot;Freeze&quot;/&quot;Man of the Year&quot; on the Step Forward label in 1977. After his departure from The Models, Pirroni started a new project, Rema-Rema, a short-lived London punk rock group, consisting of Gary Asquith (guitar/vocals), Marco Pirroni, Michael Allen (bass/vocals), Mark Cox (keyboards) and Dorothy Prior (drums, generally known only as &quot;Max&quot;). The band released a four-track EP, &quot;Wheel in the Roses&quot; (released 1980 on 4AD), featured one side of studio recordings and another of live material. However, the group dissolved when Marco Pirroni joined Adam and the Ants.

== Adam and the Ants/Adam Ant ==
Pirroni was lead guitarist and co-songwriter in the second incarnation of Adam and the Ants, co-penning two UK number one singles and a further four Top Ten hits, with Ant. The two albums he co-wrote for Adam and the Ants, &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; and &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, both made the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart (&quot;Kings&quot; number 1; &quot;Prince Charming&quot; number 2).

When Adam and the Ants disbanded in 1982, Pirroni was retained as Adam Ant&#x27;s co-writer and studio guitarist; they produced another number-one single (&quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot;) and an album (&quot;Friend or Foe&quot;), followed by four more Top 20 hits. Ant and Pirroni won two shared Ivor Novello Awards for &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;.
== The Wolfmen ==
Pirroni was a member of the Wolfmen with Chris Constantinou. They released one EP, several singles, wrote music for television advertisements and released a début album, entitled &quot;Modernity Killed Every Night&quot;. The Wolfmen released their second album, &quot;Married to the Eiffel Tower&quot;, in 2011.

== Personal life ==
After living in London&#x27;s Marylebone for several years, Pirroni relocated to north Derbyshire in 2013.

<text>Chippawa is a community located within the city of Niagara Falls, Ontario.

The village was founded in 1850, and became part of the City of Niagara Falls, Ontario by amalgamation in 1970. It is located on the Canadian shore of the Niagara River about 2 km upstream from Niagara Falls. It is bisected by the Welland River (also known locally as Chippawa Creek or The Crick). In historic documents, the name of the village and the river is sometimes spelled as Chippewa or Chippeway.

== Early history ==


=== First Nations ===
While the area has undoubtedly been populated by First Nations people for many thousands of years, very few details from times before European contact are known.

The French encountered a group of people whom they called the &quot;Neutral Indians&quot;, because they lived between the more powerful and combative Huron to the north and Iroquois to the south, but were not involved in their wars (at least in recorded time).

Eventually, however, the Neutral nation was wiped out by the Iroquois and almost nothing of their culture survives - the name by which they called themselves is unknown.

Following the extermination of the Neutrals, the area was abandoned by the Iroquois and settled by a branch of the Chippewa nation, originating the former name of the river and subsequently the name of the village. The Mississauga, a branch of the Ojibwa, were actually the tribe present when the British first colonized the area and were the very first to sign a treaty in what is now Canada with the British government , giving the British access to a one-mile strip of land on the western shore of the Niagara to replace the portage they had lost on the eastern shore after the New England colonies separated from British rule. The Ojibwe made the area one of the stopping area when migrating from the Atlantic region.

Once Niagara-On-The-Lake filled up with United Empire Loyalists the British began giving land grants to U.E.L and British veterans to settle in the late 18th century.

The name of the principal village of the Neutrals – &quot;Onghiara&quot; (located on the present-day site of Niagara on the Lake was mispronounced by the Chippewa as &quot;Nyahgeah&quot;, and again by Europeans as &quot;Niagara&quot;, making this word one of the few remnants of Neutral culture.

=== Earliest settlers ===
The first permanent settler of European descent in what is now Chippawa was Thomas Cummings. He was a United Empire Loyalist from Albany, New York who settled on the south side of the Welland River in 1783.

Later that same year, John Burch settled on the north side of the Welland River, and in 1786, he built saw- and gristmills along the Niagara River.

== Military history ==

=== Fort Chippawa ===
A fort was built in 1791 (at the present day site of Kings Bridge park) to defend the south end of the Portage Road and the King&#x27;s Bridge (discussed in the Transportation section). This was also known as Fort Welland and consisted of a log blockhouse surrounded by a stockade.

=== War of 1812 ===

A plain at Usshers Creek (about 2 km south of Chippawa, and then called Streets Creek) was the site of the Battle of Chippawa on July 5, 1814, and also the site of the American camp to which they retired following the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane on July 25, 1814.

After the War of 1812, Chippawa also became the home of Laura Secord, remembered for carrying information to the British regarding American advances before the Battle of Beaverdams. She lived in the village until her death at the age of 93.

== Transportation ==
=== Navigation and the Portage road ===
Chippawa is the limit of navigation on the Upper Niagara River. Before the construction of the Welland Canal, to reach Lake Ontario all cargo and passengers had to be unloaded and carried overland to navigable waters below the falls

Before the War of American Independence, all cargo was carried on the American side of the river. Following this, British interests required a route within their territory. A survey conducted in 1790 reserved a strip one chain wide between Chippawa and Queenston, Ontario as a public road, which would become the Portage Road.

Most of this road remains today, following its original winding route in contrast to the rectangular grid of other Niagara Falls streets.

King&#x27;s Bridge, constructed about 1790, was the very first bridge over the Welland River. It was at the mouth of the river, closer to the Niagara than today&#x27;s bridge. Sketches by Lady Simcoe (wife of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe) and deputy postmaster George Heriot each show a bridge consisting of pilings driven into the river with a wooden deck.

The bridge was of great military importance as the only crossing of the river. A survey available in the Brock University Special Collections indicates that this was a drawbridge. This survey also shows a new bridge at the location of the current one.

During the first several years that the Welland Canal operated, it did not reach Lake Erie directly. All canal traffic was lowered in a lock at Port Robinson, Ontario to the Welland River, and subsequently sailed to Chippawa, reaching Lake Erie via the Niagara River. Ships entering and leaving the Niagara faced a difficult and dangerous turn into a swift current. The Welland River curved downstream into the Niagara and ships rounding this point were in danger of being swept over the falls.

That problem was resolved by construction of the Chippawa Cut in 1829. This short canal allowed ships to turn upstream into the Niagara River directly and avoid the most severe currents. The cut is depicted in the survey mentioned above.

By the mid-1830s, the Welland Canal had been extended to enter Lake Erie at Port Colborne, Ontario, but commercial navigation on the river continued for roughly another century. In 1843, over 100 steamers carried passengers and some freight on a route that followed the Niagara River from Buffalo, New York, then into the Welland River at Chippawa, joining the Welland Canal at Port Robinson, and subsequently via the Feeder Canal to Dunnville, Ontario and up the Grand River to Brantford, Ontario.

While commercial shipping no longer exists in Chippawa, pleasure boating continues and marina facilities can be found at Lyon&#x27;s Creek just west of the village. Somewhat farther to the west is a relic of the days of commercial shipping – the Montrose Swing Bridge still carries a railway track over the river even though it has not opened for a ship in about 75 years.

=== Railways ===

==== Erie and Ontario Railway ====
Even with the Welland Canal providing access between the lakes in the 1830s, the portage road was still carrying a great deal of people and cargo. The canal took over 24 hours to pass through, and could not handle the largest ships of the day. It was inevitable that a railway would be built to streamline movement around Niagara Falls.

The Erie and Ontario railroad opened for traffic in 1839. It had wooden rails with iron straps laid on them and was pulled by horses. This was the first railway in the Niagara Peninsula. By 1854, steam power took over for the horses. A year later, the railway was extended to Niagara (the present day Niagara on the Lake), and in the 1860s, was extended to Fort Erie, Ontario at the source of the Niagara River. The line was now known as the Erie and Niagara. This route became the Canada Southern Railway&#x27;s Niagara Division and operated into the 20th century. A short section remains in service today as an industrial spur, ending at north side of the Welland River. This is the only active railway in Chippawa today, and there is no passenger service.

The stone piers which once carried this railway over the Welland River on a swing bridge are still present.

==== Niagara Falls Park and River Railway ====
The Niagara Falls Park and River Railway was trolley line was constructed along the Niagara River between Chippawa and Queenston in 1893. The line crossed the Welland River on a bridge at Cummings Lane and proceeded about 1.5 km south to Slater&#x27;s Dock (also known as Chippawa Landing), where it connected with steamboats from Buffalo. The railway carried passengers to Queenston, where connections were made with steamboats to Toronto, Ontario and other points on Lake Ontario. Moreover, it carried tourists to the falls and connected with the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway, which provided interurban service to St. Catharines, Ontario. With the decline of boat service from Buffalo and establishment of through rail service, the line to Slater&#x27;s Dock was abandoned in the early 20th century and service was cut back to the village of Chippawa.

Most of this line was combined with a parallel route on the American side and lasted until 1932 as the Niagara Gorge Railroad (also known as the &quot;Great Gorge Route&quot;, or the &quot;Niagara Belt Line&quot;). Although pamphlets and advertisements for the Great Gorge Route show service only as far as Niagara Falls, historic maps of the area show tracks leading to the north side of the Welland River until at least 1934.

=== Modern road access ===
Chippawa does not lie on any major highways. Four main streets lead to the village, all converging at the bridge over the Welland River.

The Niagara Parkway provides access to the village from both the North and South. Main Street, which changes into Lyons Creek Road outside of the village, makes the most direct connection with a major highway - the Queen Elizabeth Way 6 km away. The last main route is the original Portage Road, linking to the business area of Niagara Falls.

=== Bicycle and pedestrian routes ===
The Niagara Heritage Trail passes along the eastern edge of Chippawa, crossing the Welland River via the control dam right at the junction with the Niagara River. This paved walking and cycling trail runs from Niagara on the Lake to Fort Erie. Furthermore, Lyon&#x27;s Creek Road has paved shoulders for cyclists, and the Chippawa Parkway on the north side of the river is paved and highly suitable for cycling or walking.

=== Public transit ===
Niagara Falls Transit provides local bus service between the village and the main part of Niagara Falls. Routes 106, 112, and 206 serves the vicinity.

== Business and industry ==

Many industries have been located either within the municipal boundaries of Chippawa, or just a short distance outside the village boundaries:

=== Historic industry ===

Shipbuilding industries were established on both banks of the river before 1840. A foundry which manufactured boilers and engines was constructed at approximately the same time. Chippawa was also home to one of the largest distilleries, along with gristmills, sawmills, tanneries, and iron, brass and tin manufacturing. Later, the Norton Company began manufacturing abrasives at Chippawa.

=== Present-day industry ===
The Norton Abrasives plant still exists, now part of the Saint-Gobain corporation. This is the largest manufacturing industry in the immediate area of Chippawa. Residents are also able to get their groceries from the local Foodland grocery store.

=== Hydroelectric power ===
Being above Niagara Falls, Chippawa is the location of water intakes to electric power plants located below the falls. The Welland River is used as an intake from the Niagara River to feed a power canal originating west of the village, leading to reservoirs on the Niagara Escarpment above Queenston. This diversion actually causes the Welland River to flow backwards from its natural direction, taking water out of the Niagara River. Reconfiguration of the mouth of the Welland River to accommodate this purpose has completely eliminated the Chippawa Cut, as well as the island it had created (known as Hog&#x27;s or Hogg&#x27;s Island). It also eliminated the original channel of the river, which is now part of King&#x27;s Bridge park.
A short distance north of the village along the Niagara Parkway can be seen two monolithic structures – gates to tunnels which also carry water to the generating stations.

== Tourism ==
The Chippawa area is home to golf courses, parks, the historic field of the Battle of Chippawa, as well as attractive architecture and a quiet atmosphere located a very short distance from the extremely busy Niagara Falls. Marineland is also located just outside the village. While not home to the major hotels, Chippawa does have several smaller establishments, antiques shops, Chippawa House and Chippawa Town Hall

== Notable people==
In addition to Laura Secord, Chippawa was also home to film director James Cameron, director of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;. The village commemorates this on both the street sign for Parkway Drive which is decorated to look like a film strip, and the village&#x27;s welcome sign which is decorated with the words &quot;Home of James Cameron&quot;.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album has been awarded since 1959. The award is generally given to the album&#x27;s producers, principal vocalist(s), and the composer and lyricist if they have written a new score which comprises 51% or more playing time of the album, though the number of recipients has varied over the category&#x27;s tenure.

The inaugural award was presented at the 1st Grammy Awards to composer Meredith Willson for his work on his 1957 musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;. Ethel Merman and Gwen Verdon became the first female recipients the in 1960 when they tied for &quot;Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Redhead&quot;. Stephen Sondheim and Thomas Z. Shepard hold the record for most wins in the category, with six each, while Sondheim holds the record for most nominations, with eleven. Tommy Krasker holds the record for most nominations without a win, with eight. To date, two-time recipient Phillipa Soo is the only woman to win more than one award (for &quot;Hamilton&quot; and &quot;Into the Woods)&quot;. Among shows, cast recordings from &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, and &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; have been nominated four times each respectively, while &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; are the only shows to win twice. &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; hold the record for most nominations without a win, with three. The current recipient of the award is &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, which won at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025.

==Process==
Over the years, the qualifications for the individual nominees has fluctuated with principal artists, composers, and producers at one point being the sole eligible nominee, to the current (as of the 66th Grammy Awards) standard which is as follows: &quot;For albums containing greater than 51% playing time of new recordings. Award to the principal vocalist(s), and the album producer(s) of 50% or more playing time of the album. The lyricist(s) and composer(s) of 50 % or more of a score of a new recording are eligible for an Award if any previous recording of said score has not been nominated in this category.&quot;

Vocalists were first awarded in this category at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012. When an album does not feature any individual soloists and predominantly features an ensemble cast, no individual award is given to the members of the ensemble, with each member instead receiving a winners certificate. As of the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, only a maximum of four principal vocalists can be awarded (previously unlimited), in addition to the producer/s and lyricists/composers.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year.

<text>The Avro Type 694 Lincoln is a British four-engined heavy bomber, which first flew on 9 June 1944. Developed from the Avro Lancaster, the first Lincoln variants were initially known as the Lancaster IV and V; these were renamed Lincoln I and II. It was the penultimate piston-engined bomber operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF).

The Lincoln attained operational status in August 1945. It had been initially assigned to units of the Tiger Force, a Commonwealth heavy bomber force which had been intended to play a role in the Japan campaign in the closing stages of the Second World War, but the war ended before the Lincoln could participate. Production of the type proceeded and the type was adopted in quantity, complementing and progressively replacing the Lancaster in RAF service during the late 1940s.

The Lincoln was deployed on operations during the 1950s. RAF squadrons equipped with the type fought against guerrilla fighters during the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya; the RAF and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) also operated the Lincoln during the Malayan Emergency. The type also saw significant peacetime service with the RAF, RAAF and the Argentine Air Force. Lincolns were also operated in civil aviation, including use as aerial test beds for aero-engine research.

In RAF service, the Lincoln was replaced by a new generation of bombers using jet propulsion. In 1967, the last Lincoln bombers in Argentinian service were retired.

==Design and development==
===Origins===

The Avro Lincoln originated from a design produced by Roy Chadwick as a development of the earlier Lancaster bomber which had been produced with the purpose of conforming with the requirements of the Specification B.14/43. Known initially as the &quot;Lancaster IV&quot; and &quot;Lancaster V&quot;, the envisioned aircraft, while bearing considerable similarity to the Lancaster, featured numerous improvements, such as the adoption of stronger, longer span, higher aspect ratio (10.30 compared with 8.02) wings along with two-stage supercharged Rolls-Royce Merlin 85 engines fitted within Universal Power Plant (UPP) installations. The new bomber also possessed an enlarged fuselage that accommodated increased fuel and bomb loads and allowed up to 11 tons of various armaments and equipment fittings including the Grand Slam bomb to be carried. It had a higher operational ceiling and longer range than its Lancaster predecessor, being capable of a maximum altitude of and a maximum range of .
The prototype Lancaster IV, later renamed the &quot;Lincoln I&quot;, was assembled by Avro&#x27;s experimental flight department at Manchester&#x27;s Ringway Airport. According to aviation author Kev Delve, development of the Lincoln had proceeded relatively smoothly. On 9 June 1944, the prototype conducted its maiden flight from Ringway Airport. Testing of the prototype quickly proved it to have favourable flight characteristics. In February 1945, the first production Lincoln was completed.

The type was mainly produced at Avro&#x27;s Woodford, Cheshire and Chadderton Lancashire factories; additional aircraft were also constructed by Armstrong Whitworth at their Coventry facilities. Separate production lines were also established in Canada and Australia, although, as a consequence of the end of the war, production in Canada was halted after only a single aircraft had been constructed. Production in Australia went ahead: the Lincolns that were manufactured there were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

During early 1945, the British Government immediately set about restoring the country to a peacetime stance, which involved the demobilisation of the military and, more specifically, the disbanding of many squadrons of the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a part of cost-saving measures. A new emphasis was soon placed on &#x27;quality over quantity&#x27; during the rationalisation process, seeking to employ fewer but more capable aircraft to perform their envisioned roles; while there was no longer any urgency in bringing new types of aircraft into service, limited procurement of equipment that fell within this ethos did proceed. In accordance with this aim, the British Air Ministry proceeded to formulate and release Specification B.14/43, which sought an improved piston-engined heavy bomber to replace the wartime four-engine bombers, the Short Stirling, the Handley Page Halifax, and the Avro Lancaster.

===Further development===
One Lincoln B Mk XV pattern aircraft was completed in Canada by Victory Aircraft; a follow-up order for a total of six RCAF variants was cancelled shortly following the end of hostilities. Along with two additional Lincoln (Mk I and Mk II) aircraft on loan from the RAF, the type was briefly evaluated postwar by the RCAF. The Lancaster V/Lincoln II differed mainly in that it was fitted with Merlin 68A engines.

Prior to the Lincoln being developed, the Australian government had already formulated plans for its Department of Aircraft Production (DAP), later known as the Government Aircraft Factory (GAF), to construct the earlier Lancaster Mk III. In its place, it was decided to proceed with manufacturing a variant of the Lincoln I, re-designated the Lincoln Mk 30, to replace the Consolidated Liberators. This model was manufactured between 1946 and 1949, and is the largest aircraft ever constructed in Australia. Orders for a total of 85 Mk 30 Lincolns were placed by the RAAF, although only 73 were produced.

The first five Australian examples (&quot;A73–1&quot; to &quot;A73–5&quot;), were assembled at Fishermans Bend using a large proportion of imported British-made components. On 17 March 1946, &quot;A73-1&quot; conducted its début flight; the first entirely Australian-built Lincoln, &quot;A73-6&quot;, was formally delivered in November 1946. The Mk 30 initially used four Merlin 85 engines, this arrangement was later changed to a combination of two outboard Merlin 66s and two inboard Merlin 85s. A further improved later version, designated Lincoln Mk 30A, had four Merlin 102s.

During the 1950s, the RAAF heavily modified some of their Mk 30 aircraft to perform anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions, re-designating them &quot;Lincoln GR.Mk 31&quot;. These examples had a longer nose to house acoustic submarine detection gear and its operators, larger fuel tanks to provide the aircraft with a 13-hour flight endurance, and a modified bomb bay to accommodate torpedoes. According to pilot feedback, the Lincoln Mk 31 was particularly difficult to land at night, as the bomber had a tailwheel undercarriage and the long nose obstructed the pilot&#x27;s view of the runway. In 1952, 18 aircraft were rebuilt to this standard, and were reallocated new serial numbers accordingly. Ten were subsequently upgraded to the MR.Mk 31 standard, which included an updated radar.

Further aircraft were also derived from the Lincoln. A dedicated maritime patrol aircraft, designated the Avro Shackleton, was developed for the RAF and the South African Air Force (SAAF). Additionally, Avro decided to develop a commercial airliner, known as the Tudor, which harnessed elements of the Lincoln, such as its wings, in combination with various new elements, such as the adoption of a pressurised fuselage, to perform passenger operations.

==Operational history==

===Royal Air Force===

During 1945, the RAF received its first Lincoln, which was delivered to No. 57 Squadron based at RAF East Kirkby, Lincolnshire. In August 1945, No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron began to re-equip with the Lincoln at RAF Spilsby, Lincolnshire. However, No. 75 (NZ) Sqn had received just three aircraft prior to VJ Day, and was disbanded quickly thereafter.

During the postwar climate, the Lincoln quickly equipped the bomber squadrons of the RAF. Nearly 600 Lincolns were constructed to equip a total of 29 RAF squadrons, the majority of which were based in the United Kingdom. They were supplemented and partially replaced by 88 Boeing Washingtons, on loan from the USAF, which had longer range and could reach targets inside the Iron Curtain. Small numbers remained in use with Nos 7, 83 and 97 Squadrons until the end of 1955, at which point the type was phased out, having been replaced by the first of the V bombers.

During the 1950s, RAF Lincolns participated in operations in Kenya against Mau-Mau insurgents. During this action, they were operated from Eastleigh. The Lincoln was also deployed to Malaya during the Malayan Emergency, where it was used against insurgents aligned to the Malayan Communist Party. In Malayan theatre, RAF Lincolns were operated from Changi Air Base and Tengah Air Base. In excess of 3,000 sorties were flown during their -year deployment, during which half a million pounds of bombs dropped, 85 per cent of the total bomb tonnage dropped during the Malayan emergency.
On 12 March 1953, an RAF Lincoln (&quot;RF531&quot; &quot;C&quot;) of Central Gunnery School was shot down 20 mi (32 km) NE of Lüneburg, Germany by several Soviet MiG-15s as it flew to Berlin on a radar reconnaissance flight, killing the seven crew members.

In November 1955, four Lincolns of No. 7 Squadron RAF were detached for duties in British territories in the Middle East. In Bahrain, they carried out border patrols of the then Trucial States at the time of the Buraimi dispute. When 7 Sqn was disbanded in December 1955, the four detached crews and aircraft became No. 1426 Flight RAF, officially a photographic reconnaissance unit. It was later sent to Aden, carrying out patrols in the lead-up to the Aden Emergency.

As the RAF Lincolns became unserviceable, primarily due to progressive wear and tear, they were replaced by a variety of jet-powered aircraft. The Lincolns of Bomber Command were phased out from the mid-1950s and had been completely replaced by jet bombers by 1963. The last Lincolns in RAF service were five operated by No. 151 Squadron, Signals Command, at RAF Watton, Norfolk, which were retired on 12 March 1963.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
From late 1946, Australian-built Lincolns were phased into No. 82 Wing, based at RAAF Base Amberley, Ipswich, Queensland. The type quickly replaced the Liberator bombers that had been operated by 12, 21 and 23 Squadrons. In February 1948, these units were renumbered 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively; a fourth RAAF Lincoln squadron, No. 10 was formed on 17 March 1949 at RAAF Townsville as a reconnaissance unit.

During the 1950s, RAAF Lincolns participated in combat operations in Malaya, operating alongside RAF examples. The RAAF based the B.Mk 30s of No.1 Squadron at Tengah, for the duration of operations in Malaya.

These Lincolns served with 10 Squadron RAAF at RAAF Base Townsville, Garbutt, Queensland; the discovery of corrosion in the wing spars led to the type&#x27;s premature retirement in 1961. The Lincoln MR.Mk 31 was the final variant to see service in Australia.

===Argentine Air Force===
From 1947, the Lincoln bomber served with the &quot;Fuerza Aerea Argentina&quot;; Argentina had procured a total of 30 aircraft, together with a batch of 15 secondhand Lancasters. The adoption of the Lincoln effectively gave Argentina the most powerful bombing force in South America. Eighteen of these Lincolns were newly built, along with twelve ex-RAF aircraft. In 1947, the type entered service with &quot;I Grupo de Bombardeo&quot; of &quot;V Brigada Aérea&quot;. By the beginning of 1965, eleven of these remained in operational use, the majority of these were retired during the next year. In 1967, the final examples of the Lincoln were retired.

The Argentine aircraft were used in bombing missions against domestic rebels. Lincolns were deployed during an attempted military coup conducted in September 1951, the type was also used by both the government and rebel forces during the 1955 &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; coup which resulted in Argentinian President Juan Perón being deposed.

Argentine Lincolns were also used to conduct supply airdrops in support of Argentine operations in the Antarctic region. In 1948, one of the bombers was returned to Avro for modification at RAF Langar in Nottinghamshire to allow it to operate these Antarctic support flights; the changes included the addition of Lancastrian nose and tail cones, additional fuel tanks, and removal of armament; this led to the aircraft becoming the first Avro Lincolnian. Modified as such, the aircraft received a civilian registration and was named &quot;Cruz del Sur&quot;; it undertook its first aerial supply flight to the Antarctic San Martín Base in December 1951.

==Use in aero-engine research==
Lincolns were frequently employed as testbeds in new jet engine development. &quot;RF403&quot;, &quot;RE339/G&quot; and &quot;SX972&quot; flew with a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Python turboprops outboard in place of the Merlins, and was used for the ballistic casing drop-test programme for the Blue Danube atomic weapon. &quot;SX972&quot; was further modified to fly with a pair of Bristol Proteus turboprops. &quot;RA716/G&quot; had a similarly placed pair of Bristol Theseus turboprops and later also flew with Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets replacing the pair of turboprops. Lincoln Test Bed &quot;RF530&quot; kept its Merlins but had a Napier Naiad turboprop in the nose. It later flew, bearing the civilian &quot;Class B&quot; test registration &quot;G-37-1&quot;, with a similarly placed Rolls-Royce Tyne which it displayed at the 1956 Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) show, making a low level flypast on just the nose Tyne, the four Merlins being shut down and propellers feathered.&quot;SX973&quot; had a Napier Nomad diesel turbo-compound installed in a similar nose-mounted installation. &quot;RA643&quot; flew with a Bristol Phoebus turbojet in the bomb bay, and &quot;SX971&quot; had an afterburning Rolls-Royce Derwent mounted ventrally.

==Commercial service==
A pair of Lincoln IIs were operated by D. Napier &amp; Son Ltd. for icing research from 1948 to 1962. A transport conversion of the Lincoln II, using the streamlined nose and tail cones of the Lancastrian and a ventral cargo pannier, was known as the Avro 695 Lincolnian.

One Lincoln Freighter Mk.2 G-ALPF, former RAF RE290, converted by Airflight Ltd. was used on the Berlin Air Lift by Surrey Flying Services Ltd.

Four Lincolnian conversions by Field Aircraft Services for use as meat haulers in Paraguay were not delivered and subsequently scrapped.

<text>Vale Tudo or vale-tudo (; ), also known as No Holds Barred (NHB) in the United States, is an unarmed, full-contact combat sport with relatively few rules. It became popular in Brazil during the 20th century and would eventually evolve into modern mixed martial arts (MMA). For years, &quot;Vale Tudo&quot; was used as a synonym for MMA in Brazil, but the term fell into disuse due to the emergence of stricter rules and the influence of the media to have a more &quot;civilized&quot; name. It is now used to refer to an early, more rules-free stage of the modern sport.

Vale Tudo initially started as an informal ruleset for fighters from different martial arts to fight each other. The Gracie family was known to organize their famous &quot;Gracie Challenge&quot;, where they would fight other martial artists in Vale Tudo bouts to prove the efficiency and superiority of their own Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Many fighters eventually started to train specifically for Vale Tudo events, mixing striking and grappling, eventually advertising &quot;Vale Tudo&quot; as its own standalone style. For example, Marco Ruas referred to his hybrid style of Luta Livre and Muay Thai striking simply as &quot;Vale Tudo&quot;.

==History==

===1920s–1980s===
Fighting sideshows called &quot;vale tudo&quot; became popular in Brazilian circuses during the 1920s. Examples of such bouts were described in the &quot;Japanese-American Courier&quot; on October 4, 1928:

However, this circus term did not enter popular use until 1959–1960, when it was used to describe the style-versus-style bouts featured in a Rio television show called &quot;Heróis do Ringue&quot; (&quot;Heroes of the Ring&quot;). The matchmakers and hosts of the show included members of the Gracie family, including Carlson Gracie and Carley Gracie. The participants were all legitimate practitioners of their styles. The Gracie family, which had origins in the circus business, devised the &quot;Gracie Challenge&quot;, where they would invite or be challenged by opponents from other martial arts to a Vale Tudo match to prove the effectiveness of their Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. The Gracies would hold their challenges behind closed doors at their gyms, but in some cases they realised public events too.

One night during the show, João Alberto Barreto (later a referee for UFC 1) was competing against a man trained in Luta Livre. Barreto caught his opponent in an armbar and the man refused to submit. Barreto broke the man&#x27;s arm. Consequently, the show was canceled and soon replaced by a professional wrestling show called Telecatch.

From 1960 onwards, Vale Tudo remained mostly an underground subculture, with most fights taking place in martial arts dojos or small gymnasiums. The Vale Tudo subculture was based in Rio de Janeiro, but many fights took place in the northern region, the southern region and the Bahia state, where Capoeira is prevalent. The scene in Rio de Janeiro focused mainly on the intense rivalry between Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Luta Livre. Fights in the other regions featured more diverse martial arts competing in the events.

In 1980 and 1984 Rickson Gracie fought two events against Casimiro de Nascimento Martins (&quot;Rei Zulu&quot;), father of Zuluzinho. Both events were proceeded with public interest and they filled the Maracanãzinho stadium in Rio de Janeiro. They brought public mediatic attention back to Vale Tudo, which had been dormant since the 1960s. This was made possible by Robson Gracie&#x27;s ascension into the Presidency of the Sports Superintendence of the State of Rio de Janeiro in 1980, appointed by Leonel Brizola, whom Robson had a friendship as a bodyguard. 

In 1984 at the Maracanãzinho it was held the &quot;Noite das Artes Marciais&quot; (&quot;Night of the Martial Arts&quot;) also known as &#x27; (&quot;Jiu-Jitsu vs Martial Arts&quot;), fought by representatives of BJJ against representatives of Muay Thai, Kung Fu, Kickboxing and Luta Livre. Future UFC 7 champion Marco Ruas participated, with a draw against BJJ representative Fernando Pinduka. There was also a match between Rei Zulu versus Kickboxing world champion, and future promoter of the International Vale Tudo Championship and manager of multiple Brazilians in MMA and K-1, Sérgio Batarelli. And in 1991 the most famous event happened: &#x27; between representatives of both martial arts. The event was organized after BJJ practitioners almost got into a brawl with Luta Livre fighters, after they invaded a BJJ tournament in order to fight Wallid Ismail, as he had issued an insult and a challenge at a local newspaper against Luta Livre. The Luta Livre fighters were convinced to stand down and instead fight in a public challenge. Robson Gracie, organizer of the event, convinced TV Globo, Brazil&#x27;s largest network, to broadcast the event live under the assumption it was a pure grappling event, the rules were later changed to Vale Tudo but Globo kept the program. The actual event would see 3 matches, all with victories by Jiu-Jitsu representatives. August 29, 1993—a few months before the first UFC event—also saw the event &quot;&quot; in Curitiba, fought between c&quot;apoeiristas&quot; against Thai boxers from the Chute Boxe Academy. It was the introduction of several future MMA fighters such as Rafael Cordeiro, Jose &#x27;Pelé&#x27; Landi-Jons and Nilson de Castro, and was the first Vale Tudo/MMA event in Curitiba, a future MMA center.

===1993–2000s===

In the 1970s, Rorion Gracie of the famous Gracie family emigrated to the United States and introduced Vale Tudo to a new market when he, together with American entrepreneur Art Davie, helped found the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993. The event was advertised as a competition where fighters would each represent different martial arts in a single-elimination tournament without weight classes and no rules—although there were three rules: no biting, eye-gouging or fish-hooking. To pitch the event for TV executives, Gracie and Davie used the footage of the Gracie Challenges and Vale Tudo events in Brazil where the family had participated. The first event was named &quot;The Ultimate Fighting Championship&quot; (later retroactively renamed to UFC 1). Rorion&#x27;s younger brother, Royce Gracie represented Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and won the event after submitting three opponents in succession. The event was a success and attracted some attention from the public and the media, and more editions were realized. The UFC also pioneered the &quot;promotion&quot; model for Vale Tudo/Mixed Martial arts, instead of promoters arranging one-off events like before.

Inspired by the format of the UFC, many new promotions of Vale Tudo were created. Some of the noteworthy promotions of this time in Brazil include &quot;Universal Vale Tudo Fighting,&quot; &quot;Brazilian Vale Tudo Fighting, Brazil Open, Super Challenge&quot; and &quot;Mo Team League&quot;. Besides the UFC, the United States also saw the introduction of Vale Tudo promotions similar to the UFC, such as the Battlecade Extreme Fighting and World Combat Championship in 1995. Vale Tudo would receive the name No Holds Barred (NHB) in the United States.

In Japan, former professional wrestler Satoru Sayama had created in 1985 a hybrid martial arts organization named Shooto, which featured striking with all limbs, takedowns, groundfighting and submissions. Impressed by the UFC, in 1994 he introduced Vale Tudo to Japan by organizing the Vale Tudo Japan tournament, which was more rules-free compared to previous Shooto rules. Rickson Gracie won the 1994 and 1995 editions of the tournament, making him famous in Japan. In 1997 PRIDE Fighting Championships was founded in order to match Rickson Gracie with popular Japanese shoot-style professional wrestler Nobuhiko Takada. The rules of PRIDE were modelled after the ones from Vale Tudo Japan with some modifications. The first event of the organization had an attendance of 47,000 fans and attracted the attention of Japanese mass media and soon PRIDE became one of the largest and most popular combat sports organization in the world, and it helped to popularize MMA.

However, in the United States there was a backlash against the violent nature of the nascent sport. In 1996, Senator John McCain saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent. McCain himself led a campaign to ban the UFC, calling it &quot;human cockfighting&quot;, thirty-six states followed his campaign, and the event was blacklisted from television. In response, the UFC started to implement more restrictive rules, weight categories and judges, eventually evolving into the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. The name &quot;Mixed Martial Arts&quot; was also devised at this time as they felt the term NHB was detrimental to the public image of the sport and better represented the new evolution of the sport after the introduction of the new rules.

In Brazil, Vale Tudo eventually met similar obstacles to those faced in the US. In 1997 there was the creation of a major event named &quot;Pentagon Combat&quot;, with a pentagonal cage similar to the UFC&#x27;s Octagon, counted with veterans Oleg Taktarov and Murilo Bustamante, and sponsored by Prince Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, later known for his creation of the ADCC and investment in BJJ. The main event continued the Luta Livre-Jiu-Jitsu rivalry by matching LL representative Eugenio Tadeu and BJJ representative Renzo Gracie, both who also had a very personal rivalry. The fight went a back-and-forth between both contestants until members of the audience approached the cage and started to shout insults and interfere in the bout by attacking the contestants, Gracie fought back one of his attackers and soon the confusion soon escalated into a full riot, as people threw chairs into the ring, supporters of both fighters brawled, warning shots were allegedly fired by security and the lights were turned off by the promoters to control the fight. The event was broadcast live on national television by Rede Globo&#x27;s SporTV. The confusion resulted in the state of Rio de Janeiro banning Vale Tudo events for almost 10 years. Footage of the brawl was used by CNN in a special report order to condemn the sport in the United States.

As the UFC and similar promotions started to receive more rules. The premier organizations of the late 1990s became the World Vale Tudo Championship (WVC) and the International Vale Tudo Championship (IVC). The WVC was organized in 1996 by Frederico Lapenda and Sérgio Batarelli, the due promoted together four events, including Brazil&#x27;s first Vale Tudo/MMA pay-per-view, but soon a dispute between the two led to Batarelli to leave and create the IVC. The two promotions featured prominently throughout the 1990s as they were also televised on Brazilian TV and pay-per-view. The WVC and IVC were based in the Brazilian financial capital of São Paulo and launched the careers of many of today&#x27;s MMA stars. While based in Brazil, they also did international events: WVC did events in Japan, Aruba and Jamaica, while the IVC had events in Venezuela, Portugal and F.R of Yugoslavia. However, after the state of São Paulo prohibited Vale Tudo from being a sanctioned sport, both promotions went into decline and have not staged an event since 2002.

=== 2000s–present ===
Beginning in the early 2000s, newer promotions such as Jungle Fight and Bitetti Combat abandoned traditional Vale Tudo rules in favor of the safer mixed martial arts &quot;Unified&quot; rules. However, some promotions continued the use of traditional rules for a time, most notably Meca World Vale Tudo and Rio Heroes.

&quot;Vale Tudo&quot; was still used as a synonym for MMA in Brazil throughout the 2000s, the term started to be dropped as the sport grew and Brazilian media started to cover MMA events, first with RedeTV! covering UFC events in 2009, and in 2011 it was picked by Brazil&#x27;s largest network Rede Globo.

Today, all major events use MMA rules, according to former IVC and WVC promoter Sérgio Batarelli in an interview to Brazilian online news G1 he affirmed: &quot;But fighting with the rules from before is impossible. It&#x27;s over. [...] It&#x27;s the beginnings. There&#x27;s no way back. Even because there are very few fighters who would venture into something like this.&quot;

Vale Tudo events are still taking place in small numbers around Brazil. Due to the violent and bloody nature of the sport, these underground events sometimes cause controversy in the media. Critics of the sport argue that Vale Tudo shows should all adopt the MMA &quot;Unified&quot; ruleset created in the United States by Athletic Commissions, and used by various other countries such as Canada and England. On the other hand, supporters of Vale Tudo criticize the Unified Rules, pointing out that there is no medical proof that the Unified Rules are safer, no contestant has ever been killed or permanently disabled while fighting under traditional rules, the Unified Rules were created not for safety, but to ban techniques that commissioners saw as &quot;uncivilised&quot; (such as the soccer kick and headbutt), that the Unified Rules set is not used in Japanese, Russian, Singaporean and Thai promotions, and so on. Proponents also counter that the style of mixed martial arts fighting created by the Unified Rules is now so different from traditional Vale Tudo that it should be treated as an entirely different sport, just as kickboxing is considered different from Muay Thai.

== As a fighting style ==
As Vale Tudo became more popular and common, some fighters started training specifically for Vale Tudo contests rather than fighting with purely one style, taking the most effective techniques from both striking and grappling martial arts and synthesized them for the ruleset of Vale Tudo, eventually billing &quot;Vale Tudo&quot; as its own standalone fighting style.

Marco Ruas is recognized to be one of the first to do so. He was a Muay Thai striker and equally skilled in Luta Livre submission grappling; even before the first UFC event, he was a public proponent of cross-training in multiple martial arts and training specifically for Vale Tudo. Eventually he developed &quot;Ruas Vale Tudo&quot;, which he advertised as a martial art. He and other fighters he coached—such as Pedro Rizzo and Renato Sobral—were billed as &quot;Ruas Vale Tudo&quot; fighters.

The Chute Boxe Academy in Curitiba started as a Muay Thai gym expanded their program with BJJ and grappling training in 1991, and eventually branded themselves as a &quot;Vale Tudo&quot; gym.

<text>A safe water mark, as defined by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in maritime pilotage to indicate the end of a channel. They usually imply that open, deep and safe water lies ahead. They are also used to indicate the start and end of a buoyed section of a continuous narrow channel; and a series of them may mark a safe route through shallow areas. It is therefore important to consult appropriate charts to determine their meaning in each location. They are also known as fairway buoys and clear water buoys.

They are recognisable by their red-and-white vertical stripes and commonly bear a top sign in shape of a red ball. They either flash Morse code &quot;A&quot; (di-dah), or one long flash, occulting (more light than dark) or isophase (equal light and dark) every 10 seconds (L Fl 10s).

In the United States, safe water marks are printed with the initials of their associated waterways or localities.

<text>A Special Mark, as defined by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in maritime pilotage. It is recognisable by its yellow colour and X, (also referred to as a St. Andrews Cross or saltire) top-mark. It has a distinctive sequence of various flashes that does not match any other navigational mark flashes in its vicinity.

==Purpose==
Special marks can indicate:
*Administrative areas
*Water skiing areas
*Anchorage areas
*Mooring areas
*Waiting areas
*Marine farms
*Oil wells
*Dead ends
*Pipelines
*Spoil ground (an area where dredged material is deposited)
*Historic wrecks
*Protected areas
*Outfall pipes (such as Stormwater, and Cooling water)
*Sewerage pipes
*Intake pipes
*Submarine cables

==Other uses==
*Buoys, such as a Weather buoy or Mooring buoy are coloured yellow or have a yellow light to indicate it is not an aid to navigation.

<text>Slick Idiot is a German electronic and industrial band.

== History ==
Slick Idiot was formed by former KMFDM members Günter Schulz and En Esch, following the 1999 breakup of KMFDM. Before taking on the name Slick Idiot, Esch and Schulz contributed a cover of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Terrible Lie&quot; to Cleopatra Records&#x27; &quot;Covered in Nails 2: A Tribute to Nine Inch Nails&quot;. After releasing &quot;DickNity&quot; for purchase online, Slick Idiot, with core live members Mel Fuher and drummer/programmer Michael J. Carrasquillo, embarked on the &quot;High Life for Low Lives&quot; US tour in 2002. Cleopatra Records then re-released &quot;DickNity&quot; with a bonus remix by Christoph Schneider of Rammstein. In late 2003, Esch and Schulz joined as members of Pigface for the &quot;United II&quot; tour. In October 2004, &quot;Screwtinized&quot; was released online via their website and garnered rave reviews. En Esch toured again with Pigface on the &quot;Free for All&quot; US tour in 2005, while Schulz devoted his time to forming the side project SCHULZ with vocalist Jeff Borden. The band co-headlined, along with Hanzel und Gretyl, the first Gothicfest at the Odeum Expo Center in Illinois. In 2006, Slick Idiot completed a full US tour called the &quot;xSCREWciating Tour&quot;, with More Machine Than Man. The tour saw the addition of live members Gregg Ziemba on drums and Victoria Levy on vocals.

As a tribute to the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship, which took place in Austria and Switzerland, and to the Austrian capital Vienna, Slick Idiot recorded a version of a famous traditional Austrian song, &quot;Wien, Du Stadt meiner Träume&quot;, written by Rudolf Sieczynski. The song was released on 12 May 2008 as a digital download only.

Slick Idiot toured the US in late 2009, performing almost 50 shows in two months. The band released the album &quot;S U C K S E S S&quot; on 4 September 2009.

On 29 May 2010, Slick Idiot began the &quot;Sucksess 2010 USA Tour&quot; in Phoenix, Arizona, and continued the tour around the US. Accompanying Esch and Schulz were drummer Ziemba and singer Erica Dilanjian. Singer Mona Mur appeared as a featured guest to perform songs from &quot;120 Tage – The Fine Art of Beauty and Violence&quot;, a collaboration album between Mur and Esch. Mur accompanied the band in 2010 and 2011 on two full Canada tours, and again in 2012 on the &quot;Slick Idiot vs Mona Mur &amp; En Esch Classick Tour 2012&quot; with Dan Simoes (of Alvalanker) on guitar and Ethan Moseley (of Promonium Jesters) on drums. Mur again performed the Slick Idiot female vocal parts along with songs from the Mur and Esch collaboration.

<text>An Isolated Danger Mark, as defined by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in maritime pilotage to indicate a hazard to shipping such as a partially submerged rock.
It is recognisable by its black and red bands and top-mark of two black balls.

Its distinctive sequence of flashing white light consists of 2 quick flashes in intervals of either 5 or 10 seconds.

<text>The Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf or Ronne–Filchner Ice Shelf is an Antarctic ice shelf bordering the Weddell Sea.

==Description==
The seaward side of the Filchner–Ronne ice shelf is divided into Eastern (Filchner) and the larger Western (Ronne) sections by Berkner Island. The whole ice shelf covers some 430,000 km2, making it the second largest ice shelf in Antarctica (and on Earth), after the Ross Ice Shelf. It grows perpetually due to a flow of inland ice sheets. From time to time, when the shearing stresses exceed the strength of the ice, cracks form and large parts of the ice sheet separate from the ice shelf and float off and disperse as icebergs. This is known as calving.

The Ronne ice shelf is the larger and western part of the Filchner–Ronne ice shelf. It is bounded on the west by the base of the Antarctic Peninsula (Graham Land with Zumberge Coast and Orville Coast) and Ellsworth Land. Commander Finn Ronne, USNR, leader of the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE) in 1947–48, discovered and photographed a strip along the entire northern portion of this ice shelf in two aircraft flights in November and December 1947. He named it the &quot;Lassiter Shelf Ice&quot; and gave the name &quot;Edith Ronne Land&quot; to the land presumed to lie south of it. In 1957–58, the US-IGY party at Ellsworth Station, under now Captain Ronne, determined that the ice shelf was larger than previously charted, that it extends southward to preempt most of &quot;Edith Ronne Land&quot;. Inasmuch as Capt. James Lassiter&#x27;s name has been assigned to a coast of Palmer Land, the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) approved the name Ronne Ice Shelf for this large ice shelf, on the basis of first sighting and exploration of the ice shelf by Ronne and parties under his leadership. The shelf is therefore named for Edith Ronne, the wife of Finn Ronne and RARE Expedition member.

The Filchner ice shelf is the eastern part of the Filchner–Ronne ice shelf. It is bounded on the west by Berkner Island and on the east by Coats Land. The east part of this shelf was discovered in January–February 1912 by the German Antarctic Expedition under Wilhelm Filchner. Filchner named the feature for Kaiser Wilhelm, but the Emperor requested it be named for its discoverer. The shelf is nourished primarily by the Slessor Glacier, the Recovery Glacier, and the Support Force Glacier, all located east of Berkner Island.

In 2021, sponges and other unidentified suspension feeders were reported to have been found growing on a boulder under the western margin of the Filchner ice shelf, close to Berkner Island, at a depth of 1,233 m (872 of which were ice), 260 km from open water.

==Disintegration (calving)==
In October 1998, the iceberg A-38 broke off the Filchner–Ronne ice shelf. It had an extent of roughly 150 by 50 km and was thus larger than Delaware. It later broke up again into three parts. A similar-sized calving in May 2000 created an iceberg 167 by 32 km in extent, dubbed A-43 – the disintegration of this is thought to have been responsible for the November 2006 sighting of several large icebergs from the coast of the South Island of New Zealand, the first time since 1931 that any icebergs had been observed from the New Zealand mainland. A large group of small icebergs (the largest some 1000 metres in length), were seen off the south-east coast of the island, with one of them drifting close enough to shore to be visible from the hills above the city of Dunedin. If these were indeed the remnants of this calving, then over the course of five and a half years they had travelled slowly north and also east around over half the globe, a journey of some 13,500 km.

From January 12 and January 13, 2010, an area of sea ice larger than the state of Rhode Island, or one-seventh the size of Wales, broke away from the Ronne–Filchner Ice Shelf and shattered into many smaller pieces. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA&#x27;s Aqua and Terra satellites captured this event in this series of photo-like images.

In May 2021, Iceberg A-76 broke off the northwest corner of the shelf. At 4320 km2, it is larger than Majorca, several times larger than Iceberg A-74 which calved in the same year, or approximately 14% the size of Belgium.

The ice of the Filchner–Ronne ice shelf can be as thick as 600 m; the water below is about 1400 m deep at the deepest point.

The international Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf Programme (FRISP) was initiated in 1973 to study the ice shelf.

A study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2012 by scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, and funded by the Ice2Sea initiative, predicts the disappearance of the vast ice shelf in Antarctica by the end of the century which could – indirectly – add up to of rise of sea level each year.

<doc id="493816" wikidata="Q1186334" url="?curid=493816" title="Hāngī">
<text>Hāngī () is a traditional New Zealand Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven, called an &quot;umu&quot;. It is still used for large groups on special occasions, as it allows large quantities of food to be cooked without the need for commercial cooking appliances.

==Process==
To &quot;lay a hāngī&quot; or &quot;put down a hāngī&quot; involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the hāngī. Hāngī experts have developed and improved methods that have often, like the stones themselves, been handed down for generations.

Common foods cooked in a hāngī are meats such as lamb, pork, chicken and seafood (&quot;kaimoana&quot;), and vegetables such as potato, kūmara (sweet potato), yams (oca), pumpkin, squash, taro and cabbage.

A hāngī pit is dug to a depth of between , sufficient to hold the rocks and two stacked baskets of food. Logs, usually mānuka or kānuka, are stacked over the pit with the rocks, commonly andesite or basalt, on top. The logs are lit and is left to burn for 3 to 4 hours, heating the rocks to . Once the fire has burned down, the hot embers and most of the ash is removed. Alternatively, the fire is built separately and the hāngī pit is dug while the fire is burning, with the hot rocks transferred to the pit after heating.

Meanwhile, the food is prepared and placed in wire baskets lined with either puka, banana or cabbage leaves, or aluminium foil. The meat basket is placed in the bottom of the pit, with the vegetable basket placed on top. If seafood is included, it is placed on top of the vegetable basket. Wet sacks or cloth are placed on top of the baskets, and the whole pit is covered with earth. The hāngī takes approximately 2.5 to 4 hours to cook. A person supervises the hāngī while it cooks, covering up any escaping steam with earth.

Once the hāngī is cooked, the earth is carefully removed from the top of the pit, followed by the sacks or cloth. The baskets are lifted out of the pit, and the food taken to the kitchen for carving and serving.
Prior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid between bark, large leaves and other vegetation. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century, with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. 

In the early 21st century, gas-heated stainless-steel &quot;hāngī machines&quot; are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.

== Early &quot;umu-tī&quot; ==
Evidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or &quot;umu&quot; which were designed to cook &quot;tī kōuka&quot; or various other species of &quot;Cordyline&quot;. 

The distinguishing feature of an &quot;umu-tī&quot; was its large size compared to a normal earth oven. The long, carrot-shaped tap root was cooked in a large, stone-lined pit for between one and two days. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp with a bitter aftertaste. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands, and the remains of large &quot;umu&quot; have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. Investigation in Otago shows that most of these pits were used only once or twice.

<doc id="493820" wikidata="Q11150" url="?curid=493820" title="Languages of the European Union">
<text>The European Union (EU) has 24 official languages, of which threeEnglish, French and Germanwere considered &quot;procedural&quot; languages, but this notion was abandoned by the European Commission (whereas the European Parliament accepts all official languages as working languages). Today, English and French are used in the day-to-day workings of the institutions of the EU. Institutions have the right to define the linguistic regime of their working, but the Commission and a number of other institutions have not done so, as indicated by several judicial rulings.

The EU asserts that it is in favour of linguistic diversity. This principle is enshrined in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (art. 22) and in the Treaty on European Union (art. 3(3) TEU). In the EU, language policy is the responsibility of member states, and the EU does not have a common language policy; EU institutions play a supporting role in this field, based on the principle of &quot;subsidiarity&quot;; they promote a European dimension in the member states&#x27; language policies. The EU encourages all its citizens to be multilingual; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their native language. Though the EU has very limited influence in this area, as the content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states, a number of EU funding programmes actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity.

All 24 official languages of the EU are accepted as working languages, but in practice only threeEnglish, French, and Germanare in wide general use in its institutions, and of these, English is the most commonly used. The most widely understood language in the EU is English, which is understood by 44% of all adults, while German is the most widely used mother tongue, spoken by 18%. French is an official language in all three of the cities that are political centres of the EU: Brussels, Strasbourg, and Luxembourg City. Since the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU in 2020, the government of France has encouraged greater use of French as a working language.

Luxembourgish and Turkish, which have official status in Luxembourg and Cyprus, respectively, are the only two official languages of EU member states that are not official languages of the EU. In 2023, the Spanish government requested that its co-official languages Catalan, Basque, and Galician be added to the official languages of the EU.

==Official EU languages==
, the official languages of the European Union, as stipulated in the latest amendment of &quot;Regulation No 1 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community&quot; of 1958, are:


The number of member states exceeds the number of official languages, as several national languages are shared by two or more countries in the EU. Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, and Swedish are all official languages at the national level in multiple countries (see table above). In addition, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Hungarian, Italian, Slovak, and Slovene are official languages in multiple EU countries at the regional level.

Furthermore, not all national languages have been accorded the status of official EU languages. These include Luxembourgish, an official language of Luxembourg since 1984, and Turkish, an official language of Cyprus.

All languages of the EU are also working languages. Documents which a member state or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a member state sends to institutions of the Community may be drafted in any one of the official languages selected by the sender. The reply is drafted in the same language. Regulations and other documents of general application are drafted in the twenty-four official languages. The &quot;Official Journal of the European Union&quot; is published in the twenty-four official languages.

Documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all official languages, but that accounts for a minority of the institutions′ work. Other documents—e.g., communications with the national authorities, decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence—are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions are allowed by law to choose their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in three languages, English, French, and German (sometimes called &quot;procedural languages&quot;), and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset. Non-institutional EU bodies are not legally obliged to make language arrangement for all the 24 languages 

The translations are expensive. According to the EU&#x27;s English-language website, the cost of maintaining the institutions’ policy of multilingualism—i.e., the cost of translation and interpretation—was €1,123 million in 2005, which is 1% of the annual general budget of the EU, or €2.28 per person per year. The EU Parliament has made clear that its member states have autonomy for language education, which by treaty the Union must respect.

===Language families===

The vast majority of the 24 official EU languages belong to the Indo-European family: the three dominant subfamilies are the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic. Germanic languages are primarily spoken in central and northern Europe and include Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Romance languages are mostly spoken in western and southern European regions; they include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. The Slavic languages are predominantly found in central Europe and the Balkans in southeastern Europe; they include Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Slovene. The Baltic languages, Latvian and Lithuanian; the Celtic languages, including Irish; and Greek are also Indo-European.

Outside the Indo-European family, Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian are Uralic languages, while Maltese is the only Afroasiatic language with official status in the EU.

===Writing systems===

Most official EU languages are written in the Latin script. The two exceptions are Greek, which is written in the Greek script, and Bulgarian, which is written in Cyrillic script. With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts. The original design of euro banknotes had the word &quot;euro&quot; written in both Latin (Euro) and Greek (Ευρώ) letters; the Cyrillic spelling (Eвро) was added to the new Europa series of banknotes started in 2013 (see Linguistic issues concerning the euro).

===Language-specific regulations===
====Maltese====
Although Maltese is an official language, the Council set a transitional period of three years from 1 May 2004, during which the institutions were not obliged to draft all acts in Maltese. It was agreed that the council could extend this transitional period by an additional year, but decided not to. All new acts of the institutions were required to be adopted and published in Maltese from 30 April 2007.

====Irish====

Irish previously had the status of &quot;treaty language&quot; before being upgraded to an official and working language in 2007. However, a temporary derogation was enforced until 1 January 2022. The designation of Irish as a &quot;treaty language&quot; meant that only the treaties of the European Union were translated into Irish, whereas Legal Acts of the European Union adopted under the treaties (like Directives and Regulations) did not have to be.

When Ireland joined the EEC (now the EU) in 1973, Irish was accorded &quot;Treaty Language&quot; status. This meant that the founding EU Treaty was restated in Irish. Irish was also listed in that treaty and all subsequent EU treaties as one of the authentic languages of the treaties. As a Treaty Language, Irish was an official procedural language of the European Court of Justice. It was also possible to correspond in written Irish with the EU Institutions.

However, despite being the first official language of Ireland and having been accorded minority-language status in the Northern Ireland region of the United Kingdom, then an EU member state, Irish was not made an official working language of the EU until 1 January 2007. On that date an EU Council Regulation making Irish an official working language of the EU came into effect. This followed a unanimous decision on 13 June 2005 by EU foreign ministers that Irish would be made the 21st official language of the EU. However, a derogation previously stipulated that not all documents have to be translated into Irish as is the case with the other official languages.

The regulation meant that legislation adopted by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers is translated into Irish, and interpretation from Irish was available at European Parliament plenary sessions and some Council meetings. The cost of translation, interpretation, publication, and legal services involved in making Irish an official EU language was estimated at just under €3.5 million a year. On 3 December 2015, a new regulation passed by the council had set a definitive schedule on the gradual reduction of the derogation of the Irish language. This regulation outlined a schedule of gradual reduction spread across five years starting from 2016. The derogation was ultimately revoked on 1 January 2022, making Irish a fully recognised EU language for the first time in the state&#x27;s history.

Irish is the only official language of the EU that is not the most widely spoken language in any member state. According to the 2006 Irish census figures, there are 1.66 million people in Ireland with some ability to speak Irish, out of a population of 4.6 million, though only 538,500 use Irish on a daily basis (counting those who use it mainly in the education system) and just over 72,000 use Irish as a daily language outside the education system.

====South-Slavic language status====
At the time of Croatia&#x27;s accession to the EU, some diplomats and officials suggested that, rather than accepting the Croatian written standard as an official EU language, the EU should instead adopt a single unified literary form that would encompass several nearly-identical written standards of the same language, historically known as &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot;, the official language of Yugoslavia until its disintegration and the division of the language among ethnic lines. In addition to Croatian, this would include the Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin written standards, all of them based in the same spoken dialect of Eastern Herzegovina, with the goal of reducing potential translation and interpretation costs if the other Western Balkan states eventually joined the EU as well. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was cited as an example of an international body that had conducted business in such a unified standard. In negotiations with Croatia, however, it was agreed that the Croatian standard would become a separate official EU language, as none of the other states at issue had yet been admitted to the EU.

==Regional, minority and other languages==
Some regional or minority languages spoken within the EU do not have official recognition at EU level. Some of them may have some official status within the member state and count many more speakers than some of the lesser-used official languages. The official languages of EU are in bold.

In the list, language varieties classified as dialects of an official language by member countries are not included. However, many of these varieties may be viewed as separate languages: for instance, Scots (the Germanic language descended from Old English, not the Celtic language known as Scottish Gaelic) and several Romance languages spoken in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy, such as Aragonese, Asturian, Mirandese, Lombard, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian, Corsican, Neapolitan and Sicilian.

===Languages of France===

The French constitution stipulates French as the sole language of France. Since the 2008 modifications, article 75-1 of the Constitution adds that &quot;regional languages form part of the French heritage&quot;.

Nevertheless, there exist a number of languages spoken by sizable minorities, such as Breton (a Celtic language), Basque, and several Romance languages such as Occitan, Catalan, Corsican and the various langues d&#x27;oïl (other than French), as well as Germanic languages spoken in Alsace-Lorraine (Central Franconian, High Franconian, Luxembourgish, and Alemannic) and French Flanders (Dutch).

These languages enjoy no official status under the French state, and regions are not permitted to bestow any such status themselves.

===Languages of Greece===

The official language of Greece is Greek, and recognized minority languages are Armenian, Ladino and Turkish. Nevertheless, there are several other languages in Greece, which lack any recognition. These are Albanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian (these last two usually being collectively known as &quot;Vlach&quot;), Romani and the Slavic varieties spoken in the country. Greece has been described as the only European Union member state that sticks to a &quot;linguistic assimilationist ideology&quot;.

===Languages of Italy===

Italy&#x27;s official language is Italian, although twelve additional languages (namely Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian) have been recognized as minority languages by the 1999 national Framework Law on the Country&#x27;s historical linguistic minorities, in accordance with the Article 6 of the Italian Constitution. However, many languages other than Italian and the above-mentioned twelve are spoken across the country, most of them being either Gallo-Italic or Italo-Dalmatian, which lack any sort of official recognition and protection.

===Languages of Spain===

The Spanish governments have sought to give some official status in the EU for the languages of the autonomous communities of Spain, Catalan/Valencian, Galician and Basque. The 667th Council Meeting of the Council of the European Union in Luxembourg on 13 June 2005, decided to authorise limited use at EU level of languages recognised by member states other than the official working languages. The Council granted recognition to &quot;languages other than the languages referred to in Council Regulation No 1/1958 whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law.&quot; The official use of such languages will be authorised on the basis of an administrative arrangement concluded between the council and the requesting member state.

Although Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician are not nationwide official languages in Spain, as co-official languages in the respective regions—pursuant to Spanish constitution, among other documents—they are eligible to benefit from official use in EU institutions under the terms of 13 June 2005 resolution of the Council of the European Union. The Spanish government has assented to the provisions in respect of these languages.

The status of Catalan, spoken by over 9 million EU citizens (just over 1.8% of the total), has been the subject of particular debate. On 11 December 1990, the use of Catalan was the subject of a European Parliament Resolution (resolution A3-169/90 on languages in the [European] Community and the situation of Catalan).

On 16 November 2005, the President Peter Straub of the Committee of the Regions signed an agreement with the Spanish Ambassador to the EU, , approving the use of Spanish regional languages in an EU institution for the first time in a meeting on that day, with interpretation provided by European Commission interpreters.

On 3 July 2006, the European Parliament&#x27;s Bureau approved a proposal by the Spanish State to allow citizens to address the European Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, two months after its initial rejection.

On 30 November 2006, the European Ombudsman, Nikiforos Diamandouros, and the Spanish ambassador in the EU, Carlos Bastarreche, signed an agreement in Brussels to allow Spanish citizens to address complaints to the European Ombudsman in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, all three co-official languages in Spain. According to the agreement, a translation body, which will be set up and financed by the Spanish government, will be responsible for translating complaints submitted in these languages. In turn, it will translate the Ombudsman&#x27;s decisions from Spanish into the language of the complainant. Until such a body is established the agreement will not become effective.

Following the 2023 Spanish general election, the PSOE-led Spanish government sent a letter to the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union, asking for Catalan, Basque, and Galician to be added to the current 24 official languages of the EU. This was done in exchange for the support of the Catalan separatist party Junts for Francina Armengol&#x27;s candidacy for President of the Congress of Deputies. Without such support the PSOE would likely have been unable to form a new government and a second election would have been held in the same year.

Galician in particular, not being itself a European Parliament official language, can be used and is in fact used by some European Parliament constituents as a spoken dialect of Portuguese due to its similarity with this language.

===Luxembourgish and Turkish===
Luxembourgish (Luxembourg) and Turkish (Cyprus) are the only two national languages that are not official languages of the EU. Neither Luxembourg nor Cyprus have yet used the provision of 13 June 2005 resolution to benefit from use in official EU institutions. On 26 February 2016 it was made public that Cyprus has asked to make Turkish an official EU language, in a “gesture” that could help reunification and improve EU–Turkey relations. Already in 2004, it was planned that Turkish would become an official language if Cyprus reunited. Turkish is also a recognized minority language in two EU member countries (Greece and Romania).

In September 2010, Luxembourg&#x27;s foreign minister Jean Asselborn declined a request of the Alternative Democratic Reform Party (ADR) to make Luxembourgish an official language of the European Union citing financial reasons and also that German and French being already official languages would be sufficient for the needs of Luxembourg.

===Romani===
The Romani people, numbering over two million in the EU, speak the Romani language (actually numerous different languages), which is not official in any EU member state or polity, except for being an official minority language of Sweden and Finland. Moreover, Romani mass media and educational institution presences are near-negligible.

===Russian===
Though not an official language of the European Union, Russian is spoken in all member states that were part of the Soviet Union (and before that the Russian Empire). Russian is the native language of about 1.6 million Baltic Russians residing in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as a sizeable community of about 3.5 million in Germany and as a major immigrant language elsewhere in the EU, e.g. in and around Paris. Russian is also understood by a majority of ethnic Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians born before c. 1980, since, as official language of the Soviet Union, it was a compulsory school subject in those countries that were part of the Soviet Union. To a lesser extent, this legacy also holds true among the older generation in parts of the EU that were formerly part of the Eastern bloc, such as the GDR.

In March 2010 fact-sheets in Russian produced by the EU executive&#x27;s offices in Latvia were withdrawn, provoking criticism from Plaid Cymru MEP and European Free Alliance group President Jill Evans who called European Commission to continue to provide information in non-official EU languages and commented that &quot;it&#x27;s disappointing to hear that the EU is bowing to pressure to exclude Russian speakers in the Baltic in this way&quot;.

===Sami languages===
In Finland, the Sami languages Northern Sami (ca. 2,000 speakers), Skolt Sami (400) and Inari Sami (300) have limited local recognition in certain municipalities of Finnish Lapland. Furthermore, legislation specifically concerning the Sami must be translated to these languages. Bilingualism with Finnish is universal, though.

At least five different Sami languages are spoken in Sweden, but &quot;Sami language&quot; (undifferentiated) is recognised as an official minority language in Sweden, and is co-official with Swedish in four municipalities in Norrbotten County (Swedish Lapland). Most of Sami speakers speak Northern Sami (5,000–6,000 speakers), although there are ca. 1,000–2,000 Lule Sami speakers and 600 Southern Sami speakers. Also Ume Sámi and Pite Sámi are spoken in Sweden.

===Latin===
For millennia, Latin served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for administrative, scholarly, religious, political, and other purposes in parts of the present-day European Union. After Athens and other Greek city-states of the 6th to 4th centuries BC, the first documented political entity historically verifiable in Europe was the Roman Republic, traditionally founded in 509 BC, the successor-state to the Etruscan city-state confederacies.
Latin as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Europe was rivalled only by Greek. It is serving as honourable and ceremonial language in some of the oldest European universities in the 21st century, and has operated as the official language of the Roman Catholic Church until today. Latin, along with Greek, was at the core of education in Europe from the schools of rhetoric of the Roman Republic in all of its provinces and territories, through the medieval &quot;trivium&quot; and &quot;quadrivium&quot;, through the humanists and the Renaissance, all the way to Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (just to name one example of thousands of scientific works written in this language), to the public schools of all European countries, where Latin (along with Greek) was at the core of their curricula. Latin served as the undisputed European &quot;lingua franca&quot; until the 19th century, when the cultures of vernacular languages and the &quot;national languages&quot; started to gain ground and claim status. Today, several institutions of the European Union use Latin in their logos and domain names instead of listing their names in all the official languages. For example, the European Court of Justice has its website at &quot;curia.europa.eu&quot;. The Court of Auditors uses &quot;Curia Rationum&quot; in its logo. The Council of the European Union has its website at &quot;consilium.europa.eu&quot; and its logo showing &quot;Consilium&quot;. The European Union itself has a Latin motto: &quot;In varietate concordia&quot;. Under the European Company Regulation, companies can be incorporated as &quot;Societas Europaea&quot; (Latin for &quot;European Company&quot;, often shortened to &quot;SE&quot; after the company&#x27;s own proper name). Latin is one of the languages of IATE (the inter-institutional terminology database of the European Union).

===Immigrant languages===
A wide variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by immigrant communities in EU countries. Turkish (which is also an official language of the EU member Cyprus) is spoken as a first language by an estimated 1% of the population in Belgium and the western part of Germany, and by 1% in the Netherlands. Other widely used migrant languages include Berber languages which are spoken by about 1% of the population of both the Netherlands and Belgium and by many Berber migrants in France, Spain, Italy and Germany. Arabic is spoken in many EU countries mainly in its Maghrebi and Levantine varieties. Maghrebi Arabic is spoken by migrants in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Levantine Arabic is spoken by migrants in Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Greece. Languages from former Yugoslavia (Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, Albanian, etc.) are spoken in many parts of the EU by migrants and refugees who have left the region as a result of the Yugoslav wars and unrest there.

There are large Chinese communities in France, Spain, Italy, and other countries. Old and recent Chinese migrants speak a number of Chinese varieties, in particular Cantonese and other southern Chinese varieties. However, Mandarin is becoming increasingly more prevalent due to the opening of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

There are many Russian-speaking immigrants in Germany and France.

Many immigrant communities in the EU have been in place for several generations now, and their members are bilingual, at ease both in the local language and in that of their community.

===Sign languages===
A wide variety of sign languages are used in the EU, with around 500,000 people using a sign language as their first language. None of these languages are recognised as an official language of an EU member state, with the exception of Ireland passing the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 that granted it official status alongside Irish and English, and only three states (Austria, Finland and Portugal) refer to sign languages in their constitution.

Several NGOs exist which support signers, such as the European Union of the Deaf and the European Sign Language Centre. The European Commission has also supported some initiatives to produce digital technologies that can better support signers, such as Dicta-Sign and SignSpeak.

The sign languages in use in the EU are more difficult to classify into language families than the spoken languages, because of language contact and creolization. Important families include the Swedish, French, and German sign language families.

===Vietnamese===
Vietnamese is one of the 14 recognized minority languages in the Czech Republic.

===Esperanto===
Esperanto is a constructed language that is part of the educational system in several member states. In Hungary it is officially recognised by the Ministry of Education as a foreign language; and examinations in Esperanto may be used to meet the requirements of knowledge of foreign languages needed to complete university or high school. Every year, since 2001, between 1000 and 3000 people have passed examinations in Esperanto, making up for a sum of more than 35,000 up to 2016; it is recognised by the Hungarian state. The Hungarian census 2001 found 4575 Esperanto speakers in Hungary (4407 of them learned the language, for 168 of them it is a family or native language); in 2011 it found 8397 Esperanto speakers. In 1990 there were only 2083 Esperanto speakers in Hungary following the census.

Esperanto is not mentioned by the EU Commission as an EU language; the Commission mentions only official, indigenous regional and minority languages as well as languages of immigrants. Following estimates there are approximately 100,000 Europeans sometimes using Esperanto (and several millions having learned Esperanto); the language has several thousand native speakers, some of them of the second or third generation.

The European party Europe – Democracy – Esperanto seeks to establish the planned language as an official second language in the EU in order to make international communication more efficient and fair in economical and philosophical terms. They are based on the conclusions of the Grin Report, which concluded that it would hypothetically allow savings to the EU of €25 billion a year (€54 for every citizen) and have other benefits. However, the EU Parliament has stated clearly that language education is the responsibility of member states.

The European Esperanto Union also promotes Esperanto as the international auxiliary language of Europe.
==Knowledge==
The main official sources of information on the EU citizens&#x27; levels of language proficiency are the Special Eurobarometers no. 243 (February 2006; field work late 2005), no. 386 (2012), and no. 540 (2023). 


According to the Special Eurobarometer no. 540, as of 2023, the five most spoken languages in the EU were English (50%), German (29%), French (25%), Italian (16%) and Spanish (17%). At 19% of the total number of speakers, German was the most widely spoken native language, followed by French (15%), Italian (13%) Polish (9%) and Spanish (9%). The knowledge of foreign languages varied considerably in the specific countries, as the table below shows. The most spoken second or foreign languages in the EU were English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. In the table, boxes coloured light blue mean that the language is an official language of the country, while the main language spoken in the country is coloured dark blue.

59% of EU citizens are able to hold a conversation in a language other than their native language, three percent higher than reported in 2012. 28% are able to hold a conversation in at least two foreign languages, 11% are able to hold a conversation in at least three foreign languages, while 39% are only able to speak their native language.

English remains by far the most widely spoken foreign language throughout Europe. A total of 95% of students in the EU study English at secondary level and 38% of EU citizens state that they have sufficient skills in English to have a conversation (excluding citizens of Ireland, an English-speaking country). A total of 28% of Europeans indicate that they know either French (14%) or German (14%), along with their native language. French is most commonly studied and used in southern Europe, especially in Mediterranean countries, in Germany, Portugal, Romania, the Benelux countries and Ireland. German, on the other hand, is commonly studied and used in the Benelux countries, in Scandinavia, and in the newer EU member states. Spanish is most commonly studied in France, Italy, Luxembourg, and Portugal. In 19 out of 29 countries polled, English is the most widely known language apart from the native language, this being particularly the case in Sweden (89%), Malta (88%); the Netherlands (87%); and Denmark (86%). A total of 77% of EU citizens believe that children should learn English. English was considered the number one language to learn in all countries where the research was conducted except for Ireland and Luxembourg. English, either as a native language or as a second/foreign language, is spoken by 44% of EU citizens, followed by German with 36% and French with 30%.
With the enlargement of the European Union, the balance between French and German is slowly changing. More citizens in the new member states speak German (23% compared with 12% in the EU15) while fewer speak French or Spanish (3% and 1% respectively compared with 16% and 7% among the EU15 group). A notable exception is Romania, where 24% of the population speaks French as a foreign language compared to 6% who speak German as a foreign language. At the same time, the balance is being changed in the opposite direction by growth of the French-speaking population and decrease of the German-speaking population.

Language skills are unevenly distributed both over the geographical area of Europe and over sociodemographic groups. Reasonably good language competences are perceived in relatively small member states with several state languages, lesser used native languages or &quot;language exchange&quot; with neighbouring countries. This is the case in Luxembourg, where 92% speak at least two languages. Those who live in southern European countries or countries where one of the major European languages is a state language have a lower likelihood of speaking multiple foreign languages. Only 5% of Turks, 13% of Irish, 16% of Italians, 17% of Spaniards and 18% of Britons speak at least two languages apart from their native language.

==Working languages==
===European Commission===
While documents for and communication with citizens are in every official EU language as a right, day-to-day work in the European Commission is based around its three working languages: English, French, and German. Of these, English and French are used the most often. The use of English vs. French depends greatly on the unit or directorate. Only a few of the commissioners use a language other than English or French as their working language. German is rarely used as a true working language in the Commission, and German media have called the dominance of English and French a discrimination against German (which is the most spoken mother tongue of the EU) and a violation of the regulations pertaining to the EU&#x27;s working languages. The German Bundestag has repeatedly called for German to receive an equal position in the Commission alongside English and French. The language situation has also disappointed many in France, and Kristalina Georgieva, who is from Bulgaria, gained a round of applause when she told the European Parliament she would learn French while in the Commission.

Use of German has, however, been increasing in EU institutions, as has the number of people learning the language across Europe.

===European Parliament===

The European Parliament translates its proceedings into all official languages so that fellow MEPs can understand them better than if they had the delayed translation. Committee meetings also often default to the language most understood by those attending instead of listening to the translation.

===Court of Justice===

The working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union is French. The judges deliberate in French, pleadings and written legal submissions are translated into French, and the judgment is drafted in French. The Advocates-General, by contrast, may work and draft their opinions in any official language, as they do not take part in any deliberations. These opinions are then translated into French for the benefit of the judges and their deliberations.

===European Central Bank===

The working language of the European Central Bank is English.

==Policy==
The European Union&#x27;s legal powers on legislative acts and other initiatives on language policy are based on the provisions of the Treaties of the European Union. In the EU, language policy is the responsibility of member states, and the European Union does not have a common &quot;language policy&quot;. Based on the principle of subsidiarity, European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in the member states&#x27; language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the member states (Article 149.2). The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Statute of the Court of Justice, be determined by the council, acting unanimously (Article 290). All languages, in which was originally drawn up or was translated due to enlargement, are legally equally authentic. Every citizen of the Union may write to any of the EU institutions or bodies in one of these languages and receive an answer in the same language (Article 24 TFEU).

In the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding since its inclusion in the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU declares that it respects linguistic diversity (Article 22) and prohibits discrimination on grounds of language (Article 21). Respect for linguistic diversity is a fundamental value of the European Union, in the same way as respect for the person, openness towards other cultures, and tolerance and acceptance of other people.

===Initiatives===

Beginning with the &quot;&quot; in 1990, the European Union invests more than €30 million a year (out of a €120 billion EU budget) promoting language learning through the &quot;Socrates&quot; and &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; programmes in bursaries to enable language teachers to be trained abroad, placing foreign language assistants in schools, funding class exchanges to motivate pupils to learn languages, creating new language courses on CDs and the Internet, and projects that raise awareness of the benefits of language learning.

Through strategic studies, the Commission promotes debate, innovation, and the exchange of good practice. In addition, the mainstream actions of Community programmes which encourage mobility and transnational partnerships motivate participants to learn languages.

Youth exchanges, town twinning projects, and the European Voluntary Service also promote multilingualism. Since 1997, the Culture 2000 programme has financed the translation of around 2,000 literary works from and into European languages.

The new programmes proposed for implementation for the financial perspective 2007–2013 (Culture 2007, Youth in Action, and Lifelong Learning) will continue and develop this kind of support.

The EU used to provide the main financial support to the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages until 2010, a non-governmental organisation which represents the interests of the over 40 million citizens who belong to a regional and minority language community, and for the Mercator networks of universities active in research on lesser-used languages in Europe. Following a request from the European Parliament, the commission in 2004 launched a feasibility study on the possible creation of a new EU agency, the &quot;European Agency for Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity.&quot; The study concludes that there are unmet needs in this field, and proposes two options: creating an agency or setting up a European network of &quot;Language Diversity Centres.&quot; The Commission believes that a network would be the most appropriate next step and, where possible, should build on existing structures; it will examine the possibility of financing it on a multi-annual basis through the proposed Lifelong Learning programme. Another interesting step would be to translate important public websites, such as the one of the European Central Bank, or Frontex web site also, in at least one other language than English or French.

Although not an EU treaty, most EU member states have ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

To encourage language learning, the EU supported the Council of Europe initiatives for European Year of Languages 2001 and the annual celebration of European Day of Languages on 26 September.

To encourage the member states to cooperate and to disseminate best practice the Commission issued a Communication on 24 July 2003, on Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: an Action Plan 2004–2006 and a Communication on 22 November 2005, on A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism.

From 22 November 2004, the European Commissioner for Education and Culture portfolio included an explicit reference to languages and became European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism with Ján Figeľ at the post. From 2007 until 2010, the European Commission had a special portfolio on languages, European Commissioner for Multilingualism. The post was held by Leonard Orban. Since 2010, the portfolio was merged with education and culture, again.

EU devotes a specialised subsite of its &quot;Europa&quot; portal to languages, the EUROPA Languages portal.

<text>The Fiat CR.32 was an Italian biplane fighter used in the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War. Designed by the aeronautical engineer Celestino Rosatelli, it was a compact, robust and highly manoeuvrable aircraft for its era, leading to it being a relatively popular fighter during the 1930s.

The CR.32 fought in North and East Africa, in Albania, and in the Mediterranean theatre. It was extensively used in the Spanish Civil War, where it gained a reputation as one of the most outstanding fighter biplanes of all time. It also saw service in the air forces of China, Austria, Hungary, Paraguay and Venezuela. It frequently performed impressive displays all over Europe in the hands of the Italian &quot;Pattuglie Acrobatiche&quot;. During the late 1930s, the CR.32 was overtaken by more advanced monoplane designs; by the start of the Second World War, it was considered to be obsolete. While it had been superseded by a number of newer Italian fighters, including the newer Fiat CR.42 Falco which had been derived from the CR.32, the type continued to be flown throughout the conflict.

==Development==
The Fiat CR.32 was designed by the aeronautical engineer Celestino Rosatelli. It was derived from the earlier Fiat CR.30, which had received limited production orders from the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; but, within the space of 12 months, it was superseded by the newer CR.32. The CR.32 had a smaller and more streamlined fuselage than the CR.30, resulting in a more compact aircraft.

On 28 April 1933, the prototype CR.32, which was designated the &quot;MM.201&quot;, made its maiden flight from the Fiat company airfield at Turin. By the end of the year, the first production examples were already arriving with front line units of the Regia Aeronautica. Mass production of the type took place between 1933 and 1938. Four variants of the CR.32 were developed: the standard, &quot;bis&quot;, &quot;ter&quot;, and &quot;quater&quot;. The CR.32 &quot;bis&quot; had a more powerful Fiat A.30R V12 engine and two additional machine guns, while the &quot;ter&quot; and the &quot;quater&quot; retained the original armament, differing in the use of improved gunsights and instrumentation.

By 1938, the CR.32 had been rendered obsolete by advances in the field of aviation, including the arrival of a new generation of monoplane fighters, which were capable of superior performance. The CR.32 was directly succeeded by the Fiat CR.42 Falco, which was derived from the CR.32. During the development of this design, four CR.32s were converted to serve as prototypes.

==Design==

The Fiat CR.32&#x27;s fuselage had the same structure as the earlier CR.30, using aluminium and steel tubes covered by duraluminium on the nose up to the cockpit, on the back, in the lower section under the tail, while a fabric covering was used on the sides and belly. According to Cattaneo, the fuselage was very robust for the time. The CR.32 had a fixed undercarriage with hydraulic shock absorbers; the wheels were housed in fairings and braking was pneumatically activated.

The wings and tail used a mixed composition, similar to the fuselage, composed of a pair of aluminium alloy tubular spars and square tubes, which were covered by fabric. It was a sesquiplane, the lower wing being shorter than the upper wing. The interplane struts were arranged to form a pair of Warren trusses on either side. Ailerons were only present upon the upper wings, which were balanced by out-rigged tabs mounted on steel struts. The empennage, which was largely composed of aluminium tubes, had a variable incidence tailplane and an aerodynamically-balanced elevator.
The cockpit of the CR.32 had an adjustable seat and a parachute, the latter of which being stored within the squab. Although it was considered to be fully instrumented for the era, the RA.80-1 radio set was only an optional piece of equipment. Other equipment included a fire extinguisher, gun camera, an oxygen system for the pilot; both an optical gunsight and survey camera could also be installed as optional item. The armament initially included a pair of 7.7 mm (.030 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns (which was later substituted for a pair of 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT guns), which were fitted on top of the engine cowling; each gun had an ammo capacity of 350 rounds each. Later examples were also furnished with a pair of hard points, which could accommodate up to 12 5lb bombs, a pair of 100lb bombs, or a single 200lb bomb.

The CR.32 was powered by a single water-cooled Fiat A.30 R.A. V12 engine. Designed in 1930, it was a 60° V 12, producing up to 447 kW (600 hp) at 2,600 rpm, reportedly inspired by the American Curtiss D-12. It drove a 2.82 meter (9 ft 4 in) two-blade metal propeller with pitch only adjustable on the ground, not in flight. The engine did not use the usual aviation gasoline, but instead ran on a mixture of petrol (55%), ethanol (23%) and benzol (22%). The main fuel tank, which was located between the engine and cockpit, carried 325 litres (85.9 US gal). There was another small 25 liter (6.6 US gal) auxiliary tank positioned in a streamlined fairing in the center of the upper wing.

==Operational history==
===Early operations===
The new biplane proved to be an instant success. After a brief period of testing, the first production orders for the CR.32 were received during March 1934. Within a short amount of time, the type soon equipped the 1°, 3° and 4° &quot;Stormi&quot; of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. The CR.32 was commonly well liked by its crews, being very maneuverable and benefitting from a relatively strong fuselage structure.

The Fiat biplanes were used for many aerobatic shows, in Italy and abroad. When foreign statesmen visited Rome, the 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; élite unit put on impressive displays with formations of five or ten aircraft. During 1936, air shows were organized above various other European capitals and major cities, and, during the following year, in South America. When the team returned, a brilliant display was put on in Berlin. Further overseas tours by Italian display teams, such as a South American expedition in 1938, were performed using the type. The CR.32&#x27;s tight turning circle and excellent handling made the type ideal for aerobatic displays.

The stand-out feature of the CR.32 was its remarkable manoeuvrability. It is possible its outstanding performance and popularity amongst its pilots were responsible for a continued attitude within many officials of the Regia Aeronautica that the biplane platform remained a viable concept for further development and deployment even in the face of a new generation of monoplane fighters.

===Spain===
During 1938, Spain acquired a license to build the CR.32. Spanish manufacturer Hispano Aviación established a production line and constructed at least 100 examples, which were locally known under the designation HA-132-L Chirri. Some of these aircraft remained in military service as C.1 aerobatic trainers up until as late as 1953.

The Fiat CR.32 was used extensively in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Fascist military rebellion against the Spanish Republic. At least 380 examples took part in the air battles fought over Spain, proving formidable adversaries to the Soviet Polikarpov I-15 biplane and Polikarpov I-16 monoplane that formed the backbone of the Spanish Republican Air Force. During 1936, the type had its baptism of fire. On 18 August, the first 12 CR.32s arrived in Spain and formed the&quot; Squadriglia Gamba di Ferro&quot;, &quot;Cucaracha&quot;, and &quot;Asso di Bastoni&quot; of 3° &quot;Stormo&quot;; three days later &quot;Tenente&quot; Vittorino Ceccherelli, a Gold Medal of Military Valor winner, shot down the first enemy aircraft, a Nieuport 52, over Cordoba. In total, the Italian government dispatched between 365 and 405 C.R.32s to Spain while between 127 and 131 were delivered directly to Nationalist aviation units. During the conflict, six aircraft were captured by Republican forces, according to Nico, one of these was shipped to the Soviet Union, where it underwent a detailed evaluation.

Thanks to the agile CR.32, the Italians managed to achieved air superiority over their &quot;Fuerzas Aéreas de la República Española&quot; opponents, who flew a motley collection of very different and often obsolete aircraft. The Fiat biplane proved to be effective in the theatre, the &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot; claiming 60 (48 confirmed) modern Russian Tupolev SB bombers, which were once believed to be impossible to intercept, as well as 242 Polikarpov I-15 biplane fighters, and 240 Polikarpov I-16 monoplane fighters, plus another hundred aircraft that were not confirmed. In exchange, C.R.32 losses were reportedly only 73. According to other sources, of the 376 Fiat shipped to Spain, 175 (43 Spanish operated and 132 Italian) were lost, including 99 (26 Spanish and 73 Italian) shot down, while, by January 1939, the number of I-15s shot down was just 88.

====Spanish aces====
The top scoring CR.32 ace was Spaniard Joaquín García Morato y Castaño, who was the leading Nationalist fighter pilot of the Spanish Civil War. He achieved 36 of his 40 victories while flying the Fiat biplane. He used the same aircraft, which carried the number &quot;3-51&quot; on the fuselage, until his death. During April 1939, shortly after the war had finished, Morato fatally crashed his faithful &quot;3-51&quot; while performing low aerobatics.

Another Nationalist CR.32 ace was &quot;Capitán&quot; Manuel Vázquez Sagastizábal, who claimed 21 victories with &quot;Grupo 2-G-3&quot;, before he was shot down and killed on 23 January 1939. &quot;Comandante&quot; Angel Salas Larrazabal, after one kill flying a Nieuport-Delage 52, flew multiple CR.32s, shooting down, on 29 October 1936, the first of the fast Soviet monoplane Tupolev SB-2 bombers to fall to Nationalist fighters. He shot down four more aircraft with the CR.32 before moving to a Heinkel He 51 unit. After two more victories, he joined the new &quot;Grupo 2-G-3&quot;. With this unit, again flying CR.32s, he raised his score to 16, including three SB-2s and an I-16 in a single sortie on 2 September 1938. &quot;Capitán&quot; Miguel Guerrero Garcia achieved nine of his 13 victories flying the Fiat biplane: four I-15s, three &quot;Papagayos&quot; (R-5s and Polikarpov-RZs assault bombers), and two I-16s.

===Second World War===
The aerobatic characteristics of the CR.32 and its success in Spain misled the Italian air ministry, which was convinced that a biplane fighter still had potential as a weapon of war. Consequently, during May 1939, prior to Italy entering the Second World War, CR.32 fighters, in &quot;bis&quot;, &quot;ter&quot;, and &quot;quater&quot; versions, represented two-thirds of all fighters in the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. A total of 288 were based in Italy and North Africa, while 24 were stationed in East Africa.

====North Africa====
When Italy declared war on Britain and France on 10 June 1940, 36 CR.32s together with 51 Fiat CR.42s formed the operational fighter force of the Regia Aeronautica in Libya. The first combat between CR.32s and British aircraft came the following day. Six CR.32s intercepted a formation of Bristol Blenheim bombers attacking the airfield at El Adem, claiming two Blenheims shot down and the remaining four damaged (compared with actual British losses of two Blenheims lost and two damaged), for no losses. According to Cattaneo, instead of focusing on air-to-air dogfighting, CR.32 pilots typically engaged in strafing ground targets, acting as light attack aircraft instead; he stated these activities to have been of &quot;limited effectiveness&quot; in the campaign.

====East Africa====
Possibly the greatest wartime successes to be achieved by CR.32s were accomplished in Italian East Africa. Here, 410a and 411a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; CR.32s (which represented half of all the fighters operational in the Italian colony) destroyed a number of British and South African aircraft. In the hands of a skillful pilot, the CR.32 could be capable of defeating the faster, more powerful, and better-armed monoplanes, like the Hurricanes and the Blenheims.

The Fiats received their baptism of fire on 17 June, when CR. 32s of 411a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; flown by &quot;Tenente&quot; Aldo Meoli and &quot;Maresciallo&quot; Bossi attacked three South African Air Force Junkers Ju 86 bombers bound for Yavello, escorted by two Hurricanes of 1 SAAF Squadron. The Fiat CR.32s shot down one of the Ju 86s and then pounced on the Hurricanes, shooting down the one flown by 2/Lt B.L. Griffiths, who was killed in the crash. 
On the 7th of July, three CR.32s, escorting as many Caproni Ca.133s, intercepted three Hawker Hartebeests, and shot down the plane flown by Lt N.K. Rankin, killing the pilot and his gunner, Air Sgt D.H. Hughes. On 23 February 1941, while in the process of attacking the airfield at Makale, Maj Laurie Wilmot, who was flying a Hurricane, was bounced by Italian ace Alberto Veronese in a Fiat biplane. Wilmot was forced to crash-land, becoming a prisoner of war (PoW). Soon after, Capt Andrew Duncan hit Veronese, who was wounded and bailed out. 
The CR.32s obtained other kills, despite having to face an ever increasing number of more modern aircraft.

The 410a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; alone managed to shoot down 14 enemy aircraft, before being disbanded. But the impossibility of obtaining replacements and spare parts from the motherland caused the gradual thinning of the rows of CR.32s. On 10 January 1941 there were still 22 CR.32s in service, on 31 January there were 14, on 10 February 11 and on 5 March just eight. The last CR.32 survived until mid-April 1941.

====Mediterranean====
Fourteen CR.32s of 160° &quot;Gruppo&quot; and nine of 2° &quot;Gruppo&quot; from 6° &quot;Stormo&quot; saw action against Greece in the first weeks after the attack of 28 October 1940. Eight more from 163aa &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, based at Gadurrà airport on Rhodes, took part in the invasion of Crete. CR.32s of 3° &quot;Gruppo&quot; operated in Sardinia, but in the period of July–December 1940 their number fell from 28 to seven serviceable aircraft. Cattaneo observed that ground crews lacked the fuel, ammunition, and spare components to properly maintain their aircraft, often resulting to improvisation due to the poor supply situation, which severely impacted the fighter&#x27;s operational effectiveness. The last front line CR.32 survived until mid-April 1941 when they were sent to the &quot;Scuola Caccia&quot; (Schools for fighter pilots). By 1942, the type was relegated to only night missions as newer fighters were put into service.

===International use===
====China====
The first international operator of the CR.32 was Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s for China, which ordered 16 (according to other sources 24) CR.32s of the first series in 1933. The aircraft mounted Vickers 7.7 mm machine guns instead of the Breda-SAFAT, electric headlights, and the cooling fins on the oil tank in the nose were removed. Additionally, some were equipped with radios. They were based at Nangahang airport, near Shanghai. Some officers of the Chinese high command disliked the Fiat, but Chinese pilots appreciated that the Italian biplanes in comparative tests proved superior to the American Curtiss Hawk and Boeing P-26. The Chinese Government did not order more CR.32s as it was difficult to import alcohol and benzole to mix with petrol for the engines. In May 1936, only six CR.32s were still operational. In August 1937, the remaining CR.32s were used with some initial success in Shanghai against the invading Japanese. By late 1937, when the Chinese capital at Nanjing fell, all CR.32s had been lost.

====Austria====
In spring 1936, 45 CR.32s were ordered by Austria to equip &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; II at Wiener Neustadt. In March 1938, following the Anschluss with neighbouring Nazi Germany, the Austrian units were absorbed into the Luftwaffe, and, after a brief period, the 36 remaining aircraft were handed over to Hungary.

====Hungary====
The Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő, the Royal Hungarian Air Force (MKHL), acquired a total of 76 CR.32s during 1935 and 1936. MKHL Fiat biplanes had their baptism of fire in 1939, during the short conflict with the newly-formed state of Slovakia. The CR.32s, which were emblazoned with the red/white/green chevrons insignia, easily gained air superiority over the fledgling Slovak Air Force, which lost a few Avia B.534s and Letov S-328s during this action.

During the short conflict against Yugoslavia, fought in April 1941, the MKHL lost three CR.32s and, on 6 May 1941, the Hungarian Air Force still had 69 Fiat CR.32s on line. In June 1941, when the Kingdom of Hungary declared war on the Soviet Union, the CR.32 fighter equipped two of the units that supported the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front: 1./I Group of 1st Fighter Wing, based in Szolnok, and 2./I Group, of 2nd Fighter Wing, based at Nyíregyháza.
On 29 June, the first aerial combat over Hungary took place, when seven Tupolev SB-2 bombers attacked the railway station at Csap and were intercepted by the Fiat CR.32s from 2/3 Fighter squadron. The Fiat biplanes shot down three of the raiders while incurring no loss to themselves.

Following the acquisition of newer fighters, including the Fiat CR.42 and Reggiane Re.2000, the remaining Hungarian CR.32s were relegated being used for training missions only.

====South Africa====
A CR-32 was captured intact at Addis Adaba, made flyable and was sent to Zwartkop Air Station in August 1941. The CR-32 went on a public tour and then joined 6 Squadron in April 1942, serving as a hack. In November 1942 the plane was transferred to the Natal University Air Training Squadron, eventually being scrapped in 1945.

====South America====
In 1938, Venezuela acquired nine CR.32&quot;quater&quot;s (according to other sources, 10 aircraft.) Modifications included a larger radiator to assist engine cooling in tropical climate conditions. The aircraft were delivered to Maracay in the second half of 1938 and equipped the 1° &quot;Regimiento de Aviación Militar del Venezuela&quot;. With five CR.32s still serviceable, the aircraft were struck off charge in 1943.

A small number, estimated at four, went to Paraguay in 1938. Five CR.32&quot;quater&quot; fighters (registered 1-1, 1-3, 1-5, 1-7 and 1-9) were assigned to 1.a &quot;Escuadrilla de Caza&quot; of the Fuerzas Aéreas del Ejército Nacional del Paraguay. They did not arrive in time for military operations against Bolivia, but were in service for several years.

==Variants==

The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; ordered 1,080 CR.32s (including the two prototypes and 23 aircraft rebuilt by SCA factory in Guidonia, near Rome, plus 52 without military registry numbers for Hungary). With 100 more CR.32quaters licence-built in Spain (as the Hispano Ha. 132L &quot;Chirri&quot;), the total CR.32 production numbers range from 1,306 to 1,332 examples.

<doc id="493828" wikidata="Q333932" url="?curid=493828" title="John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon">
<text>John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon (5 November 1931 – 5 June 2023) was a Welsh politician. He was a Labour Party Member of Parliament for over 41 years, from 1959 to 2001, which included a period as Secretary of State for Wales from 1974 to 1979 and as Attorney General between 1997 and 1999. A native Welsh speaker, he was the last living former Labour MP who was first elected in the 1950s. He was also the last surviving member of Harold Wilson&#x27;s 1974–76 cabinet, and was the longest-serving Privy Counsellor at the time of his death. His combined parliamentary service totalled over 60 years.

==Background and education==
Morris was born in Capel Bangor, Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, on 5 November 1931. He was educated at the Ardwyn School, the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. During the course of his national service, he was stationed with the Royal Welch Fusiliers, the Welch Regiment, and the South Wales Borderers.

In 1959, Morris married Margaret Lewis, and they had three daughters.

==Legal career==
Morris was a barrister and was called to the Bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1954. He served as a legal adviser and deputy general secretary for the Farmers&#x27; Union of Wales. He practised at 2 Bedford Row Chambers, took silk in 1973, and was made a Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1985. Between 1982 and 1997, he was a Recorder of the Crown Court.

==Political career==
Morris represented Aberavon as its Labour MP from 1959 onwards, and subsequently became the longest serving Welsh MP in Parliament, until his retirement in 2001. According to &quot;The Almanac of British Politics&quot;, Morris was a &quot;moderate&quot; Labour MP.

Morris served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Transport, and Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence. Having been sworn of the Privy Council in the 1970 Birthday Honours, Morris joined the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales between 5 March 1974 and 4 May 1979 and returned to Government as the Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland between 1997 and 1999, having shadowed the role since 1983. As such, he was one of only a small handful of Labour ministers to hold office under Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Tony Blair.

==Other positions held==
Morris was the Chancellor of the University of South Wales from the time of its formation in 2013. The University of South Wales was formed by a merger between University of Glamorgan (where Lord Morris was Chancellor from 2002) and the University of Wales, Newport. He succeeded fellow Labour politician Lord Merlyn-Rees as the Chancellor for the University of Glamorgan. Lord Morris was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the London Welsh Centre, Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, from 2001 until 2008. He was also a council member of The Prince&#x27;s Trust.

== Later life and death ==
His memoir, &quot;Fifty Years in Politics and the Law&quot;, was published in 2011.

At the death of Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford on 18 March 2023, Morris and Stratton Mills became the surviving former MPs with the earliest date of first election, both having first entered Parliament at the 1959 general election.

Morris died on 5 June 2023, at the age of 91.

==Honours==
Morris was raised to the peerage for life as Baron Morris of Aberavon, of Aberavon in the County of West Glamorgan and of Ceredigion in the County of Dyfed in the 2001 Dissolution Honours, was made Lord Lieutenant of Dyfed a year later and was appointed to the Order of the Garter as a Knight Companion (KG) in 2003.

<doc id="493830" wikidata="Q1066772" url="?curid=493830" title="Charley Pride">
<text>Charley Frank Pride (March 18, 1934 – December 12, 2020) was an American country singer. Beginning his career as a Negro league baseball player in the early-1950s, he later pursued a career in country music, becoming the genre&#x27;s first major black superstar. The period of his greatest musical success was from around 1969 to 1975, when he was the top-selling artist for RCA Records, outselling even Elvis Presley and John Denver. During the peak years of his recording career (1966–1987), he had 52 top-10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, 30 of which made it to number one. Songs such as &quot;All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)&quot;, &quot;Is Anybody Goin&#x27; to San Antone&quot;, and &quot;Kiss an Angel Good Mornin&#x27;&quot;, among others, typified the &quot;countrypolitan&quot; style that made him famous and became crossover-pop hits. He won the Entertainer of the Year award at the Country Music Association Awards in 1971 and was awarded a Grammy for &quot;Best Country Vocal Performance, Male&quot; in 1972. Pride later ventured into gospel music, releasing his first gospel album &quot;Did You Think to Pray&quot; in 1971. In 1973 he performed &quot;The River Song&quot; from the motion picture musical &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;.

Pride is one of three African-American members of the Grand Ole Opry (the others being DeFord Bailey and Darius Rucker). He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life==
Pride was born on March 18, 1934, in Sledge, Mississippi, the fourth of eleven children of poor sharecroppers. His father intended to name him Charl Frank Pride, but owing to a clerical error on his birth certificate, his legal name was Charley Frank Pride. Eight boys and three girls were in the family. His elder brother, Mack Pride, played Negro league baseball before entering the ministry.

==Career==

===Baseball and military service===
When Pride was 14, his mother purchased him his first guitar and he taught himself to play. Though he loved music, one of Pride&#x27;s lifelong dreams was to become a professional baseball player. In 1952, he pitched for the Memphis Red Sox of the Negro American League. In 1953, he signed a contract with the Boise Yankees, the Class C farm team of the New York Yankees. During that season, an injury caused him to lose the &quot;mustard&quot; on his fastball, and he was sent to the Yankees&#x27; Class D team in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Later that season, while in the Negro leagues with the Louisville Clippers, two players – Pride and Jesse Mitchell – were traded to the Birmingham Black Barons for a team bus. &quot;Jesse and I may have the distinction of being the only players in history to be traded for a used motor vehicle,&quot; Pride mused in his 1994 autobiography.

Pride pitched for several other minor league teams, his hopes of making it to the big leagues still alive, but was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1956. After basic training, he was stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, where he was a quartermaster and played on the Fort&#x27;s baseball team. That team won the All Army Sports Championship. When discharged in 1958, he rejoined the Memphis Red Sox. He tried to return to baseball, though hindered by an injury to his throwing arm.

Pride played three games for the Missoula Timberjacks of the Pioneer League (a farm club of the Cincinnati Reds) in 1960, and had tryouts with the California Angels (1961) and the New York Mets (1962) organizations, but was not picked up by either team.

When he was laid off by the Timberjacks, he moved to work construction in Helena, Montana, in 1960. He was recruited to pitch for the local semipro baseball team, the East Helena Smelterites, and the team manager helped him get a job at the local Asarco lead smelter. The lead smelter kept 18 jobs open specifically for baseball players, and arranged their shifts so they could play as a team. Pride batted .444 his first year.

Pride&#x27;s singing ability soon came to the attention of the team manager, who also paid him to sing for 15 minutes before each game, which increased attendance and earned Pride another $10 on top of the $10 he earned for each game. He also played gigs in the local area, both solo and with a band called the Night Hawks, and Asarco asked him to sing at company picnics. His job at the smelter was dangerous and difficult; he once broke his ankle. He routinely unloaded coal from railroad cars, shoveling it into a furnace while keeping clear of slag, a task that frequently gave him burns. In a 2014 interview, Pride explained, &quot;I would work at the smelter, work the swing shift and then play music,&quot; said Pride. &quot;I&#x27;d work 11–7. Drive. Play Friday. Punch in. Drive. Polson. Philipsburg.&quot;

Between his smelter job and his music, he made a good living in the Helena area. He moved his wife and son to join him and they lived in Helena until 1967, purchasing their first home there, and with their children Dion and Angela being born at the local hospital. The Pride family moved to Great Falls, Montana, in 1967, because Pride&#x27;s music career was taking off and he required quicker access to an airport. The family ultimately left Montana and moved to Texas in 1969. In a 1967 interview with the Helena &quot;Independent Record&quot;, his wife Rozene Pride commented that the family encountered minor racism in Montana, citing an incident where they were refused service in a restaurant and another time when a realtor refused to show them a home, but she felt that the family endured less racism than she saw leveled against local Native American people, whose treatment she compared to that given to black people in the South. Pride has generally spoken with fondness of the near-decade he spent there. &quot;Montana is a very conservative state ... I stood out like a neon. But once they let you in, you become a Montanan. When the rumor was that I was leaving. They kept saying, &#x27;we will let you in, you can&#x27;t leave.&#x27;&quot;

On June 5, 2008, Pride and his brother Mack &quot;The Knife&quot; Pride and 28 other living former Negro league players were &quot;drafted&quot; by each of the 30 Major League Baseball teams in a recognition of the on-field achievements and historical relevance of 30 mostly-forgotten Negro league stars. Pride was picked by the Texas Rangers, with whom he has had a long affiliation, and the Colorado Rockies took his brother Mack.

===Rise to fame===
While he was active in baseball, Pride had been encouraged to join the music business by country stars such as Red Sovine and Red Foley, and was working towards this career. In 1958, in Memphis, Pride visited Sun Studio and recorded some songs.

He performed his music solo at clubs and with a four-piece combo called the Night Hawks during the time he lived in Montana. His break came when Jack Clement produced a demo for Pride, and played it for RCA Records executive Chet Atkins, the longtime producer at RCA who had made stars out of country singers such as Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, and others, who offered Pride a recording contract in 1965. Nashville manager and agent Jack D. Johnson signed Pride. In 1966, Pride released his first RCA single, &quot;The Snakes Crawl at Night&quot;, but the song did not chart. On the records of this song submitted to radio stations for airplay, the singer was listed as &quot;Country Charley Pride&quot;. Pride disputes that the omission of a photo was deliberate; he stated that getting promoters to bring in a Black country singer was a bigger problem: &quot;People didn&#x27;t care if I was pink. RCA signed me ... they knew I was colored ... They decided to put the record out and let it speak for itself.&quot; While living in Montana, he continued to sing at local clubs, and in Great Falls had an additional boost to his career when he befriended local businessman Louis Allen &quot;Al&quot; Donohue, who owned radio stations, including KMON, the first stations to play Pride&#x27;s records in Montana.

Soon after the release of &quot;The Snakes Crawl at Night&quot;, Pride released another single called &quot;Before I Met You&quot;, which also did not chart. Not long afterwards, his third single, &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot;, was released. This song finally brought Pride success on the country charts. The song reached number nine on Hot Country Songs on February 25, 1967.

According to a news item by the Associated Press, Pride made this comment in a 1992 interview: &quot;They used to ask me how it feels to be the &#x27;first colored country singer&#x27; ... Then it was &#x27;first Negro country singer;&#x27; then &#x27;first black country singer.&#x27; Now I&#x27;m the &#x27;first African-American country singer.&#x27; That&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s changed&quot;.

===Career peak===

The success of &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot; was enormous. Pride was nominated for a Grammy Award for the song the next year. In the late summer of 1966, on the strength of his early releases, he was booked for his first large show, in Detroit&#x27;s Olympia Stadium. Since no biographical information had been included with those singles, few of the 10,000 country fans who came to the show knew Pride was Black and discovered the fact only when he walked onto the stage, at which point the applause trickled off to silence. &quot;I knew I&#x27;d have to get it over with sooner or later,&quot; Pride later remembered. &quot;I told the audience: &#x27;Friends, I realize it&#x27;s a little unique, me coming out here – with a permanent suntan – to sing country and western to you. But that&#x27;s the way it is.&#x27; &quot;

The show became the first of a long and active career playing to large audiences, his race soon becoming a minor detail compared to his success. In 1967, he became the first black performer to appear at the Grand Ole Opry since founding member DeFord Bailey, who had last appeared in 1941. Between 1969 and 1971, Pride had eight singles that reached number one on the US Country Hit Parade and also charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)&quot;, &quot;(I&#x27;m So) Afraid of Losing You Again&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe That You&#x27;ve Stopped Loving Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Love You&quot;, &quot;Is Anybody Goin&#x27; to San Antone&quot;, &quot;Wonder Could I Live There Anymore&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Just Me&quot;, and &quot;Kiss an Angel Good Mornin&#x27;&quot;. The pop success of these songs reflected the country/pop crossover sound that was reaching country music in the 1960s and early 1970s, known as &quot;Countrypolitan&quot;. In 1969, his compilation album, &quot;The Best of Charley Pride&quot;, sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Ultimately, Elvis Presley was the only artist who sold more records than Pride for RCA.

Pride performed &quot;All His Children&quot;, featured in the film &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; (1971). The film received two Oscar nominations in 1972, one for &quot;All His Children&quot;.

===&quot;Kiss an Angel Good Mornin&#x27;&quot;===

In 1971, Pride released what would become his biggest hit, &quot;Kiss an Angel Good Mornin&#x27;&quot;, a million-selling crossover single. The same year, he won the Country Music Association&#x27;s entertainer of the year award, as well as its top male vocalist award in 1971 and 1972.

&quot;Kiss an Angel Good Mornin&#x27;&quot; became Pride&#x27;s signature tune. Besides being a five-week country number one in late 1971 and early 1972, the song was also his only pop top-40 hit, hitting number 21, and reaching the top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts, as well.

===1970s and Northern Ireland===
During the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Pride continued to rack up country music hits. Other Pride standards from this period include &quot;Mississippi Cotton Picking Delta Town&quot;, &quot;Someone Loves You, Honey&quot;, &quot;When I Stop Leavin&#x27; (I&#x27;ll Be Gone)&quot;, &quot;Burgers and Fries&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Think She&#x27;s in Love Anymore&quot;, &quot;Roll On Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Never Been So Loved (In All My Life)&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re So Good When You&#x27;re Bad&quot;. Like many other country performers, Pride paid tribute to Hank Williams, with an album of songs that were all written by Hank titled &quot;There&#x27;s a Little Bit of Hank in Me&quot;, which included top-sellers of Williams&#x27; classics &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot;, &quot;Honky Tonk Blues&quot;, and &quot;You Win Again&quot;. Pride sold more than 70 million records (singles, albums, and compilations included).

In 1975, Pride&#x27;s agent sold a 40-date tour package to a United Kingdom booking agent, who onward sold four dates to the Dublin-based Irish music promoter Jim Aiken. At the time, the Troubles were at their height, and few nonresident music and sports teams traveled there. Aiken subsequently traveled to Pride&#x27;s winter 1975/&#x27;76 concert in Ohio, and persuaded Pride to play one of the concerts at Belfast&#x27;s Ritz Cinema. Pride played the concert in November 1976, with his album song &quot;Crystal Chandeliers&quot; subsequently being released as a single in the UK and Ireland. Pride subsequently became a hero to both sides of the conflict for breaking the effective touring concert ban, his song &quot;Crystal Chandeliers&quot; was seen as a unity song, and the success of Pride&#x27;s visit enabled Aiken to book further acts into Northern Ireland after his appearance.

===1980s and beyond===

Pride performed the national anthem before game six of the 1980 World Series. He also performed the national anthem at Super Bowl VIII and again at game five of the 2010 World Series, accompanied both years by the Del Rio High School JROTC Color Guard.

On May 1, 1993, Pride became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He celebrated his 25th anniversary of becoming a member with performances at the Opry on May 4 and 5, 2018.

In 1994, Charley Pride published his book &quot;Pride: The Charley Pride Story.&quot; Pride spoke with John Seigenthaler on Nashville Public Television about the book and his childhood in Mississippi, the impacts of racism throughout his career, and his battle with depression.

In 2016, Pride was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, which celebrates 50 years of the Country Music Association Awards. Pride released his first album in six years, titled &quot;Music in My Heart&quot;, on July 7, 2017.

In 2020, the CMA announced that Pride would receive the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award at the 54th Country Music Association Awards in recognition of his work in the genre. The CEO of the CMA explained that &quot;Charley Pride is the epitome of a trailblazer. Few other artists have grown country music&#x27;s rich heritage and led to the advancement of country music around the world like Charley. His distinctive voice has created a timeless legacy that continues to echo through the country community today. We could not be more excited to honor Charley with one of CMA&#x27;s highest accolades.&quot;

==Personal life==
Pride met his wife Rozene while playing baseball in Memphis, Tennessee. They married in 1956 while Pride was on Christmas leave from Army basic training. The couple had two sons, Kraig and Dion, and a daughter, Angela. They also had five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. They resided in Dallas.

In the late 1970s, Pride had an extramarital affair with an unmarried Dallas flight attendant, and in 1979, she gave birth to a son, Tyler. In 1990, the woman sued Pride for child support, and Pride responded by contesting the boy&#x27;s paternity. In 1992, after a DNA paternity test demonstrated that Pride was in fact the child&#x27;s father, a Texas court ordered Pride to pay child support until Tyler&#x27;s 18th birthday, and further ordered that the boy&#x27;s surname be changed to Pride.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmn_6/9/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pride had a tumor removed from his right vocal cord in 1997 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. He returned to the site in February 2009 for a routine checkup and surprised the Arkansas Senate with an unplanned performance of five songs. He was joined by Governor Mike Beebe during the show.

Pride was a fan and part owner of the Texas Rangers. He also performed the national anthem at some of the Rangers&#x27; games. He was also a Dallas Cowboys fan and created their theme song &quot;We&#x27;re the Cowboys&quot; in 1979.

Pride is a distant relative of blues guitarist and singer Christone &quot;Kingfish&quot; Ingram.

==Death==
Pride died from complications related to COVID-19 in Dallas, on December 12, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. He was 86 years old.

In May 2021, Tyler Pride contested Charley&#x27;s will, asserting that he had been omitted to maintain &quot;a Pride family secret&quot; and &quot;[protect] Charley&#x27;s brand and legacy.&quot; In a statement to &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, Rozene—the executor of Charley&#x27;s will—did not dispute that Tyler was Charley&#x27;s son, but said that Tyler had been given adequate compensation and recognition during Charley&#x27;s life, and characterized the lawsuit as a ploy for financial gain. In September 2022, Tyler Pride said that the lawsuit had been settled for undisclosed terms.

<doc id="493833" wikidata="Q1738955" url="?curid=493833" title="Light characteristic">
<text>A light characteristic is all of the properties that make a particular somewhat navigational light identifiable. Graphical and textual descriptions of navigational light sequences and colours are displayed on nautical charts and in Light Lists with the chart symbol for a lighthouse, lightvessel, buoy or sea mark with a light on it. Different lights use different colours, frequencies and light patterns, so mariners can identify which light they are seeing.

==Abbreviations==
While light characteristics can be described in prose, e.g. &quot;Flashing white every two seconds&quot;, lists of lights and navigation chart annotations use abbreviations. The abbreviation notation is slightly different from one light list to another, with dots added or removed, but it usually follows a pattern similar to the following (see the chart to the right for examples).
* An abbreviation of the type of light, e.g. &quot;Fl.&quot; for flashing, &quot;F.&quot; for fixed.
* The color of the light, e.g. &quot;W&quot; for white, &quot;G&quot; for green, &quot;R&quot; for red, &quot;Y&quot; for yellow, &quot;Bu&quot; for blue. If no color is given, a white light is generally implied.
* The cycle period, e.g. &quot;10s&quot; for ten seconds.
* Additional parameters are sometimes added:
:* The height of the light above the chart datum for height (usually based on high water). e.g. 15m for 15 metres.
:* The range in which the light is visible, e.g. &quot;10M&quot; for 10 nautical miles.

An example of a complete light characteristic is &quot;Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M&quot;. This indicates that the light is a &quot;group occulting light&quot; in which a group of three eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; the light is white; the light is 15 metres above the chart datum and the nominal range is 10 nautical miles.

==Light patterns==
===Fixed light===
A fixed light, abbreviated &quot;F&quot;, is a continuous and steady light.

===Flashing light===

A flashing light is a rhythmic light in which the total duration of the light in each period is clearly shorter than the total duration of the darkness and in which the flashes of light are all of equal duration. It is most commonly used for a single-flashing light which exhibits only single flashes which are repeated at regular intervals, in which case it is abbreviated simply as &quot;Fl&quot;. It can also be used with a group of flashes which are regularly repeated, in which case the abbreviation is &quot;Fl(2)&quot; or &quot;Gr Fl(2)&quot;, for a group of two flashes. Another possibility is a composite group, in which successive groups in the period have different numbers of flashes, e.g. &quot;Fl. (2+1)&quot; indicates a group of two flashes, followed by one flash.

A specific case sometimes used is when the flashes are longer than two seconds. Such a light is sometimes denoted &quot;long flashing&quot; with the abbreviation &quot;L.Fl&quot;.

If the frequency of flashes is high (more than 30 or 50 per minute) the light is denoted as a &quot;quick light&quot;, see below.

===Occulting light===

An occulting light is a rhythmic light in which the duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of flashing off, rather than flashing on. Like a flashing light, it can be used for a single occulting light that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated &quot;Oc&quot;), a group (Oc(3)) or a composite group (Oc(2+1)).

The term occulting is used because originally the effect was obtained by a mechanism (e.g. a vertical or rotating shutter) periodically shading the light from view.

===Isophase light===
An isophase light, abbreviated &quot;Iso&quot;, is a light which has dark and light periods of equal length. The prefix derives from the Greek &quot;iso-&quot; meaning &quot;same&quot;.

===Quick light===
A quick light, abbreviated &quot;Q&quot;, is a special case of a flashing light with a high frequency (more than 30 or 50 per minute). If the sequence of flashes is interrupted by regularly repeated eclipses of constant and long duration, the light is denoted &quot;interrupted quick&quot;, abbreviated &quot;I.Q&quot;.

Group notation similar to flashing and occulting lights is also sometimes used, e.g. Q(9).

Another distinction sometimes made is between quick (more than 50 and less than 80 flashes per minute), very quick (more than 80 and less than 160 flashes per minutes, abbreviated &quot;V.Q&quot;) and ultra quick (no less than 160 flashes per minute, abbreviate &quot;U.Q&quot;). This can be combined with notations for interruptions, e.g. I.U.Q for interrupted ultra quick, or grouping, e.g. V.Q(9) for a very quick group of nine flashes. Quick characteristics can also be followed by other characteristics, e.g. VQ(6) LFl for a very quick group of six flashes, followed by a long flash.

===Morse code===
A Morse code light is light in which appearances of light of two clearly different durations (dots and dashes) are grouped to represent a character or characters in the Morse Code. For example, &quot;Mo(A)&quot; is a light in which in each period light is shown for a short period (dot) followed by a long period (dash), the Morse Code for &quot;A&quot;.

===Fixed and flashing===
A fixed and flashing light, abbreviated &quot;F. Fl&quot;, is a light in which a fixed low intensity light is combined with a flashing high intensity light.

===Alternating===
An alternating light, abbreviated &quot;Al&quot;, is a light which shows alternating colors. For example, &quot;Al WG&quot; shows white and green lights alternately.

<doc id="493842" wikidata="Q12605" url="?curid=493842" title="Prostitution in Germany">
<text>Prostitution in Germany is legal, as are other aspects of the sex industry, including brothels, advertisement, and job offers through HR companies. Full-service sex work is widespread and regulated by the German government, which levies taxes on it. In 2016, the government adopted a new law, the Prostitutes Protection Act, in an effort to improve the legal situation of sex workers, while also now enacting a legal requirement for registration of prostitution activity and banning prostitution which involves no use of condoms. The social stigmatization of sex work persists and many workers continue to lead a double life. Human rights organizations consider the resulting common exploitation of women from Eastern and Southeastern Europe to be the main problem associated with the profession.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages to Confederation (1815) ===
Sex work in historically German lands has never been outlawed and has been described since the Middle Ages. Since the 13th century, several German cities operated brothels known as &quot;Frauenhäuser&quot; (&quot;women&#x27;s houses&quot;);

the practice of sex work was considered a necessary evil, a position already held by Saint Augustine (354–430). Some municipalities actively encouraged it and far from existing on the margins, sex workers were often honoured guests, who maintained domestic order as an outlet and lesser evil to such things as adultery and rape. The city also gained tax revenues from the prostitutes.

Emperor Sigismund (1368–1437) thanked the city of Konstanz in writing for providing some 1,500 workers for the Council of Constance which took place from 1414 to 1418.

Sex workers were more vigorously persecuted beginning in the 16th century, with the start of the Reformation and the appearance of syphilis. In 1530, Charles V ordered the closure of brothels throughout the German Holy Roman Empire.

Section 999 of the 1794 General State Laws for the Prussian States determined that &quot;dissolute female persons who want to do business with their bodies ... would have to go into the whoredom houses tolerated under the supervision of the state&quot;.
=== The Confederations (1815–1871)===
Beginning in the 19th century, sex workers in many regions had to register with police or local health authorities and submit to regular health checks to curb venereal diseases.

The so-called &quot;Bremer Regulations&quot; of 1852 stated that prostitution was &quot;not a trade in the true sense&quot;. By this distinction between prostitution and other trades, immorality of prostitution was defined in law.

===German Empire (1871–1918)===
In Imperial Germany (1871–1918) attitudes to sex work were ambivalent. While sex work was tolerated as a necessary function to provide for male sexuality outside of marriage, it was frowned on as a threat to contemporary moral images of women&#x27;s sexuality. Therefore, state policy concentrated on regulation rather than abolition. This was mainly at the municipal level. The Criminal Code of 1871 prohibited brothels and &quot;commercial fornication&quot;. In the 1876 version, prostitution was only punishable if the woman worked outside police supervision. State regulation at the time created an atmosphere which defined what was considered proper, and what was proper feminine sexuality.

Controls were particularly tight in the port city of Hamburg. The regulations included defining the dress and conduct of prostitutes both inside and outside the brothel, thus making the occupation define their lives as a separate class of women on the margins of society.

At the beginning of the 20th century, prostitution was considered &quot;harmful to communities&quot;. Nevertheless, there existed or originated in the 20th century, various brothel and red-light districts such as Helenenstraße in Bremen (from 1878), Linienstraße in Dortmund (from 1904), Stahlstraße in Essen (from about 1900), Rampenloch in Minden (from 1908), Im Winkel in Bochum (from about 1912), and the Flaßhofstraße in Oberhausen (from 1910 and 1963). It is estimated that in 1900 there were 50,000 women working in Berlin (population 1 December 1900: 1,888,848).

===Weimar Republic (1918–1933)===
In Weimar-era Germany the economy collapsed due to the loss of the First World War and the imposition of war reparations at the Treaty of Versailles. As a result, the middle class lost their savings and the working class were unemployed. The Republic ended up printing money to pay its bills which lead to hyperinflation in 1923. The outcome of all of this was that women, including the millions of war widows, turned to prostitution. Licentiousness and streetwalking were common in this period and Weimar Berlin is famed for its decadence.

On a national scale, prostitution was officially proscribed, but within various locales, polices tolerated prostitutes if they were in state registry. Prostitutes were to have compulsory medical examines for STDs, banned from areas of large public gathering, and were required to give up personal freedoms of private residence, travel, and denying unwarranted search under the German moral police, &quot;Sittenpolizei&quot;. Unregistered prostitutes arrested for soliciting, or otherwise were not given the same legal protection or voice as average citizens, and due process was not practiced.

The Law for Combating Venereal Diseases was adopted in 1927, which decriminalized prostitution thus undoing the state-regulated system, &quot;Reglementierung&quot;.

=== Nazi era (1933–1945) ===
During the Nazi era, street based sex workers were seen as &quot;asocial&quot; and degenerate and were at times sent to concentration camps, especially to the Ravensbrück camp. The Nazis did not entirely disapprove of sex work though and instead installed a centralized system of city brothels, military brothels (&quot;Wehrmachtsbordelle&quot;), brothels for foreign forced laborers, and concentration camp brothels.

During the Second World War, the German Wehrmacht established about 100 Wehrmacht brothels in the occupied territories, including France, Poland, Italy, and Norway. Lothar-Günther Buchheim described his impressions from Brest: &quot;If a large ship had arrived, the hookers simply laid there between sailors.&quot; Military prostitution was regulated, &quot;Only a permit from the military command brothel allowed you to visit. Always use a condom (rubber protection). For the German soldiers there was a disinfectant syringe in the urethra.&quot;

Between 1942 and 1945, camp brothels were installed in ten concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Himmler intended these as an incentive for cooperative and hard-working non-Jewish and non-Russian inmates, in order to increase the productivity of the work camps. Initially the brothels were staffed mostly with former sex worker inmates who volunteered, but women were also put under pressure to work there.
In the documentary film, &quot;Memory of the Camps&quot;, a project supervised by the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information during the summer of 1945, camera crews filmed women who stated that they were forced into sexual slavery for the use of guards and favored prisoners. The filmmakers stated that as the women died they were replaced by women from the concentration camp Ravensbrück.

None of the women who were forced to work in these concentration camp brothels ever received compensation, since the German compensation laws do not cover persons designated as &quot;asocial&quot; by the Nazis.

In a famous case of espionage, the Nazi intelligence service SD took over the luxurious Berlin brothel Salon Kitty and equipped it with listening devices and specially trained sex workers. From 1939 to 1942 the brothel was used to spy on important visitors.

=== German Democratic Republic (GDR 1945–1990) ===

After World War II, the country was divided into East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany from 1949–90). In East Germany, as in all countries of the communist Eastern Bloc, full-service sex work was illegal and according to the official position, it did not exist. There were high-class sex workers working in the hotels of East Berlin and the other major cities, mainly targeting Western visitors; the Stasi employed some of these for spying purposes. Street-based workers were available for the pleasure of visiting Westerners, too.

=== Federal Republic of Germany (BRD 1945–2001) ===
In West Germany, the registration and testing requirements remained in place but were handled quite differently in the regions of the country. In Bavaria, in addition to scheduled Sexually transmitted disease (STD) check-ups, regular tests for HIV were required from 1987, but this was an exception. Many sex workers did not submit to these tests, avoiding the registration. A study in 1992 found that only 2.5% of the tested workers had a disease, a rate much lower than the one among comparable non-sex workers.

In 1967, Europe&#x27;s largest brothel at the time, the six-floor Eros Center, was opened on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. An even larger one, the twelve-floor building now called &quot;Pascha&quot; in Cologne was opened in 1972. The AIDS scare of the late 1980s had an effect on the business, and the Eros Center closed, as well as several other brothels in Hamburg. The &quot;Pascha&quot; continued to flourish, and has evolved into a chain with additional brothels in Munich and Salzburg.

Anything which led to the &quot;promotion of prostitution&quot; (&quot;Förderung der Prostitution&quot;) remained a crime until 2001, even after the extensive criminal law reforms of 1973. This placed operators of brothels under the threat of potential legal action. Most brothels were, therefore, run as a bar with an attached but legally separate room rental. Many municipalities built, ran and profited from high rise or townhouse-style high-rent &quot;Dirnenwohnheime&quot; (lit.: &quot;whores&#x27; dormitories&quot;), to keep street-based sex work and pimping under control. Here workers sold sex in a room they rented by the day. These establishments, called &quot;Laufhäuser&quot; in Johns&#x27; jargon are now mostly privatized and operate as &quot;Eros Centers&quot;. Even before the 2001 reform, many upmarket sex workers operated in their own apartments, alone or with other women. Luxurious country houses, called &quot;FKK-Sauna-Clubs&quot; are the higher-priced end of prostitution in Germany. There, women and men pay the same entrance fees ranging from about €50 to 100 and usually include meals and drinks and the sex workers negotiate their deals with the individual clients, thus avoiding the appearance of pimping (&quot;Zuhälterei&quot;). Illegal variations on that business model, like &quot;Flatrate-Clubs&quot; and &quot;Pauschalclubs&quot; also exist and advertise openly in daily newspapers and the Internet. These establishments charge an &quot;all-you-can handle&quot; fee of about €75 to €90.

Before the 2002 prostitution law, the highest courts of Germany repeatedly ruled that sex work offends good moral order (&quot;verstößt gegen die guten Sitten&quot;), with several legal consequences. Any contract that is considered immoral is null and void, so a sex worker could not sue for payment. Sex workers working out of their apartments could lose their leases. Finally, bars and inns could be denied licenses if sex work took place on their premises.

In 1999, Felicitas Weigmann lost the licence for her Berlin cafe &quot;Psst!&quot;, because the cafe was being used to initiate contacts between customers and sex work and had an attached room-rental also owned by Weigmann. She sued the city, arguing that society&#x27;s position had changed and sex work no longer qualified as offending the moral order. The judge conducted an extensive investigation and solicited a large number of opinions. In December 2000 the court agreed with Weigmann&#x27;s claim. This ruling is considered as precedent and important factor in the realization of the Prostitution Law of 1 January 2002. Only after an appeal process though, filed by the Berlin town district, was Weigmann to regain her café license in October 2002.

The compulsory registration and testing of workers was abandoned in 2001. Anonymous, free and voluntary health testing has been made available to everyone, including illegal immigrants. Many brothel operators require these tests.

== Modern era ==
=== Legislative reform (2002) ===
In 2002, a one-page law sponsored by the Green Party was passed by the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Greens in the Bundestag. The law, the Prostitution Act (Prostitutionsgesetz), removed the general prohibition on furthering full-service sex work and allowed sex workers to obtain regular work contracts. The law&#x27;s rationale stated that sex work should not be considered as immoral anymore.

The law has been criticized as having not effectively changed the situation of the sex workers, believed to be because some workers themselves don&#x27;t want to change their working conditions and contracts. The German government issued a report on the law&#x27;s impact in January 2007, concluding that few sex workers had taken advantage of regular work contracts and that work conditions had improved only for 35% workers.

=== Post 2002 ===

Between 2000 and 2003, the visa issuing policies of German consulates were liberalized. The opposition claimed that this resulted in an increase in human trafficking and sex workers entering the country illegally, especially from Ukraine. The episode led to hearings in 2005 and is known as the German Visa Affair 2005.

In 2004, the Turkish gang leader Necati Arabaci was sentenced to 9 years in prison for pimping, human trafficking, assault, extortion, weapons violations and racketeering. His gang of bouncers controlled the night clubs in Cologne&#x27;s entertainment district, the Ring, where they befriended girls in order to exploit them as sex workers. After Arabaci&#x27;s arrest, informants overheard threats against the responsible prosecutor, who received police protection and fled the country in 2007 when Arabaci was deported to Turkey.

In 2004, the large FKK-brothel &quot;Colosseum&quot; opened in Augsburg, and police suspected a connection to Arabaci&#x27;s gang, which owned several similar establishments and was supposedly directed from prison by its convicted leader.

After several raids, police determined that the managers of the brothel dictated the prices that the women had to charge, prohibited them from sitting in groups or using cell phones during work, set the work hours, searched rooms and handbags, and made them work completely nude (charging a penalty of €10 per infraction). In April 2006, five men were charged with pimping. The court quashed the charges, arguing that the prostitution law of 2002 created a regular employer-employee relationship and thus gave the employer certain rights to direct the working conditions. Colosseum remained in business.

In early 2005, the media in Great Britain reported that a woman refusing to take a job as a sex worker might have her unemployment benefits reduced or removed altogether.
A similar account had appeared in mid-2003; a woman received a job offer through a private employment agency. In this case, the agency apologized for the mistake, stating that a request for a sex worker would normally have been rejected, but the client misled them, describing the position as &quot;a female barkeeper.&quot; To date, there have been no reported cases of women actually losing benefits in such a case, and the employment agencies have stated that women would not be made to work in sex work.

In March 2007, the brothel &quot;Pascha&quot; in Cologne announced that senior citizens above the age of 66 would receive a discount during afternoons; half of the price of €50 for a &quot;normal session&quot; would be covered by the house. Earlier, in 2004, a 20% discount for long-term unemployed had been announced by a brothel in Dresden.

Also in 2007, authorities in Berlin began to close several apartment brothels that had existed for many years. They cited a 1983 court decision that found that the inevitable disturbances caused by brothels were incompatible with residential areas. Sex workers&#x27; rights groups and brothel owners fought these efforts. They commissioned a study that concluded that apartment brothels in general neither promote criminality nor disturb neighbors.

The economic downturn of 2009 has resulted in changes at some brothels. Reduced prices and free promotions are now found. Some changes, the result of modern marketing tools, rebates, gimmicks. Brothels introducing all-inclusive flat-rates, free shuttle buses, discounts for seniors and taxi drivers. &quot;Day passes.&quot; Some brothels reportedly including loyalty cards, group sex parties, rebates for golf players. Clients have reported reducing their number of weekly visits.

In 2009, the &quot;Bundessozialgericht&quot; ruled that the German job agencies are not required to find sex workers for open positions in brothels. The court rejected the complaint of a brothel owner who had argued that the law of 2002 had turned sex work into a job like any other; the judges ruled that the law had been passed to protect the employees, not to further the business.

The effects of the reforms continue to be debated. A five-part series in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 2013 claimed it was a failure. Others have argued that, while the German model still has many weaknesses, it has reduced violence against sex workers.

In 2014, a startup in Berlin launched Peppr, an app for prostitution.

The Criminal Code was amended in October 2016 to criminalise clients of trafficked or coerced prostitutes. This change was led by Social Democrat Eva Högl.

The &quot;Prostituiertenschutzgesetz&quot; (Prostitutes Protection Act) came into force in July 2017. Amongst the provision of the Act are registration of prostitutes, annual health checks and mandatory condom use. Brothel operators also need to register and prove their &#x27;good conduct&#x27; before registration. The legislation also places restrictions on advertising.

==== Football World Cup 2006 ====

Officials speculated that up to 40,000 illegal sex workers, mainly from Eastern European countries, would enter Germany for the Football World Cup, held in Germany in the summer of 2006. Women and church groups were planning a &quot;Red card to forced prostitution&quot; campaign with the aim of alerting World Cup visitors to the existence of forced sex trafficking. They asked for support from the national football team and the national football organization but were initially rebuffed. In March 2006, the president of the German football federation turned around and agreed to support a campaign named &quot;Final Whistle – Stop Forced Prostitution&quot;. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Nordic Council and Amnesty International also expressed concern over an increase in the trafficking of women and forced sex trafficking up to and during the World Cup.

In March 2006, the campaign &quot;Responsible John. Prostitution without compulsion and violence&quot; was started by the government of Berlin. It provides a list of signs of forced sex trafficking and urges sex workers&#x27; customers to call a hotline if they spot one of those signs.

In April 2006, an advertisement for the Pascha brothel in Cologne that featured a several story-high image of a half-naked young woman with the flags of 2006 FIFA World Cup countries sparked outrage after Muslims were offended by the inclusion of the Saudi Arabian and Iranian flags. Pascha&#x27;s owner, Armin Lobscheid, said a group of Muslims had threatened violence over the advertisement, and he blacked out the two flags. The Tunisian flag that features the Muslim crescent remained on the advertisement.

On 30 June 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the expected increase in prostitution activity around the World Cup had not taken place. This was confirmed by the 2006 BKA report on human trafficking, which reported only five cases of human trafficking related to the World Cup.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Social distancing as a preventative measure during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany caused a marked reduction in the number of visitors to brothels, some operators reporting a 50% reduction in business. Several federal states ordered entertainment venues to close on 14 March 2020, followed by the Central Government ordering a nationwide closure on 22 March 2020. (Brothels are classed as entertainment venues in Germany.)

According to Susanne Bleier Wilp of the &quot;Association for Erotic and Sexual Services Providers&quot; lobby group in Berlin, 80% of the prostitutes working in Germany at the time were foreign, mainly from Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, and Ukraine. Many of them lived in the brothels. Whilst most returned to their home countries, some were made homeless by the brothel closures.

The () published a new hygiene concept for sex workers. It had three parts, one for sex workers who work in their own apartments, one for escorts and one for street prostitutes.

====Thuringia====
The Thuringian Corona Ordinance decided to keep all the prostitution-related facilities closed until 31 August 2020. The hygiene concepts referred to by brothel operators were all denied. Due to the physical closeness related to such services, it was impossible to counteract the dangers of getting infected effectively.

====Hamburg====
On Herbertstraße on St. Pauli, 400 prostitutes and brothel operators protested for the reopening of brothels on 11 July 2020. According to the professional association for erotic and sexual services, the fact that body-related services such as tattoo studios, hairdressers and massage salons were allowed to work during the COVID-19 crisis was unfair.

====Munich====
By March 2020, all brothels in Trudering, Munich were closed due to the coronavirus crisis. Prostitutes continued to work outside of regulated establishments. They were allowed to set appointments with clients in the non-restricted areas of the city. As long as brothels were not allowed to open, prostitution continued to take place outside the brothels.

== Extent of prostitution and associated issues ==
Studies in the early 1990s estimated that about 50,000–200,000 women and some men did sex work in Germany. The &quot;International Encyclopedia of Sexuality&quot;, published in 1997, reported that over 100,000 women work in prostitution in Germany. A 2005 study gave 200,000 as a &quot;halfway realistic estimate&quot;. The prostitutes&#x27; organization &quot;Hydra&quot; puts the number at 400,000, and this number is typically quoted in the press today. A 2009 study by TAMPEP also gave the &quot;Hydra&quot; estimate of 400,000 full or part-time prostitutes, with 93% being gender female, 3% transgender and 4% gender male. According to several studies, 90% of sex workers in Germany are victims of human trafficking.

The same study found that 63% of the sex workers in Germany were foreigners, with two thirds of them coming from Central and Eastern Europe. In 1999 the proportion of foreign sex workers had been 52%. The increase was attributed to the EU enlargement.

From other studies, it is estimated that between 10% and 30% of the male adult population have had experiences with sex workers. Of those 17-year-old males in West Germany with experience of intercourse, 8% have had sex with a sex worker.

A 2009 survey identified the following main vulnerability factors for German sex workers (in the order of importance):
# Financial problems, including debts and poverty.
# Violence and abuse by police, clients, and pimps.
# No professional identity; lack of self-confidence.
# Stigma and discrimination.
# Exploitative personal dependencies.

== Forms of female prostitution ==

=== Street prostitution (&quot;Straßenstrich&quot;) ===

Regular street-based sex work is often quite well organized and controlled by pimps. Most cities established &quot;Sperrbezirke&quot; (off-limits zones) and charge the street based workers an amusement tax, that in the city of Bonn for instance is paid by the sex workers at parking meters, six euro for a period of about eight night hours. The same fee is collected from sex workers in apartments and brothels, sometimes by municipal tax collectors in person. Some sex workers have a nearby caravan, others use the customer&#x27;s car, still, others use hotel rooms. With recent economic problems, in some large cities &quot;wild&quot; street-based sex work has started to appear: areas where women work temporarily out of short-term financial need. A &quot;sex drive-in&quot;, or &quot;Verrichtungsbox&quot;, is a facility of structures to enclose cars to provide a safer place for sex work using cars.

=== Prostitution for the procurement of narcotics ===
In every major German city, there are prostitutes who offer their services to procure drugs. This often takes place near the main railway stations, while the act usually takes place in the customer&#x27;s car or in a nearby rented room. These prostitutes are the most desperate, often underage, and their services are generally the cheapest. Pimps and brothel owners try to avoid drug-addicted prostitutes, as they are inclined to spend their earnings solely or primarily on drugs. Other prostitutes tend to look down on them as well, because they are considered as lowering the market prices.

In a unique effort to move drug-addicted streetwalkers out of the city center and reduce violence against these women, the city of Cologne in 2001 created a special area for tolerated street prostitution in &quot;Geestemünder Straße&quot;. Dealers and pimps are not tolerated, the parking places have alarm buttons and the women are provided with a cafeteria, showers, clean needles and counselling. The project, modelled on the Dutch &quot;tippelzones&quot;, is supervised by an organisation of Catholic women. A positive scientific evaluation was published in 2004.

=== Bars ===
In bars, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual services. Sex usually takes place in a separate but attached building. Prices are mostly set by the bar owner and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. The prevalence of such practices has diminished as a result of the registration obligation in the Prostitutes Protection Act.

===Eros centers (&quot;Bordell, Laufhaus&quot;)===

An eros center is a house (Laufhaus) or street (&quot;Laufstraße&quot;) where women can rent small one-room apartments for 80–150 euro per day. Then they solicit customers from the open door or from behind a window. Prices are normally set by the prostitutes; they start at 250–500 euros for short-time sex. The money is not shared with the brothel owner. Security and meals are provided by the owner. The women may even live in their rooms, but most do not. Minors and women not working in the eros center are not allowed to enter. Eros centers exist in almost all larger German cities. The most famous is the &quot;Herbertstraße&quot; near the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. The largest brothel in Europe is the eros center &quot;Pascha&quot; in Cologne, a 12-storey building with some 120 rooms for rent and several bars.

=== Apartment prostitution (&quot;Wohnungspuffs&quot;) ===
There are many of these advertised in the daily newspapers. Sometimes run by a single woman or man and sometimes by a group of roommates.

=== Partytreffs and Pauschalclubs ===
These are a variation on partner-swapping swing clubs with (sometimes, but not always) paid prostitutes in attendance, as well as &#x27;amateur&#x27; women and couples. Single men pay a flat-rate entrance charge of about €80 to €150, which includes food, drink and unrestricted sexual activity, with the requirement that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests. Women normally pay a low or zero entrance charge.

=== FKK sauna clubs ===

Typically, these are brothels in houses or large buildings, often with swimming pool and sauna, a large &#x27;meet and greet&#x27; room with bar and buffet on the ground floor, TV/video screens, and bedrooms on the upper floor(s). Operating hours are usually from late morning until after midnight. The female sex workers are typically nude, wearing only high heels. The term &quot;FKK&quot; is a euphemism, erroneously referring to the German FKK &#x27;Freikörperkultur&#x27; nudist culture. In some clubs the sex workers are topless instead of nude. Meanwhile the customers and club members wear robes or towels. Men and women often pay the same entrance fee, from €35 to €70, including use of all facilities and refreshments (beer is allowed, but most FKK sauna clubs do not allow liquor). Some clubs will admit couples. This form of prostitution, which was mentioned in the rationale of the 2002 prostitution law as providing good working conditions for the women workers, exists all over Germany, Austria and parts of the Netherlands, but mainly in the Rhein-Ruhrgebiet and in the area around Frankfurt am Main. Among the largest clubs of this type are: Artemis in Berlin, opened in the fall of 2005, the new Harem in Bad Lippspringe and the long-established FKK World near Giessen and FKK Oase in the countryside near Bad Homburg.

=== Escort services (&quot;Begleitagenturen&quot;) ===
Escort services, where a potential male client calls for a woman to visit a residence or at a hotel for sexual services, exist in Germany.

===For special groups===
Sexual services for the disabled and elderly. The agency &quot;Sensis&quot; in Wiesbaden connects prostitutes with disabled customers. Nina de Vries somewhat controversially provides sexual services to severely mentally disabled men and has been repeatedly covered in the media. Professional training is available for &#x27;sex assistants&#x27;.

== Forms of male prostitution ==
A comparatively small number of males offer sexual services to females, usually in the form of escort services, meeting in hotels. The vast majority of male prostitutes serve male clients. In 2007 it was estimated that there were 2,500 male prostitutes in Berlin. The above-mentioned Pascha brothel in Cologne reserves one entire floor for male and transgender prostitutes.

== Legal situation ==
Prostitution is legal in Germany. However, since 2017, prostitutes are required to obtain two-year valid registration certificates after undergoing prescribed health advice, while businesses involved in prostitution must possess legal permits. Both prostitution without the use of condoms and the advertisement of prostitution involving either no condoms or pregnant women, are illegal as well. Prostitutes may work as regular employees with contract and also supposed to register with the local authority which provides them a certificate of registration, colloquially called Hurenpass, though the vast majority work independently. Brothels are registered businesses that need a special brothel licence; if food and alcoholic drinks are offered, the standard restaurant licence is also required.

Prostitutes have to pay income taxes and have to charge VAT for their services, to be paid to the tax office. In practice, prostitution is a cash business and taxes are not always paid, though enforcement has been strengthened. The &quot;Länder&quot; North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden Württemberg and Berlin have initiated a system where prostitutes have to pay their taxes in advance, a set amount per day, to be collected and paid to tax authorities by the brothel owners. North Rhine-Westphalia charges €25 per day per prostitute, while Berlin charges €30. In May 2007, authorities were considering plans for a uniform country-wide system charging €25 per day.

Until 2002, prostitutes and brothels were technically not allowed to advertise, but that prohibition was not enforced. The &quot;Bundesgerichtshof&quot; ruled in July 2006 that, as a consequence of the new prostitution law, advertising of sexual services is no longer illegal. Many newspapers carry daily ads for brothels and for women working out of apartments. Many prostitutes and brothels have websites on the Internet. In addition, sex shops and newsstands sell magazines specialising in advertisements of prostitutes (&quot;Happy Weekend&quot;, &quot;St Pauli Nachrichten&quot;, &quot;Sexy&quot; and many more).

Foreign women from European Union countries are allowed to work as prostitutes in Germany. Women from other countries can obtain three-month tourist visas for Germany. If they work in prostitution, it is illegal, because the tourist visa does not include a work permit.

Pimping, (&quot;Zuhälterei&quot; = exploiting and/or controlling a sex worker) admitting prostitutes under the age of eighteen to a brothel, and influencing persons under the age of twenty-one to take up or continue work in prostitution, are illegal. It is also illegal to contract sex services from any person younger than 18, per Article 182 (paragraph 2) of the Criminal Code. Before 2008 this age limit was 16. This law also applies to Germans traveling abroad, to combat child prostitution occurring in the context of sex tourism.

=== Municipal regulation ===
The first city in Germany to introduce an explicit prostitution tax was Cologne. The tax was initiated early in 2004 by the city council led by a coalition of the conservative CDU and the leftist Greens. This tax applies to striptease, peep shows, porn cinemas, sex fairs, massage parlors, and prostitution. In the case of prostitution, the tax amounts to €150 per month and working prostitute, to be paid by brothel owners or by privately working prostitutes. (The area &quot;Geestemünder Straße&quot; mentioned above is exempt.) Containment of prostitution was one explicitly stated goal of the tax. In 2006 the city took in €828,000 through this tax. The neighboring city of Bonn collects a nightly sex work tax of six euro from street prostitutes in the Immenburgstrasse by vending machines identical to German parking meters. All other areas of the city are Sperrbezirk (off-limits for street prostitution).

Every city has the right to zone off certain areas where prostitution is not allowed (&quot;Sperrbezirk&quot;). Prostitutes found working in these areas can be fined or, when persistent, jailed. The various cities handle this very differently. In Berlin prostitution is allowed everywhere, and Hamburg allows street prostitution near the Reeperbahn during certain times of the day. Almost the entire center of Munich is &quot;Sperrbezirk&quot;, and under-cover police have posed as clients to arrest prostitutes. In Leipzig, street prostitution is forbidden almost everywhere, and the city even has a local law allowing police to fine customers who solicit prostitution in public. In most smaller cities, the &quot;Sperrbezirk&quot; includes the immediate city center as well as residential areas. Several states prohibit brothels in small towns (such as towns with fewer than 35,000 inhabitants).

This concept has been the subject of a number of legal challenges. In North Rhine-Westphalia a Minden court has ruled against &#x27;Sperrbezirk&#x27;, as have courts in Hesse and Bavaria. The court ruled that a general prohibition of prostitution infringed a basic right to choose one&#x27;s occupation, as laid down in the 2002 Prostitution Act.

=== Health ===
Annual health checks for prostitutes are mandated by law in Germany.
Previously, in Bavaria (&quot;Bayern&quot;), law mandates the use of condoms for sexual intercourse with prostitutes, including oral contact. In 2017 this was extended to the whole of Germany.

== Crime ==
The 1957 murder of the high-class prostitute Rosemarie Nitribitt in Frankfurt drew great media attention in postwar Germany. The circumstances of her death remain obscure. Police investigations turned up no substantial leads other than a prime suspect who was later acquitted due to reasonable doubt. Several high-profile, respectable citizens turned out to have been among her customers, a fact on which the media based insinuations that higher social circles might be covering up and obstructing the search for the real murderer. The scandal inspired two movies.

Werner Pinzner was a contract murderer active in the brothel scene of Hamburg in the 1980s. Captured in 1986, he confessed to eight murders of people involved in prostitution businesses. His long-time female lawyer and his wife conspired to smuggle a gun into the Hamburg police headquarters on 29 July 1986, and Pinzner proceeded to kill the attending prosecutor, his wife and himself. The lawyer was sentenced to six years in prison for aiding in murder.

Six persons were murdered in a brothel in Frankfurt am Main in 1994. The Hungarian couple managing the place as well as four Russian prostitutes were strangled with electric cables. The case was resolved soon after: it was a robbery gone bad, carried out by the husband of a woman who had worked there.

In 2012 it was reported that police were investigating the owners of a number of high-class brothels in Düsseldorf. Allegedly, numerous customers had been incapacitated with date rape drugs or other drugs in order to charge exorbitant amounts to their credit cards; those who complained were blackmailed with video footage.

===Organized crime===
According to Klaus Bayerl, head of the Kriminalpolizei Augsburg, the large brothels created since 2002 are facilities in which official directors are irreproachable persons, while the background, the brothels are run by pimps or criminal gangs and almost always have close ties to organised crime.

Competing for supremacy in the red-light districts include several motorcycle gangs. Again and again there were massive clashes between the Bandidos and the Hells Angels. Both associations are known arms and drug traffickers and promoters of prostitution.

Involved in the fight for control of the red-light districts are the Black Jackets. In 2013, the Lustpark brothel in Neu-Ulm was being used as a weapons warehouse by the Black Jackets. It became known in 2012 that the Dutch gang Satudarah MC were active in Germany. Satudarah is deeply involved in prostitution, drug trafficking and violent crime.

Likewise, the bouncer Gang &quot;United Tribuns&quot; are involved in the power struggle. The bouncer scene is considered a key position also in recruiting new prostitutes. Other organisations involved in prostitution and trafficking include the Gremium MC, Outlaws MC, the Red Legion, and the Rock Machine MC, whose members are involved in the dispute with the brothel Murat C. in Neu-Ulm in December 2012 when someone was shot.

One of the leading figures in the scene is the German-Turkish Necati Arabaci. He is involved, inter alia, in the brothels Babylon in Elsdorf near Cologne and Wiago in Leverkusen, and also in brothels in Augsburg and Mallorca among others. In 2013 the Augsburg prosecutor established suspicion of money laundering against a person connected to the Hells Angels in the large Colosseum brothel in Augsburg.

The Hanoverian Frank Hanebuth was arrested in July 2013 in Mallorca, Spain, along with 20 other Hells Angels members. As head of the Hells Angels Spanish chapter, he is accused of forming a criminal organisation, promoting illegal prostitution, drug trafficking and money laundering. Hanebuth had acquired several Spanish brothels and is also involved in the mistreatment of prostitutes.

André Schulz, head of the German Criminal Investigation Association warned in July 2016 of &quot;an escalation of turf wars between enemy biker gangs in Germany&quot;.

=== Sex trafficking ===

Illegal human trafficking is a major focus of police work in Germany, yet it remains prevalent. In 2007, Germany was listed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as a top destination for victims of human trafficking.

In 2009, 710 victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation were discovered, an increase of 5% in comparison with 2008.

In 2008, authorities identified 676 sex-trafficking victims.

In 2007, law enforcement authorities recorded 689 victims trafficked for sexual exploitation. Most victims (419) were between the ages of 18 and 24; 184 were nationals of the country. Approximately 12 percent were under the age of 18, including 39 citizens. One percent (seven) were under 14 years of age.

The trafficking in women from Eastern Europe is often organized by perpetrators from that same region. The German Federal Police Office BKA reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside of Germany.

According to the report, in 2006 about 35% of the victims of human trafficking reported that they had agreed from the beginning to work in prostitution; often they did not know about the working conditions and debts incurred. Some others hoped for a job as waitress, maid or au pair; some were simply abducted. Once in Germany, their passports are sometimes taken away and they are informed that they now have to work off the cost of the trip. Sometimes they are brokered to pimps or brothel operators, who then make them work off the purchase price. They work in brothels, bars, apartments; as streetwalkers or as escorts and have to hand over the better part of their earnings. Some women reconcile themselves with this situation as they still make much more money than they could at home; others rebel and are threatened or abused. They are, reportedly, sometimes told that the police have been paid off and will not help them, which is false. They are, reportedly, also threatened with harm to their families at home.

The report states that victims are often unwilling to testify against their oppressors: the only incentive they have to do so is the permission to remain in the country until the end of the trial (with the hope of finding a husband during that time), rather than being deported immediately. Prostitutes from EU countries are not prohibited from traveling to and working in Germany. There is a large influx from Poland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Romania, for instance. Actually, the income prospects for them are not larger than at home, but they prefer to work in the better and safer German environment, as long as they can avoid pimps exploiting and controlling them. German law enforcement aggressively tries to eradicate pimping. In one raid in 2013 near Bonn, 24 males were arrested for exploiting prostitutes, one of them just 15 years old.

== Scandals and news coverage ==

In 2003, German CDU politician Michel Friedman, popular TV talk show host and then assistant chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, became embroiled in an investigation of trafficking women. He had been a client of several escort prostitutes from Eastern Europe who testified that he had repeatedly taken and offered cocaine. After receiving a fine for the drug charge, he resigned from all posts. Since 2004 he has been hosting a weekly talk show on the TV channel N24.

Also in 2003, artist and art professor Jörg Immendorff was caught in the luxury suite of a Düsseldorf hotel with seven prostitutes (and four more on their way) and some cocaine. He admitted to having staged several such orgies and received 11 months on probation and a fine for the drug charges. He attempted to explain his actions by his &quot;orientalism&quot; and terminal illness.

In 2012, Bettina Wulff, the ex-wife of German ex-president Christian Wulff, won several court settlements with some media outlets and the search engine Google requiring them to not connect her with an alleged past as a prostitute.

== Politics ==
The coalition of Social Democrats and the Green Party that governed the country from 1998 until late 2005 attempted to improve the legal situation of prostitutes in the years 2000–2003. These efforts were criticized as inadequate by prostitutes&#x27; organizations such as &quot;Hydra&quot;, which lobby for full normality of the occupation and the elimination of all mention of prostitution from the legal code. The conservative parties in the Bundestag, while supporting the goal of improving prostitutes&#x27; access to the social security and health care system, have opposed the new law because they want to retain the &quot;offending good morals&quot; status.

German churches run several support groups for prostitutes. These generally favor attempts to remove stigmatization and improve the legal situation of prostitutes, but they retain the long term abolitionist goal of a world without prostitution and encourage all prostitutes to leave the occupation.

Alice Schwarzer rejects all prostitution as inherently oppressive and abusive; she favors a legal arrangement similar to the situation in Sweden, wherein 1999 after heavy feminist lobbying a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and leftists outlawed the buying but not the selling of sexual services. German-American journalist and men&#x27;s rights activist Jerry Hoss likens the push for prostitution prohibition to a demand for a &quot;final solution of the prostitution problem by Feminazis.&quot; He asserts that pimping, forced labor, abduction, false imprisonment, illegal immigration, extortion, rape, bodily injury, etc. are already strictly forbidden in Germany and no new laws are needed, just better enforcement.

In 2005, the ruling grand coalition of CDU and SPD announced plans to punish customers of forced prostitutes, if the customer could reasonably have been aware of the situation. In April 2009, it was reported that the plans would provide for a penalty of up to 5 years in prison. The law had not been enacted when the center-right CDU-FDP coalition came to power in November 2009. In 2014, the coalition of CDU and SPD renewed their plans to increase regulation and control of prostitution. Several organisations protested against these plans, amongst them prostitutes organisations as Hydra, Doña Carmen, the &#x27;Berufsverband erotische und sexuelle Dienstleistungen&#x27;, and an anonymous group of customers, the Freieroffensive. In 2016 and 2017 many of the proposals were brought into law.

<text>Nicklaus Schandelmaier, (born 23 March 1968) is a German musician, better known by his stage name En Esch, and has been a member of the bands KMFDM, Pigface, Slick Idiot, and &lt;PIG&gt;. 

==History==
En Esch, born near Frankfurt, is an orchestra percussionist, drummer, programmer, producer, sound mixer, guitarist and singer. He was a member of the German industrial rock group, KMFDM, from 1985 to 1999, during which time he contributed to ten studio albums and more than a dozen singles as musician, composer and producer.

Sascha Konietzko claims to have given Esch his nickname because the latter felt that his real name was inappropriate for the stage. It is derived from the German pronunciation of his initials (N. Sch.). Esch lived in Germany until 1992, when he moved to Chicago to join Konietzko, who had moved there a year earlier.

It was at this time that Esch first worked with Pigface, whom he also toured with in the early 1990s. This would be the first time Esch &quot;left&quot; KMFDM and Sascha would proclaim &quot;Money&quot; as their last album together. After moving to New 
Orleans he released a solo album, &quot;Cheesy&quot;, in 1993. While Konietzko eventually relocated to Seattle, WA, Esch would adhere to his nomadic ways and eventually wind up in NYC in the mid to late 90&#x27;s. Esch would also &quot;leave the band&quot; in 1996 resulting in minimal output into the album &quot;Xtort&quot;, although Sascha did not proclaim the band &quot;done&quot; this time, not until 1999&#x27;s poignantly titled &quot;Adios&quot;. Esch would not return when KMFDM &quot;reformed&quot; in 2002 and has not appeared on any albums post-&quot;Adios&quot;.

When KMFDM broke up in 1999, Esch briefly worked with the band Pizza Whore, which changed its name to Barely Legal, and included Trixie Reiss of The Crystal Method. The band did not last, and Esch began traveling to Canada to visit Günter Schulz, the former KMFDM guitarist. They formed Slick Idiot, and released their first album in 2001. They have released two more albums under that moniker since then.

Esch has since begun working actively with Pigface again, joining them on tour in 2005.

Esch was rumored to be the replacement lead singer of industrial group Rammstein, but this turned out to be a hoax.

In 2007, he began collaborating with fellow German musician Mona Mur. The two released the album &quot;120 Tage&quot; in February 2009, and toured together in support of the release over the next two years. Esch and Mur joined Schulz, Raymond Watts, and Mark Durante to perform at the Wax Trax! Retrospectacle in Chicago, a charity event celebrating the industrial music label, and performed KMFDM songs from the 1990s. A second album by the duo of Esch and Mur was released in 2011. 

A second solo album, &quot;Spänk&quot;, was successfully crowdfunded and released in late 2014. His third solo album, &quot;Trash Chic&quot;, was originally scheduled for release on 31 May 2016, but was postponed to 1 July. Esch would hit the road in support of &quot;Trash Chic&quot;, opening for, and playing guitar, in &lt;PIG&gt;&#x27;s live band, alongside former Slick Idiot guitarist Guenter Shulz.

== Personal life ==
Esch is a vegetarian and an animal rights activist. He currently resides in Berlin.

<doc id="493846" wikidata="Q1335831" url="?curid=493846" title="Paruresis">
<text>Paruresis, also known as shy bladder syndrome, is a type of phobia in which a person is unable to urinate in the real or imaginary presence of others, such as in a public restroom. The analogous condition that affects bowel movement is called parcopresis or shy bowel.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Some people have brief, isolated episodes of urinary difficulty in situations where other people are in close proximity. Paruresis, however, goes beyond simple shyness, embarrassment, fear of exposure, or fear of being judged for not being able to urinate. Other people may find that they are unable to urinate while in moving vehicles, or are fixated on the sounds of their urination in quiet restrooms or residential settings. In severe cases, a person with paruresis can urinate only when alone at home or through the process of catheterization.

== Causes ==
Paruresis is considered a symptom of social anxiety and is correlated with other social anxiety symptoms. When the patient is under the effect of anxiolytics or otherwise disinhibited, paruresis tends to disappear.

==Pathophysiology==
It appears that paruresis involves a tightening of the sphincter or bladder neck due to a sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, or some combination of the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington&#x27;s nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.

==Diagnosis==
The condition is catered for in the rules for mandatory urine testing for drugs in UK prisons, and, also in the UK, a person with paruresis may be eligible for Universal Credit if their health condition limits their ability to work. It is listed in the NHS approved Healthinote Directory. It is now reported to have been accepted as a valid reason for jury service excusal. From 1 August 2005, the guidance on the rules relating to the testing of those on probation in the UK cites paruresis as a valid reason for inability to produce a sample which is not to be construed as a refusal.

The condition is recognised by the American Urological Association, who include it in their on-line directory of conditions.

Paruresis was described in section 300.23 of the DSM-IV-TR as &quot;performance fears ... using a public restroom&quot; but it was not mentioned by name. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) mentions paruresis by name.

&quot;Kaplan &amp; Sadock&#x27;s Synopsis of Psychiatry&quot; states, &quot;Persons with social phobias (also called &quot;social anxiety disorder&quot;) have excessive fears of humiliation or embarrassment in various social settings, such as in speaking in public, urinating in a public rest room (also called shy bladder), and speaking to a date.&quot; The &quot;Synopsis&quot; describes shy bladder as &quot;inability to void in a public bathroom&quot; and notes that relaxation exercises are an application of behavior therapy for dealing with this disorder. Some paruretics experience delayed urination and must wait for their need to void to overcome their anxiety, while others are unable to urinate at all.

==Treatment==
In terms of treating the mental aspect of paruresis, such treatment can be achieved by systematic desensitisation and cognitive behavioral therapy. In systematic desensitisation, the subject has a trusted person stand outside the restroom at first, and once the fear is overcome the observer is brought closer in, until step by step the phobia is vanquished. There is a detailed description of how the process of systematic desensitisation can be applied for people who have paruresis on the UK Paruresis Trust website. In addition to systematic desensitisation, cognitive behavioral therapy is used to change a patient&#x27;s mental approach to the condition, from one of a person who cannot urinate, to a person who can urinate or is not overly fearful when they can&#x27;t publicly urinate. 

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) classifies paruresis as a social anxiety disorder (SAD). In the UK NICE (National Institute for Health and Social Care Excellence) Guidelines set out Recognition, Assessment and Treatment for Social Anxiety Disorders.

==History==
The term &quot;paruresis&quot; was coined by Williams and Degenhart (1954) in their paper &quot;Paruresis: a survey of a disorder of micturition&quot; in the Journal of General Psychology 51:19–29. They surveyed 1,419 college students and found 14.4% had experienced paruresis, either incidentally or continuously.

===Other names===
Paruresis is also known by many colloquial terms, including bashful bladder, bashful kidneys, stage fright, pee-shyness, and shy bladder syndrome.

==Society and culture==
===Drug testing===

Some drug testing authorities find paruresis a nuisance, and some implement &quot;shy bladder procedures&quot; which pay no more than lip service to the condition, and where there is no evidence that they have conducted any real research into the matter. In the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the Code of Federal Regulations provides that &quot;An inmate is presumed to be unwilling if the inmate fails to provide a urine sample within the allotted time period. An inmate may rebut this presumption during the disciplinary process.&quot; Although U.S. courts have ruled that failure to treat properly diagnosed paruresis might violate prisoner&#x27;s constitutional rights, the courts have also &quot;routinely rejected suspicious or unsubstantiated attempts to invoke it in defense of failure to complete drug testing,&quot; particularly when there were no medical record or physician testimony to back up the claim of paruresis.

The International Paruresis Association stresses the importance of medical documentation of one&#x27;s condition since &quot;[t]he person who is unable to produce a urine sample is presumed guilty in the absence of any evidence.&quot; Some prisons have offered the use of a &quot;dry cell&quot;—i.e., a cell with no toilet facilities, but only a container for the prisoner&#x27;s waste—as an accommodation to inmates who are hindered by paruresis from providing an observed urine sample.

FBOP Program Statement 6060.08 states, &quot;Ordinarily, an inmate is expected to provide a urine sample within two hours of the request, but the Captain (or Lieutenant) may extend the time if warranted by specific situations (for example, the inmate has a documented medical or psychological problem, is dehydrated, etc.). Staff may consider supervising indirectly an inmate who claims to be willing but unable to provide a urine sample under direct visual supervision. For example, this might be accomplished by allowing the inmate to provide the sample in a secure, dry room after a thorough search has been made of both the inmate and the room.&quot; At least six state prison systems—Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Tennessee—have modified their drug testing regulations to provide accommodations for prisoners with paruresis.

Per the &quot;Handbook of Correctional Mental Health&quot;, &quot;No definitive or objective test is available to confirm or refute the presence of paruresis. The absence of prior treatment or the ability to void in some social situations but not in others does not rule it out. Although modalities associated with the treatment of social phobias help some individuals, no universally effective medication or other treatment exists. Coercive interventions, such as forcing fluids while observing a person with paruresis, are ineffective and can cause serious medical complications. Alternatives to observed urine specimen collection for individuals who self-report paruresis include unobserved collections in a dry room, testing of hair specimens, sweat testing with a patch, and blood testing (&#x27;Test for Drugs of Abuse&#x27; 2002). These alternatives preclude the need for futile attempts to differentiate inmates with true paruresis from those who fabricate complaints.&quot;

In the UK the Prison Service has long been aware of and sensitive to this condition, and guidance on how to deal with paruresis sufferers who are selected for Mandatory Drug Testing (MDT) is contained within the working manual used by MDT staff.

===Popular culture===
The condition has been occasionally portrayed in popular culture, sometimes for comedic effect or parody. Examples of this include:
* In the 2005 comedy &quot;Waiting...&quot;, a nerdy character with paruresis is one of many bathroom jokes.
* In 2015, the International Paruresis Association protested a DirecTV ad starring Rob Lowe that portrayed a paruretic as goofy, wearing a fanny pack, and having his hair parted in the middle.
* In the American sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, the character Penny is revealed to suffer from bladder shyness.

<doc id="493850" wikidata="Q285004" url="?curid=493850" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou">
<text>The de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou (designated by the United States military as the CV-2 and later C-7 Caribou) is a Canadian specialized cargo aircraft with short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability. The Caribou was first flown in 1958 and although mainly retired from military operations, is still in use in small numbers as a rugged bush airplane.

The design was further developed as the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, adding turboprop engines and other changes that further improved its short-field performance to the point where it competes with light aircraft even with a full load.

==Design and development==

The De Havilland Canada (DHC) company&#x27;s third short takeoff and landing (STOL) design was a big increase in size compared to its earlier DHC Beaver and DHC Otter, and was the first DHC design powered by two engines. The Caribou was similar in concept in that it was designed as a rugged STOL utility aircraft. The Caribou was primarily a military tactical transport that in commercial service found itself a small niche in cargo hauling. The United States Army ordered 173 in 1959 and took delivery in 1961 under the designation AC-1, which was changed to CV-2 Caribou in 1962.

The majority of Caribou production was destined for military operators, but the type&#x27;s ruggedness and excellent STOL capabilities requiring runway lengths of only 1200 feet (365 metres) also appealed to some commercial users. U.S. certification was awarded on 23 December 1960. Ansett-MAL, which operated a single example in the New Guinea highlands, and Amoco Ecuador were early customers, as was Air America (a CIA front in South East Asia during the Vietnam War era for covert operations). Other civil Caribou aircraft entered commercial service after being retired from their military users.

Today only a handful are in civilian use.

===The Turbo Caribou Program===
PEN Turbo Aviation of Cape May, NJ, has undertaken the re-engineering of the DHC-4A Caribou to a turbine powered variant, designated DHC-4A Turbo Caribou. The conversion uses PT6A-67T engines and Hartzell 5 bladed HC-B5MA-3M Constant Speed/Reversing propellers. Overall performance has improved and &quot;new&quot; basic weight is reduced while maximum normal take-off weight remained at Maximum payload is . Both Transport Canada and the US Federal Aviation Administration have issued supplemental type certificates for the Turbo Caribou. As of September 17, 2014, only 3 air frames had been converted. PEN Turbo has stockpiled dozens of air frames at their facility in NJ for possible future conversion. PEN Turbo Aviation named their company after Perry E. Niforos, who died in the 1992 crash of an &quot;earlier&quot; turboprop Caribou converted by a different firm, NewCal Aviation.

==Operational history==

In response to a United States Army requirement for a tactical airlifter to supply the battlefront with troops and supplies and evacuate casualties on the return journey, de Havilland Canada designed the DHC-4. With assistance from Canada&#x27;s Department of Defence Production, DHC built a prototype demonstrator that flew for the first time on 30 July 1958.

Impressed with the DHC4&#x27;s STOL capabilities and potential, the U.S. Army ordered five for evaluation as YAC-1s and went on to become the largest Caribou operator. The AC-1 designation was changed in 1962 to CV-2, and then C-7 when the U.S. Army&#x27;s CV-2s were transferred to the U.S. Air Force in 1967. U.S. and Australian Caribou saw extensive service during the Vietnam War.

The U.S. Army purchased 159 of the aircraft and they served their purpose well as a tactical transport during the Vietnam War, where larger cargo aircraft such as the Fairchild C-123 Provider and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules could not land on the shorter landing strips. The aircraft could carry 32 troops or two Jeeps or similar light vehicles. The rear loading ramp could also be used for parachute dropping (also, see Air America).

Under the Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966, the Army relinquished the fixed wing Caribou to the United States Air Force in exchange for an end to restrictions on Army rotary wing operations. On 1 January 1967, the 17th, 57th, 61st Aviation Companies (12th Combat Aviation Group) and the 92nd, 134th, and 135th Aviation Companies of the U.S. Army were inactivated and their aircraft transferred respectively to the newly activated 537th, 535th, 536th, 459th, 457th, and 458th Troop Carrier Squadrons of the USAF (This was Operation &quot;Red Leaf&quot;). On 1 August 1967 the &quot;troop carrier&quot; designations were changed to &quot;tactical airlift&quot;.

Some Republic of Vietnam Air Force Caribou were captured by North Vietnamese forces in 1975 and remained in service with that country through to the late 1970s. Following the war in Vietnam, all USAF Caribou were transferred to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard airlift units pending their replacement by the C-130 Hercules in the 1980s.

All C-7s have now been phased out of U.S. military service, with the last example serving again under U.S. Army control through 1985 in support of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Golden Knights parachute demonstration team. Other notable military operators included Australia, Canada, India, Malaysia and Spain.

In September 1975, a group of 44 civilians, including armed supporters of the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT), commandeered a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Caribou, &quot;A4-140&quot;, on the ground at Baucau Airport in the then Portuguese Timor, which was in the middle of a civil war. The Caribou had landed at Baucau on a humanitarian mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross. The civilians demanded that the RAAF crew members fly them to Darwin Airport (also RAAF Base Darwin) in Australia, which they did. After the Caribou arrived there, the Australian government detained the civilians for a short period, and then granted refugee visas to all of them. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later described &quot;A4-140&quot; as &quot;the only RAAF plane ever hijacked&quot;, and the incident as &quot;one of the more remarkable stories in Australia’s military and immigration history&quot;.

The RAAF retired &quot;A4-140&quot;, by then its last Caribou, on 27 November 2009. The aircraft, which was manufactured in 1964, was donated to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

===Civilian operations===
After retirement from military use, several examples of the Caribou have been purchased by civilian operators for deployment in areas with small airfields located in rugged country with few or poor surface transport links.

<text>The Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy (official German name: ) is a German research institution for sustainability research, focusing on impacts and practical application. It explores and develops models, strategies, and instruments to support sustainable development at local, national, and international levels. Research at the Wuppertal Institute focuses on ecology and its relation to economy and society. Special emphasis is put on analyzing and supporting technological and social innovations that decouple the prosperity of economic growth from the use of natural resources. The organization&#x27;s activities focus on developing transformation processes aimed at shaping a climate-friendly and resource-efficient world.

The institute was founded by politician Johannes Rau (SPD) and scientist Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker (SPD) in 1990 and 1991 and is mainly financed by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

==Organization and networks==
The Wuppertal Institute collaborates with universities and institutes in Germany and abroad. It has formal cooperation agreements with the Lund University, the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering of the Tsinghua University Beijing, the University of Osnabrück, the HafenCity University Hamburg, the Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS) in Teheran and the Bergische Universität Wuppertal. A cooperation agreement was also reached with the University of Kassel. Joint research projects with the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) in Japan and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in India are regularly conducted. The institute is also a member of the Johannes Rau Research Association and the Ecological Research Network (Ecornet).

The Wuppertal Institute describes itself as an intermediary between science, economy and politics, meaning that its sustainability research design is application-oriented. It has the legal status of a non-profit limited company (gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, according to German law). It receives basic funding from the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, the sole owner of the Wuppertal Institute. The major part of its funding derives from research projects. The Wuppertal Institute&#x27;s clients cover governmental organizations ranging from local authorities to ministries at both state and national levels, business and industry ranging from medium-sized companies to corporate groups and industrial associations, civil society ranging from environmental associations to churches, and trade unions and foundations.

The Wuppertal Institute is based in Wuppertal and employs approximately 250 workers. Two-thirds are research staff and come from a wide variety of background disciplines: natural and environmental sciences, geography, systems sciences, engineering, planning, law, economics, and political and social science. The staff consists of roughly as many men as women. The Berlin office promotes cooperation with scientific institutes and research partners in the capital.

An International Advisory Board stands for the independence and the Institute&#x27;s scientific quality and provides advice concerning strategic basic research issues.

== Financing of the Wuppertal Institute ==
The institute is financed by third-party funds (Drittmittel) and core funding from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Wuppertal Institute is a non-profit GmbH whose sole owner is the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The chairman of the supervisory board is a state secretary of the respective government.

==History==
The Wuppertal Institute started its research work in 1991, headed by Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker. The later Federal President Johannes Rau (SPD) gave significant support to the founding when he was still Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia. He ensured that the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy was established in his hometown. The Institute&#x27;s mission – formulated in its partnership agreement – was, first of all, to &quot;promote measures and initiatives to secure the climate situation, to improve the environment and to save energy, as an interface between the scientific pursuit of knowledge and its practical application”. Founding President Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker advocated a resource strategy founded on reducing resource use by means of what he called an &quot;efficiency revolution&quot; pointing the way towards new models of prosperity. Efficiency is the cornerstone of the book &quot;Factor Four - Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use&quot; by Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Amory and Hunter Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute, US). They assembled fifty examples of successful products using half the usual amount of natural resources, including hypercars, &quot;Passivhaus&quot;, superwindows, long-lasting furniture, and a summer holiday in the Austrian Alps. The book was accepted as a report to the Club of Rome, and was on the best-seller lists for several months. It has been translated into more than ten languages.

Peter Hennicke studied and worked on using efficiency potentials in the field of energy use before he came to the Wuppertal Institute. He intensified research in this area as head of the Energy Division; later on, he succeeded Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker as president from 2000 to 2008. Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, the vice-president at that time, found a large audience proposing his MIPS concept for gauging material input per service unit and identifying &quot;ecological rucksacks&quot; that &quot;carry&quot; products and services when they arrive at the consumer. He was aware of the fact that the then prevailing environmental policy was not paying enough attention to the great material flows; he advocated that besides already existing successful legal measures for pollutant emissions limitation, it would be necessary to reduce the material flows to conserve the finite material, energy, and natural resources. With his concept of the “Ecological rucksack” he introduced his ideas into scientific and political debates.

In 2001, the Tokyo-based Takeda Foundation awarded Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek a price worth one hundred million Japanese yen for their concepts &quot;Factor Four&quot;, &quot;MIPS&quot; and &quot;ecological rucksack&quot;, an expression of the Wuppertal Institute&#x27;s international recognition.

Following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the implementation of Agenda 21 was high on the (environmental) policy agenda in many countries. The first attempts were very timid and showed a lack of experience in implementing the new leading principle called sustainable development. The 1995 report Zukunftsfähiges Deutschland (published as “Greening the North”), commissioned by BUND and Misereor, was to remedy this: The Wuppertal Institute team, headed by Reinhard Loske and Raimund Bleischwitz, pioneered a new methodology. Beginning with an estimate of the Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity, the &quot;environmental space&quot;, the study developed leading principles to help Germans avoid overusing the environmental space to which they are &quot;entitled&quot;. The principles are based on concepts such as efficiency and sufficiency.

Prof. Dr. Wolfang Sachs, a scientist of the Wuppertal Institute, member of the Club of Rome, and lead author at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), directed the study “Sustainable Germany in a Globalized World”. It was published as a book in October 2008 by Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND), Church Development Service (Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst - EED) and &quot;Friends of the Earth&quot; to stimulate the social discussion on globally sustainable development.

Agreed in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol took the global nature of the climate change into account, even if it was ratified only many years later. The Kyoto Protocol was the first international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Wuppertal Institute&#x27;s Climate Policy Division was closely involved in setting this milestone in the international climate debate.

In 2002, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia decided to no longer support the institute. The Wuppertal Institute examined the matter on the recommendation of the respected Science Council, which advises the federal and state governments on research policy matters.

The institute&#x27;s environmental policy tasks are still important and worthy of support, but the concrete work suffers from serious conceptual deficiencies, said the council. Qualified research is particularly lacking in the fields of transport and climate development.

In August 2005, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Wuppertal Institute jointly founded the Center on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP). As a member of the globally cooperating UNEP Centers, its mission is to develop practically oriented contributions to the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production program that was agreed upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002.

In September 2004, the Wuppertal Institute&#x27;s Berlin office was established under the direction of Hermann E. Ott. Wolfgang Sachs took over the management in 2009, Maja Göpel in 2013, and Daniel Vallentin and Timon Wehnert in 2017. Since 2019 Timon Wehnert and Stefan Werland are heading the Berlin office.

Since its foundation, the Wuppertal Institute has been working on visions for a sustainable, low-CO2 society. Based on the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by 80 percent by 2050, the Wuppertal Institute has developed various long-term scenarios for the German energy system. They serve as a basis for the long-term energy study of the German government and also the climate protection policies of municipalities&#x27; strategies towards the long-term goal of a low-carbon society. A study commissioned by Siemens AG for the city of Munich shows what this could look like. Long-term energy scenarios, such as those developed by the Wuppertal Institute together with research partners for the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, contributed to the German government&#x27;s decision after the Fukushima reactor accident to abandon nuclear power generation and initiate the energy turnaround.

Uwe Schneidewind became the third president of the institute on March 1, 2010. He took over as successor to Peter Hennicke after he had retired for more than two years. Schneidewind holds a professorship at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal. At the Wuppertal Institute, Schneidewind placed the transdisciplinary understanding of science within the conceptual framework of transition research. In 2011 the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) published its main report &quot;World in Transition – A Social Contract for Sustainability&quot;, which calls for a fundamental change: a shift from a fossil to a post-fossil society. The task of research, it states, is to examine these transition processes and to support the transformation through specific innovations in the relevant sectors. This approach characterizes the scientific work at the institute. It also includes the question of securing prosperity, the &quot;good life&quot;, beyond unrestrained economic growth. In the sustainability discourse, it is becoming increasingly clear that more efficient use of resources is eminently important, but it is not enough because rebound effects often reduce efficiency gains. The Wuppertal Institute is conducting ever more concrete research into how sufficiency strategies can be effective and how they can be used politically, in fields such as construction, energy or local politics.

In summer 2018, the book &quot;Die Große Transformation – Eine Einführung in die Kunst gesellschaftlichen Wandels&quot; by Uwe Schneidewind was published. The book aims to find answers to the question of how the transformation to a socially and ecologically just world can succeed. For this, it needs “Zukunftskunst” (&quot;future art&quot;), writes Schneidewind. It refers to the ability to combine cultural change, smart politics, new economic activity, and innovative technologies, and on this basis to make creative contributions to the implementation of the energy turnaround, mobility turnaround, food turnaround or sustainable change in cities.

Uwe Schneidewind left the Wuppertal Institute on 30 April 2020. Since May 1, 2020, Manfred Fischedick has been leading the Institute as Scientific Managing Director. Manfred Fischedick, who studied engineering and is a Professor of Economics at the Schumpeter School of Business and Economics at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal, deals in his work with system analytical questions, aspects of innovation dynamics and the market introduction of new technologies.

==Research==
Conceiving strategies for sustainable development requires an integrated approach both to policy and to scientific research. The quest to live and work in a way that conserves resources often raises questions that cannot be answered by one area of policy alone or by a single scientific discipline. This is the Wuppertal Institute&#x27;s starting point. Its interdisciplinary research teams bring together the expertise of scientists and economists as well as geographers and spatial planners, engineers, philosophers, and historians.

The Wuppertal Institute conducts research at an international level. The Institute&#x27;s international research activities follow a transformative approach, where researchers work in transdisciplinary and multicultural teams that address global and context-specific sustainability challenges. 

The Institute&#x27;s main research areas at the international level include the energy and industry system transitions, global climate governance, the low-carbon urban transformation (incl. mobility), sustainable production and consumption, and the circular economy.

In 2019, structural changes were implemented as the institute grew in size. 13 new Research Units organized within the four divisions began their work. With the new structure, the institute intends to take into account the higher management complexity and also to position the research fields more clearly.

In its scientific activities, the Institute advises ministries at the federal and state level as well as the European Union and is thus frequently in the public eye. On 2 March 2020, Svenja Schulze (German Federal Minister of the Environment) and Manfred Fischedick presented the federal government&#x27;s first &quot;Digital Policy Agenda for the Environment&quot; at a federal press conference. It contains 70 concrete measures that combine digitalization and climate protection, such as The Federal Environment Agency, to create a registry for data centers as a data basis for future efficiency targets. Smartphones and tablets are to be given a longer life through new rules at EU level, thereby saving resources. Under the European Union&#x27;s Ecodesign Directive, manufacturers will be required to make batteries and display replaceable and offer spare parts or updates for a minimum period. The Wuppertal Institute intensively accompanied the Federal Ministry of the Environment in the preparation of the environmental digital agenda and provided scientific advice.

The scientific work of the institute is mainly conducted in four divisions, which are divided into Research Units.

The Division Future Energy and Mobility Systems examines questions of technology and infrastructure, taking a systems analysis approach. In the fields of energy and mobility, it explores what technical and social innovations will facilitate the transition to sustainable structures, what implications this process has and what chances it offers. It sees key challenges in the decarbonization of energy systems, the climate-friendly restructuring of energy-intensive industries, and the sustainable modernization of our cities. The following Research Units belong to the division:

:*&quot;International Energy Transitions&quot;&lt;br&gt;This Research Unit develops solution paths for sustainable energy systems and industrial transformation in developing regions - especially in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the MENA region.
:*&quot;Sectors and Technologies&quot;&lt;br&gt;This research team develops strategies for the climate neutrality of the energy, transport and industrial sectors, taking into account their energy and resource impacts.
:*&quot;Structural Change and Innovation&quot;&lt;br&gt;This Research Unit shapes sustainable structural change, contributes to increasing the innovative capacity of industrial regions and evaluates opportunities from climate change and resource conservation.
:*&quot;Systems and Infrastructures&quot;&lt;br&gt;This Research Unit analyses the interaction of technologies, infrastructures and energy sources for the transformation to a sustainable energy system.

The Division Energy-, Transport- and Climate-Policy focuses on strategies and instruments for effective and integrated energy, transport and climate policies at the local, regional, national and international level. Central themes are the synergy effects of policy strategies that support the sustainable development of energy and transport systems as well as climate protection generally as well as policy instruments in the field of energy end-use efficiency. The following Research Units belong to the division:

:*&quot;Global Climate Governance&quot;&lt;br&gt;The unit sees itself as a navigator of international governance processes and, as an architect of transformative solutions on a global level, develops integrated strategies and instruments for the transformation to sustainability.
:*&quot;Energy Policy&quot;&lt;br&gt;This Research Unit analyses policy packages and instruments for the transition to a sustainable, largely carbon-free, energy-efficient and renewable energy system.
:*&quot;Mobility and International Cooperation&quot;&lt;br&gt;The research team develops implementation-oriented global concepts that combine local demand, expertise and policy advice with financing institutions.
:*&quot;Mobility and Transport Policy&quot;&lt;br&gt;The researchers investigate which policies and actors can shape the transformation of the transport system towards sustainable mobility in Germany.
:*&quot;Urban Transitions&quot;&lt;br&gt;The Research Unit develops innovative concepts and instruments that enable sustainable transformations in cities and regions.

The Division Sustainable Production and Consumption develops instruments, concepts and strategies to promote the transition to more sustainable patterns of production and consumption. The division explores opportunities for creating a sustainable, resource-light society, and a socio-ecological market economy in which products and services offer a high quality of life and are produced sustainably, globally and locally. One of the main elements is the development and market launch of products considered sustainable in terms of their entire life cycle as well as production processes optimized right the way along the added value chain. The research focuses on the social-ecological balance of entrepreneurial, social, and technological changes and innovations in line with the implementation of the United Nations&#x27; international Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The following Research Units belong to the division:

:*&quot;Innovation Labs&quot;&lt;br&gt;This Research Unit develops open innovation processes for sustainable production and consumption patterns in companies and municipalities, politics and society.
:*&quot;Production and Consumption Systems&quot;. The research team analyses and evaluates production and consumption structures from the perspective of resource efficiency and sustainability.

The Division Circular Economy focuses its research on how to succeed in transforming the resource-intensive, linear economy into a circular economy in which the value and the raw materials contained in products are preserved in the best way possible after their usage phase. The division develops targets and instruments for environmental services and digitalization, which enables closed material cycles and creates the conditions for sustainable digitalization. Germany and the European Union target a comprehensive transition towards a circular economy, in which waste should be avoided, products and their components should be used as long as possible, and waste is regarded as a potential resource. Related challenges and questions focuses on the design of infrastructures, policy mixes and governance structures. Necessary innovation processes are the starting point for the institute&#x27;s research. The following Research Units belong to the division:

:*&quot;Digital Transformation&quot;&lt;br&gt;The Research Unit examines the perspectives of digitalization and how it can be used for sustainability transformation and to achieve a sustainable digital transformation.
:*&quot;Material Loops&quot;&lt;br&gt;The focus of this Research Unit is the closing of material cycles as a central prerequisite for a sustainable, globally viable level of resource consumption.

Berlin Office&lt;br&gt;As a branch of the Wuppertal Institute, the Berlin office promotes cooperation between the Wuppertal Institute and other academic and research institutions in Berlin.

<text>Janet Ray Michie, Baroness Michie of Gallanach (&quot;née&quot; Bannerman; 4 February 1934 – 6 May 2008) was a Scottish speech therapist and Liberal Democrat politician. She served as the Member of Parliament for Argyll and Bute for fourteen years, from 1987-2001, and then became a life peer in the House of Lords. She was the first peer to pledge the oath of allegiance in the House of Lords in Gaelic.

==Early life==
Janet Ray Bannerman was born in the Old Manse, Balmaha, on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond in Stirlingshire, the second of four children of Jenny Murray (Ray) (&quot;née&quot; Mundell) and John Bannerman (later Lord Bannerman of Kildonan).

Her father was a farm manager to the Duke of Montrose, a former Scotland rugby player and Liberal politician. In her youth, she spoke at political meetings while waiting for her father to arrive. He contested Argyll at the 1945 general election, and Inverness at the 1950 general election. He surprised many by narrowly losing the 1954 Inverness by-election, coming close again at the general elections in 1951 and 1955. He narrowly lost the 1961 Paisley by-election, and contested Paisley again at the 1964 general election, before becoming a life peer in December 1967.

Michie was educated at Aberdeen High School for Girls, Lansdowne House School (Edinburgh), and the Edinburgh College of Speech Therapy. She married Iain Michie in 1957, and she followed his work with the Royal Army Medical Corps for 16 years in the UK and overseas. They had three daughters. She continued as a speech therapist after they settled in Oban, working at the county hospital and becoming Area Speech Therapist for the Argyll and Clyde Health Board in 1977.

==Political career==
Following in the footsteps of her father, she entered politics and became Chairman of Argyll Liberal Association from 1973–76, and then vice-Chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1977-79. She was the Liberal Party candidate for Argyll and Bute on three occasions, losing in 1979 and 1983, but ultimately defeating Conservative minister John Mackay to secure election as Member of Parliament at the 1987 general election, becoming the sole female Liberal MP.

She took the oath of allegiance in the House of Commons in Gaelic, and joined the Liberal Democrats upon the party&#x27;s formation in 1988. She increased her majority at the next two general elections, gaining the confidence of the voters in her scattered constituency of peninsulas and islands. 

She was a Liberal Democrat spokesman on Transport and Rural Development from 1987–88, on Women&#x27;s Issues from 1988–94, and on Scotland from 1988-97. She was an advocate of home rule for Scotland and the promotion of and development of the Scottish Gaelic language. She was also chair of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 1992-93. She was appointed a member of the panel of chairmen by Speaker Betty Boothroyd in her last term in the Commons; from 1997-2001. She supported the campaigns to end submarine operations of the Royal Navy and United States Navy in the Firth of Clyde, to hold another inquiry into the Chinook crash on the Mull of Kintyre in 1994 in her constituency, and the successful bid for the residents of Gigha to buy their own island.

In 1992, Michie became a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. Later, she also became a joint Vice-Chairperson of the Parliamentary Group on the Whisky Industry. She stood down from Parliament at the 2001 general election, being replaced by Alan Reid. She was made a life peer as Baroness Michie of Gallanach, of Oban in Argyll and Bute on 14 July 2001. She was the first peer to pledge the oath of allegiance in Gaelic when being introduced to the Lords.

At different points in her career, she was Vice-President of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, Honorary Associate of the National Council of Women of Great Britain, and Honorary President of the Clyde Fishermen&#x27;s Association, and also held honorary positions in the An Comunn Gàidhealach, the Scottish National Farmers&#x27; Union and the Scottish Crofting Foundation, and was a participant in the early days of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. She chaired the West Highland Health Services Solutions Group.

In August 2007, she was appointed to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission established by the Scottish Government. Before the Commission was able to report, Michie died at her home in Oban after receiving treatment for cancer. She died two days after her Liberal Democrat colleague in the House of Lords, Richard Holme. She was survived by two daughters, having been predeceased by her husband and a third daughter.

<doc id="493881" wikidata="Q7406013" url="?curid=493881" title="Salt water aspiration syndrome">
<text>Salt water aspiration syndrome or saltwater aspiration syndrome is a medical condition caused by the inhalation or aspiration (entry of materials into lungs from mouth) of small amounts of salt water during an underwater dive, leading to lung irritation and inflammation. Unlike drowning or near-drowning, it does not involve ingestion of large volumes of water. It often results from faulty diving equipment or improper breathing techniques, allowing fine water droplets to reach the lower respiratory tract.

The condition begins with a cough, followed by shortness of breath, chest discomfort or pain, shivering, fever and other systemic symptoms. It can resemble a viral infection but improves within hours, especially with supplemental oxygen. While most cases resolve on their own, severe instances may require critical care. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptom progression. Salt water aspiration syndrome was first described in 1970.

== Cause and mechanism ==
Salt water aspiration syndrome occurs when small amounts of salt water are inhaled or aspirated, unlike drowning and near-drowning which involve intake of large volumes of water. This condition can develop subtly over the course of an underwater dive or happen with a single aspiration event. Faulty diving equipment such as diving regulators, improper breathing techniques, or buddy breathing lead to the inhalation or aspiration of fine salt water droplets. The small size of the droplets allows them to reach the lower respiratory tract without significantly triggering the upper airway&#x27;s cough reflex, hence getting aspirated without causing immediate symptoms during the dive.

Hypertonic salt water—being more concentrated than human blood—creates an osmotic gradient when it enters the lungs. This gradient draws water out of surrounding lung tissues into the alveoli and bronchioles, leading to irritation and inflammation. Salt water can also cause oxidative stress, dilution of pulmonary surfactant, breakdown of the blood-air barrier, cellular degradation and cell death. Marine microorganisms and particulates can further exacerbate inflammatory processes, which may cause or contribute towards systemic symptoms seen with this condition.

== Clinical presentation ==

Most patients with salt water aspiration syndrome report experiencing aspiration during their dive. Affected individuals start with a cough immediately after completing the dive, sometimes productive of excessive or blood-tinged sputum. Following a latency period of about two hours, divers may develop shortness of breath, increased respiratory rate, increased heart rate, bluish skin, chest discomfort and pain.

The condition generally mimics symptoms of a viral infection. Fever, malaise and chills are most commonly reported, and usually the first systemic symptoms to appear. Most individuals experience tremors and shivering — the latter is worse with reduced oxygen levels in blood. These symptoms tend to worsen with cold exposure or physical activity. Headaches are reported in about two-thirds of cases, while about one-third experience body aches. Gastrointestinal involvement can cause loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Less commonly, affected individuals experience fainting, temporary loss of consciousness and mild confusion. In rare cases, severe inflammation of lungs can occur.

Lung auscultation may reveal abnormal breath sounds such as rhonchi (snoring-like) or crackles (rattling), and chest imaging can show lung consolidations and edema. Decreased lung volumes, including a reduction of average 0.7 liters in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and vital capacity, is found on spirometry. Laboratory studies do not show specific abnormalities, but low oxygen levels in blood, slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may be seen.

== Diagnosis and treatment ==
The diagnosis of salt water aspiration syndrome is based on medical history and physical examination. Its initial symptoms of cough and difficulty breathing are similar to near-drowning, however, near-drowning does not cause viral infection-like symptoms. Furthermore, it can be difficult to distinguish the condition from an acute viral infection at first; unlike viral illnesses, salt water aspiration syndrome tends to improve within a few hours.

The condition shares features with decompression sickness; a review of the dive profile and the absence of other symptoms associated with decompression can help distinguish between the two. Significant improvement following supplemental oxygen further supports the diagnosis of salt water aspiration syndrome. Other diving conditions like pulmonary barotrauma, immersion pulmonary edema and low body temperatures can produce similar symptoms or occur alongside this syndrome; these can be distinguished through the clinical course and imaging results.

Treatment involves supportive care with supplemental oxygen, observation and rest. Most cases resolve within the first 24 hours, often spontaneously without treatment. Critical care may be necessary for severe cases or cases complicated with underlying respiratory disorders.

== Research ==

The condition was first described in 1970 by Carl Edmonds, who documented 30 cases at the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot;. A 1989 study estimated that 37 percent of deaths that occurred during recreational scuba diving in Australia and New Zealand in the 1980s involved salt water aspiration syndrome. The study hypothesized—based on reports of the victim&#x27;s symptoms and an analysis of their equipment—that the syndrome acted as an intermediate factor, exacerbating panic and exhaustion, which subsequently led to loss of consciousness and death by drowning. In 2019, a case study reported severe salt water aspiration syndrome caused by a beluga whale splash; an audience member at Georgia Aquarium aspirated salt water that was splashed by a beluga whale, which led to severe inflammation of lungs and low oxygen levels in blood requiring intensive care.

<text>The Bell 212 (also known as the &quot;Bell Two-Twelve&quot;) is a two-blade, twin-engine, medium helicopter that first flew in 1968. Originally manufactured by Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth, Texas, United States, production was moved to Mirabel, Quebec, Canada in 1988, along with all Bell commercial helicopter production after that plant opened in 1986.

The 212 was marketed to civilian operators and has up to a 15-seat capacity, with one pilot and fourteen passengers. In cargo-carrying configuration, the 212 has an internal capacity of 220 ft3 (6.23 m3). An external load of up to 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) can be carried.

==Development==

Based on the stretched fuselage Bell 205, the Bell 212 was originally developed for the Canadian Forces as the &quot;CUH-1N&quot; and later redesignated as the &quot;CH-135&quot;. The Canadian Forces took delivery of 50 starting in May 1971. At the same time the United States military services ordered 294 Bell 212s under the designation UH-1N.
By 1971, the Bell 212 had been developed for commercial applications. Among the earliest uses of the type in civil aviation was by Helicopter Service AS of Norway to be used in support of offshore drilling; it proved popular across the offshore sector in particular as it had been certified for operating under marginal weather conditions. Today, the 212 can be found used in logging operations, maritime rescue and resupply in the Arctic on the Distant Early Warning Line or North Warning System.

The 212 is powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6T-3 Twin-Pac made up of two coupled PT6 power turbines driving a common gearbox. They are capable of producing up to 1,800 shp (1,342 kW). Should one power section fail the remaining section can deliver 900 shp (671 kW) for 30 minutes, or 765 shp (571 kW) continuously, enabling the 212 to maintain cruise performance at maximum weight.

Early 212s configured with an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) package were required to have a large and very obvious fin attached to the roof of the aircraft, above and slightly behind the cockpit. This fin was initially determined necessary to alter the turning performance of the aircraft during complex instrument flight maneuvers, but is no longer required due to revised stipulations of the type certificate. Many aircraft still fly with the modification.

In 1979, with the purchase of eight by the Civil Air Authority, the 212 became the first U.S. helicopter sold in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The ICAO designator for this aircraft as used in a flight plan is &quot;B212&quot;. Bell developed the Model 212 further with the Bell 412; the major difference being the composite four-blade main rotor. The last Bell 212 was delivered in 1998.
==Variants==
*Bell Model 212 - Bell Helicopters company designation for the UH-1N.
*Twin Two-Twelve - Civil utility transport version. It can carry up to 14 passengers.
*Agusta-Bell AB 212 - Civil or military utility transport version. Built under license in Italy by Agusta.
*Agusta-Bell AB.212ASW - Anti-Submarine Warfare variant of AB.212
*Bell Model 412 - Bell 212 with a four-bladed semi-rigid rotor system.
*Eagle Single - Bell 212 converted to a single-engine configuration. Produced by Eagle Copters of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, using a Lycoming T5317A, T5317B, or T5317BCV engine.

==Operators==

===Civil and government operators===
The Bell 212 is used by many private and commercial operators, it is particularly popular in the oil industries and for law enforcement use.

==Notable incidents==
*1982 Bristow Helicopters Bell 212 crash: On 14 September 1982, a medical evacuation helicopter flight operated by Bristow Helicopters crashed during the early hours of the morning in driving rain and poor visibility over the North Sea.

<doc id="493890" wikidata="Q860385" url="?curid=493890" title="Juan de Fuca plate">
<text>The Juan de Fuca plate is a small tectonic plate (microplate) generated from the Juan de Fuca Ridge that is subducting beneath the northerly portion of the western side of the North American plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. It is named after the explorer of the same name. One of the smallest of Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates, the Juan de Fuca plate is a remnant part of the once-vast Farallon plate, which is now largely subducted underneath the North American plate.

In plate tectonic reconstructions, the Juan de Fuca plate is referred to as the Vancouver plate between the break-up of the Farallon plate 55–52 Ma and the activation of the San Andreas Fault c. 30 Ma.

== Origins ==
The Juan de Fuca plate system has its origins with Panthalassa&#x27;s oceanic basin and crust. This oceanic crust has primarily been subducted under the North American plate, and the Eurasian plate. Panthalassa&#x27;s oceanic plate remnants are understood to be the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, Cocos and the Nazca plates, all four of which were part of the Farallon plate.

== Extent ==
The Juan de Fuca plate is bounded on the south by the Blanco fracture zone (running northwest off the coast of Oregon), on the north by the Nootka Fault (running southwest off Nootka Island, near Vancouver Island, British Columbia) and along the west by the Pacific plate (which covers most of the Pacific Ocean and is the largest of Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates). The Juan de Fuca plate itself has since fractured into three pieces, and the name is applied to the entire plate in some references, but in others only to the central portion. The three fragments are differentiated as such: the piece to the south is known as the Gorda plate and the piece to the north is known as the Explorer plate. The separate pieces are demarcated by the large offsets of the undersea spreading zone.

== Volcanism ==
This subducting plate system has formed the Cascade Range, the Cascade Volcanic Arc, and the Pacific Ranges, along the west coast of North America from southern British Columbia to northern California. These in turn are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a much larger-scale volcanic feature that extends around much of the rim of the Pacific Ocean.

==Earthquakes==
The last megathrust earthquake at the Cascadia subduction zone was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, estimated to have a moment magnitude of 8.7 to 9.2. Based on carbon dating of local tsunami deposits, it is inferred to have occurred around 1700. Evidence of this earthquake is also seen in the ghost forest along the bank of the Copalis River in Washington. The rings of the dead trees indicate that they died around 1700, and it is believed that they were killed when the earthquake occurred and sank the ground beneath them causing the trees to be flooded by saltwater. Japanese records indicate that a tsunami occurred in Japan on 26 January 1700, which was likely caused by this earthquake.

In 2008, small earthquakes were observed within the Juan de Fuca plate. The unusual quakes were described as &quot;more than 600 quakes over the past 10 days in a basin 150 miles [240 km] southwest of Newport&quot;. The quakes were unlike most quakes in that they did not follow the pattern of a large quake, followed by smaller aftershocks; rather, they were simply a continual deluge of small quakes. Furthermore, they did not occur on the tectonic plate boundary, but rather in the middle of the plate. The subterranean quakes were detected on hydrophones, and scientists described the sounds as similar to thunder, and unlike anything previously recorded.

==Carbon sequestration potential==
The basaltic formations of the Juan de Fuca plate could potentially be suitable for long-term CO2 sequestration as part of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. Injection of CO2 would lead to the formation of stable carbonates. It is estimated that 100 years of US carbon emissions (at current rate) could be stored securely, without risk of leakage back into the atmosphere.

==Tearing==
In 2019, scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, published a study in &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; in which they reported that by utilizing data from over 30,000 seismic waves and 217 earthquakes to create a three-dimensional map, they had revealed the existence of a hole in the subducted part of the Juan de Fuca plate, and speculated that the hole is an indication of a deep tear in the plate along a &quot;preexisting zone of weakness&quot;. According to William B. Hawley and Richard M. Allen, the authors of the study, the hole may be the cause of volcanism and earthquakes on the plate, and is causing deformation of the offshore part of the plate. The deformation may cause the plate to fragment, with the remaining un-subducted small pieces becoming attached to other plates nearby.

== Lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary beneath Juan de Fuca ==
In 2016, a geophysical study was published on the possible presence of a layer of buoyant material between the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere and the asthenosphere under the Juan de Fuca plate. The study extends the theory of partial melt in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to subduction zones, specifically in the convergent margins.

Using teleseismic body-wave tomography, a low-velocity zone of thickness 50~100 km in the sublithospheric region beneath the Juan de Fuca plate was detected. The observation, along with fluid-mechanical calculations that factor in Couette and Poiseuille flows, support the hypothesis of the accumulation of a buoyant material, characterized by low viscosity. The exact source of this anomaly remains unknown, although its highly-conductive nature and low-seismic wave velocity are well observed.

<doc id="493892" wikidata="Q631411" url="?curid=493892" title="Fairchild C-123 Provider">
<text>The Fairchild C-123 Provider is an American military transport aircraft designed by Chase Aircraft and built by Fairchild Aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. In addition to its USAF service, which included later service with the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, it went on to serve the U.S. Coast Guard and various air forces in Southeast Asia. During the War in Vietnam, the C-123 was used to deliver supplies, to evacuate the wounded, for agent insertions behind enemy lines, and was also used to spray Agent Orange.

==Design and development==

The C-123 Provider was designed originally as an assault glider aircraft for the United States Air Force (USAF) by Chase Aircraft as the XCG-20 (Chase designation MS-8 Avitruc) Two powered variants of the XCG-20 were developed during the early 1950s, as the XC-123 and XC-123A. The only difference were the class of engines used. The XC-123 used two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-23 air-cooled radial piston engines, while the XC-123A was fitted with four General Electric J47-GE-11 turbojets, in two pods. The XC-123A also has the distinction, while being experimental, of being the first USAF&#x27;s jet-powered military transport. While the piston-powered XC-123 was initially well-regarded for its ruggedness, reliability, and its ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips, the turbojet-powered XC-123A – designed for high-speed transport between USAF bases for critical parts and personnel – was found unable to operate from short and rough airstrips. There was also no practical speed advantage due to the wing and fuselage design, and a drastic reduction in range. Only the one turbojet-powered test and evaluation version was built.

While the United States Air Force was interested in placing an order for the new transport, Chase did not have the production capacity to meet the Air Force&#x27;s needs, and sought a partner to handle production of the new aircraft. By 1953, Henry J. Kaiser purchased a majority share in Chase Aircraft, feeling that after having completed C-119s for Fairchild under contract, he could take control of the impending C-123 contract. Two airframes were completed at Kaiser&#x27;s Willow Run factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, before a pricing scandal that led to Kaiser&#x27;s being told that no further contracts with him would be honored. The C-123 contract was put up for bid, and the two completed airframes scrapped. The contract was finally awarded to Fairchild Engine and Airplane, who assumed production of the former Chase C-123B, a refined version of the XC-123. Before turning production over to Fairchild, Chase originally named their C-123B the &quot;AVITRUC&quot; but it never stuck.

==Operational history==

The first recipients of C-123 aircraft were USAF transport units, soon followed by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) which used the aircraft for search and rescue (SAR) missions, and even the U.S. Air Force Demonstration Team, the &quot;Thunderbirds,&quot; used C-123s for a time as a logistics support aircraft for transporting the team&#x27;s ground crews and equipment. The type would also be widely exported under various U.S. military assistance programs, directly from USAF stocks. A C-123 was used to transport President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s limousine during his November, 1963, Texas tour.

The C-123 was nearly ignored by the USAF for service in Vietnam, but a political rivalry with the U.S. Army and the Army&#x27;s use of the CV-2 Caribou and later pre-production order for the de Havilland Canada C-8 Buffalo, led to a decision to deploy C-123s there. To compete with the well-performing CV-2, the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C-123 to allow it to do similar work on short runways. This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks, including the HC-123B which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971, and the C-123J which was fitted with retractable skis for operations in Greenland and Alaska on compacted snow runways.


By 1962, the C-123K variant aircraft was evaluated for operations in Southeast Asia and their stellar performance led the Air Force to upgrade 180 of the C-123B aircraft to the new C-123K standard, which featured auxiliary jet pods underneath the wings, and anti-skid brakes. In 1968, the aircraft helped resupply troops in Khe Sanh, Vietnam, during a three-month siege by North Vietnam.

A number of C-123s were configured as VIP transports, including General William Westmoreland&#x27;s &quot;White Whale&quot;. The C-123 also gained notoriety for its use in &quot;Operation Ranch Hand&quot; defoliation operations in Vietnam. Oddly enough, the USAF had officially chosen not to procure the VC-123C VIP transport, opting instead for the Convair VC-131D.

The first C-123s to reach South Vietnam were part of the USAF&#x27;s Special Aerial Spray Flight, as part of Operation Ranch Hand tasked with defoliating the jungle in order to deny rebels their traditional hiding places. These aircraft began their operations at the end of 1961. Aircraft fitted with spraying equipment were given the U prefix as a role modifier, with the most common types being the UC-123B and the UC-123K. Aircraft configured for this use were the last to see military service, in the control of outbreaks of insect-borne disease. The C-123 was also used as &quot;jump aircraft&quot; for U.S. Army Airborne students located at Lawson Army Airfield, Fort Benning, Georgia from the early 1970s through the early 1980s. This aircraft was used in conjunction with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed C-141 Starlifter.

In 1958, the U.S. Coast Guard received its first HC-123B from the USAF, followed by seven more in 1961. Prior to the Vietnam War the C-123B was utilized for a multitude of missions such as a troop carrier, medivac transport, and support missions from short, minimally-prepared landing strips. Installation of a dome on the nose of the aircraft accommodated a large radar allowing the plane to meet the requirements for search and rescue and long range flight over water. The Coast Guard crewed the aircraft with a complement of five: two officers serving as the pilot and copilot, augmented by an enlisted flight mechanic, an enlisted navigator, and an enlisted loadmaster. The HC-123B&#x27;s role in the Coast Guard was slowly replaced by the longer-ranged Coast Guard HC-130 aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s as those newer airframes came on line. In 1972 the final C-123B in the U.S Coast Guards&#x27; Inventory was retired.

With the end of the Vietnam War, remaining C-123Ks and UC-123Ks were transferred to tactical airlift units of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and the Air National Guard (ANG) that were operationally-gained by Tactical Air Command (TAC) before 1975 and Military Airlift Command (MAC) after 1975.

The 302nd Tactical Airlift Wing at Rickenbacker AFB (later Rickenbacker ANGB), Ohio, flew the last UC-123Ks Providers in operational service before being converted to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Known as the Special Spray Flight, these aircraft were used to control insect-borne diseases, with missions to Alaska, South America, and Guam being among the humanitarian missions performed by this Air Force Reserve unit.

The final examples of the C-123 in active U.S. military service were retired from the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard in the early 1980s. Some airframes were transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for test and evaluation programs while others were transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for miscellaneous programs. These aircraft were also retired by the end of the 1990s.

===Experimental projects===
In 1954, the YC-123D, formerly the XC-123A prototype, flew in its modified state after being converted by Stroukoff Aircraft. While the most obvious change from the original XC-123A was the switch of engines (to two Wright Turbo Compound R3350-89A radial engines, turning four-blade, thirteen foot Aeroproducts constant-speed fully feathering propellers), the YC-123D also had a boundary layer control system fitted. This system directs air from the engines at high speed over the top of the wing, making the wing act as if the aircraft is flying at a higher airspeed. As a result, the YC-123D had a greatly reduced takeoff and landing distance. Compared to the C-123B, the YC-123D could land in 755 feet instead of 1,200, and takeoff with only 850 ft of runway instead of 1,950, with a 50,000 lb total weight.

In 1955, Stroukoff, under contract from the USAF, produced a single YC-123E, designed to be able to take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff&#x27;s &quot;Pantobase&quot; system, combining a ski system with a sealed fuselage and wing mounted floats, while retaining its normal landing gear. The skis worked both on snow and water, and the system effectively allowed the aircraft to land on water, land, snow or ice.

In 1956, the USAF awarded a contract to Fairchild to design an improved version of the C-123 under the designation C-136, but the contract was cancelled before the aircraft was built.

At much the same time, the YC-123H was under development, the product of a Fairchild modification program started in 1956 and completed in 1957. A &quot;Jet Augmentation Program&quot; for existing C-123Bs had been initiated in 1955 at the behest of the USAF, and in the YC-123H contract the USAF expanded it to allow the mounting of two pod-mounted General Electric J85 turbojets.

In 1979, the Royal Thai government, seeking to extend the life of their C-123 fleet, placed a contract with the Mancro Aircraft Company, supported by the USAF, to convert a single C-123B to turboprop powerplants. Allison T56-A-7 turboprops were used and by the time the aircraft, dubbed C-123T, was complete it had new &quot;wet&quot; wings, an auxiliary power unit (APU) to assist with power movement of the control surfaces, and a heating system for the cargo compartments that also fed a new de-icing system. Budgetary restrictions forced the Thai government to abandon the program in 1981, and with a lack of interested parties development of the C-123T stopped. However, it concluded the life of the C-123 by making it the only aircraft type to operate under jet, piston, and turboprop engine power, and as a glider, during its history.

The C-123T has recently been revived by a joint venture between the US-based Fleetwings Aircraft Company and the South African company Elmer Group. In 2010, they announced a project to initially remanufacture old airframes for African customers and, where there was demand, to build new aircraft. The airframes would be fitted with new turboprop Rolls-Royce T56-A-15 engines, a glass cockpit and other enhancements. The proposed C-123T would have had a 25,000 lb payload capability, and a take-off run of just over 1,000 ft at 50,000 lb MTOW. Possible applications included maritime patrol, search and rescue, and even use as a gunship, while roll-on packages have already been developed for mid-air refueling and agricultural applications.

===Black Spot and other special military C-123s===
During the Vietnam War, some C-123s were modified for specialized roles. Most of these modifications were on a one- or two-aircraft level. Only the usage of C-123s as &quot;flare ships&quot; to illuminate targets for fixed wing gunships such as the AC-47 and AC-119G were more numerous. These aircraft operating under the call-sign &quot;Candle&quot; were flown by the USAF&#x27;s 14th Special Operations Wing.

A single C-123B was tested as a possible replacement for the &quot;Candle&quot; aircraft, with its rear loading ramp removed and replaced with a large box with 28 large lights. The aircraft could continuously light a circle from an altitude of . This aircraft, under the provisional designation NC-123B, was dropped because the lights fixed to the aircraft made it far easier for enemy gunners to track compared to the earlier flare ships.

The &quot;Candle&quot; aircraft had an extended life when several UC-123Ks were transferred to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand. During that period, it was used as a flare ship as well as a forward air control (FAC) aircraft. The flare duties were generally used for troops in contact (TIC) while the FAC mission directed air strikes in Laos over the Ho Chi Minh trail.

Another NC-123B was used as a radio relay aircraft over the Ho Chi Minh trail, with equipment to read the signals from various sensors on the ground designed to pick up enemy truck activity.

Two C-123K aircraft modified in September 1965 under Project Black Spot. The Black Spot aircraft were to fit under the &quot;self-contained night attack capability&quot; that was Operation Shed Light&#x27;s primary focus and E-Systems of Greenville, Texas, was contracted to complete the modifications. These aircraft featured a variety of new sensors including Low Light Level TV (LLLTV), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and a laser rangefinder. The aircraft looked radically different visibly from its transport brethren, as the new equipment required lengthening the nose by over . The aircraft also featured an armament system designed to carry BLU-3/B (using the ADU-253/B adapter) or BLU-26/B (using the ADU-272/B adapter) bomblets, or CBU-68/B cluster bombs.

The two aircraft, AF Serial Numbers 54-0691 and 54-0698, were first designated NC-123K in 1968 and then redesignated AC-123K in 1969. These NC/AC-123Ks were first deployed operationally at Osan AB, South Korea, between August and October 1968, and flying in support of operations against North Korean infiltrators approaching by boat. The operations in Korea met with a certain level of success and as a result the NC/AC-123Ks were transferred to South Vietnam in November 1968. The aircraft operated there until January 1969, when they were redeployed to Ubon RTAB, Thailand. The two aircraft were then returned to the United States to Hurlburt Field, Florida, in May 1969, where a second round of training occurred. Four crews attended a ground school in Greenville, Texas, and returned to Hurlburt where they flew the aircraft for the first time.

The fate of the aircraft is still unclear. Sources have missions terminating in early July 1970 and the aircraft flying to the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center (MASDC) &quot;boneyard&quot; at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where they were returned to C-123K standard, then returned to South Vietnam still wearing their camouflage and black undersides for transport duty. However, the official history states that combat operations ceased on 11 May 1969, with no mention of the second deployment. While the second deployment is mentioned in associated documentation, the only dates are of the arrival in Thailand and there is no information as to when they departed or where their destination was.

===Covert operations===

====Southeast Asia====
In 1962, the CIA acquired five C-123Bs from USAF for Air America to be used in Laos and Vietnam, and another 5 C-123Bs to be used by Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) top secret 34th Squadron, a Black Ops units called the &quot;Black Bat&quot;, as Flight B section (Flight A section was the two P2V-7U/RB-69A). The five Taiwan C-123Bs were sent to Lockheed Skunk Works for modifications as covert insertion aircraft with &quot;smart&quot; air-to-air jammer, BSTR system to jam the radars of ground anti-aircraft guns, also added a defensive operator&#x27;s station to operate the jammers on board, with extra fuel in underwing tanks, with 36 Taiwanese crew finished training courses at Pope AFB by November 1962.

The five ROCAF/Taiwan/CIA C-123Bs would be used over North Vietnam as low level and nighttime covert airdrop aircraft, under the South Star II agreement, under the guise of Taiwan&#x27;s national airline, China Airlines, which had &quot;cover story&quot; of operating Vietnamese Air Transport (VIAT) in South Vietnam, that was formerly operated by Air America. The secret outfit was based in Saigon, but would fly out of Da Nang for airdrop missions going into North Vietnam, with some missions lasting 14 hours.

On 1 February 1964, the overall control of South Star II was transferred from CIA to Studies and Observations Group (SOG), as part of U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) in Saigon. The outfit was redesignated as Det. 1 of USAF&#x27;s 75th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS), but within SOG it was known as the First Flight Detachment (FFD).

In May 1964, under &quot;Project Duck Hook&quot;, six more C-123s received extensive modifications by Lockheed Air Service at Ontario, California, equipped with ATIR and BSTR ECM packages, ASN-25 Doppler navigation system, APN-153 terrain-following radar, a console station for radio operator, new HF radio and other radios. These aircraft were issued to the secret Taiwanese Black Bat unit operating in South Vietnam. In October 1964, MACV, CIA and ROCAF/Taiwan signed the South Star III agreement to continue the operation in Vietnam. The six &quot;Duck Hook&quot; C-123Bs were based at Nha Trang Air Base, north of Cam Ranh Bay, officially designated as USAF Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron.

The &quot;Duck Hook&quot; C-123Bs were updated with RDR-10 weather radar and ARN-131 homing receiver in 1966 in order to perform missions over the Ho Chi Minh trail. All C-123Bs were converted to C-123Ks in 1968, with two wing-mounted turbojets, plus an ECM upgrade with APR-25 radar warning receiver and ALE-1 chaff dispenser. Project &quot;Duck Hook&quot; designation was ultimately changed to &quot;Heavy Hook&quot;. The Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron unit at Nha Trang received an outstanding unit award from the USAF, for flying 4,000 classified combat and combat support missions from June 1966 to May 1968.

In May 1970, C-123Ks from the &quot;Black Bats&quot; supported the secret U.S. military incursion into Cambodia. In October 1970, flights into Laos began. In March 1972, the SOG was deactivated, and the Southern Star operation ended with four surviving C-123Ks returned to Taiwan. On 1 March 1973, 34th &quot;Black Bat&quot; Squadron of ROCAF/Taiwan was disbanded.

====Central America====

On 5 October 1986, a Corporate Air Services C-123 Provider (HPF821, previously N4410F and USAF 54-679, (c/n 20128)) departed San Salvador-Ilopango Airport in El Salvador loaded with 70 AK-47 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, rocket grenades and other supplies. It flew along the coastline of Nicaragua and entered Nicaraguan airspace near the border with Costa Rica. Nearing San Carlos, the plane descended to 2,500 feet while preparing to drop off its cargo to Contra fighters.

While conducting the drop, the C-123 was shot down by a Sandinista soldier, using a SA-7 Grail. CIA pilots Wallace &quot;Buzz&quot; Sawyer and William Cooper were killed in the crash. Loadmaster Eugene Hasenfus parachuted to safety and was taken prisoner. He was later released in December 1986. The Fairchild C-123 that was shot down in Nicaragua remains there. Its sister ship, also a Fairchild C-123 that was purchased by the CIA at the same time as the first one, was then left abandoned at San Jose International Airport for a time and then was purchased for $3,000 and disassembled into 7 pieces and transported via boat to Quepos, Costa Rica and then reassembled and is now the center piece of a beachside cocktail lounge just up the road from Manual Antonio national park.

====Agent Orange controversy====
In 2011, a retired Air Force officer, Major Wesley T. Carter, filed a complaint with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the Air Force Reserve at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University&#x27;s Mailman School of Public Health.

The aircraft which were flown from 1972–1982, were assigned to the Air Force Reserve after their service in Vietnam, and used for normal cargo and aeromedical evacuation missions. Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with the windows open due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, &quot;...within official channels.&quot; Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the Robins AFB, Georgia Museum of Aviation with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting the scraps into ingots for disposal.

On 9 June 2011, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Inspector General rejected Carter&#x27;s complaints, and in a subsequent message explained, &quot;Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to identify or notify the individuals in the categories you mention&quot; when asked if the military would alert the aircrews regarding their exposure to dioxin. On 18 June 2011, the veterans&#x27; complaint was accepted with the Department of Defense Inspector General, adding the request that the UC-123K aircraft themselves be designated by the Secretary of Defense as &quot;Agent Orange Exposure Sites&quot;.

In December 2011, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs posted two notices of its decision that, while the post-Vietnam aircraft &quot;may&quot; have been contaminated, the aircrews were &quot;unlikely&quot; to have suffered exposure to dioxin. In an unusual response, the U.S. Center for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry quickly countered the VA position on 25 January 2012 with a statement by their Deputy Director concluding that aircrews and maintenance personnel most likely were exposed well beyond military and government surface-wipe screening levels.

<text>&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by lead vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the first song on the greatest hits album &quot;Nirvana&quot;, released by DGC Records in October 2002. It is also the final song the band recorded before Cobain&#x27;s suicide in April 1994. 

For years after Cobain&#x27;s death, the song was known only from a bootlegged live version, recorded in October 1993 at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois, and from a cover by American rock band Hole, fronted by Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love. Surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic had intended to release the studio version on a posthumous Nirvana box set, but Love blocked its release in 2001, asserting that a recording of such &quot;extraordinary artistic and commercial value&quot; belonged on a cheaper, single disc compilation instead. 

In September 2002, &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was subject to a high profile Internet leak, which led to it being put into heavy rotation on radio stations around the world, despite cease and desist orders from DGC&#x27;s parent company Geffen Records. Shortly after, it was announced that the lawsuit between Love and Grohl and Novoselic was settled, and that the song would appear on a greatest hits album later that year.

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was released as a promo single in October 2002, and reached number one on both &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts.

==Early history==

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was written in 1993. A boombox-recorded home demo, featuring Cobain on vocals and guitar, was released posthumously on the Nirvana box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, in November 2004. The same version was re-released on the compilation album, &quot;&quot;, in November 2005.

The full song was only performed once in concert, at the Aragon Ballroom on October 23, 1993. Contemporary reviews of the show did not mention the then-unknown song, but Chicago music journalist Jim DeRogatis later described hearing it at the concert in a 2002 &quot;Spin&quot; article, recalling that &quot;it was classic Nirvana, hitting with the same impact as &#x27;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x27; and boasting a similar structure-a slow, creepy verse, suddenly exploding into a painfully cathartic but undeniably catchy chorus.&quot;

==Robert Lang session==

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was recorded in the studio by Adam Kasper at Nirvana&#x27;s final session, on January 30, 1994 at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. The band had booked the studio for three days during a tour break, but Cobain had been absent for the first two days, leaving Novoselic and Grohl to work on their own songs. Upon Cobain&#x27;s arrival on the third day, he immediately went to the studio&#x27;s mixing console and listened to the material his bandmates had recorded, offering support. Despite his apparent enthusiasm for the session, he had arrived at the studio without his gear, and ended up using a Univox guitar that the band&#x27;s guitar technician, Ernie Bailey, had reworked for him, along with the studio&#x27;s 50 Watt Marshall amp, which he disliked, and a pedal board with a Boss distortion pedal.

The band jammed for approximately 20 minutes, and then began working on the arrangement of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;, then known as &quot;Kurt&#x27;s Tune #1&quot;. According to a May 2004 &quot;Mojo&quot; article by Gillian G. Gaar, the band rehearsed the song three times, with the structure &quot;pretty well hashed out&quot; on the first take, and the chiming intro featured in the final version, achieved by Cobain playing the guitar above the nut, first appearing on the third take. Robert Lang, the studio&#x27;s owner, recalled being &quot;speechless&quot; hearing the song while in the control room with Kasper.

After recording the master instrumental take, the band and others present at the recording session took a break away from the studio to visit a local pizzeria and for Cobain to buy cigarettes, and then returned and recorded another instrumental song, titled &quot;Jam After Dinner&quot;. Cobain then recorded the vocals to &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right,&quot; completing the main vocals in one take, and then adding two additional vocal overdubs. These were the only vocals that Cobain recorded during the session. His final contribution to the recording was a guitar overdub. Novoselic and Grohl recorded six more songs without Cobain, who had likely left by then, after signing the studio door and adding a drawing of a cat next to his signature.

Nirvana&#x27;s touring guitarist, Pat Smear, lived in Los Angeles and was not present during the session. In a 2002 interview with the website &quot;Nirvana Fan Club&quot;, he said Cobain had sent him a cassette of the recording and told him he could add his part later. The band dissolved before Smear had the chance. The band reportedly planned to continue work at Lang&#x27;s studio after their upcoming European tour, but Cobain died just over two months later, after cancelling the tour and returning to Seattle.

The masters of the sessions remained in Novoselic&#x27;s basement until 1998, when work began on a posthumous Nirvana box set with an intended release date of September 2001, the 10th anniversary of the band&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. The song, now retitled &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right,&quot; was mixed on July 14 and 15 of that year at Conway Studios in Hollywood, California, in anticipation of its release. According to Novoselic, the final mix does not sound significantly different from the way it sounded when it was recorded in 1994, with the most dramatic changes being the addition of compression and reverb.

==Post-Robert Lang session==

Unlike many unreleased Nirvana recordings, the studio version of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; had never been bootlegged and remained unheard by the public until 2002, when clips provided by Love were played on an episode of the NBC show &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;. However, an audience recording of the Aragon Ballroom version began appearing on commercial bootlegs as early as 1994, under erroneous titles such as &quot;On a Mountain&quot; and &quot;Autopilot.&quot;

The song received further exposure when Hole performed it, under the title &quot;You&#x27;ve Got No Right,&quot; during their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; appearance on February 14, 1995. Love introduced it as &quot;a song that Kurt wrote; [the] last song, almost.&quot;

In 1995, Love offered the song to American rock musician Mark Lanegan, a friend of Cobain&#x27;s, to cover with his band, Screaming Trees. As Screaming Trees guitarist Gary Lee Conner recalled in the 2023 book &quot;Lanegan&quot;, &quot;When we were working on songwriting for Dust...Mark is like, &#x27;Courtney wants us to do a song… And it was that song — &#x27;You Know You&#x27;re Right.&#x27; So, I got a tape of it and we learned it. We never recorded it. But we learned it without Mark, and Mark came down to sing it… and he couldn&#x27;t. He changed his mind. And that was the end of it.&quot; Conner acknowledged that the band &quot;could have had a big hit&quot; by releasing a cover of a then-unknown Nirvana song, but believes Lanegan may have been wary of capitalizing on Cobain&#x27;s death.

==Lawsuit and release==

In 2001, the studio version of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; became the center of a legal dispute between Love and surviving Nirvana members Grohl and Novoselic. Love blocked its release, saying that it would be &quot;wasted&quot; on the planned box set, and was better suited to a single-disc collection similar to the Beatles&#x27; compilation album &quot;1&quot;. Her lawsuit called the song a &quot;potential &#x27;hit&#x27; of extraordinary artistic and commercial value&quot;, and her manager asserted that a release with the song could sell 15 million copies. Novoselic said he did not necessarily disagree with Love: &quot;I&#x27;ve always considered everything she said. We&#x27;ve considered it and agreed and said, &#x27;Hey, that&#x27;s a great idea, Courtney.&#x27; I tried to get along with Courtney as best I could, but there&#x27;s only so much you can do.&quot;

In August 2001, one of the earliest firsthand descriptions of the studio version appeared in the Cobain biography &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;, written by the Seattle music journalist Charles R. Cross, who had been granted access to the recording by Love. Cross called the song &quot;one of the high-water marks in [Cobain&#x27;s] entire canon,&quot; and wrote that &quot;the plaintive wail in the chorus couldn&#x27;t be clearer: &#x27;Pain,&#x27; he cried, stretching the word out for almost ten seconds, giving it four syllables, and leaving an impression of inescapable torment.&quot; 

In March 2002, Love played the song at a private event in Hollywood, and also allowed a portion of the song to air on an episode of &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; that she was interviewed in. The latter marked the first time any part of the studio recording had been heard by the general public.

As the lawsuit continued, another description of the studio version appeared in print, in the &quot;Spin&quot; article &quot;The Nirvana Wars&quot;, written by DeRogatis and published in June 2002. Like Cross, DeRogatis had been allowed to hear the studio version and other unreleased Nirvana recordings by Love, and described it as &quot;even stronger&quot; than the live version he heard in person at the Aragon Ballroom in 1993.

===Leak===

In May 2002, four additional clips of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; were leaked online, leading some to speculate that it had been placed on advance copies of Grohl&#x27;s heavy metal side project, &quot;Probot&quot;. On May 17, Grohl issued a statement denying his involvement in the leak, and that the song was not included on any CD he had compiled or given to anyone.

On September 21, 2002, an unmastered MP3 of the full studio version of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was leaked online. The song was quickly put in rotation by a number of alternative rock radio stations, which led to cease-and-desist letters being issued by DGC Records&#x27; parent company Geffen Records; a number of stations defied the orders. The Seattle radio station 107.7 The End posted a banner on their website that announced: &quot;We took your e-mails and flooded the server at Geffen Records with tons of choice words about their &#x27;You Know You&#x27;re Right&#x27; cease and desist order. Due to the huge publicity outcry, the label has released the track. Hear NEW Nirvana all this weekend, only on 107.7 The End.&quot;

In late September, Love, Grohl and Novoselic released a joint statement announcing that the lawsuit had been settled, and that &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; would be officially released on the &quot;Nirvana&quot; greatest hits album later that year. It was released as a promotional single, with a music video directed by Chris Hafner. It was rereleased on Nirvana&#x27;s second greatest hits compilation, &quot;Icon&quot;, in 2010.

==Composition==
&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; is an alternative rock song that is three minutes and 38 seconds long. According to the sheet music published at Sheet Music Plus by EMI Music Publishing, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 84 beats per minute. &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; is composed in the key of F minor, while Kurt Cobain&#x27;s vocal range spans one octave and three notes. The song follows a basic sequence of F5–D–E in the verses and pre-chorus and is mainly restricted to a droning chord of F5 throughout the refrain as its chord progression. The journalist Charles R. Cross said it featured the &quot;soft-hard dynamics&quot; of Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Heart-Shaped Box,&quot; with quiet verses followed by a loud screamed chorus.

It follows the usual quiet/loud/quiet pattern of Nirvana songs. The lyrics are sarcastic: &quot;things have never been so swell, I have never failed to fail&quot; and alternating word play between &quot;you know you&#x27;re right&quot; and &quot;you know your rights&quot;.

===Title===

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; did not have an official title at the time of Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994. According to Gaar&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Mojo&quot; article, it was listed simply as &quot;Kurt&#x27;s Tune #1&quot; on the tracking sheets from the Robert Lang Studios recording session. The title used by Hole, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got No Right,&quot; was the one most commonly used by fans prior to the song&#x27;s official release.

In the liner notes to &quot;Nirvana&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer David Fricke erroneously states that the song had gone under the previous titles of &quot;Autopilot&quot; and &quot;On a Mountain&quot;. The latter title was also cited by Cross in &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;. These names were actually invented by bootleggers who had misheard Grohl&#x27;s comment at the beginning of the live version. Grohl had announced, &quot;This is our last song; it&#x27;s called &#x27;All Apologies&#x27;&quot;, unaware that Cobain had already started playing &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;. Due to the relatively poor fidelity of the live recording, bootleggers believed Grohl had introduced the new song, and tried to interpret what they thought was its title. Cross also seems to misrepresent the lyrics in &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;, citing the lyric, &quot;I am walking in the piss,&quot; which appears in Hole&#x27;s 1995 version of the song, but in no known Nirvana recording.

==Music video==

A music video for &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was released in October 2002. Directed by Chris Hafner, it features a montage of band footage, drawn mostly from live performances and interviews, occasionally edited to give the effect of the song being performed. The video peaked at number two on MTV&#x27;s most played music videos, as monitored by the Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, for the week ending October 20, 2002.

==Reception==

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was the fourth Nirvana song to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, reaching number 45. It was their fifth song to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it remained for four consecutive weeks, the longest of any Nirvana song. With an increase of 1,616 spins, Nirvana also broke the record for the largest detected jump by an act already on the chart. It also became the first Nirvana song to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The digital download release also sold well internationally.

Amy McAuliffe from BBC called the song &quot;a poignant reminder of what might have been&quot; and described it as &quot;listening to a dead man snarling out his last gasp of righteous sarcasm.&quot; Will Hermes of &quot;Spin&quot; remarked that it was &quot;amazing how a merely good Nirvana song still scorches everything within earshot.&quot; David Samuels of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote that &quot;unlike most post-mortem rock releases, &#x27;You Know You&#x27;re Right&#x27; is not B-side material or the result of recording studio wizardry—it&#x27;s a real Nirvana song&quot; that showed that &quot;Cobain was at the peak of his powers as a vocalist and songwriter—the most gifted and popular writer that rock music had seen since Lennon/McCartney.&quot; Likewise, Larry Flint from &quot;Billboard&quot; stated, &quot;Unlike most previously unreleased cuts tacked onto best-of sets, &#x27;You Know You&#x27;re Right&#x27; is a potent addition to Nirvana&#x27;s cache of classic material.&quot;

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was ranked as the fifth-best single of the year by &quot;Spin&quot;, with Charles Aaron calling it a &quot;gnarly little heart-shaped box crammed with feedback, bile, and a gut-shredding chorus.&quot; In 2002, the song received a BDS Spin Award for 50,000 radio spins in the US, and in 2003 it received a BDS award for 100,000 radio spins in the US.

== Legacy ==
In 2011, &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was ranked at number two on &quot;NME&#x27;s&quot; list of the 10 best Nirvana songs. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it at number 21 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2023, it was ranked at number 30 by Stephen Thomas Erlewine on &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list. Shortly before its release, Kasper described &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s &quot;best songs, probably in the Top Ten.&quot; 

Grohl reflected on the song in a 2019 interview with &quot;The Guardian,&quot; telling interviewer Eve Barlow that &quot;I listened to it for the first time in 10 years. Oh God, it&#x27;s hard to listen to. It was not a pleasant time for the band. Kurt was unwell. Then he was well. Then he was unwell. The last year of the band was tough.&quot; In addition to calling the lyrics &quot;heartbreaking&quot; in retrospect, Grohl added that &quot;I used to think it sounded like [Cobain] was singing the chorus. Now I listen to it and it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s wailing.&quot;

In May 2020, American director Cameron Crowe revealed in an interview with &quot;Stereogum&quot; that he had hidden the studio recording of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right,&quot; given to him by Love, in his film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, which was released almost a year prior to the song&#x27;s official release. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t credit it in the movie and it was actually illegal,&quot; Crowe explained, &quot;but Courtney Love gave it to us. She said, &#x27;This is the only Nirvana song that&#x27;s never been released. Hide it in your movie somewhere.&#x27;

In a 2022 retrospective article on the song, Brad Shoup of &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;the most anticipated rock single of 2002,&quot; and wrote that its posthumous chart success &quot;was a testament to Kurt Cobain&#x27;s bone-deep sense of songcraft – and the still-sizable fanbase Nirvana had established before Cobain&#x27;s April 1994 suicide.&quot;
