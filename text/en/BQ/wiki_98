<text>Ostracods, or ostracodes, are a class of the Crustacea (class Ostracoda), sometimes known as seed shrimp. Some 33,000 species (only 13,000 of which are extant) have been identified, grouped into 7 valid orders. They are small crustaceans, typically around in size, but varying from in the case of the marine &quot;Gigantocypris.&quot; The largest known freshwater species is &quot;Megalocypris princeps&quot;, which reach 8 mm in length. In most cases, their bodies are flattened from side to side and protected by a bivalve-like valve or &quot;shell&quot; made of chitin, and often calcium carbonate. The family Entocytheridae and many planktonic forms do not have calcium carbonate. The hinge of the two valves is in the upper (dorsal) region of the body. Ostracods are grouped together based on shell and soft part morphology, and molecular studies have not unequivocally supported the group&#x27;s monophyly. They have a wide range of diets, and the class includes carnivores, herbivores, scavengers and filter feeders, but most ostracods are deposit feeders.

==Etymology==
&quot;Ostracod&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;óstrakon&quot; meaning shell or tile.

==Fossils==

Ostracods are &quot;by far the most common arthropods in the fossil record&quot; with fossils being found from the early Ordovician to the present. An outline microfaunal zonal scheme based on both Foraminifera and Ostracoda was compiled by M. B. Hart. Freshwater ostracods have even been found in Baltic amber of Eocene age, having presumably been washed onto trees during floods.

Ostracods have been particularly useful for the biozonation of marine strata on a local or regional scale, and they are invaluable indicators of paleoenvironments because of their widespread occurrence, small size, easily preservable, generally moulted, calcified bivalve carapaces; the valves are a commonly found microfossil.

A find in Queensland, Australia, in 2013, announced in May 2014, at the Bicentennary Site in the Riversleigh World Heritage area, revealed both male and female specimens with very well preserved soft tissue. This set the Guinness World Record for the oldest penis. Males had observable sperm that is the oldest yet seen and, when analysed, showed internal structures and has been assessed as being the largest sperm (per body size) of any animal recorded. It was assessed that the fossilisation was achieved within several days, due to phosphorus in the bat droppings of the cave where the ostracods were living.

==Description==

The body of an ostracod is encased by a carapace originating from the head region, and consists of two valves superficially resembling the shell of a clam. A distinction is made between the valve (hard parts) and the body with its appendages (soft parts). Studies of the embryonic development in Myodocopida shows that the bivalved carapace develops from two independent buds of the carapace valves. As the two halves grow, they meet in the middle. In Manawa, an ostracod in the order Palaeocopida, the carapace originates as a single element and during growth folds at the midline.

===Body parts===

The body consists of a head and thorax, separated by a slight constriction. Unlike many other crustaceans, the body is not clearly divided into segments. Most species have completely or partly lost their trunk segmentation, and there are no boundaries between the thorax and abdomen, and it has therefore been impossible to tell if the first pair of limbs after the maxillae belongs to the head or the thorax. With a few exception, like platycopids which have an 11-segmented trunk, the abdomen in ostracods has no visible segments.

The head is the largest part of the body, and bears four pairs of appendages. Two pairs of well-developed antennae are used to swim through the water. In addition, there are a pair of mandibles and a pair of maxillae. The thorax has three primary pairs of appendages. The first of these has different functions in different groups. It can be used for feeding (Cypridoidea) or for walking (Cytheroidea), and in some species it has evolved into a male clasping organ. The second pair is mainly used for locomotion, and the third is used for walking or cleaning, but can also be reduced or absent. Both the second and third pair are absent in suborder Cladocopina. In the Myodocopina the third pair is a multisegmented cleaning organ that resembles a worm. Their external genitals seem to originate from the fusion of three to five appendages. The two &quot;rami&quot;, or projections, from the tip of the tail point downward and slightly forward from the rear of the shell.

All ostracods have a pair of &quot;ventilatory appendages&quot; that beat rhythmically, which create a water current between the body and the inner surface of the carapace. Podocopa, the largest subclass, have no gills, heart or circulatory system, so the gas exchange take place all over the surface. The other subclass of ostracods, the Myodocopa, do have a heart, and the family Cylindroleberididae also have 6–8 lamellar gills. Certain other larger members of Myodocopa, even if they don&#x27;t have gills, have a circulatory system where hemolymph sinuses absorbs oxygen through special areas on the inner wall of the carapace. In addition, the respiratory protein hemocyanin has been found in the two orders Myodocopida and Platycopida. Nitrogenous waste is excreted through glands on the maxillae, antennae, or both.

The primary sense of ostracods is likely touch, as they have several sensitive hairs on their bodies and appendages. Compound eyes are only found in Myodocopina within the Myodocopa. The order Halocyprida in the same subclass is eyeless. Podocopid ostracods have just a naupliar eye consisting of two lateral ocelli and a single ventral ocellus, but the ventral one is absent in some species. Platycopida was assumed to be completely eyeless, but two species, Keijcyoidea infralittoralis and Cytherella sordida, have been found to both possess a nauplius eye too.

==Palaeoclimatic reconstruction==

A new method is in development called mutual ostracod temperature range (MOTR), similar to the mutual climatic range (MCR) used for beetles, which can be used to infer palaeotemperatures. The ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 (δ18O) and the ratio of magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) in the calcite of ostracod valves can be used to infer information about past hydrological regimes, global ice volume and water temperatures.

==Distribution==
Ecologically, marine ostracods can be part of the zooplankton or (most commonly) are part of the benthos, living on or inside the upper layer of the sea floor. Ostracods has been found as deep as 9,307 m (genus Krithe in family Krithidae). Subclass Myodocopa and the two podocop orders Palaeocopida and Platycopida are restricted to marine environments (except for Platycopida which have a few brackish species), but we find non-marine forms in the four superfamilies Terrestricytheroidea, Cypridoidea, Darwinuloidea, and Cytheroidea in the order Podocopida. Terrestricytheroidea is semi-terrestrial and usually found in brackish and marine-influenced environments such as salt marshes, but not in freshwater. The other three superfamilies also live in freshwater (Darwinuloidea is exclusively non-marine). Of these three, only Cypridoidea have freshwater species able to swim. Representatives living in terrestrial habitats are also found in all three freshwater groups, such as genus &quot;Mesocypris&quot; which is known from humid forest soils of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

As of 2008, around 2000 species and 200 genera of non-marine ostracods are found. However, a large portion of diversity is still undescribed, indicated by undocumented diversity hotspots of temporary habitats in Africa and Australia. Non-marine species have been found to live in sulfidic cave ecosystems such as the Movile Cave, deep groundwaters, hypersaline waters, acidic waters with pH as low as 3.4, phytotelmata in plants like bromeliads, and in temperatures varying from almost freezing to more than 50 °C in hot springs. Of the known specific and generic diversity of non-marine ostracods, half (1000 species, 100 genera) belongs to one family (of 13 families), Cyprididae. Many Cyprididae occur in temporary water bodies and have drought-resistant eggs, mixed/parthenogenetic reproduction, and the ability to swim. These biological attributes preadapt them to form successful radiations in these habitats.

==Ecology==

===Lifecycle===
Male ostracods have two penises, corresponding to two genital openings (gonopores) on the female. The individual sperm are often large, and are coiled up within the testis prior to mating; in some cases, the uncoiled sperm can be up to six times the length of the male ostracod itself. Mating typically occurs during swarming, with large numbers of females swimming to join the males. Some species are partially or wholly parthenogenetic. Superfamily Darwinuloidea was assumed to have reproduced asexually for the last 200 million years, but rare males have since been discovered in one of the species.

In the subclass Myodocopa, all members of the order Myodocopida have brood care, releasing their offspring as first instars, allowing a pelagic lifestyle. In the order Halocyprida the eggs are released directly into the sea, except for a single genus with brood care. In the subclass Podocopa, brood care is only found in Darwinulocopina and some Cytherocopina in the order Podocopida. In the remaining Podocopa it is common to glue the eggs to a firm surface, like vegetation or the substratum. These eggs are often resting eggs, and remain dormant during desiccation and extreme temperatures, only hatching when exposed to more favorable conditions. Species adapted to vernal pools can reach sexual maturity in just 30 days after hatching. There is no larval stage or metamorphosis (direct development). Instead they hatch from the egg as juveniles with the bivalved carapace and at least three functional limbs. As the juvenile grows through a series of molts they acquire more limbs and develop further the already existing ones. They reach sexual maturity in the final instar and then never molts again. The number of instars they go through before adulthood varies. In Podocopa it is eight or nine (but family Entocytheridae and suborder Bairdiocopina has only seven), the Halocyprida goes through six or seven, and Myodocopida only four to six. They are able to produce several offspring many times as adults (iteroparity).

===Predators===
A variety of fauna prey upon ostracods in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. An example of predation in the marine environment is the action of certain Cytherocopina in the cuspidariid clams in detecting ostracods with cilia protruding from inhalant structures, thence drawing the ostracod prey in by a violent suction action. Predation from higher animals also occurs; for example, amphibians such as the rough-skinned newt prey upon certain ostracods. Whale sharks also seem to eat them as part of their filter feeding process.

===Bioluminescence===
Some ostracods, such as &quot;Vargula hilgendorfii&quot;, have a light organ in which they produce luminescent chemicals. These ostracods are called &quot;blue sand&quot; or &quot;blue tears&quot; and glow blue in the dark. Their bioluminescent properties made them valuable to the Japanese during World War II, when the Japanese army collected large amounts from the ocean to use as a convenient light for reading maps and other papers at night. The light from these ostracods, called &quot;umihotaru&quot; in Japanese, was sufficient to read by but not bright enough to give away troops&#x27; position to enemies. Bioluminescence has evolved twice in ostracods; once in Cypridinidae, and once in Halocyprididae. In bioluminescent Halocyprididae a green light is produced within carapace glands, and in Cypridinidae a blue light is produced and extruded from the upper lip. Most species use the light as predation defense, but the male of at least 75 known species of the Cypridinidae, restricted to the Caribbean, use pulses of light to attract females. Some species are the opposite where the females use pulses of light to attract males. This is seen in one example such as the glow worm. This bioluminiscent courtship display has only evolved once in ostracods, in a cypridinid group named Luxorina that originated at least 151 million years ago. Ostracods with bioluminescent courtship show higher rates of speciation than those who simply use light as protection against predators. The male will continue to swim after releasing its small ball of bioluminescent mucus, but the female is able to read the display to pinpoint the male&#x27;s location. In one species hundreds of thousands of males synchronize their light display, and when one male creates a pattern of light, the new pattern will spread out as the neighboring males repeat it.

==Classification==

Early work indicated that Ostracoda may not be monophyletic, and early molecular phylogeny was ambiguous on this front. Recent combined analyses of molecular and morphological data suggested monophyly in analyses with broadest taxon sampling, but this monophyly had no or very little support (Fig. 1 - bootstrap 0, 17 and 46, often values above 95 are considered sufficient for the taxon support).

<doc id="509044" wikidata="Q4678580" url="?curid=509044" title="Adam's Mark">
<text>Adam&#x27;s Mark Hotels &amp; Resorts was a chain of upscale hotels in the United States. The company was headquartered in the HBE Corporation offices in Creve Coeur, Missouri, in Greater St. Louis. Fred Kummer founded the chain in the early 1970s, as well as its parent, HBE Corp.

==History==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Adams Mark faced several civil, state, and federal lawsuits for racial discrimination against Black customers. It was the first hotel chain, in its entirety, to face a United States Justice Department inquiry into racial discrimination for violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In the 1990s, Adams Mark settled multimillion-dollar racial discrimination lawsuits involving employees and consumers against individual hotels in Indianapolis and St. Louis.

In December 1999, five African–American hotel guests brought a class action lawsuit against the hotel chain after attending the Black College Reunion in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1999. The suit alleged that Adams Mark &quot;charged black guests higher rates, required them to wear orange wrist bands and prohibited black visitors.&quot; Additionally, the claimants reported that &quot;rooms rented to blacks had been &#x27;stripped down&#x27; and lacked such basic amenities as telephones and maid service; pictures had been removed from the walls and room mini-bars were locked.&quot; The Justice Department agreed with the claimants in a nonmonetary settlement, finding that Adams Mark engaged in racial discrimination by &quot;charging Black customers higher prices than Whites and segregating Black customers in less desirable rooms as part of a corporate pattern of discrimination.&quot;

The suit, and subsequent 17-month boycott of the chain called by the NAACP, was settled out of court for $8 million in 2000.

In July 2015, new allegations of racism against Adams Mark surfaced. The Daily Kos reported, &quot;A white hotel manager of the Adams Mark Hotel in Kansas City, hung a black slave doll from the doorway of the office with a garbage bag in an apparent mocking of the death of Sandra Bland.&quot; Tweets about the incident documented a photograph of the doll hanging by a &quot;white plastic bag noose&quot; around her neck.

<text>An empanada is a type of baked or fried turnover consisting of pastry and filling, common in Spain, other Southern European countries, North African countries, South Asian countries, Latin American countries, and the Philippines. The name comes from the Spanish (to bread, i.e., to coat with bread), and translates as &#x27;breaded&#x27;, that is, wrapped or coated in bread. They are made by folding dough over a filling, which may consist of meat, cheese, tomato, corn, or other ingredients, and then cooking the resulting turnover, either by baking or frying.

==Origins==
The origin of empanadas is unknown, but they are thought to have originated in 7th century Galicia, a region in northwest Spain.

An empanada (&quot;empãada&quot;) is mentioned in the Cantigas de Santa Maria 57:VI (c. 1282):Entr&#x27; esses roubadores / viu jazer um vilão / desses mais malfeitores, / ũa perna na mão / de galinha, freame / que sacara com fame / entom dũ&#x27; empãada | que so um seu çurame/ comer quisera, / mais nom podera, / ca Deus nom queria.

In the midst of these robbers he saw lying there one of the most vicious of the rascals with a chicken leg in his hand. He had taken the cold morsel out of a pasty and was about to eat it under the cover of his cape. However, he could not, for God prevented it.Rabbinic Jewish books from the same period, including the &quot;Novellae&quot; of Asher ben Jehiel (1250-1327), the &quot;Novellae&quot; of Yom Tov of Seville (c. 1260–1320), the &quot;Orchot Chayyim&quot; of Aaron ben Jacob () and the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; of Jacob ben Asher () mention &quot;inpanada&quot; and &quot;panada&quot; as bread products containing fat, meat or fish on the inside.

<doc id="509070" wikidata="Q687889" url="?curid=509070" title="Ripping">
<text>Ripping is the extraction of digital content from a container, such as a CD, onto a new digital location. Originally, the term meant to rip music from Commodore 64 games. Later, the term was applied to ripping WAV or MP3 files from digital audio CDs, and after that to the extraction of contents from any storage media, including DVD and Blu-ray discs, as well as the extraction of video game sprites.

Despite the name, neither the media nor the data is damaged after extraction. Ripping is often used to shift formats, and to edit, duplicate or back up media content. A rip is the extracted content, in its destination format, along with accompanying files, such as a cue sheet or log file from the ripping software.

To rip the contents out of a container is different from simply copying the whole container or a file. When creating a copy, nothing looks into the transferred file, nor checks if there is any encryption or not, and raw copy is also not aware of any file format. One can copy a DVD byte by byte via programs like the Linux dd command onto a hard disk, and play the resulting ISO file just as one would play the original DVD.

To rip contents is also different from grabbing an analog signal and re-encoding it, as it was done with early day CD-ROM drives not capable of digital audio extraction (DAE). Sometimes even encoding, i.e. digitizing audio and video originally stored on analog formats, such as vinyl records is incorrectly referred to as ripping.

== Software ==

A CD ripper, CD grabber or CD extractor is a piece of software designed to extract or &quot;rip&quot; raw digital audio (in format commonly called CDDA) from a compact disc to a file or other output. Some all-in-one ripping programs can simplify the entire process by ripping and burning the audio to disc in one step, possibly re-encoding the audio on-the-fly in the process.

For example, audio CDs contain 16-bit, 44.1 kHz LPCM-encoded audio samples interleaved with secondary data streams and synchronization and error correction info. The ripping software tells the CD drive&#x27;s firmware to read this data and parse out just the LPCM samples. The software then dumps them into a WAV or AIFF file, or feeds them to another codec to produce, for example, a FLAC or MP3 file. Depending on the capabilities of the ripping software, ripping may be done on a track-by-track basis, or all tracks at once, or over a custom range. The ripping software may also have facilities for detecting and correcting errors during or after the rip, as the process is not always reliable, especially when the CD or the drive containing the CD itself is damaged or defective.

There are also DVD rippers which operate in a similar fashion. Unlike audio CDs, DVDs do contain data formatted in files for use in computers. However, commercial DVDs are often encrypted (for example, using Content Scramble System/ARccOS protection), preventing access to the files without using the ripping software&#x27;s decryption ability, which may not be legal to distribute or use. DVD files are often larger than is convenient to distribute or copy to CD-R or ordinary (not dual-layer) DVD-R, so DVD ripping software usually offers the ability to re-encode the content, with some quality loss, so that it fits in smaller files.

==Legality==

When the material being ripped is not in the public domain, and the person making the rip does not have the copyright owner&#x27;s permission, then such ripping may be regarded as copyright infringement. However, some countries either explicitly allow it in certain circumstances, or at least do not forbid it. Some countries also have fair use-type laws which allow unauthorized copies to be made under certain conditions.

=== Asia ===
=== Europe ===

A directive of the European Union allows its member nations to instate in their legal framework a &quot;private copy&quot; exception to the authors and editors rights. If a member State chooses to do so, it must also introduce a compensation for the copyright holders. Most European countries, except for Norway, have introduced a private copying levy that compensates the owners directly from the country&#x27;s budget. In 2009 the sum awarded to them was $55 million. In all but a few of these countries (exceptions include the UK and Malta), the levy is excised on all machines and blank materials capable of copying copyrighted works.

Under the directive, making copies for other people is forbidden, and if done for profit can lead to a jail sentence.

In the Netherlands, citizens are allowed to make copies of their legally bought audio and video. This includes CD, SACD, as well as DVD and Blu-ray. These copies are called &quot;home copies&quot; and may only be used by the ripper. Public distribution of ripped files is not allowed.

====Spain====
In Spain, anyone is allowed to make a private copy of a copyrighted material for oneself, providing that the copier has accessed the original material legally.

====United Kingdom====
Private copying of copyrighted material is illegal in the United Kingdom. According to a 2009 survey, 59% of British consumers believed ripping a CD to be legal, and 55% admitted to doing it.

In 2010, the UK government sought input on modernizing copyright exceptions for the digital age, and commissioned the &quot;Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth&quot;. The review asserted that a private copying exception was overdue, citing that users were unaware of what was even legally allowed, and that a copyright law where &quot;millions of citizens are in daily breach of copyright, simply for shifting a piece of music or video from one device to another&quot; was not &quot;fit for the digital age&quot;. The review recommended, among other things, that the government consider adopting the EU Copyright Directive&#x27;s recommendation that member states enact an exception for private, noncommercial copying so long as the rights holders receive &quot;fair compensation.&quot; Other EU member states chose to implement the exception paired with a tax on music purchases or widely varying levies on copying equipment and blank media. However, the Review reasoned that no such collections are necessary when implementing a copyright exception for format-shifting:

In August 2011, the government broadly accepted the recommendations of the Hargreaves Review. At the end of 2012, the government published &quot;Modernising Copyright&quot;, a document outlining specific changes the government intends to make, including the Hargreaves-recommended exception for private, noncommercial copying.

Following each milestone in the reform process, press reports circulated that ripping non-DRM-protected CDs and DVDs was no longer illegal. However, the actual legislation to implement the changes is not yet in force; the Intellectual Property Office had only begun seeking review of draft legislation in June 2013, and the resulting Statutory Instruments (SIs) were not laid out for Parliamentary approval until March 27, 2014, and were not actually approved until July 14 (Commons) and July 27 (Lords); with an effective date of October 1, 2014. Anticipating approval, the Intellectual Property Office published a guide for consumers to explain the forthcoming changes and to clarify what would remain illegal. The private copying exception may seem to conflict with the existing Copyright Directive prohibition on overriding or removing any DRM or TPM (technical protection measures) that are sometimes used on optical media to protect the content from ripping. However, the &quot;Modernising Copyright&quot; report makes clear that any workarounds to allow access will not involve a relaxation of the prohibition.

On 17 July 2015, the private copying exemption was overturned by the High Court of Justice following a complaint by BASCA, Musicians&#x27; Union, and UK Music, making private copying once again illegal. The groups objected to the exclusion of a compensation scheme, presenting evidence contradicting an assertion that an exemption would cause &quot;zero or insignificant harm&quot; to copyright holders and thus did not require compensation.

=== North America ===

====United States====
U.S. copyright law (Title 17 of the United States Code) generally says that making a copy of an original work, if conducted without the consent of the copyright owner, is infringement. The law makes no explicit grant or denial of a right to make a &quot;personal use&quot; copy of another&#x27;s copyrighted content on one&#x27;s own digital media and devices. For example, space shifting, by making a copy of a personally owned audio CD for transfer to an MP3 player for that person&#x27;s personal use, is not explicitly allowed or forbidden.

Existing copyright statutes &quot;may&quot; apply to specific acts of personal copying, as determined in cases in the civil or criminal court systems, building up a body of case law. Consumer copyright infringement cases in this area, to date, have only focused on issues related to consumer rights and the applicability of the law to the sharing of ripped files, not to the act of ripping, &quot;per se&quot;.

====Canada====
The Copyright Act of Canada generally says that it is legal to make a backup copy of any copyrighted work if the user owns or has a licence to use a copy of the work or subject-matter as long as the user does not circumvent a technological protection measure or give any of the reproductions away. This means that in most cases, ripping DVDs in Canada is most likely illegal.

=== Oceania ===

====Australia and New Zealand====
In Australia and New Zealand a copy of any legally purchased music may be made by its owner, as long as it is not distributed to others and its use remains personal. In Australia, this was extended in 2006 to also include photographs and films.

==Opinions of ripping==
Recording industry representatives have made conflicting statements about ripping.

Executives claimed (in the context of &quot;Atlantic v. Howell&quot;) that ripping must be regarded as copyright infringement. In oral arguments before the Supreme Court in &quot;MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.&quot;, MGM attorney Don Verrilli (later appointed United States Solicitor General by the Obama administration), stated: &quot;The record companies, my clients, have said, for some time now, and it&#x27;s been on their Website for some time now, that it&#x27;s perfectly lawful to take a CD that you&#x27;ve purchased, upload it onto your computer, put it onto your iPod. There is a very, very significant lawful commercial use for that device, going forward.&quot;

Nevertheless, in lawsuits against individuals accused of copyright infringement for making files available via file-sharing networks, RIAA lawyers and PR officials have characterized CD ripping as &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;stealing&quot;.

When asked directly about the issue, RIAA president Cary Sherman asserted that the lawyers misspoke, and that the RIAA has never said whether it was legal or illegal, emphasizing that the RIAA had not yet taken anyone to court over that issue alone.

===Fair use===

Although certain types of infringement scenarios are allowed as fair use and thus are effectively considered non-infringing, &quot;personal use&quot; copying is not explicitly mentioned as a type of fair use, and case law has not yet established otherwise.

===Personal copying acknowledgments===

According to Congressional reports, part of the Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA) of 1992 was intended to resolve the debate over home taping. However, 17 USC 1008, the relevant text of the legislation, did not fully indemnify consumers for noncommercial, private copying. Such copying is broadly permitted using analog devices and media, but digital copying is only permitted with certain technology like DAT, MiniDisc, and &quot;audio&quot; CD-R—not with computer hard drives, portable media players, and general-purpose CD-Rs.

The AHRA was partially tested in &quot;RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia, Inc.&quot;, a late-1990s case which broached the subject of a consumer&#x27;s right to copy and format-shift, but which ultimately only ascertained that one of the first portable MP3 players was not even a &quot;digital recording device&quot; covered by the law, so its maker was not required to pay royalties to the recording industry under other terms of the AHRA.

Statements made by the court in that case, and by both the House and Senate in committee reports about the AHRA, do interpret the legislation as being intended to permit private, noncommercial copying with any digital technology. However, these interpretations may not be binding.

In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a government office which requires business to engage in consumer-friendly trade practices, has acknowledged that consumers normally expect to be able to rip audio CDs. Specifically, in response to the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal, the FTC declared that the marketing and sale of audio CDs which surreptitiously installed digital rights management (DRM) software constituted deceptive and unfair trade practices, in part because the record company &quot;represented, expressly or by implication, that consumers will be able to use the CDs as they are commonly used on a computer: to listen to, transfer to playback devices, and copy the audio files contained on the CD for personal use.&quot;

== DVD ripping ==

A DVD ripper is a computer program that facilitates copying the content of a DVD to a hard disk drive. They are mainly used to transfer video on DVDs to different formats, to edit or back up DVD content, and to convert DVD video for playback on media players and mobile devices. Some DVD rippers include additional features such as Blu-ray support, DVD and Blu-ray Disc decryption, copy protection removal and the ability to make discs unrestricted and region-free. While some DVD rippers only convert video to highly compressed MP4 video files, there are other rippers that can convert DVDs to higher quality compressed video. These types of DVD rippers are used by the television and film industry to create broadcast quality video from DVD. Video ripped by these professional DVD rippers is an exact duplicate of the original DVD video.

=== Circumvention of DVD copy protection ===

In the case where media contents are protected using some &quot;effective&quot; copy protection scheme, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 makes it illegal to manufacture or distribute circumvention tools and use those tools for infringing purposes. In the 2009 case &quot;RealNetworks v. DVD CCA&quot;, the final injunction reads, &quot;while it may well be fair use for an individual consumer to store a backup copy of a personally owned DVD on that individual&#x27;s computer, a federal law has nonetheless made it illegal to manufacture or traffic in a device or tool that permits a consumer to make such copies.&quot; This case made clear that manufacturing and distribution of circumvention tools was illegal, but use of those tools for non-infringing purposes, including fair use purposes, was not.

The Library of Congress periodically issues rulings to exempt certain classes of works from the DMCA&#x27;s prohibition on the circumvention of copy protection for non-infringing purposes. One such ruling in 2010 declared, among other things, that the Content Scramble System (CSS) commonly employed on commercial DVDs could be circumvented to enable non-infringing uses of the DVD&#x27;s content. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) hailed the ruling as enabling DVD excerpts to be used for the well-established fair-use activities of criticism and commentary, and for the creation of derivative works by video remix artists. However, the text of the ruling says the exemption can only be exercised by professional educators and their students, not the general public.

=== Anti DVD-ripping efforts ===

All DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA)-licensed DVD player/burner manufacturers implement DVD CCA-mandated &quot;robustness&quot; and &quot;compliance&quot; rules on their products in an effort to restrict ripping. Some even go beyond that and implement additional features to restrict ripping, for example:
* RIPLOCK: some manufacturers put an artificial limit, or lock, on ripping speeds. Some of these drives have alternative 3rd-party firmware that have this removed to enable faster ripping.
* Bitsetting/Booktyping: this is a feature which makes DVD+Rs readable by older DVD players that can play DVD-ROMS only. Some manufacturers disable this feature on their drives. Again, some alternative 3rd-party firmware can enable this so that burned DVDs appear as DVD-ROMs and are playable by older DVD players.

<doc id="509078" wikidata="Q267956" url="?curid=509078" title="Atom (web standard)">
<text>The name Atom applies to a pair of related Web standards. The Atom Syndication Format is an XML language used for web feeds, while the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP) is a simple HTTP-based protocol for creating and updating web resources.

Web feeds allow software programs to check for updates published on a website. To provide a web feed, the site owner may use specialized software (such as a content management system) that publishes a list (or &quot;feed&quot;) of recent articles or content in a standardized, machine-readable format. The feed can then be downloaded by programs that use it, like websites that syndicate content from the feed, or by feed reader programs that allow internet users to subscribe to feeds and view their content.

A feed contains entries, which may be headlines, full-text articles, excerpts, summaries or links to content on a website along with various metadata.

The Atom format was developed as an alternative to RSS. Ben Trott, an advocate of the new format that became Atom, believed that RSS had limitations and flaws—such as lack of on-going innovation and its necessity to remain backward compatible—and that there were advantages to a fresh design.

Proponents of the new format formed the IETF Atom Publishing Format and Protocol Workgroup. The Atom Syndication Format was published as an IETF proposed standard in RFC 4287 (December 2005), and the Atom Publishing Protocol was published as RFC 5023 (October 2007).

==Usage==

The blogging community uses web feeds to share recent entries&#x27; headlines, full text, and even attached multimedia files. The providers allow other websites to incorporate a blog&#x27;s &quot;syndicated&quot; headline or headline-and-short-summary feeds under various usage agreements. people use Atom and other web-syndication formats for many purposes, including journalism, marketing, bug-reports, or any other activity involving periodic updates or publications. Atom also provides a standard way to export an entire blog, or parts of it, for backup or for importing into other blogging systems.

It is common to find web feeds on major websites, as well as on many smaller ones. Some websites let people choose between RSS- or Atom-formatted web feeds; others offer only RSS or only Atom. In particular, many blog and wiki sites offer their web feeds in the Atom format.

A feed reader or &quot;aggregator&quot; program can be used to check feeds and to display new articles. Client-side readers may also be designed as standalone programs or as extensions to existing programs like web browsers.

Web-based feed readers and news aggregators require no software installation and make the user&#x27;s &quot;feeds&quot; available on any computer with web access. Some aggregators syndicate (combine) web feeds into new feeds, e.g., taking all football-related items from several sports feeds and providing a new football feed.

==Atom compared to RSS 2.0==
When Atom emerged as a format intended to rival or replace RSS, CNET described the motivation of its creators as follows: &quot;Winer&#x27;s opponents are seeking a new format that would clarify RSS ambiguities, consolidate its multiple versions, expand its capabilities, and fall under the auspices of a traditional standards organization.&quot;

A brief description of some of the ways Atom 1.0 differs from RSS 2.0 has been given by Tim Bray, who played a major role in the creation of Atom:

===Date formats===

The RSS 2.0 specification relies on the use of formatted timestamps to communicate information about when items in the feed were created and last updated. The Atom working group chose instead to use timestamps formatted according to the rules specified by (which is a subset of ISO 8601; see Appendix A in RFC 3339 for differences).

===Internationalization===

While the RSS vocabulary has a mechanism to indicate a human language for the feed, there is no way to specify a language for individual items or text elements. Atom, on the other hand, uses the standard xml:lang attribute to make it possible to specify a language context for every piece of human-readable content in the feed.

Atom also differs from RSS in that it supports the use of Internationalized Resource Identifiers, which allow links to resources and unique identifiers to contain characters outside the US ASCII character set.

===Modularity===

The elements of the RSS vocabulary are not generally reusable in other XML vocabularies. The Atom syntax was specifically designed to allow elements to be reused outside the context of an Atom feed document. For instance, it is not uncommon to find atom:link elements being used within RSS 2.0 feeds.

==Barriers to adoption==
Despite the emergence of Atom as an IETF Proposed Standard and the decision by major companies such as Google to embrace Atom, use of the older and better-known RSS formats has continued. There are several reasons for this:

* RSS 2.0 support for enclosures led directly to the development of podcasting. While many podcasting applications support the use of Atom 1.0, RSS 2.0 remains the preferred format. While iTunes previously supported Atom, it dropped support in 2023. and requires podcasts to be in RSS 2.0 format.
* Many sites choose to publish their feeds in only a single format. For example, CNN and &quot;The New York Times&quot; offer their web feeds only in RSS 2.0 format.
* News articles about web syndication feeds have increasingly used the term &quot;RSS&quot; to refer generically to any of the several variants of the RSS format such as RSS 2.0 and RSS 1.0 as well as the Atom format.

==Development history==

===Background===
Before the creation of Atom the primary method of web content syndication was the RSS family of formats.

Members of the community who felt there were significant deficiencies with this family of formats were unable to make changes directly to RSS 2.0 because the official specification document stated that it was purposely frozen to ensure its stability.

===Initial work===
In June 2003, Sam Ruby set up a wiki to discuss what makes &quot;a well-formed log entry&quot;. This initial posting acted as a rallying point. People quickly started using the wiki to discuss a new syndication format to address the shortcomings of RSS. It also became clear that the new format could form the basis of a more robust replacement for blog editing protocols such as the Blogger API and LiveJournal XML-RPC Client/Server Protocol as well.

The project aimed to develop a web syndication format that was:
* &quot;100% vendor neutral,&quot;
* &quot;implemented by everybody,&quot;
* &quot;freely extensible by anybody, and&quot;
* &quot;cleanly and thoroughly specified.&quot;

In short order, a project road map was built. The effort quickly attracted more than 150 supporters, including David Sifry of Technorati, Mena Trott of Six Apart, Brad Fitzpatrick of LiveJournal, Jason Shellen of Blogger, Jeremy Zawodny of Yahoo, Timothy Appnel of the O&#x27;Reilly Network, Glenn Otis Brown of Creative Commons and Lawrence Lessig. Other notables supporting Atom include Mark Pilgrim, Tim Bray, Aaron Swartz, Joi Ito, and Jack Park. Also, Dave Winer, the key figure behind RSS 2.0, gave tentative support to the new endeavor.

After this point, discussion became chaotic, due to the lack of a decision-making process. The project also lacked a name, tentatively using &quot;Pie,&quot; &quot;Echo,&quot; &quot;Atom,&quot; and &quot;Whatever&quot; (PEAW) before settling on Atom. After releasing a project snapshot known as &quot;Atom 0.2&quot; in early July 2003, discussion was shifted off the wiki.

===Atom 0.3 and adoption by Google===
The discussion then moved to a newly set up mailing list. The next and final snapshot during this phase was &quot;Atom 0.3&quot;, released in December 2003. This version gained widespread adoption in syndication tools, and in particular it was added to several Google-related services, such as Blogger, Google News, and Gmail. Google&#x27;s Data APIs (Beta) GData are based on Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0.

===Atom 1.0 and IETF standardization===
In 2004, discussions began about moving the project to a standards body such as the World Wide Web Consortium or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The group eventually chose the IETF and the Atompub working group was formally set up in June 2004, finally giving the project a charter and process. The Atompub working group is co-chaired by Tim Bray (the co-editor of the XML specification) and Paul Hoffman. Initial development was focused on the syndication format.

The Atom Syndication Format was issued as a Proposed Standard in IETF in December 2005. The co-editors were Mark Nottingham and Robert Sayre. This document is known as &quot;atompub-format&quot; in IETF&#x27;s terminology. The Atom Publishing Protocol was issued as a Proposed Standard in IETF in October 2007. Two other drafts have not been standardized.

==Example of an Atom 1.0 feed==
An example of a document in the Atom Syndication Format:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;feed xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;

 &lt;title&gt;Example Feed&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;subtitle&gt;A subtitle.&lt;/subtitle&gt;
 &lt;link href=&quot;http://example.org/feed/&quot; rel=&quot;self&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;link href=&quot;http://example.org/&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;id&gt;urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b91C-0003939e0af6&lt;/id&gt;
 &lt;updated&gt;2003-12-13T18:30:02Z&lt;/updated&gt;
 
 &lt;entry&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link href=&quot;http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03.html&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;link rel=&quot;edit&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03/edit&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;id&gt;urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a&lt;/id&gt;
 &lt;published&gt;2003-11-09T17:23:02Z&lt;/published&gt;
 &lt;updated&gt;2003-12-13T18:30:02Z&lt;/updated&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Some text.&lt;/summary&gt;
 &lt;content type=&quot;xhtml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the entry content.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/content&gt;
 &lt;author&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;email&gt;johndoe@example.com&lt;/email&gt;
 &lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;/entry&gt;

&lt;/feed&gt;

===Including in HTML===
The following tag should be placed into the head of an HTML document to provide a link to an Atom feed.

&lt;link href=&quot;atom.xml&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; rel=&quot;alternate&quot; title=&quot;Sitewide Atom feed&quot; /&gt;

<doc id="509080" wikidata="Q2552898" url="?curid=509080" title="Kiwi (nickname)">
<text>&quot;Kiwi&quot; ( ) is a common self-reference used by New Zealanders, though it is also used internationally. The label is generally viewed as a symbol of pride and affection for most people of New Zealand, however there are New Zealanders, particularly some with Māori heritage, that find the appellation jarring and prefer not to identify with it. 

The name derives from the kiwi, a native flightless bird, which is a national symbol of New Zealand. Until the First World War, the kiwi represented the country and not the people; however, by 1917, New Zealanders were also being called &quot;Kiwis&quot;, supplanting other nicknames such as &quot;Enzedder&quot;.

==History==
The kiwi has long had a special significance for the indigenous Māori people, who used its skin and feathers to make feather cloaks () for chiefs. The bird first came to European attention in 1811 when a skin ended up in the hands of a British Museum zoologist, George Shaw, who classified it as a type of penguin and portrayed it as standing upright. After early sightings by Europeans the kiwi was regarded as a curiosity; in 1835 the missionary William Yate described it as &quot;the most remarkable and curious bird in New Zealand&quot;.

=== Representing the country ===
In the early 1900s, cartoonists began to use the kiwi as a representation of New Zealand. For example, in a 1904 &quot;New Zealand Free Lance&quot; cartoon a plucky kiwi is shown growing to a moa after a rugby victory of 9–3 over a British team. The next year, &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; printed a cartoon of a kiwi and a kangaroo (representing Australia) going off to a colonial conference. Trevor Lloyd, who worked for &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, also used a kiwi to represent the All Blacks rugby team, but he more often drew a moa. Other symbols for New Zealand at this time included the silver fern, a small boy, and a young lion cub. Until the First World War, the kiwi was used as a symbol of the country rather than the people of New Zealand.

===Representing the people===

In the early-20th century, New Zealanders, especially soldiers and All Blacks players, were referred to internationally as &quot;&quot; (derived from the initials of the country&#x27;s name, N.Z.) or &quot;Maorilanders&quot; (in reference to the Māori people and their historical contribution to the country). These terms were still being used near the end of the First World War of 1914–18. However, although New Zealand soldiers were often described as &quot;Diggers&quot; or as &quot;Pig Islanders&quot;, by 1917 they were also being called &quot;Kiwis&quot;.

The image of the kiwi had appeared on military badges since the South Canterbury Battalion used it in 1886, and several regiments took it up in the First World War. &quot;Kiwis&quot; came to mean the men of New Zealand regiments. The nickname is not thought to have originated as a reference to the physical attributes of the New Zealand servicemen (i.e. implying they were short and stocky or nocturnal like the bird). It was simply that the kiwi was distinct and unique to the country. Its prominent use on the New Zealand regiments&#x27; insignia also made for easy association. The nickname eventually became common usage in all war theatres. 

After the end of the First World War in November 1918, many New Zealand troops stayed in Europe for months or years awaiting transport home. At Sling Camp, near Bulford on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, New Zealand soldiers carved a chalk kiwi into the nearby hill in early 1919. The New Zealanders&#x27; presence popularised the nickname within Europe.
An Australian boot polish called &quot;Kiwi&quot; was widely used in the imperial forces. William Ramsay, a developer of the product, named the polish in honour of his wife&#x27;s birthplace, New Zealand. Beginning in 1906, Kiwi Shoe Polish eventually became widely sold in the UK and the US, and the symbol became more widely known. &quot;The Australian National Dictionary&quot; also gives the first use of the term &quot;Kiwi Kids&quot; and &quot;Kiwis&quot; in 1917, to mean Australian army recruits who had &quot;kiwied up&quot;; in other words, they had highly-polished boots.

Following the Second World War of 1939–1945 the term gradually became attributed to all New Zealanders, and today throughout the world they are referred to as Kiwis, as well as often referring to themselves that way.

==Current usage==
Spelling of the word &quot;Kiwi&quot;, when used as a nickname for the people, is often capitalised. The bird&#x27;s name is spelled with a lower-case &quot;k&quot; and, being a word of Māori origin, normally stays as &quot;kiwi&quot; when pluralised. As an English word, the nickname normally takes the plural form &quot;Kiwis&quot;. Thus, &quot;two Kiwis&quot; refers to two people, whereas &quot;two kiwi&quot; refers to two birds. This linguistic nicety is exemplified by the conservation trust Save the Kiwi, which used the slogan &quot;Kiwis for kiwi&quot;. In 2020, Kiwibank shifted to using the plural form &quot;Kiwi&quot; (capitalised but without the terminal &quot;-s&quot;) to refer to the people, most prominently changing its slogan from &quot;Kiwis making Kiwis better off&quot; to &quot;Kiwi making Kiwi better off&quot;.

Kiwi is not generally considered to be a derogatory term, but there are New Zealanders, particularly some with Māori heritage, who find the appellation jarring and prefer not to identify with it. In 2018, a South Australian employment tribunal ruled that the nickname was not discriminatory, after a New Zealander unsuccessfully argued that she was a victim of racial discrimination after being labelled a &quot;Kiwi&quot;. 

In an official context, the term &quot;kiwi&quot; has been used in the name of government services and state-owned enterprises, such as Kiwibank, KiwiSaver, and KiwiRail, and is frequently used in government press releases to refer to everyone in or of New Zealand. In August 2022, Minister of Immigration Michael Wood referred to 85,000 holders of recently approved New Zealand 2021 resident visas as &quot;new Kiwis&quot;.

<text>A pyramidal number is the number of points in a pyramid with a polygonal base and triangular sides. The term often refers to square pyramidal numbers, which have a square base with four sides, but it can also refer to a pyramid with any number of sides. The numbers of points in the base and in layers parallel to the base are given by polygonal numbers of the given number of sides, while the numbers of points in each triangular side is given by a triangular number. It is possible to extend the pyramidal numbers to higher dimensions.

<text>Perushtitsa ( ) or Perushtitza is a Bulgarian town located in Perushtitsa Municipality, Plovdiv Province at the foot of the Rhodopes, 22 kilometers south of Plovdiv.

The name &quot;Perushtitsa&quot; comes from the word &quot;Peristitsa&quot;, which in turn comes from the name of the God Perun.

The town is famous throughout Bulgaria for the fight that took place there in 1876 during the April Uprising against the Ottoman reign. During the suppression of the uprising by Turkish irregulars, the majority of the residents were slaughtered. The French journalist Ivan de Woestyne, who visited the town in July 1876, reported for the newspaper Le Figaro that out of a population of about 2000 only 150 elders and children were left. Lady Strangford arrived from Britain later that year with relief for the people of Bulgaria following the massacres. She built a hospital at Batak and later other hospitals were built including at Perushtitsa.

Perushtitsa is one of the few places in Bulgaria where Mavrud grapes are grown for a typical Bulgarian wine Mavrud.

The remains of the Red Church date from the 5th or 6th century and are a symbol for the city of Perushtitsa. They are located 2 km northeast of Perushtitsa.

There is a multi functional sports complex &quot;Perushtitsa&quot; (at coordinates 42.061396,24553302) which can be used for 14 sports - basketball, handball, volleyball, football, badminton, table tennis, body building, and others.

<text>Tornado, also called Upper Falls, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States.

Four agencies of the United States government determine the official name of the community. The United States Postal Service established the Upper Falls of Coal Post Office in 1851, then replaced it with the Tornado Post Office in 1881 and today delivers mail within ZIP Code 25202 addressed to either Tornado or Upper Falls. The United States Board on Geographic Names authenticated the name of the community as Tornado in 1980, changed it to Upper Falls in 2010 and back to Tornado in 2013. After approving the replacement of the Tornado CDP with the much larger Upper Falls CDP in 2010, the Kanawha County Commission decided in 2013 that residents of the community supported the name Tornado over Upper Falls and requested that the name be changed back. The United States Census Bureau originated the Tornado CDP in 1990, changed to the Upper Falls CDP in 2010 and then to the Tornado CDP for 2020. The United States National Geodetic Survey maintains a bench mark in the community named Upper Falls, which has never changed.

The 2000 Tornado CDP had a population of 1,111 and a total area of . The 2010 Upper Falls CDP, which was much larger, had a population of 3,701 and a total area of , making it the largest CDP in West Virginia by area. The 2020 Tornado CDP is again much smaller, with a population of 1,081 and a total area of .

The adjacent Coal River gives the community its historical name from the cascading waters of its Upper Falls.
==Geography==
Tornado is located at (38.342778, −81.844167).

== History ==
The Upper Falls of the Coal River was discovered in 1742 by John Peter Salling during an expedition along the Coal River. Salling and four companions each received a governor&#x27;s commission from the state of Virginia to explore the territory east of the Mississippi River, in return for land grants. It was this group that also discovered coal along the banks of the Coal River.

It was not until after the Revolutionary War that European settlers began moving into the area. Even then, the few who survived the attacks of the native peoples usually fled to safer destinations. But by around 1800, a gristmill was established by Joseph Thomas at the Upper Falls which continued in operation until the 1930s.

Beginning about 1830, timber harvested from the region was floated on the Coal River to Saint Albans. At the same time, great quantities of marketable cannel coal were found on the upper Coal River. However, only at periods of high water could logs and shallow wooden boats loaded with coal be drifted over the Upper Falls and Lower Falls and on down the river.

A system of wooden-crib locks and dams designed to make Coal River navigable was constructed in the 1850s to transport cannel coal, bituminous coal, coal oil and timber to market. This began the era of two-way commercial steamboat traffic on the river. The Upper Falls was the site of Upper Falls Lock and Dam, and Edward Kenna, who also developed a sawmill at the Upper Falls around 1850, was lockmaster; his son, John Edward Kenna, later served as U.S. senator from West Virginia. Damage caused by ongoing flooding and the outbreak of the Civil War suspended steam tug navigation of Coal River. Traffic resumed after the war, but ended permanently in 1881.

From 1858, at least ten failed attempts were made to build a rail line up the Coal River. Finally, under the direction of General Cornelius Clarkson Watts, a Confederate veteran, construction of the Coal River and Western Railway began in 1902 and was completed in 1904. The lasting economic boom brought by the railroad to the region saw the bustling Upper Falls Station offer daily service for both passengers and freight. Timber extraction largely ended in the 1920s, but the rail line, now owned by CSX Transportation, still transports massive amounts of bituminous coal to global markets.

There was a rapid influx of people to the area during and soon after World War II, and many came to live in Tornado. They found employment in the defense and chemical manufacturing industries in the Kanawha Valley and benefited from economic prosperity as a result. Today, the community is a residential suburb and recreation destination of the Charleston metropolitan area.

== Post offices ==
The Upper Falls of Coal Post Office, the first to serve the area, was established in 1851. During Reconstruction, it was replaced by a post office named Tornado in 1881.

Today, residents who receive mail at ZIP Code 25177 use the city name St. Albans, while those at ZIP Code 25202 use either Tornado or Upper Falls, with both names in general use.

== Other names ==
Since the earliest European settlers moved into the region in the 1700s, the community was also known as Upper Falls of Coal River.

Andrews Heights is an area named for landowner R. Carl Andrews, who served as mayor of Charleston from 1947 to 1950 and was a Democratic candidate for governor of West Virginia in 1940. Andrews Heights Elementary School is named for Mayor Andrews.

During its history, transportation infrastructure serving the community has included highway, rail and river transport.

=== Highway ===
The primary means of transportation throughout the CDP today is by secondary highways.

====2020 census====

The 2020 Tornado CDP is much smaller than the 2010 Upper Falls CDP.

In a clockwise direction on the map, Coal River Road (Kanawha County Highway 3) intersects the northern boundary of Tornado at Browns Creek and (CH 9/1) crosses the southern border at the Lincoln County line. Falls Creek Road (CH 3) also intersects the southern boundary at the Lincoln County line.

====2010 census====

The 2010 Upper Falls CDP was much larger than the 2020 Tornado CDP.

In a clockwise direction on the map, Coal River Road (Kanawha County Highway 3) intersected the northern boundary of Upper Falls at Tear Drop Lane (private). Dogwood Road (CH 6/6) crossed the northern border at the Armstrong Tunnel. Smith Creek Road (CH 9) demarcated the CDP to the east at Dry Ridge Road (CH 8). Coal River Road (CH 9/1) crossed the southern border at the Lincoln County line. Falls Creek Road (CH 3) intersected the southern boundary at the Lincoln County line, as well. Woods Drive (CH 1/3) crossed to the west at the Putnam County line. Finally, Browns Creek Road (CH 1) delimited the CDP at the intersection of Bryants Branch Road (CH 3/3) to the north.

=== Rail ===
The Coal River subdivision, a CSX Transportation main line, runs essentially parallel to the river on its east side and is used primarily to transport coal from the Southern West Virginia coalfields to global markets. There was once a railroad station in the community named &quot;Upper Falls Station.&quot;

=== River ===
The Coal River is still designated by the federal government as a navigable waterway, though the 19th century system of locks and dams that made commercial transportation possible no longer exists.

<doc id="509096" wikidata="Q5235191" url="?curid=509096" title="David Hoyle (performance artist)">
<text>David Hoyle (born 19 September 1962) is an English performance artist, avant-garde cabaret artist, singer, actor, comedian and film director. His performances are known to combine many disparate elements, from satirical comedy to painting, surrealism and even striptease, much of which is aggressive comedy in nature. Hoyle&#x27;s work has often focused on themes in the LGBTQ community, attacking what he sees as dominant trends in &quot;bourgeois Britain and the materialistic-hedonistic gay scene&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; his performances have led him to become &quot;something of a legend&quot; on the London cabaret circuit.

Born into a lower-middle-class background in Layton, Blackpool, Lancashire, Hoyle was heavily bullied for his homosexuality as a child, leading to a mental breakdown aged fourteen. He began performing at a local working men&#x27;s club before moving to London and then Manchester. It was here that he began performing at gay clubs in the city in the early 1990s, eventually developing the character known as The Divine David, an &quot;anti-drag queen&quot; who combined &quot;lacerating social commentary&quot; with &quot;breathtaking instances of self-recrimination and even self-harm.&quot; Eventually taking his character to television, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Nation&quot; (1998) and produced two shows for Channel 4, &quot;The Divine David Presents&quot; (1998) and then &quot;The Divine David Heals&quot; (2000). That year, he decided to bring an end to The Divine David character, performing a farewell show at Streatham Ice Arena entitled &quot;The Divine David on Ice&quot;.

Retreating from his public appearances, Hoyle returned to his home in Manchester where he suffered from a mental breakdown that lasted several years. In 2005 he returned to television, appearing as the character Doug Rocket on Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, and the next year he returned to the stage, performing as himself in a show entitled &quot;David Hoyle&#x27;s SOS&quot;. Over the next few years he continued with a string of shows, most of which were held at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London, and which included &quot;Magazine&quot; (2007), &quot;Dave&#x27;s Drop-In&quot; (2009), &quot;Licking Wounds&quot; (2010) and &quot;Lives&quot; (2011). In 2010 he also released his own feature film, &quot;Uncle David&quot;, in which he both directed and starred.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1963–1989===

Hoyle found it difficult growing up as a homosexual in Blackpool, later telling a reporter from &quot;The Times&quot; that people found out about his sexuality whilst at secondary school. He was subsequently bullied, and felt that going to school was &quot;like walking to your death on a daily basis. Knowing that you were going to get assaulted, knowing that you didn&#x27;t have anybody to talk to.&quot; Although the teachers knew of the bullying that he faced, they did nothing to stop it, believing that &quot;by subjecting me to violence it would make me heterosexual.&quot; The stress led him to suffer a mental breakdown when he was fourteen, although the doctors who treated him &quot;pathologised my natural behaviour and tried to give me tablets for it&quot;, something which he thought caused him even greater suffering.

Hoyle&#x27;s family were Anglican, and he sang in the local church choir, however he had a problem with those Christians who were &quot;very quick to seize on the Bible to condemn you&quot;. His parents recognised his sexuality, but had difficulty accepting it, although Hoyle has remarked that they did so out of &quot;kindness and concern&quot; for how he would develop as an adult. Hoyle gained some relief from the persecution he faced however by visiting the comedians and performers that used to appear at Blackpool every summer, such as Ken Dodd and Dorothy Squires, and he particularly adored the circus, later relating that &quot;I thought its performers were the most glamorous people. Beyond beautiful.&quot;

It was when he was seventeen that he first went out on to the gay scene, but was put off when the first thing that anyone said to him was &quot;you&#x27;re not fuckable.&quot; It was around the same time that he began performing in the Belle Vue, a pub in Blackpool, where he did comedy routines whilst in the character of Paul Munnery-Vain (the name being a pun on pulmonary vein), the illegitimate offspring of the Duke of Edinburgh and Dorothy Squires. He found that many of the punters enjoyed his performances, although was unnerved that some of them made sexual advances toward him.

Aged twenty-one, he then left Blackpool and moved south to London, where he began to actively socialise in the city&#x27;s gay scene. Here he temporarily gained a job playing the role of hunchbacked butler Riff-Raff in a stage production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, although was forced to quit when his alcohol and illegal drug intake got out of control. He would later comment that in London during these years he had &quot;a lovely time. It was like going out for a night and it carried on for three years.&quot; However, it was during the 1980s that the HIV/AIDS epidemic hit the gay population and with little education or medical treatments, several of his friends&#x27; contracted and died of the virus; &quot;people started to drop like flies. In our early twenties, we were losing our friends similarly to people of pension age.&quot; Partly because of the epidemic, Hoyle decided to leave London, moving back up north and settling down in Manchester.

===The Divine David: 1990–2000===
David Hoyle first came to prominence through the clubbing scene around Manchester&#x27;s Gay Village in the early 1990s, when club nights introduced performance elements to add to their experience. Hoyle was the host and compere at Manchester&#x27;s Paradise Factory nightclub, and was also involved in the early days of the superclub Manumission, when it started as a club night in Manchester. He came to the notice of a London audience via his weekly performances at Duckie, from 1995 onwards. Soon after, Louise Gray published the first national press interview with Hoyle (&#x27;David versus Goliath&#x27;, 29 November 1996). He also performed at the Queer Up North festival and the Leeds conceptual art club &#x27;Freakshow&#x27;. Hoyle began appearing as a character whom he called &#x27;The Divine David&#x27;, which would later be described by reporter Ben Walters as &quot;a sort of anti-drag act caustically lamenting the narcissism of the gay mainstream... through song, dance, painting and whatever else took his fancy.&quot; Other elements of his performance included pole dancing, mural painting and even striptease. Meanwhile, Hoyle had begun indulging in large quantities of alcohol and illegal drugs, leading to a &quot;lot of near-death experiences&quot;.
Aside from his performances as the Divine David, Hoyle also acted in various other roles; in 1998, he appeared prominently in the music video for Faith No More&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Started a Joke&quot;, whilst that same year, he also appeared as a cameo in Todd Haynes&#x27;s film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; playing Freddi, a member of Brian Slade&#x27;s entourage.

Hoyle appeared regularly as The Divine David in the BBC&#x27;s sketch show &quot;Comedy Nation&quot; (1998) and achieved national prominence with his 1998 arts TV show &quot;The Divine David Presents&quot; on Channel 4, also under his stage persona. This was followed a year later by the series &quot;The Divine David Heals&quot;.

In 2000, Hoyle publicly killed off the Divine David in a show entitled &quot;The Divine David on Ice&quot; which was held at Streatham Ice Rink in London; at the end of the show, the character died to the soundtrack David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;. Commenting on the reason for killing off The Divine David, Hoyle would relate that:

:In a way the Divine David became the patron saint of decadence and nihilism and all the rest of it, and it&#x27;s hard for that not to affect your own actions... As much as I used to say, &quot;Oh yes, you have to be very sure of your identity to be doing all this business,&quot; I don&#x27;t think I actually was. If you&#x27;re used to creating aliases and camouflage and all that sort of palaver, eventually you have to peel it all away and work out who you are.

Temporarily abandoning his career and retreating to his Manchester home, he spent several years in a period of reflection, later relating that he spent much of this time simply staring at his wallpaper, &quot;just rocking to and fro, you know, the days merging, the seasons coming and going.&quot; Suffering a nervous breakdown, Hoyle gained most of his satisfaction from helping out his neighbours at their local housing association-backed communal garden, finding that being amongst plants aided his mental recovery.

===&quot;Nathan Barley&quot; and a return to the stage: 2005–2008===

Emerging from five years as a recluse, in 2005 Hoyle appeared in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, written by television satirists and comedians Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris. In &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, which only ran for one series, Hoyle played an ageing popstar named Doug Rocket, a founding member of a band named The Veryphonics (thereby being a parody of David A. Stewart, the founding member of 1980s synthpop band Eurythmics).

In 2006 he finally returned to the stage, taking part in the &quot;It&#x27;s Queer Up North&quot; festival, during which he constructed a garden inside Manchester&#x27;s Contact Theatre. His garden project was a success, with the run having to be extended to meet demand. In June of that year he also appeared in a one-off informal show at Bush Hall, London, entitled &quot;When David met Justin&quot; and during which he chatted and shared music with transgender American cabaret performer Justin Bond.

He subsequently met theatre director Sarah Frankcom, who helped him to produce a show known as &quot;David Hoyle&#x27;s SOS&quot;, which toured the UK in 2006. Considering it to be his most autobiographical show to date, Hoyle told a reporter that it was inspired by his childhood growing up in Blackpool, commenting that &quot;you&#x27;ve got all that showbusiness seaside stuff going on&quot; in it.

In 2007, Hoyle launched a new ten-part show at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London, produced by fellow avant-garde performer Duckie, entitled &quot;Magazine&quot;. Each week, Hoyle would deal with a different subject, examining such topics as immigration, crime and punishment, dogging, HIV/AIDS, women&#x27;s issues and alcoholism. In doing so he hoped that he could get his audience thinking about intellectual topics, stating that &quot;All I can provide with &quot;Magazine&quot; is a microcosm of a macrocosm... But at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern the truth will be revealed and it will be a shared experience and there will be a mass lifting of consciousness. That&#x27;s all I can say.&quot; For the performance dealing with HIV/AIDS, Hoyle screened a short film of his own HIV test that was taken earlier that day, the first which he had had in twenty years. The result came out negative, but as reporter Lyn Gardner remarked, &quot;had it been positive, I am certain he would still have shown us the clip.&quot; That same year, Hoyle also worked with the experimental theatre troupe Victoria.

===Continuing stage work and the Avant Garde Alliance: 2009===

In 2009, Hoyle also opened a new show named &quot;Dave&#x27;s Drop-in Centre&quot; at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London. Describing the show to a reporter, he commented that it was &quot;loosely inspired by a psychiatric daycare centre, and all the activities that go on, from occupational therapy to hobbies to empowerment, group catharsis.&quot; Spread over a series of six Thursday nights, in each show Hoyle collaborated with a different performer to explore a variety of topics; for instance with burlesque comedian Fancy Chance he dealt with nationalism and immigration whilst with Dickie Beau he looked into the theme of childhood.

In October–November 2009, Hoyle presented a piece of performance art at London&#x27;s Chelsea Theatre as a part of their SACRED season. Entitled &quot;Theatre of Therapy&quot; and directed by Nathan Evans, it involved Hoyle interviewing audience members whilst sitting on a couch that once belonged to pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) when the latter had lived in Hampstead, North London. Describing the use of such an artefact, Hoyle told a journalist that &quot;The couch will be electrically charged with the vibration of Freud&#x27;s voice. I plan to have a relationship with it.&quot;

In 2009, Hoyle publicly proclaimed that he was intending to stand for election as a member of parliament in the Vauxhall constituency in south London. Standing as a representative of the Avant-Garde Alliance Party, he proclaimed that, should he come into power, he would advocate killing local priests and other authority figures to bring about &quot;a new way, a new way of being, a new way of living, a new way of responding. No longer are we going to look to others to tell us how to be.&quot; These &quot;pseudo-faux-adult parental figures&quot;, Hoyle claimed, &quot;have had a jolly good run for their money and it&#x27;s now time for them to fuck off&quot;. He further went on to advocate polygamy and encouraged more sex (including &quot;inter-species love [and] inter-generational sex&quot;), believing that it would cut crime rates. Furthermore, he argued for an overhaul of the workplace system, encouraging people to adopt a &quot;spiritual dimension&quot; to their jobs, and called for the abolition of the arms trade, with weapons factories being converted into social housing.

===&quot;Uncle David&quot; and further stage work: 2010–present===
In 2010, Hoyle premiered his first feature film, &quot;Uncle David&quot;, which he had both directed and starred in, at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. Set in and around a caravan park in the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, &quot;Uncle David&quot; featured Hoyle in the title role as a man living with his adolescent nephew (played by Ashley Ryder, a &quot;boyish porn actor&quot; who had collaborated with Hoyle in some of his stage shows). The film explored the relationship between the two characters, with the action unfolding over a couple of days, with one reviewer writing that &quot;Suspense and dread accumulate as the low-key naturalism and the characters&#x27; obvious affection for one another play-off against the enormity of what looms ahead.&quot; In November of that year, Hoyle and Ryder were awarded a shared Best Actor Award for their roles in the film at Chéries-Chéris, Paris Gay, Lesbian, Trans, Film Festival. Meanwhile, in December of that year he filmed a special Christmas message for the socially liberal newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In the run up the 2010 United Kingdom general election Hoyle announced his support for fellow queer-identified figure David Joseph Henry running against Hazel Blears in Salford and Eccles (UK Parliament constituency) by hosting the &quot;Hazel Must Go&quot; campaign&#x27;s Launch Party standing for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

In August 2011, Hoyle produced his first musical show, &quot;Unplugged&quot;, at London&#x27;s Soho Theatre, during which he sang a medley of songs, some of which were covers and others which were his own creation. Directed by regular Hoyle collaborator Nathan Evans, the music was directed by Michael Roulston, and included a series of songs that had a &quot;personal connection&quot; to him; covers of Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s &quot;Hurt&quot;, New Order&#x27;s &quot;True Faith&quot;, Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;You Made Me Love You (I Didn&#x27;t Want to Do It)&quot;, Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Losing My Mind&quot; and Tony Christie&#x27;s &quot;How Can I Entertain?&quot;, as well as a new song, &quot;A Return to Trauma&quot;. Journalist Paul Vale of &quot;The Stage&quot; noted that it was &quot;something of a departure&quot; from Hoyle&#x27;s earlier work, and that he was &quot;almost sanitised&quot; in his behaviour, providing &quot;a healthy dialogue with his audience&quot;, discussing his &quot;progressive views on education and a tongue-in-cheek dissection of avant-garde performance art, but mostly the chit-chat is either friendly or amiably abusive.&quot; Whilst noting that &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s anecdotes and wit were in full flow from the start&quot;, the reporter Jamie Fisher of the &quot;Pink Paper&quot; was more critical, noting that many would be &quot;put off by his reliance on lavatorial humour and random avant-garde style&quot;, believing that he was destined to appeal &quot;to a cult audience only&quot;.

In December 2012 Hoyle returned to the Soho Theatre with a stage show collection of songs written with Richard Thomas, covering a variety of topics raging from &#x27;Gays in the Military&#x27; to the scandals of the BBC over the ages. &quot;Merrie Hell&quot; covers the dark side of the Christmas holidays set against melodies disjointed from the reality of subject covered within the show, with Thomas, who scored Jerry Springer: The Opera, helping bring levity alongside reflection and filthy humour.

==Personal life==
A fierce and vocal supporter of LGBTQ rights, Hoyle has publicly stated that should he ever be in a position of political power, &quot;I would remove anyone who&#x27;s vaguely homophobic to a concentration camp outside the M25, where they could keep each other company until such time as it was deemed appropriate for them to be dispatched.&quot; Nonetheless, Hoyle remains highly critical of the mainstream gay culture in Britain, believing it to be &quot;off-the-peg&quot; and generic, and describing it as &quot;the biggest suicide cult in history&quot;. In his work he has attempted to fight against the idea that gay people are, &quot;not socialist, not political, not left-field, just as pathetic and ridiculous as anybody else, that we couldn&#x27;t give a fuck about anything as long as we can listen to Kylie and go shopping.&quot;

Hoyle suffers from mental breakdowns, something which he blames on his abusive childhood. He often raises the issue of mental health in his performances, relating that, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the last great taboos. People who would rush to help someone with a broken leg run away when someone has a mental health problem.&quot; Hoyle is also a painter, often reflecting his own life in his work; one of his works was for instance titled, &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m David and 48 and Returning to Psychiatric Help Which is in the Public Interest&quot;. His character, Doug Rocket in &quot;Nathan Barley&quot; mentions nervous breakdowns when talking about the fictional group The Veryphonicsmentions. Rocket says, &quot;It induced the first of many nervous breakdowns, all of which I&#x27;ve chosen to ignore.&quot;

<text>Citizens for Blank Votes () is a Spanish political party.

In Spanish electoral law, a distinction is made between valid votes, blank votes () and null votes. Blank votes are interpreted as correctly executed votes for &quot;none of the above&quot;, and consistently about 2% of votes are blank. Voting &quot;blank&quot; is not the same thing as abstaining, and so it has been argued that blank votes should be recognized as legitimate by apportioning empty seats in representative bodies according to the number of blank votes. Abstainers, the argument continues, exclude themselves from the democratic process and so need not be recognized in this way.

The platform of Ciudadanos En Blanco is that, if elected, their candidates will leave their seats vacant, until such time as the Spanish electoral law is reformed to recognize blank votes in the manner described above.
At that point, the party will have no more reason to exist.

The party&#x27;s slogan is (Do not vote &quot;en blanco&quot;, vote for Citizens &quot;En Blanco&quot;).

<text>Another Democracy is Possible () was a Spanish activist group (2003~2006), advocating for more democracy (fair electoral systems, participative and direct democracy, popular initiatives, and so on).

It carried out several Trojan activities; for instance, it took part of national, regional and local polls as an extraparliamentary Spanish political party. It never asked for votes; rather, it promoted its activist message by including its shocking logo into the electoral ballots and getting media visibility.

<doc id="509120" wikidata="Q975166" url="?curid=509120" title="Tetrahedral number">
<text>A tetrahedral number, or triangular pyramidal number, is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides, called a tetrahedron. The th tetrahedral number, , is the sum of the first triangular numbers, that is,

:formula_1

The tetrahedral numbers are:

:1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, ... 

== Formula ==
The formula for the th tetrahedral number is represented by the 3rd rising factorial of divided by the factorial of 3:
:formula_2

The tetrahedral numbers can also be represented as binomial coefficients:
:formula_3
Tetrahedral numbers can therefore be found in the fourth position either from left or right in Pascal&#x27;s triangle.

===Proofs of formula===
This proof uses the fact that the th triangular number is given by
:formula_4
It proceeds by induction.

;Base case
:formula_5

;Inductive step
:formula_6

The formula can also be proved by Gosper&#x27;s algorithm.

===Recursive relation===
Tetrahedral and triangular numbers are related through the recursive formulas

:formula_7

The equation formula_8 becomes

:formula_9

Substituting formula_10 for formula_11 in equation formula_8

:formula_13

Thus, the formula_11th tetrahedral number satisfies the following recursive equation

:formula_15

==Generalization==

The pattern found for triangular numbers formula_16 and for tetrahedral numbers formula_17 can be generalized. This leads to the formula:
formula_18
== Geometric interpretation ==

Tetrahedral numbers can be modelled by stacking spheres. For example, the fifth tetrahedral number () can be modelled with 35 billiard balls and the standard triangular billiards ball frame that holds 15 balls in place. Then 10 more balls are stacked on top of those, then another 6, then another three and one ball at the top completes the tetrahedron.

When order- tetrahedra built from spheres are used as a unit, it can be shown that a space tiling with such units can achieve a densest sphere packing as long as .

==Tetrahedral roots and tests for tetrahedral numbers==
By analogy with the cube root of , one can define the (real) tetrahedral root of as the number such that :
formula_19

which follows from Cardano&#x27;s formula. Equivalently, if the real tetrahedral root of is an integer, is the th tetrahedral number.

*:, sum of odd squares.
*:, sum of even squares.
*A. J. Meyl proved in 1878 that only three tetrahedral numbers are also perfect squares, namely:
*:
*Sir Frederick Pollock conjectured that every positive integer is the sum of at most 5 tetrahedral numbers: see Pollock tetrahedral numbers conjecture.
* The only tetrahedral number that is also a square pyramidal number is 1 (Beukers, 1988), and the only tetrahedral number that is also a perfect cube is 1.
* The infinite sum of tetrahedral numbers&#x27; reciprocals is , which can be derived using telescoping series:
*:formula_20
* The parity of tetrahedral numbers follows the repeating pattern odd-even-even-even.
*An observation of tetrahedral numbers:
*Numbers that are both triangular and tetrahedral must satisfy the binomial coefficient equation:
*:formula_21

: The only numbers that are both tetrahedral and triangular numbers are :

 is the total number of gifts &quot;my true love sent to me&quot; during the course of all 12 verses of the carol, &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. The cumulative total number of gifts after each verse is also for verse &quot;n&quot;.

The number of possible KeyForge three-house combinations is also a tetrahedral number, where is the number of houses.

<text>Greg Gilmore (born January 3, 1962) is a French born-American drummer in Seattle, Washington, and co-founder of the recording label First World Music.

== Biography ==
Although born in France, Gilmore grew up in the Seattle area. After playing in 10 Minute Warning with Duff McKagan (The Fartz, Guns N&#x27; Roses), Steve Verwolf, Paul Dana, Bob Groves, and David Garrigues, Gilmore decided to join his friend Duff McKagan when he announced he was leaving Seattle for a new life in L.A, and accompanied him in his early auditions. Shortly after the success of Guns N&#x27; Roses, he moved back to Seattle and in the late 1980s Gilmore was a member of the critically acclaimed, seminal Seattle band Mother Love Bone along with bandmates Andrew Wood (vocals), Bruce Fairweather (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), and Stone Gossard (guitar). After Wood&#x27;s death from a heroin overdose, Ament and Gossard went on to play key roles in Pearl Jam.

Gilmore went on to collaborate with Seattle engineer and producer Jack Endino, with whom he would release &quot;Angle of Attack&quot; (1990) and &quot;Endino&#x27;s Earthworm&quot; (1992). In the ensuing years, Gilmore would collaborate with a wide variety of musicians on releases such as: Land&#x27;s &quot;Archipelago&quot; (1997) and Doghead&#x27;s eponymous 1996 release. In the liner notes of &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; (1996), Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil credits Gilmore with &quot;inspiration&quot; for the song &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot;.

1999 saw the release of the eponymous debut album by Radio Chongqing, which Gilmore recorded with bandmates Lesli Dalaba (trumpet) and George Soler (stick).

As of 2007 he has been playing with Steve Fisk and working on several other recording projects.

<text>Aaron Temkin Beck (July 18, 1921November 1, 2021) was an American psychiatrist who was a professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. He is regarded as the father of cognitive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). His pioneering methods are widely used in the treatment of clinical depression and various anxiety disorders. Beck also developed self-report measures for depression and anxiety, notably the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which became one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. In 1994 he and his daughter, psychologist Judith S. Beck, founded the nonprofit Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, which provides CBT treatment and training, as well as research. Beck served as President Emeritus of the organization up until his death.

Beck was noted for his writings on psychotherapy, psychopathology, suicide, and psychometrics. He published more than 600 professional journal articles, and authored or co-authored 25 books. He was named one of the &quot;Americans in history who shaped the face of American psychiatry&quot;, and one of the &quot;five most influential psychotherapists of all time&quot; by &quot;The American Psychologist&quot; in July 1989. His work at the University of Pennsylvania inspired Martin Seligman to refine his own cognitive techniques and later work on learned helplessness.

==Early life and education==
Aaron Temkin Beck was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on July 18, 1921. He was the youngest of four children born to Elizabeth Temkin and Harry Beck, Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. Harry worked as a printer and Elizabeth&#x27;s family found financial success in tobacco wholesaling; the family belonged to the upwardly-mobile vanguard of Providence&#x27;s Eastern European-Jewish immigrant community. At the time of Aaron&#x27;s birth, the Temkin-Becks lived a &quot;comfortable, lower-middle class lifestyle&quot; and were in the process of putting down roots on Providence&#x27;s East Side. In 1923, when Aaron was two years old, the family purchased a house at 43/41 Sessions Street in the city&#x27;s Blackstone neighborhood.

Beck attended John Howland Grammar School, Nathan Bishop Junior High, and Hope Street High School, where he graduated as valedictorian in 1938. As an adolescent, Beck dreamed of becoming a journalist. Beck matriculated at Brown University, where he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1942. At Brown, he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa society, was an associate editor of &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot;, and received the Francis Wayland Scholarship, William Gaston Prize for Excellence in Oratory, and Philo Sherman Bennett Essay Award. Beck attended Yale Medical School, planning to become an internist and work in private practice in Providence. He graduated from Yale with a Doctor of Medicine in 1946.

==Career==
After receiving his M.D., Beck completed a six-month junior residency in pathology at Rhode Island Hospital and a three-year residency in neurology at Cushing Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham, Massachusetts. During this time, Beck began to specialize in neurology, reportedly liking the precision of its procedures. However, due to a shortage of psychiatry residents, he was instructed to do a six-month rotation in that field, and he became absorbed in psychoanalysis, despite initial wariness.

After completing his medical internships and residencies from 1946 to 1950, Beck became a fellow in psychiatry at the Austen Riggs Center, a private mental hospital in the mountains of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, until 1952. At that time, it was a center of ego psychology with an unusual degree of collaboration between psychiatrists and psychologists, including David Rapaport.

Beck then completed military service as assistant chief of neuropsychiatry at Valley Forge Army Hospital in the United States Military.

=== Penn psychiatry ===
Beck then joined the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1954. The department chair was Kenneth Ellmaker Appel, a psychoanalyst who was president of the American Psychiatric Association, whose efforts to expand the presence and relatedness of psychiatry had a big influence on Beck&#x27;s career. At the same time, Beck began formal training in psychoanalysis at the Philadelphia Institute of the American Psychoanalytic Association.

Beck&#x27;s closest colleague was Marvin Stein, a friend since their army hospital days to whom Beck looked up to for his scientific rigor in psychoneuroimmunology. Beck&#x27;s first research was with Leon J. Saul, a psychoanalyst known for unusual methods such as therapy by telephone or setting homework, who had developed inventory questionnaires to quantify ego processes in the manifest content of dreams (that which can be directly reported by the dreamer). Beck and a graduate student developed a new inventory they used to assess &quot;masochistic&quot; hostility in manifest dreams, published in 1959. This study found themes of loss and rejection related to depression, rather than inverted hostility as predicted by psychoanalysis. Developing the work with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, Beck came up with what he would call the Beck Depression Inventory, which he published in 1961 and soon started to market, unsupported by Appel. In another experiment, he found that depressed patients sought encouragement or improvement following disapproval, rather than seeking out suffering and failure as predicted by the Freudian anger-turned-inwards theory.

Through the 1950s, Beck adhered to the department&#x27;s psychoanalytic theories while pursuing experimentation and harboring private doubts. In 1961, however, controversy over whom to appoint the new chair of psychiatry—specifically, fierce psychoanalytic opposition to the favored choice of biomedical researcher Eli Robins—brought matters to a head, an early skirmish in a power shift away from psychoanalysis nationally. Beck tried to remain neutral and, with Albert J. Stunkard, opposed a petition to block Robins. Stunkard, a behaviorist who specialized in obesity and who had dropped out of psychoanalytic training, was eventually appointed department head in the face of sustained opposition which again Beck would not engage in, putting him at bitter odds with his friend Stein.

On top of this, despite having graduated from his Philadelphia training, the American Psychoanalytic Institute rejected Beck&#x27;s membership application in 1960, skeptical of his claims of success from relatively brief therapy and advising he conduct further supervised therapy on the more advanced or termination phases of a case, and again in 1961 when he had not done so but outlined his clinical and research work. Such deferments were a tactic used by the institute to maintain the orthodoxy in teaching, but Beck did not know this at the time and has described the decision as stupid and dumb.

Beck usually explained his increasing belief in his cognitive model by reference to a patient he had been listening to for a year at the Penn clinic. When he suggested she was anxious due to her ego being confronted by her sexual impulses, and asked her whether she believed this when she did not seem convinced, she said she was actually worried that she was being boring, and that she thought this often and with everyone.

=== Private practice ===
In 1962, Beck requested a sabbatical and would go into private practice for five years. In that same year, he was already making notes about patterns of thoughts in depression, emphasizing what can be observed and tested by anyone and treated in the present. He was engaged by George Kelly&#x27;s personal construct theory and Jean Piaget&#x27;s schemas. Beck&#x27;s first articles on the cognitive theory of depression, in 1963 and 1964 in the &quot;Archives of General Psychiatry&quot;, maintained the psychiatric context of ego psychology but then turned to concepts of realistic and scientific thinking in the terms of the new cognitive psychology, extended to become a therapeutic need.

Beck&#x27;s notebooks were also filled with self-analysis, where at least twice a day for several years he wrote out his own &quot;negative&quot; (later &quot;automatic&quot;) thoughts, rated with a percentile belief score, classified and restructured.

The psychologist who would become most important for Beck was Albert Ellis, whose own faith in psychoanalysis had crumbled by the 1950s. He had begun presenting his &quot;rational therapy&quot; by the mid-1950s. Beck recalled that Ellis contacted him in the mid-1960s after his two articles in the &quot;Archives of General Psychiatry&quot;, and therefore he discovered Ellis had developed a rich theory and pragmatic therapy that he was able to use to some extent as a framework blended with his own, though he disliked Ellis&#x27;s technique of telling patients what he thought was going on rather than helping the client to learn for themselves empirically. Psychoanalyst Gerald E. Kochansky remarked in 1975 in a review of one of Beck&#x27;s books that he could no longer tell if Beck was a psychoanalyst or a devotee of Ellis. Beck highlighted the classical philosophical Socratic method as an inspiration, while Ellis highlighted disputation which he stated was not anti-empirical and taught people how to dispute internally. Both Beck and Ellis cited aspects of the ancient philosophical system of Stoicism as a forerunner of their ideas. Beck cited Epictetus as an influence from Stoicism.

In 1967, becoming active again at University of Pennsylvania, Beck still described himself and his new therapy (as he always would quietly) as neo-Freudian in the ego psychology school, albeit focused on interactions with the environment rather than internal drives. He offered cognitive therapy work as a relatively &quot;neutral&quot; space and a bridge to psychology. With a monograph on depression that Beck published in 1967, according to historian Rachael Rosner: &quot;Cognitive Therapy entered the marketplace as a corrective experimentalist psychological framework both for himself and his patients and for his fellow psychiatrists.&quot;

==Cognitive therapy==
Working with depressed patients, Beck found that they experienced streams of negative thoughts that seemed to arise spontaneously. He termed these cognitions &quot;automatic thoughts&quot;, and discovered that their content fell into three categories: negative ideas about oneself, the world, and the future. He stated that such cognitions were interrelated as the cognitive triad. Limited time spent reflecting on automatic thoughts would lead patients to treat them as valid.

Beck began helping patients identify and evaluate these thoughts and found that by doing so, patients were able to think more realistically, which led them to feel better emotionally and behave more functionally. He developed key ideas in CBT, explaining that different disorders were associated with different types of distorted thinking. Distorted thinking has a negative effect on a person&#x27;s behavior no matter what type of disorder they had, he found. Beck explained that successful interventions will educate a person to understand and become aware of their distorted thinking, and how to challenge its effects. He discovered that frequent negative automatic thoughts reveal a person&#x27;s core beliefs. He explained that core beliefs are formed over lifelong experiences; we &quot;feel&quot; these beliefs to be true.

Since that time, Beck and his colleagues worldwide have researched the efficacy of this form of psychotherapy in treating a wide variety of disorders including depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, drug abuse, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and many other medical conditions with psychological components. Cognitive therapy has also been applied with success to individuals with schizophrenia. He also focused on cognitive therapy for schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and for patients who have had recurrent suicide attempts.

Beck&#x27;s recent research on the treatment of schizophrenia has suggested that patients once believed to be non-responsive to treatment are amenable to positive change. Even the most severe presentations of the illness, such as those involving long periods of hospitalization, bizarre behavior, poor personal hygiene, self-injury, and aggressiveness, can respond positively to a modified version of cognitive behavioral treatment.

Although Beck&#x27;s approach has sometimes been criticized as too mechanistic, modern CBT stresses the importance of a warm and encouraging therapeutic relationship and tailoring treatment to the specific challenges of each individual. Beck&#x27;s work was presented as a far more scientific and experimentally-based development than psychoanalysis (while being less reductive than behaviorism), Beck&#x27;s key principles were not necessarily based on the general findings and models of cognitive psychology or neuroscience developing at that time but were derived from personal clinical observations and interpretations in his therapy office. And although there have been many cognitive models developed for different mental disorders and hundreds of outcome studies on the effectiveness of CBT—relatively easy because of the narrow, time-limited and manual-based nature of the treatment—there has been much less focus on experimentally proving the supposedly active mechanisms; in some cases the predicted causal relationships have not been found, such as between dysfunctional attitudes and outcomes.

==Organizations==
Beck was involved in research studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and conducted biweekly Case Conferences at Beck Institute for area psychiatric residents, graduate students, and mental health professionals. He met every two weeks with conference participants and generally did two to three role plays. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007.

Beck was the founder and President Emeritus of the non-profit Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and the director of the Aaron T. Beck Psychopathology Research Center, which was the parent organization of the Center for the Treatment and Prevention of Suicide, which is now known as the Penn Center for the Prevention of Suicide. In 1986, he was a visiting scientist at Oxford University.

He was a professor emeritus at Penn since 1992, and an adjunct professor at both Temple University and University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. During his time at Penn, he pioneered the development of Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy. While the Center for CT-R was created at Penn, it was later absorbed by Beck Institute.

==Personal life and death==
Beck was married in 1950 to Honorable Phyllis W. Beck (ret.), and they had four children together: Roy, Judy, Dan, and Alice. Phyllis was the first woman judge on the appellate court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

<text>Eric Reeves (born 1950) is an American academic who is professor emeritus of English language and literature at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Reeves has carried out research into the politics and human rights situation in Sudan.

==Education==
Before being employed at Smith College, Reeves received degrees in English Literature from Williams College and the University of Pennsylvania.

== Sudan research ==
Reeves started studying politics and human rights in Sudan in 1999. He testified several times before the United States Congress, has lectured widely in academic settings, and has served as a consultant to a number of human rights and humanitarian organizations operating in Sudan. Working independently, he has written on several aspects of Sudan&#x27;s recent history, in particular the Darfur genocide, and the role of the Sudanese and Chinese governments in perpetuating it. He was described as &quot;a fierce critic&quot; of former American President Barack Obama&#x27;s policy of reconciliation with Sudan.

Reeves received a grant from Humanity United (Redwood City, CA) to support his research and travel. A collection of his essays on ongoing war and human destruction in Darfur appeared as &quot;A Long Day&#x27;s Dying&quot; (Key Publishing, 2007). He later published an eBook about five crucial years in the history of Sudan: &quot;Compromising with Evil: An archival history of greater Sudan, 2007 - 2012&quot; (www.CompromisingWithEvil.org).

He presently oversees a project in Zamzam IDP camp in North Darfur, with a primary emphasis on assisting girls and women traumatized by genocidal sexual violence. The project also distributes food and medicine to the neediest; it has also begun an effort to rehabilitate that water wells that have fallen into disrepair, making life for the more than 400,000 people in Zamzam extremely difficult. 

== Publications and awards ==
His work has appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, as well as numerous academic journals. This work has led to Reeves receiving a number of honorary degrees, and many other forms of national and international recognition.

<text>John Hosea Kerr (; December 31, 1873 – June 21, 1958) was an American jurist and politician who served 15 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1923 to 1953.

==Early life and education ==
Kerr was born in Yanceyville, Caswell County, North Carolina but lived most of his life in Warrenton, North Carolina. Kerr received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Wake Forest University and his law degree from Wake Forest University School of Law.

== Career ==
In 1895, Kerr started his law practice in Warrenton, North Carolina. He served as town attorney and then as mayor of Warrenton in 1897 and 1898.

In 1905, Kerr served as solicitor and then from 1916 to 1923, Kerr served as superior court judge.

=== Congress ===
Kerr was originally elected to the United States House of Representatives in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Claude Kitchin in 1923. He lost a bid for re-election in the 1952 Democratic Party primary to Lawrence H. Fountain.

== Death ==
Kerr died on June 21, 1958 in Warrenton, North Carolina.

=== Legacy ===
Constructed between 1947 and 1953, Kerr Lake, Kerr Lake State Recreation Area, and John H. Kerr Dam is named after him deriving from his instrumental efforts towards the project.

Kerr&#x27;s son, John H. Kerr, Jr., and grandson, John H. Kerr, III, both served in the North Carolina General Assembly. His great uncle John Kerr also served in the United States House of Representatives.

<text>The Newtonian telescope, also called the Newtonian reflector or just a Newtonian, is a type of reflecting telescope invented by the English scientist Sir Isaac Newton, using a concave primary mirror and a flat diagonal secondary mirror. Newton&#x27;s first reflecting telescope was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope. The Newtonian telescope&#x27;s simple design has made it very popular with amateur telescope makers.

==Description==
A Newtonian telescope is composed of a primary mirror or objective, usually parabolic in shape, and a smaller flat secondary mirror. The primary mirror makes it possible to collect light from the pointed region of the sky, while the secondary mirror redirects the light out of the optical axis at a right angle so it can be viewed with an eyepiece.

===Advantages of the Newtonian design===
* They are free of chromatic aberration found in refracting telescopes.
* Newtonian telescopes are usually less expensive for any given objective diameter (or aperture) than comparable quality telescopes of other types.
* Since there is only one surface that needs to be ground and polished into a complex shape, overall fabrication is much simpler than other telescope designs (Gregorians, cassegrains, and early refractors had two surfaces that need figuring. Later achromatic refractor objectives had four surfaces that have to be figured).
* A short focal ratio can be more easily obtained, leading to a wider field of view.
* The eyepiece is located at the top end of the telescope. Combined with short f-ratios this can allow for a much more compact mounting system, reducing cost and adding to portability.

=== Disadvantages of the Newtonian design ===
* Newtonians, like other reflecting telescope designs using parabolic mirrors, suffer from coma, an off-axis aberration which causes imagery to flare inward and towards the optical axis (stars towards edge of the field of view take on a comet-like shape). This flare is zero on-axis, and is linear with increasing field angle and inversely proportional to the square of the mirror focal ratio (the mirror focal length divided by the mirror diameter). The formula for third order tangential coma is 3θ / 16F², where θ is the angle off axis to the image in radians and F is the focal ratio. Newtonians with a focal ratio of f/6 or lower (f/5 for example) are considered to have increasingly serious coma for visual or photographic use. Low focal ratio primary mirrors can be combined with lenses that correct for coma to increase image sharpness over the field.
* Newtonians have a central obstruction due to the secondary mirror in the light path. This obstruction and also the diffraction spikes caused by the support structure (called the &quot;spider&quot;) of the secondary mirror reduce contrast. Visually, these effects can be reduced by using a two or three-legged curved spider. This reduces the diffraction sidelobe intensities by a factor of about four and helps to improve image contrast, with the potential penalty that circular spiders are more prone to wind-induced vibration.
* For portable Newtonians collimation can be a problem. The primary and secondary can get out of alignment from the shocks associated with transport and handling. This means the telescope may need to be re-aligned (collimated) every time it is set up. Other designs such as refractors and catadioptrics (specifically Maksutov cassegrains) have fixed collimation.
* The focal plane is at an asymmetrical point and at the top of the optical tube assembly. For visual observing, most notably on equatorial mounts, tube orientation can put the eyepiece in a very poor viewing position, and larger telescopes require ladders or support structures to access it. Some designs provide mechanisms for rotating the eyepiece mount or the entire tube assembly to a better position. For research telescopes, counterbalancing very heavy instruments mounted at this focus has to be taken into consideration.

==Variations==

There are several variations on the Newtonian design that add a lens to the system creating a catadioptric telescope. This is done to correct spherical aberration or reduce cost.

===Schmidt–Newtonian===

A Schmidt–Newtonian telescope combines the Newtonian optical design with a full-aperture Schmidt corrector plate in front of the primary mirror that not only corrects spherical aberration but can also support the secondary mirror. The resulting system has less coma and secondary mirror support induced diffraction effects.

===Maksutov–Newtonian===
Similar to a Schmidt–Newtonian, a Maksutov telescope&#x27;s meniscus shaped corrector can be added to the Newtonian configuration, which gives it minimal aberration over a wide field of view, with one-fourth the coma of a similar standard Newtonian and one-half the coma of a Schmidt-Newtonian. Diffraction can also be minimized by using a high focal ratio with a proportionally small diagonal mirror mounted on the corrector.

===Jones–Bird===
A Jones–Bird Newtonian (sometimes called a Bird–Jones) uses a spherical primary mirror in place of a parabolic one, with spherical aberrations corrected by sub-aperture corrector lens usually mounted inside the focusser tube or in front of the secondary mirror. This design reduces the size and cost of the telescope with a shorter overall telescope tube length (with the corrector extending the focal length in a &quot;telephoto&quot; type layout) combined with a less costly spherical mirror. Commercially produced versions of this design have been noted to be optically compromised, due to the difficulty of producing a correctly shaped sub-aperture corrector, and are targeted at the inexpensive end of the telescope market.

==History ==
Newton&#x27;s idea for a reflecting telescope was not new. Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Francesco Sagredo had discussed using a mirror as the image forming objective soon after the invention of the refracting telescope, and others, such as Niccolò Zucchi, claimed to have experimented with the idea as far back as 1616. Newton may even have read James Gregory&#x27;s 1663 book &quot;Optica Promota&quot; which described reflecting telescope designs using parabolic mirrors (a telescope Gregory had been trying unsuccessfully to build).

Newton built his reflecting telescope because he suspected it could prove his theory that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. Colour distortion (chromatic aberration) was the primary fault of refracting telescopes of Newton&#x27;s day, and there were many theories as to what caused it. During the mid-1660s with his work on the theory of colour, Newton concluded this defect was caused by the lens of the refracting telescope behaving the same as prisms he was experimenting with, breaking white light into a rainbow of colours around bright astronomical objects. If this were true, then chromatic aberration could be eliminated by building a telescope which did not use a lens – a reflecting telescope.

In late 1668 Isaac Newton built his first reflecting telescope. He chose an alloy (speculum metal) of tin and copper as the most suitable material for his objective mirror. He later devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror and may have been the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction; even though it would introduce spherical aberration, it would still correct chromatic aberration. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a Newtonian telescope, a secondary diagonally mounted mirror near the primary mirror&#x27;s focus to reflect the image at a 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made the tube, mount, and fittings. Newton&#x27;s first version had a primary mirror diameter of and a focal ratio of f/5. He found that the telescope worked without colour distortion and that he could see the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the crescent phase of the planet Venus with it. Newton&#x27;s friend Isaac Barrow showed a second telescope to a small group from the Royal Society of London at the end of 1671. They were so impressed with it that they demonstrated it to Charles II in January 1672. Newton was admitted as a fellow of the society in the same year.

Like Gregory before him, Newton found it hard to construct an effective reflector. It was difficult to grind the speculum metal to a regular curvature. The surface also tarnished rapidly; the consequent low reflectivity of the mirror and also its small size meant that the view through the telescope was very dim compared to contemporary refractors. Because of these difficulties in construction, the Newtonian reflecting telescope was initially not widely adopted. In 1721 John Hadley showed a much-improved model to the Royal Society. Hadley had solved many of the problems of making a parabolic mirror. His Newtonian with a mirror diameter of compared favourably with the large aerial refracting telescopes of the day.

<text>A photino is a hypothetical subatomic particle, the fermion WIMP superpartner of the photon predicted by supersymmetry. It is an example of a gaugino. Even though no photino has ever been observed so far, it is one of the candidates for the lightest supersymmetric particle in the universe. It is proposed that photinos are produced by sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

==Photino numbers==
Photinos have a lepton number 0, baryon number 0, and spin 1/2. With an R-parity of −1 it is a possible candidate for dark matter. It mixes with the superpartners of the Z boson (zino) and the neutral higgs (higgsino) to form the neutralino.

<text>Eli Yablonovitch (born 15 December 1946) is an American physicist and engineer who, along with Sajeev John, founded the field of photonic crystals in 1987. He and his team were the first to create a 3-dimensional structure that exhibited a full photonic bandgap, which has been named Yablonovite. In addition to pioneering photonic crystals, he was the first to recognize that a strained quantum-well laser has a significantly reduced threshold current compared to its unstrained counterpart. This is now employed in the majority of semiconductor lasers fabricated throughout the world. His seminal paper reporting inhibited spontaneous emission in photonic crystals is among the most highly cited papers in physics and engineering.

==Career==
Yablonovitch received his B.Sc. in physics from McGill University in 1967. He went on to receive his A.M. degree in applied physics from Harvard University in 1969, and his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1972. During his post-graduate studies, Yablonovitch worked on nonlinear optics with carbon dioxide lasers.

After receiving his Ph.D., Yablonovitch worked at Bell Laboratories. He then became a professor of applied physics at Harvard in 1974. In 1979, he joined Exxon research center to work on photovoltaic research for solar energy. While working at Exxon, Yablonovitch derived the 4 (n squared) factor as the theoretical limit for light trapping in photovoltaics. This is now used worldwide in almost all solar panels.

Yablonovitch joined Bell Communications Research in 1984, and became its director of solid-state physics research in 1991. During his time at Bell Communications, Yablonovitch did his pioneering work on photonic crystals.

Yablonovitch became a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA and continued to study and develop photonic crystals and photonic bandgap materials. In July 2007, he joined the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences department at UC Berkeley. His research topics include silicon photonics, telecommunications, optical antennas, new applications of photovoltaics, and searching for a low-voltage replacement for the transistor. Recently he has investigated analog computing approaches to solving hard problems, such as the traveling salesman problem.

== Entrepreneurship ==
Yablonovitch has co-founded multiple companies related to his research interests. In 2000, he co-founded Ethertronics Inc. Ethertronics is a cell phone antenna manufacturer that has, to date, shipped over 1.7 billion antennas.

In 2001, Yablonovitch co-founded Luxtera Inc., a semiconductor company that makes electro‑optical systems using silicon photonics, manufactured with CMOS processes. Luxtera is the first company to market foundry-based silicon photonics.

Yablonovitch co-founded Luminescent Inc. in 2002. Luminescent provided sophisticated mathematical optimization for use in photolithography masks. Luminescent was acquired by Synopsys in 2012.

In 2008, Yablonovitch founded Alta Devices Inc. Alta Devices produces thin-film gallium arsenide photovoltaic cells for solar energy. Alta Devices currently holds the efficiency world record for single junction solar cells at 29.1% and dual junction solar cells at 31.6%, both at 1 sun illumination.

== Fellowships and awards ==
He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Optical Society of America (OSA), and the American Physical Society (APS).

He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Inventors, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London.

<doc id="509158" wikidata="Q702424" url="?curid=509158" title="Federal Administrative Court (Germany)">
<text>The Federal Administrative Court (, , BVerwG) is one of the five federal supreme courts of Germany. It is the court of the last resort for generally all cases of administrative law, mainly disputes between citizens and the state. It hears appeals from the &quot;Oberverwaltungsgerichte&quot;, or Superior Administrative Courts, which, in turn, are the courts of appeals for decisions of the &quot;Verwaltungsgerichte&quot; (administrative courts).

However, cases concerning social security law belong to the jurisdiction of the &quot;Sozialgerichte&quot; (Social Courts) with the Bundessozialgericht as federal court of appeals, and cases of tax and customs law are decided by the &quot;Finanzgerichte&quot; (Fiscal Courts), and, ultimately, by the Bundesfinanzhof.

The &quot;Bundesverwaltungsgericht&quot; has its seat at the former Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) building in Leipzig&#x27;s district Mitte.

== History ==
The Federal Administrative Court was established on the basis of Article 95 (1) of the Basic Law by Act of 23 September 1952. The seat of the Federal Administrative Court was initially Berlin. Since 8 June 1953, the Federal Administrative Court was housed in the former premises of the Prussian Higher Administrative Court. The decision in favour of Berlin as the seat was controversial among the Allied Powers; the Soviet Union in particular was opposed to it. As a result, with the rearmament of the Federal Republic, the military service senates of the Federal Administrative Court had to move to Munich. Since the Federal Administrative Court moved from Berlin to Leipzig to the Reichsgericht building, they have also resided in Leipzig.

Leipzig was designated as the new seat of the Federal Administrative Court by law of 21 November 1997. The official date of the change of seat was set for 26 August 2002 by the Federal Minister of Justice by legal decree of 24 June 2002. The most recent chapter in the history of the Federal Administrative Court is thus connected with the use of the former Reichsgericht building in Leipzig - it officially began with the ceremonial inauguration of the building as the Federal Administrative Court on 12 September 2002.

<doc id="509160" wikidata="Q712383" url="?curid=509160" title="Michel Camilo">
<text>Michel Camilo (born April 4, 1954) is a Dominican pianist and composer. He specializes in jazz, Latin and classical piano work.

==Background and career==
Camilo was born into a musical family and as a young child showed aptitude for the accordion that his parents gave him. Although he enjoyed the accordion, it was his grandparents&#x27; piano that sparked his interest the most, so at the age of 9 he asked his parents to buy him one. Their response was to first send him to the Elementary Music School, part of the National Conservatory, and then a year later to grant his wish.

The formal system of the music school taught Camilo to play in the classical style, and by age 16 he was playing with the National Symphony Orchestra of the Dominican Republic. Camilo comments on his first encounter with the sounds of jazz, in an interview with the All About Jazz website:

:&quot;The first time I heard jazz was when I was 14 and a half. I heard the great Art Tatum on the radio playing his solo piano rendition of &#x27;Tea for Two.&#x27; That immediately caught my ear. I just wanted to soak it in, to learn to play that style. Then I found out it was jazz.&quot;

Camilo studied for 13 years at the National Conservatory, and whilst developing his strong classical abilities was also heavily influenced by the bebop tradition, and by the contemporary jazz of Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea and Amilton Godoy (Zimbo Trio&#x27;s pianist). His influences at this time also included Horace Silver, Erroll Garner, and the ragtime music of Scott Joplin.

When the Harvard University Jazz Band visited the Dominican Republic and heard Camilo at a jam session, the bandleader encouraged him, &#x27;You should be in the States&#x27;, and so the idea was planted. In 1979, Camilo moved to New York to study at Mannes College and at The Juilliard School, and broke onto the international stage in 1983 when Tito Puente&#x27;s pianist was unable to make a concert at the Montreal Jazz Festival. On a recommendation, without hearing him, Puente asked Camilo to play. Cuban reedman Paquito D&#x27;Rivera was in the audience and offered him a place in his band. For four years, Camilo toured internationally with D&#x27;Rivera and recorded two albums with him.

Camilo&#x27;s emergence as a star in his own right began around 1985, the year he debuted with his trio at Carnegie Hall. In that same year he toured Europe with Paquito D’Rivera&#x27;s quintet, and recorded his first album, &quot;Why Not?&quot;, for Japan&#x27;s &quot;King&quot; label. His album &quot;Suntan/In Trio&quot; had a trio with Anthony Jackson on the bass and Dave Weckl on the drums. In 1988, Camilo debuted on a major record label, Sony, with the release of &quot;Michel Camilo&quot;, which became a bestseller and held the top jazz album spot for ten consecutive weeks. Special guests joined in with Camilo, such as percussionist Sammy Figueroa and tap dancer Raul. Other bestselling albums followed and so did the accolades, including a Grammy and an Emmy. Camilo&#x27;s collaborative 2000 album with flamenco guitarist Tomatito &quot;Spain&quot; won Best Latin Jazz Album in the first Latin Grammy Awards.

As well as being an outstanding performer, Camilo is a talented composer and has written scores for several Spanish language films including &quot;Los peores años de nuestra vida&quot; and the award-winning &quot;Amo tu cama rica&quot;.

Camilo tours extensively, and lectures in Europe, the US, and in the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico. He holds several honorary degrees, a Visiting Professorship and a Doctorate at Berklee College of Music, and has been honored in his home country by being named a Knight of the Heraldic Order of Christopher Columbus, and being awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez &amp; Mella.

==Association with other musicians==

Camilo&#x27;s regular trio lineup for many years had his long-term friends Anthony Jackson on contrabass guitar and Cliff Almond on drums. Charles Flores has occupied the trio&#x27;s bass seat since their Grammy-winning album &quot;Live at the Blue Note&quot;. Lately Camilo has drummer Dafnis Prieto as part of his trio. This new trio released the album &quot;Spirit of the Moment&quot; in April 2007.

Other musicians he has played with include Tito Puente, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, Dizzy Gillespie, Katia Labèque, Toots Thielemans, Airto Moreira, Chuck Mangione, Stanley Turrentine, Claudio Roditi, Nancy Alvarez, Mongo Santamaría, George Benson, Eddie Palmieri, Jon Faddis, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Lew Soloff, Tania Maria, Jaco Pastorius, Patato, Randy Brecker, Michael Brecker, Chuck Loeb, Giovanni Hidalgo, Guarionex Aquino, Wynton Marsalis, Dave Valentin, Flora Purim, Delfeayo Marsalis, Chucho Valdés, Joe Lovano, Herbie Hancock, Tomatito, John Patitucci, David Sanchez, Hiromi Uehara, Cachao, Marco Rizo, Marcus Roberts, Steve Gadd, Danilo Perez, Gary Burton, Billy Taylor, Dave Weckl, Hilton Ruiz, Roy Hargrove, Romero Lubambo, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Leny Andrade, Bireli Lagrene, Marian McPartland, Leonard Slatkin, Arturo Sandoval, Frank Colón, Aisha Syed Castro, Béla Fleck, Lou Marini, Cliff Almond, Juan Luis Guerra 4.40, Mark Walker.

Camilo is one of the ambassadors to Music Traveler GmbH, together with Billy Joel, Hans Zimmer, John Malkovich, Sean Lennon, Adrien Brody.

<text>The Davidov Stradivarius (also: Davidoff or Davydov; ) is an antique cello made in 1712 by luthier Antonio Stradivari of Cremona, Italy. It is very similar in construction and form to the equally famed &quot;Duport Stradivarius&quot;, built a year earlier and played by Mstislav Rostropovich until his death in 2007. The varnish is of a rich orange-red hue, produced with oil color glazes. Its owners have included Karl Davydov and Jacqueline du Pré, and it is currently used by cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

==Nomenclature==
In 1870, the &quot;Davidov Stradivarius&quot; was given to the eponymous Karl Davydov (1838–1889) by patron Count Matvei Wielhorski (1794–1866) at the court of Tsar Alexander II. Davydov was a Russian cellist of great renown at the time, described as the &quot;czar of cellists&quot; by Tchaikovsky, though far less successful as a composer. The cello body has a few marks and scratches due to mishandling from this period.

==History==
The cello was sold in Paris in 1888. In 1928 it was purchased by Herbert N. Straus, an American business executive. When he died, his widow asked New York City musical instrument dealer Rembert Wurlitzer to sell the instrument for her. In 1964, the &quot;Davydov&quot; cello was purchased for US$90,000 by Ismena Holland who in turn presented the instrument to her goddaughter, the English cellist Jacqueline du Pré. Upon receiving the &quot;Davydov&quot;, Du Pre&#x27;s instructor, William Pleeth, declared it as &quot;one of the really great instruments of the world&quot;. Practically all of du Pré&#x27;s recordings from 1968 to 1970 were made on this instrument. By 1970, du Pré began using a different cello (made for her by Sergio Peresson and purchased by her husband Daniel Barenboim), as she was bothered by the Davidov&#x27;s &quot;unpredictability.&quot; Yo-Yo Ma later commented, &quot;Jackie&#x27;s unbridled dark qualities went against the &quot;Davydov&quot;. You have to coax the instrument. The more you attack it, the less it returns&quot;. The Peresson was her primary instrument for the remainder of her career.

Upon her death in 1987, the &quot;Davidov,&quot; owned by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, was made available for use by Yo-Yo Ma. He has since performed and recorded with the instrument in Baroque music, specifically, the &quot;Simply Baroque&quot; and &quot;Simply Baroque II&quot; recordings. It was modified especially for the task of creating a more authentic sound for that era. The &quot;Davidov&quot; has subsequently been reconfigured for modern music.

<doc id="509168" wikidata="Q1380415" url="?curid=509168" title="Franz Cumont">
<text>Franz-Valéry-Marie Cumont (3 January 1868 in Aalst, Belgium – 20 August 1947 in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre near Brussels) was a Belgian archaeologist and historian, a philologist and student of epigraphy, who brought these often isolated specialties to bear on the syncretic mystery religions of Late Antiquity, notably Mithraism.

==Biography==
Cumont was a graduate of the University of Ghent (PhD, 1887). After receiving royal travelling fellowships, he undertook archaeology in Pontus and Armenia (published in 1906) and in Syria, but he is best known for his studies on the impact of Eastern mystery religions, particularly Mithraism, on the Roman Empire. Cumont&#x27;s international credentials were brilliant, but his public circumspection was not enough. In 1910, Baron Edouard Descamps, the Catholic Minister of Sciences and Arts at the University of Ghent, refused to approve the faculty&#x27;s unanimous recommendation of Cumont for the chair in Roman History, Cumont having been a professor there since 1906. There was a vigorous press campaign and student agitation in Cumont&#x27;s favor, because the refusal was seen as blatant religious interference in the university&#x27;s life. When another candidate was named, in 1912, Cumont resigned his positions at the university and at the Royal Museum in Brussels, left Belgium and henceforth divided his time between Paris and Rome.

He contributed to many standard encyclopedias, published voluminously and in 1922, under stressful political conditions, conducted digs on the shore of the Euphrates at the previously unknown site of Dura-Europos; he published his research there in 1926. He was a member of most of the European academies. In 1936 Franz Cumont was awarded the Francqui Prize on Human Sciences. He was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in 1940. In 1947, Franz Cumont donated his library and papers to the Academia Belgica in Rome, where they are accessible to researchers.

His works include
*&quot;Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum&quot; (1898–1953) 
*&quot;Texts and Illustrated Monuments Relating to the Mysteries of Mithra&quot; (1894–1900, with an English translation in 1903) is the study that made his international reputation, by its originality and massive documentation.
*&quot;Les religions orientales dans le paganisme romain&quot; (1906, widely translated)
*&quot;After-Life in Roman Paganism,&quot; lectures delivered at Yale University, published in 1922, was cautiously expressed, but it corrected many false impressions of pagan rite that Christian apologists had made.
*&quot;Astrology and Religion Among the Greeks and Romans&quot;, published in 1912 (available in a Dover reprint)

After his death, critics of his interpretation of Mithras as the descendant of the Iranian deity Mithra began to be heard, and surfaced at the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies in Manchester England, 1971. Modern interpretation of Mithras as the astronomical bull-slayer have continued to move away from Cumont&#x27;s interpretations, though his documentation remains valuable.

In 1997 the Royal Library, Brussels, observed the fiftieth anniversary of Cumont&#x27;s death appropriately, with a colloquium on syncretism in the Mediterranean world of Antiquity. In 2010 the Belgian publisher Brepols started an edition of Cumont&#x27;s collected works. The volumes are published in two series as &#x27;major&#x27; and &#x27;minor&#x27; writings identified by the acronyms BICUMA and BICUMI.

<doc id="509173" wikidata="Q800572" url="?curid=509173" title="Broad Street railway station (England)">
<text>Broad Street was a major rail terminal in the City of London, adjacent to Liverpool Street station. It served as the main terminus of the North London Railway (NLR) network, running from 1865 to 1986. During its lifetime, it catered for mainly local suburban services around London, and over time struggled to compete with other modes of transport, leading to its closure.

The station was built as a joint venture by the NLR and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in order to have a station serving freight closer to the City. It was immediately successful for both goods and passenger services, and saw a significant increase in NLR traffic. Usage peaked in the early 20th century, after which it suffered from competition from London trams, buses and, especially, the London Underground network. Patronage gradually fell and services decreased, while the building became increasingly dilapidated.

Freight services were withdrawn towards the end of the 1960s and the station closed in 1986. The station building was replaced by Broadgate, an office and retail complex, while part of the connecting line to the station was reinstated in 2010 as part of the London Overground.

==Location==
The station was sited at the junction of Broad Street and Liverpool Street in the Broad Street ward of the City of London, with Liverpool Street station immediately to the east. It was near Liverpool Street and tube stations.

==History==
The station was proposed by the North London Railway (NLR). The line originally opened as the East &amp; West India Docks &amp; Birmingham Junction Railway in 1850, in order to transport freight between the London and Birmingham Railway and the London Docklands. By the time it had been renamed to the NLR in 1853, passenger traffic had grown in equal importance, so it was decided to build a station with direct access to the City.

===Opening===
The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) was also keen to have a goods depot in the City, and agreed to help the NLR fund the new extension. The connecting line to Broad Street (via the Kingsland Viaduct) was authorised by the North London Railway (City Branch) Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. cxcvi) of 22 July 1861. The work involved a extension from Kingsland down towards Broad Street, and required the demolition of numerous properties in Shoreditch and Haggerston. During construction of the terminus, a large burial ground was unearthed, exposing human remains. This may have been a result of the plague, or burial pits from Bethlehem Hospital. The overall cost of the station and extension was £1.2m (£m in ).

The station was opened on 1 November 1865 as the terminus of a network of commuter railways linking east and west London via the looping route of the NLR, originally with seven platforms and three approach tracks. The main building was designed by William Baker and constructed in an Italianate style and a Second Empire style roof. The frontage was long and wide, constructed from white Suffolk brick and Peterhead granite, with a clock tower as a centrepiece.
Initial services were to , and via . Services to Watford began on 1 September 1866. Cheap fares for the working class were available from the outset. A goods station was built next to the passenger station, opening to traffic on 18 May 1868. It was constructed on a deck, and a hydraulic lift was provided to move wagons down to warehouses below. Because of this, the station used only of land, which was convenient owing to the high price of land in the City.

===Expansion and development===
Broad Street was an immediate success and caused NLR traffic to double in a short space of time. A fourth approach line was added in 1874, a further (eighth) platform in 1891, and a final (ninth) platform in 1913. Two covered footbridges were added at the front of the main building in 1890 in order to provide direct access from the street to the platforms.

At its peak at the turn of the 20th century, Broad Street was the third-busiest station in London (after Liverpool Street and Victoria). At this time, more than one train per minute arrived or departed Broad Street during rush hour, with over 27 million passengers in 1902. The Great Northern Railway also used Broad Street as a supplement to its King&#x27;s Cross terminal to the west. On 1 February 1910, the LNWR introduced a &quot;City to City&quot; service from Broad Street to , and . The service only lasted for a few years, before being withdrawn on 22 February 1915 as a result of World War I. Nevertheless, the majority of Broad Street&#x27;s traffic was local suburban services.

===Decline===

In the early years of the 20th century, the North London Line suffered a reduction in passengers and, especially, revenue, owing to the expansion of the bus, tram and Underground networks. In 1909, the NLR passed general handling of trains to the LNWR. By 1913, numbers had dropped to 44.6 per cent compared to 1900, and by 1921 to only 23.3 per cent and the patronage of Broad Street station declined accordingly. On 8 September 1915, the station was damaged by a Zeppelin attack.
In the face of the competition, the governing board finally decided to electrify the NLR, on the two-conductor-rail at 600 V DC system, and electrified passenger services started on 1 October 1916, using Oerlikon rolling stock, though the Watford service was not electrified until 10 July 1922. At the terminus, only the western five lines were ever electrified. Electrification appeared to stem the tide of passenger losses. Electric services to Richmond and Kew began on 1 October 1916, followed by peak services to Watford on 16 April 1917. The latter were increased to all-day services on 10 July 1922. By this time, there were four trains per hour to Richmond and two per hour to Watford. Steam services continued to Poplar, with a peak service to . These latter trains continued to use old livery, without modern conveniences such as heating and electric light, and were unpopular.

The station came under the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as part of the Big Four grouping in 1923. The former GNR services from Broad Street were stopped completely in 1939 in order to accommodate essential World War II traffic. Broad Street was badly damaged during the war. The lines leading to the station were taken out of action after an overnight raid on 3–4 October 1940, closing the station for a number of days. Similar disruption occurred on 13 October and 11 November. The service to Shoreditch closed in 1940, while the service to Poplar was withdrawn on 14 May 1944 and never reinstated. A number of peak-season mainline trains to used Broad Street to take pressure off King&#x27;s Cross in the early 1950s, but otherwise only a small number of local services remained. The main station building was closed in 1957, after which passengers were directed to a new concourse-level hut at the platform entrance to buy tickets.
Curving around the north of London before turning south into the City, the North London Line was, for most passengers, a slower route into the financial district than alternative options like taking the Underground or changing at Euston or King&#x27;s Cross. By 1960, only 41 trains carrying 6,400 passengers arrived at Broad Street in the three morning peak hours.

The line and station came in for criticism in the Beeching Report of 1963, whose recommendations resulted in the closing of many branch lines and stations across the country. Though Broad Street itself was not specifically listed for closure, it was earmarked as &quot;stopping passenger services to be modified&quot;. The station was gradually run down and the level of service steadily reduced. In 1967 the major part of the train shed roof was removed, having become unsafe, while goods services were withdrawn on 27 January 1969. Four of the nine platforms were taken out of use in the same year. On 6 November 1976, peak-hour services to the Eastern Region via the Canonbury Spur were withdrawn with the opening of the Northern City Line, and an additional platform was disconnected. The station was by then very dilapidated, with vegetation growing between disused platforms, and most of the old goods area was used as a car park.

===Closure===

In 1979, British Rail was granted planning permission to completely redevelop Broad Street and Liverpool Street stations, and the latter took over the former&#x27;s few services still remaining. This put Broad Street into a terminal decline. By 1985, 6,000 passengers per week were using Broad Street station and 300 arrived daily in the morning peak. From 13 May 1985, the service to was diverted away from Broad Street, leaving the peak hour Watford Junction services.

It was agreed that Broad Street would be closed, trains being diverted to Liverpool Street once a new connecting chord was built from the North London Line. Until this was done, it was possible to accommodate this last service from the outer end of one platform, and, in November that year, demolition of the station began. The remaining single platform was used until 27 June 1986. The station was formally closed on 30 June, along with Dalston Junction, the other station serving the North London Line&#x27;s City branch. Demolition of the station was completed by the end of 1986. The service from Watford to Liverpool Street was withdrawn on 28 September 1992. Primrose Hill station, the only station exclusively served by the route from Watford to the City, was closed at the same time.

==Redevelopment==
Broad Street station was completely demolished and replaced by the Broadgate office and shopping complex. Most of the Kingsland Viaduct leading to the North London Line remains largely intact, and has been restored to carry the London Overground along the old trackbed as far as . The former line over the Great Eastern Street viaduct to Broad Street has been used as a location for artists&#x27; studios, housed in converted Jubilee line Underground trains.

The Crossrail project, now called the Elizabeth line, to construct a new underground railway line through central London, has one of its stations at Liverpool Street. A new ticket hall serving the Elizabeth Line station has been built within the old Underground ticket hall with its entrance at 100 Liverpool Street, the old entrance to the Underground that served Broad Street, with the platforms themselves under the Broadgate complex.

A feature of the concourse was the North London Railway war memorial. Made of white marble, it was installed on 10 February 1921, containing inscriptions of 64 names. The memorial commemorated the workers of the North London Railway company who lost their lives in &#x27;The Great War&#x27;. Upon closure, the memorial was put in store at Richmond station in 1989. On 7 June 2011, it was rededicated outside Hoxton station by Rev James Westcott of St. Chad&#x27;s Church and London&#x27;s transport commissioner Peter Hendy.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 3 April 1891, 11 people were injured when a train from hit the hydraulic buffer stops at Broad Street.
*On 20 September 1898, 15 people were injured when a service from Richmond approaching Broad Street at slightly excessive speed ran into the buffers at the end of platform six. A Board of Trade report on the incident stated: &quot;Fifteen passengers are reported to have complained of bruises or shock, and a few others have claimed compensation for damage to their hats.&quot; The train&#x27;s driver testified: &quot;I committed an error of judgment in not applying the brake quite soon enough.&quot;
*On 18 August 1904, a train arriving into a Broad Street platform from Poplar collided with a service waiting to depart for Chalk Farm. Both trains were full and 56 passengers were injured. The Board of Trade investigation reported that &quot;three of the injured had to be taken to hospital, but they were all able to proceed to their homes the same day.&quot; Six train crew members also complained of injury. An error on the part of the signaller was determined to be the primary cause of the collision.
*On 20 March 1923, two people were injured when a train was rear-ended at Broad Street.

==Cultural references==
Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1984 feature film and album of the same name, &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot;, makes reference to the station. In one of the last scenes of the film, McCartney walks into the station and sits alone on one of its benches.

Broad Street is the target of an unsuccessful IRA bombing in television spy drama &quot;Spooks&quot;; although set in 2002, Broad Street had been closed 16 years prior. Shots of Marylebone station were used.

<text>Sanford I. &quot;Sandy&quot; Weill (; born March 16, 1933) is an American banker, financier, and philanthropist. He is a former chief executive and chairman of Citigroup. He served in those positions from 1998 until October 1, 2003, and April 18, 2006, respectively.

==Early life and education==
Weill was born in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York City, to Polish Jewish immigrants, Etta (Kalika) and Max Weill. He attended P.S. 200 of the New York City Public Schools system for elementary school in his local neighborhood of Bensonhurst. He also attended Peekskill Military Academy in Peekskill, New York of Upstate New York, and then enrolled at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was active in the U.S. Air Force ROTC and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. In 1955, Weill graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Cornell.

Weill&#x27;s middle initial of &quot;I&quot; is not an abbreviation for anything. In 2002, he said:

==Career==

In 1955, shortly after graduating from Cornell University, Weill began his first job on Wall Street, serving as a runner for Bear Stearns. In 1956, he became a licensed broker at Bear Stearns. Rather than making phone calls or personal visits to solicit clients, Weill found he was far more comfortable sitting at his desk, poring through companies&#x27; financial statements and disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For weeks his only client was his mother, Etta, until his later to be wife, Joan, persuaded an ex-boyfriend to open a brokerage account.

===Building Shearson===
While working at Bear Stearns, Weill was a neighbor of Arthur L. Carter who was working at Lehman Brothers. Together with Roger Berlind and Peter Potoma, they formed Carter, Berlind, Potoma &amp; Weill in May 1960. In 1962 the firm became Carter, Berlind &amp; Weill after the New York Stock Exchange brought disciplinary proceedings against Potoma.

In 1968, with the departure of Arthur Carter, the firm was renamed Cogan, Berlind, Weill &amp; Levitt (Marshall Cogan, Arthur Levitt), or CBWL jokingly referred to on Wall Street as &quot;Corned Beef With Lettuce&quot;. Weill served as the firm&#x27;s Chairman from 1965 to 1984, a period in which it completed over 15 acquisitions to become the country&#x27;s second-largest securities brokerage firm. The company became CBWL-Hayden, Stone, Inc. in 1970; Hayden Stone, Inc. in 1972; Shearson Hayden Stone in 1974, when it merged with Shearson Hammill &amp; Co.; and Shearson Loeb Rhoades in 1979, when it merged with Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower &amp; Co.

With capital totaling $250 million, Shearson Loeb Rhoades trailed only Merrill Lynch as the largest securities broker.

===American Express===
In 1981, Weill sold Shearson Loeb Rhoades to American Express for about $915 million in stock. In 1982, he founded the National Academy Foundation with the Academy of Finance to educate high school students. Weill began serving as president of American Express Co. in 1983 and as chairman and CEO of American Express&#x27;s insurance subsidiary, Fireman&#x27;s Fund Insurance Company, in 1984. Weill was succeeded by his protégé, Peter A. Cohen, who became the youngest head of a Wall Street firm. While at American Express, Weill began grooming his newest protégé, Jamie Dimon, the future CEO of JPMorgan Chase.

===Acquisitions===
Weill resigned from American Express in August 1985 at age 52. After an attempt to become the CEO of BankAmerica Corp., he persuaded Minneapolis-based Control Data Corporation to spin off a troubled subsidiary, Commercial Credit, a consumer finance company. In 1986, Weill bought Commercial Credit for $7 million. After a period of layoffs and reorganization, the company completed a successful IPO.

In 1987, he acquired Gulf Insurance. The following year, in 1988, he paid $1.5 billion for Primerica, the parent company of Smith Barney and the A. L. Williams insurance company. In 1989, he acquired Drexel Burnham Lambert&#x27;s retail brokerage outlets. In 1992, he paid $722 million to buy a 27% share of Travelers Insurance, which had gotten into trouble because of bad real estate investments.

In 1993, he reacquired his old Shearson brokerage (now Shearson Lehman) from American Express for $1.2 billion. By the end of the year, he had completely taken over Travelers Corp in a $4 billion stock deal and officially began calling his corporation Travelers Group Inc. In 1996 he added to his holdings, at a cost of $4 billion, the property and casualty operations of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty. In September 1997 Weill acquired Salomon Inc., the parent company of Salomon Brothers Inc. for over $9 billion in stock.

===Citigroup===

In April 1998, Travelers Group announced an agreement to undertake the $76 billion merger between Travelers and Citicorp, and the merger was completed on October 8, 1998. The possibility remained that the merger would run into problems connected with federal law. Ever since the passage of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932, during the presidential administration, of 31st President, Herbert Hoover (1874–1964, served 1929–1933), the fields of banking and insurance businesses had been kept separate. Both Weill and CEO / chairman predecessor John S. Reed (born 1939), bet that the U.S. Congress in Washington, D.C. would soon pass legislation overturning those regulations, which Weill, Reed and a number of businesspeople considered not in their interest.

To speed up the process, they recruited to the Board of Directors of the financial company former 38th President, Gerald R. Ford (1913–2006, served 1974–1977, a Republican) and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin (born 1938, who served during the Democratic Bill Clinton presidential administration, 1993–2001) whom Weill was personally close to. With both Democrats and Republicans on their side, the law was taken down in less than two years. Many European countries, for instance, had already torn down the firewall between banking and insurance. During a two-to-five-year grace period allowed by law, Citigroup could conduct business in its merged form; should that period have elapsed without a change in the law, Citigroup would have had to spin off its insurance businesses. Weill&#x27;s office holds a wood etching of him engraved with the words &quot;The Shatterer of Glass–Steagall&quot;. Weill now denies that the congressional repeal of the 1932 Glass–Steagall Act played a role in the following financial crisis of 2007–2008 and subsequent Great Recession of 2007–2010, the worst economic downturn and financial collapse in American history since the infamous Great Depression of the 1930s.

In 1998, Weill was the recipient of &quot;FinancialWorld Magazine&quot;″s CEO of the Year Award and received the same honor from &quot;ChiefExecutive Magazine&quot; in 2002.

In 2001, Weill became a Class A director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of the United States Federal Reserve system. Class A directors are those elected by the Federal Reserve member regional banks. Also in 2001, Weill established several offshore enterprises, including one through which he owned his yacht. These entities were identified in the infamous Panama Papers scandal, a release in 2016 of secret financial documents dating back to the 1970s, of off-shore overseas / foreign money deposits and secret bank accounts of millions of dollars of wealthy Americans and others hiding them for federal / state income tax purposes.

In 2002, the financial company was hit by the wave of Wall Street managerial restructuring that followed the earlier stock market downturn of 2002. The following year of 2003, Weill sold 5.6 million shares of Citigroup stock back to the financial institution itself for nearly $264 million and semi-retired, relinquishing the title of chief executive officer (CEO) to Charles O. (&quot;Chuck&quot;) Prince (born 1950), who however only served for the next few years, stepping down himself as both CEO and one year as chairman in 2007). But Weill remained chairman of the board of directors of Citigroup in 2002 until four years later in 2006.

Four years after the beginning of the shocking economic panic and financial collapse of the Great Recession of 2007–2011, on July 25, 2012, Weill reversed course on the financial supermarket, and was quoted saying: &quot;What we should probably do is go and split up investment banking from banking, have banks be deposit takers, have banks make commercial loans and real estate loans, have banks do something that&#x27;s not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that&#x27;s not too big to fail,&quot; Weill said on CNBC (the business / financial news cable television network): &quot;If they want to hedge what they&#x27;re doing with their investments, let them do it in a way that&#x27;s going to be mark-to-market so they&#x27;re never going to be hit.&quot;

==Personal life==
Weill married Joan H. Mosher on June 20, 1955. The couple now live on a 362 acres estate they purchased in 2010 in Sonoma, California. 

==Philanthropy==

In 1997, Weill received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member, retired U.S. Army General and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and also later U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell (1937–2021).

Weill served as a Cornell Trustee, his alma mater. In 1998, he endowed Cornell&#x27;s medical school, now known as Weill Cornell Medicine, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City (separate from Cornel&#x27;s main campus in Ithaca). As chairman of the Board of Overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College and an emeritus member of the Board of Trustees of Cornell University itself, Weill orchestrated a $400 million donation to Cornell, to which he and his wife personally contributed $250 million.

In June 2007, he endowed the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at his alma mater of Cornell University, on its campus in Ithaca, New York, housed in a new life science building named Weill Hall. On September 10, 2013, Joan and Sandy Weill and the Weill Family Foundation announced a $100 million gift to Weill Cornell. Weill is chairman of the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical College and the parallel Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, having joined the board in 1982 and becoming its chair in 1995. Weill Cornell established the first American medical school overseas in Doha, the modernist capital city of the emirate State of Qatar in the Middle East / Persian Gulf region, in 2001. This was made possible through a special partnership between Weill Cornell and the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. Weill Cornell&#x27;s inaugural class in Qatar graduated in 2008.

Weill also serves on the Board of Governors of Sidra. a 380-bed specialty teaching hospital was scheduled to open in 2014, also in the emirate State of Qatar in the Middle East / Persian Gulf. Sidra is supported by a $9 billion endowment from the Qatar Foundation. In addition, he is a Trustee of New York-Presbyterian Hospital; a Trustee of the Hospital for Special Surgery; and a member of the Executive Council of the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center.

In May 2003, he received the Baruch Medal for Business and Civic Leadership, presented by Baruch College of the City University of New York system for his work in public education and his accomplishments in business.

A proponent of education, Weill instituted a joint program with the New York City Board of Education in 1980 that created the specialized magnet school of the Academy of Finance, which trains high school students for careers in financial services. He serves as Founder and Chairman of the National Academy Foundation (NAF), which oversees more than 100,000 students in 617 career-themed academies of finance, hospitality and tourism, information technology, engineering, and health sciences, in 35 states, as well as the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (in the Caribbean Sea / West Indies islands). Ninety-nine percent of NAF&#x27;s students graduate, with eighty-seven percent going on to post-secondary education – often as the first in their families to attend college. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (born 1957, served 2011–2021), appointed Weill as a member of his New York Education Reform Commission.

Weill has received honorary degrees from Howard University in Washington, D.C., Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Long Island, the University of New Haven in New Haven, Connecticut, The New School in New York City, and the Sonoma State University in Sonoma, California.

He previously served as the chairman of the Board of the famous 19th century concert hall / auditorium of Carnegie Hall, built 1891 on Seventh Avenue (between 56th and 57th Streets, in Manhattan), of New York City, until 2016, and both he and his wife Joan are avid champions and lovers of classical music in the United States, frequently attending various concerts across the country. Since 1986, one of the three performance halls in landmark Carnegie Hall has been named after Weill and his wife, Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall. The 1997 recipient of the New York State Governor&#x27;s Art Award, Weill has been chairman of the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Hall since 1991. For Weill&#x27;s 70th birthday, Carnegie Hall raised a record $60 million in one evening event through a generous $30 million match by Weill and his wife for the Weill Music Institute, which established broad-reaching music education programs. Weill is also chairman of the Green Music Center Board of Advisors at the Sonoma State University in California and a director of the Lang Lang International Music Foundation.

In September 2006, Joan and Sanford Weill Hall was dedicated at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan. The building is home to the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, named for Gerald R. Ford (1913–2006, served 1974–1977), as the 38th President of the United States, at President Ford&#x27;s alma mater and shortly after his death. Weill donated $5 million towards the construction of the Ford Public Policy School building and an additional $3 million to endow the position of the academic dean of the U.M. Ford School.

Joan and Sanford Weill have been co-chairs, of the annual &quot;Louis Marshall Award Dinner&quot;, from 2000 to 2010.

In 2002, the Joan Weill Adirondack Library and Joan Weill Student Center were dedicated at the Paul Smith&#x27;s College in the small hamlet / village of Paul Smiths, New York, (near the larger town of Brighton in Franklin County of the Adirondacks Mountains region of northern Upstate New York), where she was a trustee.

The Weills are recipients of the 2009 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award. Sanford I. Weill was the 2015 recipient of the Carnegie Hall Medal of Excellence.

In 2010, the Weills bought a 362-acre estate in Sonoma County, California. In March 2011, the Weills announced a $12 million gift to nearby Sonoma State University, providing the funds to complete the Donald and Maureen Green Music Center concert hall for a fall 2012 opening. The facility, inspired / influenced by the previous similar designed Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood, the famous music venue and music festival performance center (and the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 1937), near the towns of Lenox / Stockbridge of Berkshire County in the Berkshire Hills of Western Massachusetts, The matching Green Music Center pavilion in California has been named the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Hall. &quot;We love to be involved in the communities where we spend time,&quot; Sandy Weill commented to an interviewer.

In 2011, Rambam Medical Center in Haifa on the Mediterranean Sea northern coast of the State of Israel and its supporting organization of the American Friends of the Rambam Medical Center announced that Joan and Sandy Weill and the Weill Family Foundation made a donation of $10 million. In addition, the money was intended to support the Israeli-Palestinian Friendship Center and enable the hospital to better serve patients from the Palestinian / Arab-populated areas of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank by making residential hostel facilities available to their families while providing advanced medical training to Palestinian residents, fellows, and nursing staff.

In 2012, Weill was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, among other prominent Anericans.

In September 2013, Weill and his wife wrote an op-ed article for the CNBC business / financial news cable television network, stating that philanthropy goes beyond just money. &quot;For us, philanthropy is much more than just writing a check. It&#x27;s donating your time, energy, experience, and intellect to the causes and organizations you are passionate about.&quot;

In 2015, former trustee Joan Weill offered an additional $20 million to the Paul Smith&#x27;s College, but only if it changed its name to &quot;Joan Weill-Paul Smith&#x27;s College&quot;, a change that would have violated the terms of the devise of the school&#x27;s real property, which required that the school be &quot;forever known&quot; as Paul Smith&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences. Paul Smith&#x27;s then applied to the New York State Supreme Court in the state capital of Albany, for a release from the naming clause of Phelps Smith, the 1937 donor&#x27;s will, arguing that its continued future financial survival depended on receipt of trustee Mrs. Weill&#x27;s generous $20 million gift. Notwithstanding that argument, there was considerable opposition to the requested name change from college alumni and others. The college was originally funded by the last will and testament of Apollo (&quot;Paul&quot;) Smith&#x27;s youngest son, Phelps Smith, who specified that the collegiate institution should be &quot;forever known&quot; by his father&#x27;s, (Apollos (&quot;Paul&quot;) Smith (1825–1912), and founder of the notable local resort Paul Smith&#x27;s Hotel in the Adirondacks Mountains region of northern Upstate New York) name. In light of the potential donation, the college petitioned to be released from the will&#x27;s conditions, but their appeal was denied by Judge John T. Ellis of the state supreme court in August 2015, and the Weill donation was unfortunately withdrawn.

In 2016, Sandy and Joan Weill announced a $185 million contribution to the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) for a new neuroscience institute. At the time, the gift was the largest donation in the university branch campus&#x27; history. The Weill Institute for Neurosciences is now currently housed in a $316 million facility at UCSF&#x27;s Mission Bay campus in San Francisco. The Weills hope the Institute there will develop more effective treatments for such debilitating and increasing amounts of diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s diseases of the human brain, plus multiple sclerosis, sleep disorders, autism, and other brain-related ailments. In 2019, the Weills pledged an additional $106 million for neuroscience research at UCSF, along with similar other research work being done at the U.C. at Berkeley, and at the University of Washington in Seattle, further north up the West Coast. The Weills are among U.C. at Berkeley&#x27;s top benefactors, with the couple contributing over $52 million in fiscal year 2020 alone; Weill Hall is named in their honor, and Sandy Weill is a member of the university&#x27;s board of visitors.

<text>Public Opinion is a book by Walter Lippmann published in 1922. It is a critical assessment of functional democratic government, especially of the irrational and often self-serving social perceptions that influence individual behavior and prevent optimal societal cohesion. The detailed descriptions of the cognitive limitations people face in comprehending their sociopolitical and cultural environments, leading them to apply an evolving catalogue of general stereotypes to a complex reality, rendered &quot;Public Opinion&quot; a seminal text in the fields of media studies, political science, and social psychology.

==Pseudo-environment==
The introduction describes the human inability to interpret the world: &quot;The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance&quot; between people and their environment. Instead, people construct a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone&#x27;s pseudo-environment is a fiction. People &quot;live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones.&quot;

Human behavior is stimulated by the person&#x27;s pseudo-environment and then is acted upon in the real world. The book highlights some general implications of the interactions among one&#x27;s psychology, environment, and the mass communications media.

More recent research uses the term &quot;social constructionism&quot; or &quot;constructed reality&quot; to describe what Lippmann (1922) called &quot;pseudo-environment&quot;.

==News and truth==
By definition, pertinent facts are never provided completely and accurately; by necessity they are arranged to portray a certain, subjective interpretation of an event. Those who are most familiar with the greatest number of facts about a certain environment construct a pseudo-environment that aligns with their own &#x27;stereotypes&#x27; and convey this to the public, knowingly or not, to suit their own private needs. This is inescapable human nature. Propaganda inherently requires a barrier of censorship between the event and the public. Thus mass communication media, by their nature as vehicles for informational transmission, are essentially vulnerable to manipulation.

The blame for that perceptual parallax falls not upon the mass media technology (print, radio, cinema, or, inferentially, television) or logistical concerns, but upon certain members of society who attend to life with little intellectual engagement. That causes the following:

#The buying public: the &quot;bewildered herd&quot; (a term here borrowed from &quot;The Phantom Public&quot;) must pay to understand the unseen environment by the mass communications media. The irony is that although the public&#x27;s opinion is important, it must pay for its acceptance. People will be selective and will buy the most factual media at the lowest price: &quot;For a dollar, you may not even get an armful of candy, but for a dollar or less people expect reality/representations of truth to fall into their laps.&quot; The media have the social function of transmitting public affairs information and their business profit role of surviving in the market.
#Nature of news: people publish already-confirmed news that are thus less disputable. Officially-available public matters will constitute &quot;the news&quot; and unofficial (private) matters are unavailable, are less available, or are used as &quot;issues&quot; for propaganda.
#News truth and conclusion: the function of news is to signal an event, and that signalling, eventually, is a consequence of editorial selection and judgement; journalism creates and sows the seeds (news) that establish public opinion.

==Manufacture of consent==

Lippman argues that, when properly deployed in the public interest, the manufacture of consent is useful and necessary for a democratic society, because, in many cases, &quot;the common interests&quot; of the public are not obvious except upon careful analysis of the collected data, a critical intellectual exercise in which most people are uninterested or are incapable of doing. 

The political elite are members of the class of people who are incapable of accurately understanding, by themselves, the complex &quot;unseen environment&quot; wherein the public affairs of the modern state occur; thus, Lippmann proposes that a professional, &quot;specialized class&quot; collect and analyze data, and present their conclusions to the society&#x27;s decision makers, who, in their turn, use the &quot;art of persuasion&quot; to inform the public about the decisions and circumstances affecting them.

&quot;The Public and Its Problems&quot;, a 1927 book by John Dewey, agreed that the general public is irrational, but rejected Lippman&#x27;s call for a technocratic elite. Dewey believed that in a democracy, the people are also part of the public discourse. These contrasting opinions were discussed in the Lippmann-Dewey debate, which started to be widely discussed by the late 1980s in American communication studies circles.

Lippmann also figured prominently in work by academics Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky, who cited Lippmann&#x27;s advocacy of &quot;manufacture of consent&quot; which referred &quot;to the management of public opinion, which Lippmann felt was necessary for democracy to flourish, since he felt that public opinion was an irrational force.&quot;

<doc id="509191" wikidata="Q2166515" url="?curid=509191" title="Shedd Aquarium">
<text>Shedd Aquarium (formally the John G. Shedd Aquarium) is an indoor public aquarium in Chicago. Opened on May 30, 1930, the aquarium holds about 32,000 animals and is the third largest aquarium in the Western Hemisphere, after the Georgia Aquarium and Monterey Bay Aquarium.

The Shedd Aquarium is a highly-ranked world aquarium and at one time was the largest indoor facility in the world. It is the first inland aquarium with a permanent saltwater fish collection. The aquarium is located along Lake Michigan in the city&#x27;s Museum Campus, which also includes other highly-ranked institutions such as Adler Planetarium and the Field Museum of Natural History.

In 2015, the Shedd Aquarium had 2.02 million visitors. It was the most visited aquarium in the Western Hemisphere in 2005, and in 2007, became the most visited cultural institution in Chicago. The aquarium contains 1,500 species, including fish, marine mammals, birds, snakes, amphibians, and insects. The aquarium received awards for &quot;best exhibit&quot; from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) for Seahorse Symphony in 1999, Amazon Rising in 2001, and Wild Reef in 2004. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

==History==

Shedd Aquarium was the gift of retail leader John G. Shedd, a protégé of Marshall Field (benefactor of the adjacent Field Museum), to the city of Chicago. Although Shedd only lived long enough to see the architect&#x27;s first drawings for the aquarium, his widow, Mary R. Shedd, cut the ribbon at the official opening ceremony.

The aquarium cost $3 million to build (equivalent to $ in ), and initially included 132 exhibit tanks. Groundbreaking took place on November 2, 1927, and construction was completed on December 19, 1929; the first exhibits opened on May 30, 1930. As one of the first inland aquariums in the world, the Shedd had to rely on a custom-made railroad car, the Nautilus, for the transport of fish and seawater. The Nautilus lasted until 1959.

In 1930, 20 railroad tank cars made eight round trips between Key West and Chicago to transport of seawater for the Shedd&#x27;s saltwater exhibits. In 1933, Chicago hosted its second world&#x27;s fair, the Century of Progress. The Aquarium was located immediately north of the fairgrounds, and the museum gained exposure to a large international crowd.

In 1971, Shedd Aquarium added one of its most popular exhibits, a exhibit reproducing a Caribbean coral reef. That same year, the aquarium acquired its first crewed research vessel, a 75-foot (23 m) boat for exploring the Caribbean, to conduct field research and collect specimens. In 1985, this boat was replaced with the aquarium&#x27;s current vessel, the &quot;Coral Reef II&quot;. In 1987, Shedd Aquarium was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

John Shedd&#x27;s grandson, John Shedd Reed, who had served as president of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad from 1967 to 1986, was president of the aquarium&#x27;s board from 1984 until 1994, and was a life trustee until his death in 2008. Ted A. Beattie served as president and CEO of the aquarium from 1994 until his retirement in 2016. Bridget C. Coughlin assumed duties as president and CEO of the company in the Spring of 2016.

===Architecture===

Shedd Aquarium is notable for its architecture. The basic design, by architectural firm Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, is taken from classical Greek architecture, more specifically Beaux Arts, to match the other structures of the Museum Campus. The central aquarium building is octagonal, fronted by Doric columns and a formal staircase and topped by a dome. Aquatic motifs are worked in at every opportunity; tortoise shells, dolphins, octopuses, waves, and even the Trident of Poseidon can be found all over the aquarium&#x27;s exterior and interior.

Improving upon its predecessor inland aquarium, the Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit, extensive use was made of designs by Mary Chase Perry Stratton, incorporating her custom-made Pewabic Pottery tile. The Oceanarium is done in a more modern style representing the Pacific Northwest, but one that blends with the older part of the building. &quot;Whale Harbor&quot;, the Oceanarium&#x27;s main tank, is backed by a wall of windows that look out onto Lake Michigan.

==Exhibits and presentations==
There are several permanent exhibits at Shedd: Waters of the World, Caribbean Reef, Amazon Rising, Wild Reef, and the Abbott Oceanarium.

===Waters of the World===

The oldest galleries in the aquarium feature exhibits on oceans, rivers, islands and lakes, and Chicago&#x27;s own local waters. Species on exhibit include American bullfrog, a giant Pacific octopus, American alligator, lake sturgeon, starfish, lined seahorses, and alligator snapping turtle.

===Caribbean Reef===
The Caribbean Reef exhibit was built in 1971, on the site of the aquarium&#x27;s very first exhibit, the Tropical Pool. A feature of this exhibit is a diver that interacts with the animals while talking with the people. A part of the exhibit is a circular tank that allows for maximum walk-around viewing. It was one of the first habitats to display schooling fish. It is also home to the rescued green sea turtle, Nickel, as well as Atlantic tarpons, cownose rays, redband parrotfish, Bonnethead sharks, a Green moray eel, and many more species. The exhibit is near the center of the first floor. It is adjacent to Amazon Rising, Waters of the World, and Wild Reef. The Caribbean Reef tank was closed in 2023 and will eventually be replaced with the Caribbean Reef tunnel connecting the two main sections of the aquarium building, while two new tanks will eventually replace the original Caribbean Reef tank.

===Amazon Rising===
The Amazon Rising exhibit is an walkthrough flooded forest recreation of the Amazon River and the surrounding jungle. This exhibit contains 250 different species, and its highest water level is . Species from this area on exhibit include a green anaconda, red-bellied piranhas, electric eels, freshwater stingrays, dwarf caimans, caiman lizards, wattled jacanas, yellow-spotted river turtles, red-footed tortoises, yellow-footed tortoises, mata matas, Arapaimas, different species of South American birds, fish, and frogs, and many more.

===Wild Reef===

In 2003, Shedd opened Wild Reef, a permanent exhibit located two levels below the main building. The exhibit contains a total of and recreates a Philippine coral reef on the Apo Island marine reserve, complete with living coral, multiple species of fish and rays, and a collection of sharks such as sandbar, zebra, blacktip reef sharks, white-spotted guitarfish, Spotted wobbegongs, and Japanese wobbegongs.

The main draw of this attraction is a shark tank with high curved windows, allowing visitors a diver&#x27;s-eye view. The Wild Reef exhibit also features a saltwater tank display area where coral is propagated and grown for conservation purposes.

===Oceanarium===
In 1991, Shedd Aquarium opened the Oceanarium (known since 2010 as the Abbott Oceanarium), a large addition to the aquarium that features marine mammals, including Pacific white-sided dolphins, beluga whales, sea otters and California sea lions, on the right side of the stairway that is next to the sea lions is an open estuary tank for several cuttlefish and by the sea otter exhibit, is a large natural looking touch tank for tide pool creatures like crabs, sea cucumbers and sea anemones. The lower level of the Oceanarium allows underwater viewing of the beluga whales and the dolphins. It holds in total; the largest single tank is the &quot;Whale Harbour&quot;.

The Oceanarium is the largest indoor marine mammal facility in the world. The Oceanarium also houses a 1,000-seat amphitheater which presents an educational marine mammal show. Several of the sea otters that lived in the aquarium in the past were rescued from the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill in 1989. In the fall of 2008, Shedd&#x27;s Oceanarium was closed for preventive sealing as well as administrative upgrades. The animals in the exhibit area were temporarily moved to other zoos and aquariums until the exhibit reopened in May 2009.

===Polar Play Zone===
The exhibit is an interactive play area for children and contains an underwater viewing area of the beluga whales, Pacific white-sided dolphins and sea otters. The exhibit also includes Southern rockhopper penguins and magellanic penguins, as well as 5 circular tanks for moon jellyfish and starfishes that are by an interactive submarine model. There is also a starfish touch pool.

===Stingray Touch===
Located on the aquarium&#x27;s South Terrace, this exhibit allows guests to touch cownose rays as they swim around their outdoor exhibit and is open seasonally from May through October.

=== Plankton Revealed ===
The Plankton Revealed exhibit opened in July 2023 focuses on the importance of plankton and features flamboyant cuttlefish, white-spotted jellyfish, brine shrimp and other small animals. This interactive exhibit is the aquarium&#x27;s first to be fully bilingual, featuring Spanish translations.

===4D Theater===
The 4D Theater opened in 2009 as part of the renovation of the Abbott Oceanarium. The 4D experience includes a 3D film with interactive seats, high-tech audio and interactive elements like scents and bubbles. Films shown have included &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D&quot;, &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot;, and &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (seasonal).

==Previous special exhibits==
=== Jellies ===

The &quot;jellies&quot; exhibit opened in April 2011, focusing on jellyfish, and the misconceptions surrounding them. It featured at least 10 species of jellyfish, including moon jellyfish, egg-yolk jellyfish, purple-striped jelly, Atlantic sea nettle, jelly blubber and upside-down jellyfish. The exhibit closed in 2015.

=== Underwater Beauty ===
This exhibit opened on May 25, 2018, and focused on the visual beauty of sea life, with sections called &quot;Color&quot;, &quot;Patterns&quot;, and &quot;Rhythms.&quot; The exhibit featured 100 different species of fish and invertebrate, displayed to accent their visual qualities, including the ribbon eel, lagoon jelly, flower hat jelly, peacock mantis shrimp, Weedy seadragon and longnose hawkfish. The exhibit closed on April 17, 2023.

The Seahorse Symphony exhibit opened in 1998 and ran through 2003. It featured trumpetfish, snipefish, shrimpfish, leafy seadragon, banded pipefish, seahorse, and the weedy seadragon.

=== Crabs! ===
Crabs! opened on May 17, 2005 as part of the Shedd Aquarium&#x27;s 75th anniversary celebration. Until its closure on January 8, 2006, it was the largest exhibition of crabs in the United States.

=== Lizards and the Komodo King ===
From 2006 to 2008, this exhibit featured over 25 species of reptiles, including a Komodo dragon, green tree monitors, Gila monsters, caiman lizards, geckos, and a crocodile monitor.

==Animals on exhibit, past and present==

===Australian Lungfish===
Granddad

Walter Chute, the aquarium&#x27;s director from 1928 to 1964, wanted rare fish to attract the 10 million tourists expected to visit Chicago for the exposition in 1933. Granddad, an Australian lungfish, arrived at the Shedd in 1933, along with his mate, from Sydney during the Century of Progress world exposition. During the expo&#x27;s run, they attracted about 4.5 million visitors.

At Granddad&#x27;s death in 2017, he was claimed by the aquarium to be the oldest fish in any aquarium in the world. He was 109 years old; he weighed and was in length. His normal behavior was to lay like a sunken log on the bottom of his habitat.

===Beluga whales===
The Shedd Aquarium currently has eight living Belugas as of November 15, 2022: Naya (F), Beethoven (M), Kayavak (F), Bella (F), Aurek (M), Kimalu (F), Annik (M) and Atlas (M).

Mauyak, Qannik, Miki, Kimalu, Annik: In 2000, Mauyak gave birth to Qannik, who was sent to Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma where he died in 2009. On August 16, 2007, Mauyak gave birth yet again to a male calf named Miki, the Inuit word for ″small″ bringing the total number of successful beluga calf births at the aquarium to four since 1999. Miki has been moved to the Mystic Aquarium in 2016. On August 27, 2012, Mauyak gave birth to a female calf, Kimalu. On July 3, 2019, Mauyak gave birth to a male calf, Annik, bringing the total number of belugas at Shedd to eight. Mauyak died on Saturday, November 12, 2022. 

Immiayuk, Kayavak: Kayavak is one of the most famous residents of the Oceanarium. The whale became an orphan at only nearly five months old after her mother, Immiayuk, died. Trainers fed Kayavak fish, cared for her day and night, taught her how to &quot;be a whale&quot;, and she thrived to be the healthy adult she is today.

Puiji, Bella, and Nunavik: In 2006, the beluga whale Puiji gave birth to a female calf, later named Bella. On December 14, 2009, she gave birth to a 162-pound, five-foot, four-inch male calf. Although it was a difficult birth, the calf survived and debuted to the public on Sunday, January 24, 2010. He has since been named &quot;Nunavik&quot; meaning &quot;friendly, beautiful, and wild&quot;. Nunavik currently lives at the Georgia Aquarium as of 2016. Puiji died on Wednesday, October 26, 2011, following a seizure after having been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed medical condition over the course of several months.

Naluark: Naluark was transferred to Mystic Aquarium &amp; Institute for Exploration in Mystic, Connecticut, in October 2011. He has since been moved to SeaWorld Orlando in 2016.

Naya: Naya first arrived at Shedd Aquarium in 1992. She has since had four calves. Her first was a stillborn in 2002. She then gave birth on December 20, 2009 to a 162-pound, five-foot two-inch male calf, though the calf died two days later from complications during birth. In 2020, Naya gave birth to premature twins. The first calf, a female born head first, survived being born. The second calf, born tail first, was a stillborn. Unfortunately, because the calves were premature twins, the first calf had multiple health issues and died 15 days later despite being in the care of staff members.

===Alaskan sea otters===
Yaku (son of Kenai) was euthanized on February 26, 2022, due to failing health brought on by a tumor in his chest.

Kenai (&quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill survivor) was euthanized on October 9, 2012, due to failing health brought on by advancing years.

Kachemak (oldest sea otter in a North American Aquarium/Zoo) was euthanized on August 24, 2013, due to failing health related to age.

Seldovia (M) arrived at the Shedd Aquarium on November 29th, 2023. He is currently the only Alaskan sea otter at Shedd and shares his habitat with the Southern sea otters.

===Southern sea otters===
Luna (F), Cooper (M), Watson (M), Suri (F), Willow (F).

===Pacific white-sided dolphins===

The aquarium has seven white sided dolphins: Loke (F), Kri (F), Katrl (F), Munchkin (F), Makoa (M), Elelo (M), and Harmony (F).

Males Sagu and Makoa were conceived by Li&#x27;i at the Miami Seaquarium when Piquet was on a breeding loan there. Piquet gave birth to Sagu on Memorial Day weekend in 2012. Piquet gave birth to her second calf, Makoa, on June 1, 2015. Piquet was moved to Miami Seaquarium in early 2018 for a breeding loan and Ipo was transferred to Shedd to take her place. Piquet was later transferred back in May of 2019. In August of that year, she miscarried a calf sired by Li&#x27;i. Ipo and Piquet were moved to SeaWorld San Antonio in October of 2020. Sagu died in May of 2021. 

Kri has lived at the Shedd Aquarium on and off since 1991. She was transferred to the Mystic Aquarium in 2009 due to construction on Shedd&#x27;s oceanarium, and the Miami Seaquarium in 2013 for a breeding loan. Kri had a stillborn calf in 2003 that was sired through artificial insemination. 

Katrl first arrived along with Piquet to Shedd Aquarium in 1993. On April 18, 2016, Katrl gave birth to a male calf sired by Li&#x27;i. The calf was placed on display on June 18, 2016, and was named Kukdlaa, meaning &quot;Bubbles&quot; in the Tlingit language. Kukdlaa died in 2019. Harmony was born to Katrl and Sagu on August 31, 2020, hours after a rare twin beluga birth. 

Loke and her then 5-year-old son Elelo arrived to Shedd Aquarium on August 3, 2023 after living off-display at the Miami Seaquarium for Elelo&#x27;s entire life. The move was a result of several USDA reports that noted Miami Seaquarium&#x27;s poor facility state. It is unknown if the two will be transferred back, as the Miami Seaquarium&#x27;s remaining Pacific white-sided dolphin, Li&#x27;i, was transferred to SeaWorld San Antonio in September of 2023.

===Green sea turtle===
Nickel

Nickel is a female green sea turtle who resides at the Caribbean Reef exhibit located in directly in front of the main lobby. Nickel was rescued on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast area in 1998, where she was struck by the propellers of a motorboat. This accident damaged her shell and paralyzed her from the waist down causing her to have buoyancy problems.

Researchers thought that she could no longer live in the wild so she was brought to Shedd in the spring of 2003. Upon her arrival, she went through several medical examinations, including an x-ray. The x-ray revealed a 1975 nickel lodged in her throat which is where she received the name, Nickel. Nickel is one of the many rescued animals that reside in the Shedd. She serves as an example to many people of the effects human activities can have on wildlife.

===North American river otter===
Rio

Euthanized on October 29, 2013, due to age related health issues, Rio was 21 and lived well past the median life expectancy of a North American river otter.

=== Grouper === 
Bubba

Bubba, a male Queensland grouper, was believed to be the first fish to undergo chemotherapy. He was introduced to the aquarium in 1987 and died in 2006.

=== Tarpon ===
Deadeye

Deadeye, a female Atlantic tarpon, was the oldest fish to reside at the Caribbean Reef in the aquarium. She was first introduced to the aquarium in 1935 and died in 1998.

==Conservation and research==

The Daniel P. Haerther Center for Conservation and Research helps to provide on-site research at the aquarium. They study topics such as animal health and behavior, nutrition, animal training, reproduction and genetics.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) designated the Shedd Aquarium as its Center for Species Survival:Freshwater, to study and promote the conservation and restoration of global freshwater systems, and strategies for freshwater species survival.

The aquarium also partners with conservation efforts in the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. The Bahamian rock iguana is one of the most endangered lizards in the world. Since 1994, the Shedd Aquarium has been studying and providing conservation plans for this iguana. The Shedd Aquarium is now recognized as the lead authority on this iguana. In Southeast Asia, the Shedd partners with Project Seahorse to monitor and map out the seahorse populations in Southeast Asia.

Since 1991, the Shedd Aquarium has been involved with research focused on beluga whales. They focus on the animal handling procedures to ensure the animals’ welfare. The aquarium conducts most of their beluga whale research in Bristol Bay in southwest Alaska.

<text>Evaristo Felice Dall&#x27;Abaco (12 July 1675, Verona, Italy — 12 July 1742, Munich, Bavaria) was an Italian composer, violinist, and cellist.

== Life ==
Dall&#x27;Abaco was born in Verona to renowned guitarist Damiano dall&#x27;Abaco. He is thought to have been a pupil of Torelli&#x27;s from whom he would have learned violin and cello.

He became a violinist with Tommaso Antonio Vitali in Modena, and in 1704 joined the court of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria in Munich as &quot;Kammermusiker&quot;. After only a few months, he fled with the court to Brussels following Maximilian&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Blenheim. When he went into exile with the court, he spent time in France and absorbed some of the influences there. On Maximilian&#x27;s restoration and return to Munich in 1715, Dall&#x27;Abaco was appointed &quot;Concert-meister&quot;. He continued to compose chamber music at the French and Dutch courts until 1740, when he retired. Dall&#x27;Abaco&#x27;s music is especially indebted to Vivaldi and Corelli. Dall&#x27;Abaco died on his 67th birthday.

While in Brussels, dall&#x27;Abaco fathered Joseph Abaco (1710–1805).

<doc id="509209" wikidata="Q5519442" url="?curid=509209" title="Galvin railway station">
<text>Galvin railway station is a closed railway station which was located on the Werribee line of the Melbourne suburban rail system in Australia. It was located adjacent to Maidstone Street, Altona, and was situated between Paisley and Laverton stations.

== History ==
Galvin station opened on 27 August 1927 and was named after Michael Galvin, the Werribee shire president at the time. It was a public platform, but it played a particular role in providing passenger services for workers at industries being established in the area. When the line between Altona Junction and Laverton was duplicated in 1967,
Galvin was provided with an island platform. After the system of public transport fare zones was instituted in the early 1980s, Galvin became the border between Zones 1 and 2 on the Werribee Line.

In 1985, a new extension joining Westona and Laverton stations was opened. The Werribee line had been electrified two years earlier,but after the construction of the Westona - Laverton link, trains on the Werribee line were diverted via Altona and Westona to try to make a more viable route, because both Galvin and the nearby Paisley station were little used. As a result, both Galvin and Paisley were bypassed and closed. The last trains stopped at the station on 14 April 1985.

After closure, the station building and platforms were demolished, but the track slew to allow for Galvin&#x27;s island platform remains.

<text>Soldier Field is a multi-purpose stadium on the Near South Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Opened in 1924 and reconstructed in 2003, the stadium has served as the home of the Chicago Bears from the National Football League (NFL) since 1971, as well as Chicago Fire FC of Major League Soccer (MLS) from 1998 to 2006 and since 2020. It also regularly hosts stadium concerts and other large crowd events. The stadium has a football capacity of 62,500, making it the smallest stadium in the NFL. Soldier Field is also the oldest stadium established in the NFL and 3rd oldest in MLS.

The stadium&#x27;s interior was rebuilt as part of a major renovation project in 2002, which modernized the facility but lowered its seating capacity, eventually causing it to be delisted as a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Soldier Field has served as the home venue for a number of other sports teams in its history, including the Chicago Cardinals of the NFL and University of Notre Dame football. It hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and multiple CONCACAF Gold Cup championships. In 1968, it hosted the inaugural World Games of the Special Olympics, as well as its second World Games in 1970. Other historic events have included large rallies with speeches, including by Amelia Earhart, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King Jr.

==History==

On December 3, 1919, Chicago-based architectural firm Holabird &amp; Roche was chosen to design the stadium, which broke ground on August 11, 1922. The stadium cost $13 million to construct (equivalent to $ million in ), a large sum for a sporting venue at that time (in comparison, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum had cost less than US$1 million in 1923 dollars). On October 9, 1924, the 53rd anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire, the stadium was officially dedicated as &quot;Grant Park Stadium&quot;, although it had hosted a few events before then, including a field day for Chicago police officers on September 6, and the stadium&#x27;s first football game, between Louisville Male High School and Austin Community Academy High School, on October 4. On November 22, the stadium hosted its first college football game, in which Notre Dame defeated Northwestern University 13–6.

On November 11, 1925, the stadium&#x27;s name was changed to Soldier Field, in dedication to U.S. soldiers who had died in combat during World War I. Its formal rededication as Soldier Field was held during the 29th annual playing of the Army–Navy Game on November 27, 1926. Several months earlier, in June 1926, the stadium hosted several events during the 28th International Eucharistic Congress, the first held in the United States. During the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair in 1933, it served as the main stage.

The stadium&#x27;s design is in the Neoclassical style, with Doric columns rising above the East and West entrances. In its earliest configuration, Soldier Field was capable of seating 74,280 spectators, and was in the shape of a U. Additional seating could be added along the interior field, upper promenades, and on the large, open field and terrace beyond the north endzone, bringing the seating capacity to over 100,000.

===Chicago Bears move in===
Before they moved into the stadium, the Chicago Bears had played select charity games at Soldier Field as early as , when they played their former crosstown rivals, the Chicago Cardinals. The Cardinals also used the stadium as their home field for their final season in the city in 1959.

In , the Bears moved into Soldier Field full-time, originally with a three-year commitment. The team previously played home games at Wrigley Field, the home stadium of the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB), but were forced to move to a larger venue due to post-AFL–NFL merger policies requiring that stadium capacities seat at least 50,000 spectators as well as lighting for potential night games. The Bears had initially intended to build a stadium in Arlington Heights, but the property did not fit the league&#x27;s specifications.

On September 19, 1971, the Bears played their first home game at Soldier Field, in which they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 17–15. In 1978, the Bears and the Chicago Park District agreed to a 20-year lease and renovation of the stadium; both parties pooled their resources for the renovation. The playing surface was AstroTurf from 1971 until 1987, and was replaced with natural grass in 1988. On February 27, 1987, Soldier Field was designated a National Historic Landmark.

===Replacement talks===
In 1989, Soldier Field&#x27;s future was in jeopardy after a proposal was created for a &quot;McDome&quot;, which was intended to be a domed stadium for the Bears, but was rejected by the Illinois Legislature in 1990. Because of this, Bears president Michael McCaskey considered relocation as a possible factor for a new stadium. The Bears had also purchased options in Hoffman Estates, Elk Grove Village and Aurora. In 1995, McCaskey announced that he and Northwest Indiana developers agreed to construction of an entertainment complex called &quot;Planet Park&quot;, which would also include a new stadium. However, the plan was rejected by the Lake County Council, and in 1998, then-Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley proposed that the Bears share Comiskey Park with the Chicago White Sox.

===Renovations===
Beginning in 1978, the plank seating was replaced by individual seats with backs and armrests. In 1982, a new press box, as well as 60 skyboxes, were added to the stadium, boosting its capacity to 66,030. In 1988, 56 more skyboxes were added, increasing capacity to 66,946. Capacity was slightly increased to 66,950 in 1992. By 1994, however, capacity was slightly reduced to 66,944. During the renovation, seating capacity was reduced to 55,701 by building a grandstand in the open end of the U shape. This moved the field closer to both ends in order to move the fans closer to the field, at the expense of seating capacity. The front row 50-yard line seats were only away from the sidelines, the shortest distance of all NFL stadiums until MetLife Stadium opened in 2010 with a distance of .

====2002–03 renovation and landmark delisting====

In 2001, the Chicago Park District, which owns the structure, faced substantial criticism when it announced plans to alter the stadium with a design by Benjamin T. Wood and Carlos Zapata of Wood + Zapata in Boston. The stadium grounds were reconfigured by local architecture firm Lohan Associate, led by architect Dirk Lohan, grandson of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The stadium&#x27;s interior would be demolished and reconstructed while the exterior would be preserved in an example of facadism. A similar endeavor of constructing a new stadium within the confines of a historic stadium&#x27;s exterior was done with Leipzig&#x27;s Red Bull Arena, which similarly built a modern stadium while preserving the exterior of the original Zentralstadion. Fans and radio hosts, such as WSCR&#x27;s Mike North, criticized the small seating capacity of the new venue, and others have criticized the Park District&#x27;s lack of care to the field surface after the first seasonal freeze and a refusal to consider a new-generation artificial surface, leaving the Bears to play on dead grass.

On January 19, 2002, the night of the Bears&#x27; playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, demolition began as tailgate fires still burned in trash cans in the parking lots. The removal of 24,000 stadium seats in 36 hours by Archer Seating Clearinghouse, a speed record never exceeded since, was the first step in building the new Soldier Field. Nostalgic Bears fans recalling the team&#x27;s glory seasons (especially 1985), as well as some retired players, picked up their seats in the South parking lot. The foremen on the job were Grant Wedding, who installed the seats himself in 1979, and Mark Wretschko, an executive for the factory who made the new seats. As Soldier Field underwent renovation, the Bears spent the 2002 NFL season playing their home games at Memorial Stadium at the University of Illinois. On September 29, , the Bears played their first game at the renovated Soldier Field, in which they were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 38–23. The total funding for the renovation cost $632 million; taxpayers were responsible for $432 million while the Chicago Bears and the NFL contributed $200 million.

Several writers and columnists attacked the Soldier Field renovation project as an aesthetic, political and financial nightmare. The project received mixed reviews within the architecture community, with criticism from civic and preservation groups. Prominent architect and native Chicagoan Stanley Tigerman called it &quot;a fiasco. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; architecture critic Blair Kamin dubbed it the &quot;Eyesore on the Lake Shore,&quot; while others called it &quot;Monstrosity on the Midway&quot; or &quot;Mistake by the Lake&quot;. The renovation was described by some as if &quot;a spaceship landed on the stadium&quot;. Lohan responded:

I would never say that Soldier Field is an architectural landmark. Nobody has copied it; nobody has learned from it. People like it for nostalgic reasons. They remember the games and parades and tractor pulls and veterans&#x27; affairs they&#x27;ve seen there over the years. I wouldn&#x27;t do this if it were the Parthenon. But this isn&#x27;t the Parthenon.

Proponents of the renovation argued it was badly needed because of aging and cramped facilities. &quot;The New York Times&quot; named the renovated Soldier Field one of the five best new buildings of 2003. Soldier Field was given an award in design excellence by the American Institute of Architects in 2004.

On September 23, 2004, as a result of the renovation, a 10-member federal advisory committee unanimously recommended that Soldier Field be delisted as a National Historic Landmark. The recommendation to delist was prepared by Carol Ahlgren, an architectural historian at the National Park Service&#x27;s Midwest Regional Office in Omaha, Nebraska, who was quoted in Preservation Online stating, &quot;if we had let this stand, I believe it would have lowered the standard of National Historic Landmarks throughout the country. ... If we want to keep the integrity of the program, let alone the landmarks, we really had no other recourse.&quot; The stadium lost the landmark designation on February 17, 2006.

===Subsequent developments===
In May 2012, Soldier Field became the first NFL stadium to achieve LEED status, a program intended to award environmentally sustainable buildings.

On July 9, 2019, the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer (MLS) announced an agreement with the Village of Bridgeview to release the team from their lease with SeatGeek Stadium, where they had played since 2006. As a result, the Fire returned to Soldier Field for the 2020 MLS season.

On June 17, 2021, the Chicago Bears submitted a bid for the Arlington Park Racetrack property, making a move from Soldier Field to a new venue more possible. On September 29, the Bears and Churchill Downs Incorporated announced that they had reached an agreement for the property.

On September 5, 2022, the Kentucky bluegrass was replaced with Bermuda grass after poor field conditions were noted in an August 13 preseason game.

==Public transportation==
The closest Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; station to Soldier Field is the Roosevelt station on the Orange, Green and Red lines. The Chicago Transit Authority also operates the #128 Soldier Field Express bus route to the stadium from Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station. There are also two Metra stations close by: the Museum Campus/11th Street station on the Metra Electric Line, which also is used by South Shore Line trains, and 18th Street, which is only served by the Metra Electric Line. Pace also provides access from the Northwest, West and Southwest suburbs to the stadium with four express routes from Schaumburg, Lombard, Bolingbrook, Burr Ridge, Palos Heights and Oak Lawn.

==Facility contracts==
The pouring rights of non-alcoholic beverages at Soldier Field were held by The Coca-Cola Company from at least 1992 until 2012, when the Bears signed a contract with Dr Pepper Snapple Group (later Keurig Dr Pepper), making it the only stadium in the NFL then (with Cleveland Browns Stadium striking a similar deal in 2018) to have such rights held by the company. With the 2003 renovation, the Bears gained power in striking sponsorship deals at Soldier Field; the Miller Brewing Company was given the pouring rights of alcoholic beverages, while Delaware North Sportservice was named the food and beverage service provider. Aramark took over service operations at the stadium when the latter contract expired in 2013.

==Events==

===American football===
====Single events====
*The stadium hosted its first football game on October 4, 1924, between Louisville Male High School and Chicago&#x27;s Austin Community Academy High School; Louisville&#x27;s team won 26–0.
*Over 100,000 spectators attended the 1926 Army–Navy Game. It would decide the national championship, as Navy entered undefeated and Army had lost only to Notre Dame. The game lived up to its hype, and even though it ended in a 21–21 tie, Navy was awarded the national championship.
*The all-time collegiate attendance record of 123,000+ was established November 26, 1927, as Notre Dame beat the USC Trojans 7–6. Subsequently, in 2016, 150,000+ attended a game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and Tennessee Volunteers at Bristol Speedway.
*Austin defeated Leo to win the 1937 Chicago Prep Bowl; another contender for the highest attendance ever (estimated at over 120,000 spectators). The Chicago Prep Bowl games are held at Soldier Field yearly on the day after Thanksgiving. The bowl game is older than the IHSA state championship tournament held since the 1960s.
*The stadium was host to 41 College All-Star Games, an exhibition between the previous year&#x27;s NFL champion (or, in its final years, Super Bowl champion) and a team of collegiate all-star players prior to their reporting to their new professional teams training camps. This game was discontinued after the 1976 NFL season. The final game in 1976 was halted in the third quarter when a torrential thunderstorm broke out and play was never resumed.
*The University of Notre Dame has hosted two games at Soldier Field, as part of their Shamrock Series. The first was in 2012, against the University of Miami, with another, against the University of Wisconsin-Madison, following in 2021.

====NFL playoffs====
:*1985 NFC Divisional Playoff: New York Giants 0, Chicago Bears 21. The last home playoff game was in 1963, when the team played in Wrigley Field. 
:*1985 NFC Championship Game: Los Angeles Rams 0, Chicago Bears 24. This was the first NFC Championship held here.
:*1986 NFC Divisional Playoff: Washington 27, Chicago Bears 13.

<text>Bentley University is a private university in Waltham, Massachusetts, United States. It was founded in 1917 as a school of accounting and finance in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood. Bentley has one undergraduate school which offers 17 business majors and 14 arts and sciences majors, as well as 39 minors. Its graduate school offers five master&#x27;s degrees, an MBA with eight disciplines, and three PhD programs.

While Bentley&#x27;s main campus hosts almost all of its services, the university also has another campus one mile north. The North Campus hosts four residential buildings.

==History==
Bentley University was founded in 1917 as the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance by Harry C. Bentley, who served as the school&#x27;s president until 1953. In 1961, the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Thomas Lincoln Morison, who moved the college from its Boylston Street address in Boston to its current-day location in Waltham, Massachusetts. Land for this move was purchased from the Lyman Estate in 1962, and the construction to develop the campus then lasted from 1963 to 1968.

Gregory H. Adamian, a major driving force in the college&#x27;s development, became the fourth president in 1970. Under his guidance, the college became accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1971 and graduate degrees in 1973. During this time, the school also changed its name to Bentley College. In 2002, Bentley College opened up a campus in the Middle Eastern country of Bahrain in partnership with the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance. The college was accredited to confer its first doctoral degrees in the fields of business and accountancy in 2005. A main fixture of the campus, The Bentley Library, underwent a sweeping renovation in 2006 during which time the school&#x27;s logo was changed to showcase the clock tower that sits atop the building. One year later, Gloria Cordes Larson, a former state and federal government official and Boston-based lawyer, became the first female president of Bentley College.

In 2008, under the leadership of provost Bob Galliers, the school changed its name to Bentley University after being authorized by the state board of higher education to do so. Alison Davis-Blake, the former dean of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota and of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, became Bentley&#x27;s eighth president in July 2018. She stepped down in June 2020 and was replaced by Interim President Paul Condrin, the chair of the board of trustees. In March 2021, the board unanimously appointed E. LaBrent Chrite to serve as Bentley&#x27;s ninth president.

==Academics==
The Masters of Human Factors in Information Design program is offered in San Francisco. Students take four of the required courses in California, five courses online, and the 10th course at Bentley&#x27;s &quot;User Experience Center&quot;. The program was designed to accommodate the busy schedules of tech professionals and to draw students from a wide geographic area. Each course is delivered in an executive format: three class meetings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, followed by four weeks of faculty-monitored virtual teamwork, and closing with a Friday/Saturday meeting in the classroom. 

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, Bentley University accepted 57.9% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered very high, applicant competition considered average, and those admitted having an average 3.75 high school GPA. The university does not require submission of standardized test scores, Bentley being a test optional school, where test scores will be considered if submitted. Those accepted who submitted test scores had an average 1340 SAT score (27% submitting scores) or average 30 ACT score (5% submitting scores).

<text>MDFMK was an industrial rock band formed by two members of KMFDM, Sascha Konietzko and Tim Sköld. Lucia Cifarelli, formerly of the band Drill, later joined to make a trio.

==History==
Due to &quot;differences in vision and drive&quot;, KMFDM disbanded in 1999. Sascha Konietzko and Skold continued working together under the name MDFMK. Konietzko was living in New York at the time, and auditioned female singers to provide vocals for the album. Through this process, he selected Lucia Cifarelli (formerly of the band Drill). The trio released only one album: &quot;MDFMK&quot; (2000, Universal Records). All three shared vocal duties on the album. Their song &quot;Missing Time,&quot; originally made for an earlier version of the video game &quot;Prey&quot;, was used in the animated movie &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;.

The band toured the United States and Canada in 2000, during which it had a fourth member, a giant robot guitarist named Zyclor. 

Konietzko stated in 2003 that there was material for what he called &quot;MDFMK #2&quot;, but that Universal Records was &quot;sitting on it&quot;. He also said that if Universal never released the material, he would eventually buy the rights to it and release it himself.

<doc id="509229" wikidata="Q3298759" url="?curid=509229" title="United States occupation of Haiti">
<text>The United States occupation of Haiti began on July 28, 1915, when 330 US Marines landed at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, after the National City Bank of New York convinced the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, to take control of Haiti&#x27;s political and financial interests. The July 1915 occupation took place following years of socioeconomic instability within Haiti that culminated with the lynching of President of Haiti Vilbrun Guillaume Sam by a mob angered by his decision to order the executions of political prisoners. 

During the occupation, Haiti had three new presidents while the United States ruled as a military regime through martial law led by Marines and the Gendarmerie. A corvée system of forced labor was used by the United States for infrastructure projects, resulting in hundreds to thousands of deaths. Under the occupation, most Haitians continued to live in poverty, while American personnel were well compensated. The American occupation ended the constitutional ban on foreign ownership of land, which had existed since the foundation of Haiti.

The occupation ended on August 1, 1934, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt reaffirmed an August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last contingent of marines departed on August 15, 1934, after a formal transfer of authority to the American-created Gendarmerie of Haiti.

==Background==

In the late 1700s, the relationship between Haitians and the United States began when some Haitians fought beside Americans in the American Revolutionary War. Originally the wealthiest region in the Americas when it was the French colony of Saint-Domingue, a slave revolt at the colony beginning in 1791 that led to the successful Haitian Revolution in 1804 frightened those living in the Southern United States who supported slavery, raising fears that it would inspire other slaves. Such sentiments among wealthy slaveholding Americans strained relations between the United States and Haiti, with the United States initially refusing to recognize Haitian independence while slaveholders advocated for a trade embargo with the newly created Caribbean nation. The Haiti indemnity controversy – which France forced upon Haiti through gunboat diplomacy in 1825 due to France&#x27;s financial loss following Haiti&#x27;s independence – resulted with Haiti using much of its revenue to pay debt to foreign nations by the late-1800s.

The United States had been interested in controlling Haiti in the decades following its independence from France. As a way &quot;to secure a US defensive and economic stake in the West Indies&quot;, according to the United States Department of State, President Andrew Johnson of the United States began the pursuit of annexing Hispaniola, including Haiti, in 1868. In 1890, the Môle Saint-Nicolas affair occurred when President Benjamin Harrison, on the advice of Secretary of State James G. Blaine, ordered Rear-Admiral Bancroft Gherardi to persuade newly assumed President of Haiti Florvil Hyppolite to lease the port to the United States. Enforcing gunboat diplomacy upon Haiti, Gherardi aboard along with his fleet arrived in the capital city of Port-au-Prince to demand the acquisition of Môle Saint-Nicolas. President Hyppolite refused any agreement as Haitians grew angered by the presence of the fleet, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that the Haitians&#x27; &quot;semi-barbaric minds saw in it a threat of violence&quot;. Upon returning to the United States in 1891, Gherardi said in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that in a short time Haiti would experience further instability, suggesting that future governments in Haiti would abide by the demands of the United States.

By the 1890s, Haiti became reliant on importing most of its goods from the United States while it exported the majority of its production to France. The Roosevelt Corollary also affected Haiti&#x27;s relationship with the United States. By 1910, President William Howard Taft attempted to introduce American businesses to Haiti in order to deter European influence and granted a large loan to Haiti to pay off foreign debts, though this proved to be fruitless due to the size of the debt.

===German presence===
The United States was not concerned by France&#x27;s influence, though German influence in Haiti raised concern. Germany had intervened in Haiti, including the Lüders affair in 1897, and had been influencing other Caribbean nations during the previous few decades. Germany had also become increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under the Monroe Doctrine.

The United States&#x27; concern over Germany&#x27;s ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which, although numbering only about 200 in 1910, wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about eighty percent of the country&#x27;s international commerce. They owned and operated utilities in Cap-Haïten and Port-au-Prince, including the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and also had built the railway serving the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac.

The German community was more willing to integrate into Haitian society than any other group of European foreigners, including the more numerous French. Some Germans had married into Haiti&#x27;s most prominent mixed-race families of African-French descent. This enabled them to bypass the constitutional prohibition against foreigners owning land. The German residents retained strong ties to their homeland and sometimes aided the German military and intelligence networks in Haiti. They also served as the principal financiers of the nation&#x27;s numerous revolutions, floating loans at high interest rates to the competing political factions.

In the lead-up to World War I, the strategic importance of Haiti, along with the German influence there, worried President Wilson, who feared a German presence near the Panama Canal Zone.

===Haitian instability===
In the first decades of the 20th century, Haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to France, Germany, and the United States. The Wilson administration viewed Haiti&#x27;s instability as a national security threat to the United States. Political tensions were often between two groups; wealthy French-speaking mulatto Haitians who represented the minority of the population and poor Afro-Haitians who spoke Haitian Creole. Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by &quot;cacos&quot;, peasant militias from the mountains of the north, who stayed along the porous Dominican border and were often funded by foreign governments to stage revolts.

In 1902, a civil war was fought between the government of Pierre Théoma Boisrond-Canal and General Pierre Nord Alexis against rebels of Anténor Firmin, which led to Pierre Nord Alexis becoming president. In 1908, he was forced from power and a series of short lived presidencies came and went: his successor François C. Antoine Simon in 1911; President Cincinnatus Leconte (1911–1912) was killed in a (possibly deliberate) explosion at the National Palace; Michel Oreste (1913–1914) was ousted in a coup, as was his successor Oreste Zamor in 1914. Between 1911 and 1915, Haiti had seven presidents because of political assassinations, coups and forced exiles.

===American financial interests===
Prior to the intervention of the United States, Haiti&#x27;s large debt was 80 percent of its annual revenue, though it was able to meet financial obligations, especially when compared to Ecuador, Honduras, and Mexico at that time. In the twentieth century, the United States had become Haiti&#x27;s largest trade partner, replacing France, with American businesses expanding their presence in Haiti. Due to the influence of Germans within Haiti, they were regarded as a threat to American financial interests, with businesses ultimately advocating for policies of invading Haiti. Haitian authorities in 1903 began to accuse the National Bank of Haiti of fraud and by 1908, Haitian Minister of Finance Frédéric Marcelin pushed for the bank to work on the behalf of Haitians, though French officials began to devise plans to reorganize their financial interests. French envoy to Haiti Pierre Carteron wrote following Marcelin&#x27;s objections that &quot;It is of the highest importance that we study how to set up a new French credit establishment in Port-au-Prince ... Without any close link to the Haitian government.&quot;

Businesses from the United States had pursued the control of Haiti for years and in 1909, the new president of National City Bank of New York, Frank A. Vanderlip, began to plan the bank&#x27;s take over of Haiti&#x27;s finances as part of his larger role of making the bank grow in international markets. In early 1909, Speyer &amp; Co. promoted a stock to Vanderlip and the bank to invest in the National Railroad of Haiti, which held a monopoly of importing in the Port-au-Prince area. The Haitian government faced conflict with the National City Bank over the railroad regarding payments to creditors, later leading to the bank seeking to control the entirety of Haiti&#x27;s finances. Vanderlip wrote to Chairman of National City Bank James Stillman in 1910, &quot;In the future, this stock will give us a foothold [in Haiti] and I think we will perhaps later undertake the reorganization of the Government’s currency system, which, I believe, I see my way clear to do with practically no monetary risk&quot;. From 1910 to 1911, the United States Department of State backed a consortium of American investors – headed by the National City Bank of New York – to acquire a managing stake of the National Bank of Haiti to create the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BNRH), with the new bank often holding payments from the Haitian government, leading to unrest. France would also keep a stake in the BNRH. The BNRH was the country&#x27;s sole commercial bank and served as the Haitian government&#x27;s treasury.

Officials of the Wilson administration were not knowledgeable about Haiti and often relied on information from American businessmen. United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan fired established Latin American experts upon his nomination and instead replaced them with political allies. Bryan initially proposed forgiving the debt of Caribbean nations, though President Wilson viewed this as too radical. With his ideas facing rejection, Bryan, who had little information on Haiti, instead relied on the vice president of National City Bank, Roger Leslie Farnham, for information regarding Haiti. Farnham had an extensive background working as a financial advisor, lobbyist, journalis, and purchasing agent between the United States and the Caribbean, with American historian Brenda Gayle Plummer writing &quot;Farnham ... is often portrayed by historians as the deus ex machina single-handedly plotting the American intervention of 1915&quot;. Throughout the 1910s, Farnham demanded successive Haitian governments to grant him control of the nation&#x27;s customs, the only source of revenue, threatening American intervention when Haiti refused citing national sovereignty. John H. Allen, manager of the BNRH, also met with Bryan for consultation in 1912, with Allen later sharing an account of Bryan being surprised about Haitian culture and stating &quot;Dear me, think of it! Niggers speaking French&quot;.

In 1914, France began to lose its ties to Haiti as it was focusing its efforts on World War I and Farnham suggested to the United States Congress that the BNRH&#x27;s &quot;active management has been from New York&quot;. Allen later stated that if the United States permanently occupied Haiti, he supported National City Bank acquiring all shares of BNRH, believing that it would &quot;pay 20% or better&quot;. Farnham persuaded Secretary Bryan to have the United States invade Haiti during a telephone call on January 22, 1914. Farnham argued that Haiti was not improving due to continuous internal conflict, that Haitians were not interested in the revolts occurring and that American troops would be welcomed in Haiti. Farnham also exaggerated the role of European influence, even convincing Secretary Bryan that France and Germany – two nations then at war with each other – were plotting in cooperation to obtain the harbor of Môle Saint-Nicholas in northern Haiti. The businessman concluded that Haiti would not improve &quot;until such time as some stronger outside power steps in&quot;. American diplomats would ultimately draft plans to take over Haiti&#x27;s finances, dubbed the &quot;Farnham Plan&quot;.

After American officials travelled to Haiti to propose the &quot;Farnham Plan&quot;, Haitian legislators denounced their minister of foreign affairs, saying he was &quot;endeavoring to sell the country to the United States&quot; according to a telegram of the US State Department. Due to Haitian opposition to the plan, the BNRH withheld funds from the Haitian government and funded rebels to destabilize the Haitian government in order to justify American intervention, generating 12% gains in interest by holding on to the funds. On January 27, 1914, Haitian President Michel Oreste was deposed in a coup. Two generals, Charles and Oreste Zamor, seized control. In response, the USS &quot;Montana&quot; sent a marine detachment on January 29 into Port-au Prince to protect American interests. On February 5, 1914, military forces from the French cruiser &quot;Conde&quot; and British HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; also landed troops. These units agreed to leave the city and boarded their ships on February 9, 1914.

BNRH&#x27;s Allen telegrammed the State Department on April 8, 1914, requesting that the US Navy sail to Port-au-Prince to deter possible rebellions. In the summer of 1914, the BNRH began to threaten the Haitian government that it would no longer provide payments. Simultaneously, Secretary Bryan telegrammed the United States consul in Cap-Haïtien, writing that the State Department agreed with invading Haiti, telling the consul that the United States &quot;earnestly desires successfully carrying out of Farnham&#x27;s plan&quot;.
American bankers raised fears that Haiti would default on debt payments despite consistent compliance by Haiti with loan conditions, calling for the seizure of Haiti&#x27;s national bank. National City Bank officials – acting on behalf of Farnham – demanded the State Department to provide military support to acquire Haiti&#x27;s national reserves, with the bank arguing that Haiti had become too unstable to safeguard the assets. Urged by the National City Bank and the BNRH, with the latter of the two already under direction of American business interests, eight United States marines walked into the national bank and took custody of Haiti&#x27;s gold reserve of about US$500,000 – about the – on December 17, 1914. The Marines packed the gold into wooden boxes, loaded them into a wagon, and transported the gold under the protection of plainclothes clandestine soldiers lining the route to the USS &quot;Machias&quot;, which transferred its load to the National City Bank&#x27;s New York City vault on 55 Wall Street. The robbery of the gold provided the United States with a large amount of control over the Haitian government, though American businesses demanded further intervention. National City Bank would go on to acquire some of its largest gains in the 1920s due to debt payments from Haiti, according to later filings to the Senate Finance Committee, with debt payments to the bank comprising 25% of Haiti&#x27;s revenue.

==American invasion==
In February 1915, Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, son of a former Haitian president, took power as President of Haiti. The culmination of his repressive measures came on July 27, 1915, when he ordered the execution of 167 political prisoners, including former president Zamor, who was being held in a Port-au-Prince jail. This infuriated the population, which rose up against Sam&#x27;s government as soon as news of the executions reached them. Sam, who had taken refuge in the French embassy, was lynched by an enraged mob in Port-au-Prince as soon as they learned of the executions. The United States regarded the anti-American revolt against Sam as a threat to American business interests in the country, especially the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO). When the &quot;caco&quot;-supported anti-American Rosalvo Bobo emerged as the next president of Haiti, the United States government decided to act quickly to preserve its economic dominance.

In April 1915, Secretary Bryan expressed support for invading Haiti to President Wilson, writing &quot;The American interests are willing to remain there, with a view of purchasing a controlling interest and making the bank a branch of the American bank – they are willing to do this provided this government takes the steps necessary to protect them and their idea seems to be that no protection will be sufficient that does not include control of the Customs House.&quot;

On July 28, 1915, United States President Woodrow Wilson ordered 340 United States marines to occupy Port-au-Prince and the invasion took place the same day. The Secretary of the Navy instructed the invasion commander, Rear Admiral William Banks Caperton, to &quot;protect American and foreign&quot; interests. Wilson also wanted to rewrite the Haitian constitution, which banned foreign ownership of land, to replace it with one that guaranteed American financial control. To avoid public criticism, Wilson claimed the occupation was a mission to &quot;re-establish peace and order ... [and] has nothing to do with any diplomatic negotiations of the past or the future,&quot; as disclosed by Rear Admiral Caperton. Only one Haitian soldier, Pierre Sully, tried to resist the invasion, and he was shot dead by the Marines.

==American occupation==

===Dartiguenave presidency===

====US installs Dartiguenave as president====
Haitian presidents were not elected by universal suffrage but rather chosen by the Senate. The American occupying authorities therefore looked to find a presidential candidate ready to cooperate with them. Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave, president of the Senate and among the mulatto Haitian elite who supported the United States, agreed to accept the presidency of Haiti in August 1915 after several other candidates had refused. The United States would later go on to install more wealthy mulatto Haitians in positions of power.

====US takeover of Haitian institutions====
For several decades, the Haitian government had been receiving large loans from both American and French banks, and with the political chaos was growing increasingly incapable of repaying their debts. If the anti-American government of Rosalvo Bobo prevailed, there was no guarantee of debt repayment, and American businesses refused to continue investing there. Within six weeks of the occupation, US government representatives seized control of Haiti&#x27;s customs houses and administrative institutions, including the banks and the national treasury. Under US government control, 40% of Haiti&#x27;s national income was designated to repay debts to American and French banks.
In September 1915, the United States Senate ratified the Haitian-American Convention, a treaty granting the United States security and economic oversight of Haiti for a 10-year period. Haiti&#x27;s legislature initially refused to ratify the treaty, though Admiral Caperton threatened hold payments from Haiti until the treaty was signed. The treaty gave the President of the United States the power to appoint a customs receiver general, economic advisors, public works engineers; and to assign American military officers to oversee a Haitian gendarmerie. Haiti&#x27;s economic functions were overseen by the United States Department of State, while the United States Navy was tasked with infrastructure and healthcare works, though the Navy ultimately held more authority. Officials from the United States then wielded veto power over all governmental decisions in Haiti, and Marine Corps commanders served as administrators in the departments. The original treaty was to be in effect for ten years, though an additional agreement in 1917 expanded the United States&#x27; power for twenty years. For the next nineteen years, US State Department advisers ruled Haiti, their authority enforced by the United States Marine Corps.

The Gendarmerie of Haiti, now known as the &quot;Garde d&#x27;Haïti&quot;, was also created and controlled by US Marines throughout the occupation, initially led by Major Smedley D. Butler. Rear Admiral Caperton ordered his 2,500 Marines to occupy all of Haiti&#x27;s districts, equipping them with airplanes, cars, and trucks. Five airfields were constructed and at least three airplanes were present in Haiti. Marines were tasked with multiple duties for their districts; law enforcement, tax collection, medicine distribution, and overseeing arbitration.

Economically and politically, the Haitian government relied on American approval for most projects. The 1915 treaty with the United States proved expensive; the Haitian government had such a limited income that it was difficult to hire public workers and officials. Before utilizing any money, the Haitian government had to obtain approval from an American financial advisor and by 1918, would rely on American officials for approval of any laws due to fears of violating the treaty.

====First Caco War====
The installation of a president without the consent of Haitians and the forced labor of the corvée system enforced upon Haitians by American forces led to opposition of the US occupation began immediately after the marines entered Haiti, creating rebel groups of Haitians who felt they were returning to slavery. The rebels (called &quot;Cacos&quot;, after a local bird sharing their ambush tactics) strongly resisted American control of Haiti. The US and Haitian governments began a vigorous campaign to destroy the rebel armies. Perhaps the best-known account of this skirmishing came from Marine Major Smedley Butler, awarded a Medal of Honor for his exploits. He was appointed to serve as commanding officer of the Haitian gendarmerie. He later expressed his disapproval of the US intervention in his 1935 book &quot;War Is a Racket&quot;.

On November 17, 1915, the Marines captured Fort Rivière, a stronghold of the Caco rebels, which marked the end of the First Caco War. The United States military issued two Haitian Campaign Medals to US Marine and naval personnel for service in the country during the periods 1915 and 1919–1920.

====US forces new Haitian constitution====
Shortly after installing Dartiguenave as president of Haiti, President Wilson pursued the rewriting of the Constitution of Haiti. One of the main concerns for the United States was the ban of foreigners from owning Haitian land. Early leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines had forbidden land ownership by foreigners when Haiti became independent to deter foreign influence, and since 1804, some Haitians had viewed foreign ownership as anathema. Fearing impeachment and due to opposition of the legislature, Dartiguenave ordered the dissolution of the senate on April 6, 1916, with Major Butler and Colonel Waller enforcing new legislative elections. Colonel Eli K. Cole would later assume Waller&#x27;s position as commander of the Marines.

The newly elected legislature of Haiti immediately rejected the constitution proposed by the United States. Instead, the legislative body began drafting a new constitution of its own that was in contrast to the interests of the United States. Under orders from the United States, President Dartiguenave dissolved the legislature in 1917 after its members refused to approve the proposed constitution, with Major Butler forcing the closing of the senate at gunpoint.

Haiti&#x27;s new constitution was drafted under the supervision of Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. A referendum in Haiti subsequently approved the new constitution in 1918 (by a vote of 98,225 to 768). In Roosevelt&#x27;s new constitution, Haiti explicitly allowed foreigners to control Haitian land for the first time since Haiti&#x27;s creation. As a result of opposing the United States&#x27; effort of rewriting its constitution, Haiti would remain without a legislative branch until 1929.

====Second Caco War====
The end of the First World War in 1918 deprived the Haitians of their main ally in the liberation struggle. Germany&#x27;s defeat meant its end as a menace to the US in the Caribbean, as it lost control of Tortuga. Nevertheless, the US continued its occupation of Haiti after the war, despite President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s claims at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that he supported self-determination among other peoples.

At one time, at least twenty percent of Haitians had been involved in the rebellion against occupation according to Africanologist Patrick Bellegarde-Smith. The strongest period of unrest culminated in a 1918 rebellion by up to 40,000 former cacos and other members of the opposition led by Charlemagne Péralte, a former officer of the dissolved Haitian army. The scale of the uprising overwhelmed the Gendarmerie, but US Marine reinforcements helped put down the revolt. For their part, the Haitians resorted to non-conventional tactics, being severely outmatched by their occupiers. Prior to his death, Péralte launched an attack on Port-au-Prince. The assassination of Péralte in 1919 solidified US Marine power over the Cacos. The Second Caco War ended with the death of Benoît Batraville in 1920, who had commanded an assault on the Haitian capital that year. An estimated 2,004 Cacos were killed in the fighting, as well as several dozens of US Marines and Haitian gendarmes.

====Congressional investigation====
The educated elite in Haiti was &quot;L&#x27;Union Patriotique,&quot; which established ties with opponents of the occupation in the US. They found allies in the NAACP and among both white and African-American leaders. The NAACP sent civil rights activist James Weldon Johnson, its field secretary, to investigate conditions in Haiti. He published his account in 1920, decrying &quot;the economic corruption, forced labor, press censorship, racial segregation, and wanton violence introduced to Haiti by the US occupation encouraged numerous African Americans to flood the State Department and the offices of Republican Party officials with letters&quot; calling for an end to the abuses and to remove troops. Academic W. E. B. Du Bois, who had Haitian ancestry, demanded a response for the Wilson administration&#x27;s actions and wrote that US troops &quot;have no designs on the political independence of the island and no desire to exploit it ruthlessly for the take of selfish business interests&quot;.

Based on Johnson&#x27;s investigation, NAACP executive secretary Herbert J. Seligman wrote in the July 10, 1920, &quot;The Nation&quot;:

&quot;Military camps have been built throughout the island. The property of natives has been taken for military use. Haitians carrying a gun were for a time shot on sight. Machine guns have been turned on crowds of unarmed natives, and United States Marines have, by accounts which several of them gave me in casual conversation, not troubled to investigate how many were killed or wounded.&quot;According to Johnson, there was only one reason why the United States occupied Haiti:
Two years after Johnson published his findings, a congressional investigation began in the United States in 1922. The report from Congress did not include testimony from Haitians and ignored allegations involving National City Bank of New York and US Marines. Congress concluded the report by defending a continued occupation of Haiti, arguing that &quot;chronic revolution, anarchy, barbarism, and ruin&quot; would befall Haiti if the United States withdrew. Johnson described the congressional investigation as &quot;on the whole, a whitewash&quot;.

===Borno presidency===
In 1922, Dartiguenave was replaced by Louis Borno, with the US-appointed General John H. Russell, Jr. serving as High Commissioner. General Russell worked on the behalf of the United States Department of State and was authorized as the representative to carry out treaty works.

====National City Bank acquires BNRH====
On August 17, 1922, BNRH was completely acquired by National City Bank, its headquarters was moved to New York City and Haiti&#x27;s debt to France was moved to be paid to American investors. Following the acquisition of BNRH, the November 1922 issue of National City Bank&#x27;s employee journal &quot;No. 8&quot; exclaimed &quot;Bank of Haiti is Ours!&quot; According to professor Peter James Hudson, &quot;such control represented the end of independence and, as the BNRH and the republic&#x27;s gold reserve became mere entries on the ledgers of the City Bank, a sign of a return to colonial servitude&quot;.

====Forced labor====
The Borno-Russell government oversaw the use of forced labor to expand the economy and to complete infrastructure projects. Sisal was introduced to Haiti as a commodity crop, and sugar and cotton became significant exports. However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture met with limited success, in part because much of Haiti&#x27;s labor force was employed as seasonal workers in the more-established sugar industries of Cuba and the Dominican Republic. An estimated 30,000–40,000 Haitian laborers, known in Cuba as &quot;braceros,&quot; went annually to the Oriente Province between 1913 and 1931. The Great Depression disastrously affected the prices of Haiti&#x27;s exports and destroyed the tenuous gains of the previous decade. Under press laws, Borno frequently imprisoned newspaper press that criticized his government.

====Les Cayes massacre====
President Herbert Hoover had become increasingly pressured about the effects of occupying Haiti at the time and began inquiring about a withdrawal strategy. By 1929, Haitians had grown angered with the Borno-Russell government and American occupation, with demands for direct elections increasing. In early December 1929, protests against the American occupation began at the Service Technique de l’Agriculture et de l’Enseignement Professionnel&#x27;s main school. On December 6, 1929, about 1,500 Haitians peacefully protesting local economic conditions in Les Cayes were fired upon by US Marines, with the massacre resulting in 12 to 22 Haitians dead and 51 injured. The massacre resulted in international outrage, with President Hoover calling on Congress to investigate conditions in Haiti the following day.

====Forbes Commission, Borno&#x27;s resignation====
President Hoover would later appoint two commissions, including one headed by a former US governor of the Philippines William Cameron Forbes&quot;.&quot; The commission arrived in Haiti on February 28, 1930, with President Hoover demanding the commission to determine &quot;when and how we are to withdraw from Haiti&quot; and &quot;what we shall do in the meantime&quot;. The Forbes Commission praised the material improvements that the US administration had achieved, but it criticized the continued exclusion of Haitian nationals from positions of real authority in the government and the gendarmerie. In more general terms, the commission asserted that &quot;the social forces that created [instability] still remain – poverty, ignorance, and the lack of a tradition or desire for orderly free government.&quot; The commission concluded that occupation of Haiti was a failure and that the United States did not &quot;understand the social problems of Haiti&quot;.

With increased calls for direct elections, American officials feared violence if demands were not met. An agreement was made that resulted with President Borno&#x27;s resignation and the establishment of Haitian banker Louis Eugène Roy as an interim president. In the agreement proposed by the Forbes Commission, Roy would be elected by Congress to serve as president until a direct election for Congress was held, which is when Roy would resign. American officials said that if Congress were to refuse, Roy would be installed as president forcibly.

===Vincent presidency===
Under orders to not interfere with elections, the United States observed elections on October 14, 1930, that resulted with Haitian nationalist candidates being elected. Sténio Vincent was elected President of Haiti by the Congress of Haiti in November 1930. The new nationalist government had a tense relationship with American officials. By the end of 1930, Haitians were being trained by Americans for administration roles of their own nation. When additional American commissions began to arrive in Haiti, popular unrest broke out and President Vincent reached a secret agreement to ease tensions with the United States in exchange to grant more power to American officials to enact their &quot;Haitianization&quot; policies.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, who as Assistant Secretary of the Navy said he was responsible for drafting the 1918 constitution, was a proponent of the &quot;Good Neighbor policy&quot; for the US role in the Caribbean and Latin America. The United States and Haiti agreed on August 7, 1933, to end the occupation. On a visit to Cap-Haïtien in July 1934, Roosevelt reaffirmed the August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last contingent of US Marines departed on August 15, 1934, after a formal transfer of authority to the Garde. The US retained influence on Haiti&#x27;s external finances until 1947, as per the 1919 treaty that required an American financial advisor through the life of Haiti&#x27;s acquired loan.

==Effects==

===Economy===
The occupation was costly for the Haitian government; American advisors collected about 5% of Haiti&#x27;s revenue while the 1915 treaty with the United States limited Haiti&#x27;s income, resulting with fewer jobs for the government to assign. Numerous agricultural changes included the introduction of sisal. Sugarcane and cotton became significant exports, boosting prosperity. However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture produced limited results while American agricultural businesses removed the property from thousands of Haitian peasants to produce bananas, sisal and rubber for export, resulting with lower domestic food production.

Haitian traditionalists, based in rural areas, were highly resistant to US-backed changes, while the urban elites, typically mixed-race, welcomed the growing economy, but wanted more political control. Following the end of the occupation in 1934, under the Presidency of Sténio Vincent (1930–1941), debts were still outstanding and the US financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941 when three American and three Haitian directors headed by an American manager assumed the role. Haiti&#x27;s loan debt to the United States was about twenty percent of the nation&#x27;s annual revenue.

Formal American influence on Haiti&#x27;s economy would conclude in 1947. The United Nations and the United States Department of State would report at the time that Haitian rural peasants, who comprised 90% of the nation&#x27;s population, lived &quot;close to starvation level&quot;.

===Infrastructure===
The occupation improved some of Haiti&#x27;s infrastructure and centralized power in Port-au-Prince, though much of the funds collected by the United States was not used to modernize Haiti. Corvée forced labor of Haitians, that was enforced by the US-operated gendarmerie, was used for infrastructure projects, particularly for road building. Forced labor would ultimately result in the deaths of hundreds to thousands of Haitians. Infrastructure improvements included of roads being made usable, 189 bridges built, the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, the construction of hospitals, schools, and public buildings, and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first Caribbean city to have a phone service with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.

The majority of Haitians believed that the public works projects enforced by the US Marines were unsatisfactory. American officers who controlled Haiti at the time spent more on their own salaries than on the public health budget for two million Haitians. A 1949 report by the United States Department of State wrote that irrigation systems that were recently constructed were &quot;not in good condition&quot;.

===Education===
The United States redesigned the education system. It dismantled the liberal arts education which the Haitians had inherited (and adapted) from the French system. With the Service Technique de l’Agriculture et de l’Enseignement Professionnel, Americans emphasized agricultural and vocational training, similar to its industrial education for minorities and immigrants in the United States. Dr. Robert Russa Moton was tasked with assessing the Service Technique, concluding that though the objectives were admirable, performance was not satisfactory and criticized the large amount of funding it received compared to average Haitian public schools, which were in poor condition.

Elite Haitians despised the system, believing it was discriminatory against their people. The mulatto elite also feared the creation of an educated middle class that would potentially lead to the loss of their influence.

===Human rights abuses===

The United States Marines ruled Haiti as a military regime using a constant state of martial law, operating the newly created Haitian gendarmerie to suppress Haitians who opposed occupation. Between 1915 and 1930, Haitians represented only about 35–40% of officers in the gendarmes. During the occupation of Haiti by the United States, human rights abuses were committed against the native Haitian population. Such actions involved censorship, concentration camps, forced labor, racial segregation, religious persecution of Haitian Vodou practitioners and torture.

Overall, American troops and the Haitian gendarmerie killed several thousand Haitian civilians during the rebellions between 1915 and 1920, though the exact death toll is unknown. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the 20 months of active unrest, 2,250 Haitian rebels had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250. According to Haitian American academic Michel-Rolph Trouillot, about 5,500 Haitians died in labor camps alone. Haitian historian Roger Gaillard, estimated that in total, including rebel combatants and civilians, at least 15,000 Haitians were killed throughout the occupation. According to Paul Farmer, the higher estimates are not supported by most historians outside Haiti.

American troops also performed union-busting actions, often for American businesses like the Haitian American Sugar Company, the Haitian American Development Corporation and National City Bank of New York.

====Executions and killings====
Under American occupation, extrajudicial executions were committed against Haitians. During the second Caco war of 1918–1919, many Caco prisoners were summarily executed by Marines and the gendarmerie on orders from their superiors. On June 4, 1916, Marines executed Caco General Mizrael Codio and ten others captured in Fonds-Verrettes. In Hinche in January 1919, Captain Ernest Lavoie of the gendarmerie, a former United States Marine, allegedly ordered the killing of nineteen Caco rebels according to American officers, though no charges were placed due to no physical evidence being presented. During the investigation of two marines accused of illegally executing Haitians, the attorney of the soldiers minimized their actions, saying that such killings were common, prompting larger investigations into the matter.

One controversial event occurred when in an attempt to discourage rebel support from the Haitian population, the US troops took a photograph of Charlemagne Péralte&#x27;s body tied to a door following his assassination in 1919, and distributed it in the country. However, it had the opposite effect, with the image&#x27;s resemblance to a crucifixion making it an icon of the resistance and establishing Péralte as a martyr.
Mass killings of civilians were allegedly committed by United States Marines and their Haitian gendarmerie subordinates. According to Haitian historian Roger Gaillard, such killings involved rape, lynchings, summary executions, burning villages and deaths by burning. Internal documents of the United States Army justified the killing of women and children, describing them as &quot;auxiliaries&quot; of rebels. A private memorandum of the Secretary of the Navy criticized &quot;indiscriminate killings against natives&quot;. American officers responsible for acts of violence were given names in Creole such as &quot;Linx&quot; for Commandant Freeman Lang and &quot;Ouiliyanm&quot; for Sergeant Dorcas Lee Williams. According to American journalist H. J. Seligman, Marines would practice &quot;bumping off Gooks&quot;, describing the shooting of civilians in a similar manner as killing for sport.

Beginning in 1919, American troops began attacking rural villages. In November 1919, villagers in Thomazeau hiding in a nearby forest sent a letter – the only surviving testament of the event – to a French priest asking for protection. In the letter, survivors wrote that at least two American planes bombed and shot at two villages, killing half of the population, including men, women, children and the elderly. On December 5, 1919, American planes bombed Les Cayes in a possible act of intimidation. American pilots were investigated for their actions, though none were condemned. These actions were described by anthropologist Jean-Philippe Belleau as possibly &quot;the first ever carried out by air on civilian populations&quot;.

====Forced labor====
A corvée policy of forced labor was enacted upon Haitians, enforced by the US-operated Haitian gendarmerie in the interest of improving economic conditions to fulfill foreign debts – including payments to the United States – and to improve the nation&#x27;s infrastructure. The corvée system was found in Haiti&#x27;s rural code by Major Smedley D. Butler, who testified that forced labor cut the cost of of road construction from $51,000 per mile to $205 per mile.

The corvée resulted in the deaths of hundreds to thousands of Haitians. Haitians were tied together in rope and those fleeing labor projects were often shot. According to Haitian American academic Michel-Rolph Trouillot, about 5,500 Haitians died in labor camps. In addition, Roger Gaillard writes that some Haitians were killed fleeing the camps or if they did not work satisfactorily. Many of the deaths and killings attributed to forced labor occurred during the extensive construction of roads in Haiti. In some instances, Haitians were forced to work on projects without pay and while shackled to chains. The corvée system&#x27;s treatment of Haitians has been compared to the system of bondage labor enforced upon black Americans during the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War.

====Racism====
Many of those tasked with the occupation of Haiti espoused racist beliefs. The first Marine commander ashore assigned was Colonel Littleton Waller, who had a history of racism against mulattos, describing them as &quot;real nigger ... real nigs beneath the surface&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of State Robert Lansing also held racist beliefs, writing at the time that &quot;the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization&quot;. The United States introduced Jim Crow laws to Haiti with racist attitudes towards the Haitian people by the American occupation forces that were blatant and widespread. Many of the Marines chosen to occupy Haiti were from the Southern United States, specifically Alabama and Louisiana, resulting in increased racial tensions. Racism has been recognized as a factor leading to increased violence by American troops against Haitians. One general described Haitians as &quot;niggers who pretend to speak French&quot;.

Initially, officers and the elites intermingled at social gatherings and clubs. Such gatherings were minimized when families of American forces began arriving. Relations degraded rapidly upon departure of officers for World War I. The Haitian elite found the American junior and non-commissioned officers to be ignorant and uneducated. There were numerous reports of remaining Marines drinking to excess, fighting, and sexually assaulting women. The situation was so bad that Marine general John A. Lejeune, based in Washington, D.C., banned the sale of alcohol to any military personnel.

The Americans inhabited neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince in high-quality housing. This neighborhood was called the &quot;millionaires&#x27; row&quot;. Hans Schmidt recounted a navy officer&#x27;s opinion on the matter of segregation: &quot;I can&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t have a better time with their crowd, just as I do with mine.&quot; American racial intolerance provoked indignation and resentment – and eventually a racial pride that was reflected in the work of a new generation of Haitian historians, ethnologists, writers, artists, and others. Many of these later became active in politics and government. The elite Haitians, mostly mixed-race with higher levels of education and capital, continued to dominate the country&#x27;s bureaucracy and to strengthen its role in national affairs.

Colorism, which had existed since French colonization, had also become prevalent once more under American occupation and racial segregation became common. All three rulers during the occupation came from the country&#x27;s mixed-race elite. At the same time, many in the growing black professional classes departed from the traditional veneration of Haiti&#x27;s French cultural heritage and emphasized the nation&#x27;s African roots. Among these were ethnologist Jean Price-Mars and François Duvalier, editor of the journal &quot;Les Griots&quot; (the title referred to traditional African oral historians, the storytellers) and future totalitarian president of Haiti. The racism and violence that occurred during the United States occupation of Haiti, inspired black nationalism among Haitians and left a powerful impression on the young Duvalier.

====Torture====
The torture of Haitian rebels or those suspected of rebelling against the United States was common among occupying Marines. Some methods of torture included the use of water cure, hanging prisoners by their genitals and &quot;ceps&quot;, which involved pushing both sides of the tibia with the butts of two guns.

==Analysis==

===20th century===
Haitian writers and public figures also responded to the occupation. For example, a minister of public education, Dantès Bellegarde raised issues with the events in his book, &quot;La Résistance Haïtienne (l&#x27;Occupation Américaine d&#x27;Haïti)&quot;. Bellegarde outlines the contradictions of the occupation with the realities. He accused President Wilson of writing the new Haitian Constitution to benefit the Americans, and wrote that Wilson&#x27;s main purpose was to remove the previous Haitian clause that stated foreigners could not own land in the country. The original clause was designed to protect Haiti&#x27;s independence from foreign powers. With the clause removed, Americans (including whites and other foreigners) could now own land. Furthermore, Bellegarde discusses the powerlessness of Haitian officials in the eyes of the Occupation because nothing could be done without the consent of the Americans. However, the main issue that Bellegarde articulates is that the Americans tried to change the education system of Haiti from one that was French based to that of the Americans. Even though Bellegarde was resistant he had a plan to build a university in Haiti that was based on the American system. He wanted a university with various schools of science, business, art, medicine, law, agriculture, and languages all connected by a common area and library. However, that dream was never realized because of the new direction the Haitian government was forced to take.

Jean Price-Mars associated the reasons behind the occupation to the division between the Haitian elite and the poorer people of the country. He noted that the groups were divided over the practice of Haitian Vodou, with the implication that the elites did not recognize Vodou because they connected it to an evil practice.

===21st century===
Pezullo writes in his 2006 book &quot;Plunging Into Haiti: Clinton, Aristide, and the Defeat of Diplomacy&quot; that the racism similar to Jim Crow laws in the United States inspired black nationalism within Haiti and ignited future support for Haitian dictator François Duvalier.

In a 2013 article by Peter James Hudson published in &quot;Radical History Review&quot;, Hudson wrote:

Hudson further stated that the motives of American businessmen to become involved in Haiti were due to racial capitalism motivated by white supremacy.

According to a 2020 study which contrasts the American occupations of both Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the United States had a longer and more domineering occupation of Haiti because of perceived racial differences between the two populations. Dominican elites articulated a European–Spanish identity – in contrast to Haitian blackness – which led US policymakers to accept leaving the territory in the population&#x27;s hands.

<text>Williamstown Pier was the original terminus of the Williamstown railway line, on the Melbourne suburban rail system. It was in the suburb of Williamstown, to the west of central Melbourne. The station existed primarily to serve the Williamstown docks precinct.

== History ==
Originally named Pier, it opened on 17 January 1859. It opened to passengers on 15 May 1881, and relocated to a new site on 8 January 1905.

The station contained a goods yard that was used for grain shipments, up until the 1960s.

By mid-1978, the station building was demolished and was replaced with two smaller brick structures. The last services terminated at the station on 25 March 1987, following a derailment on the sharply curved track leading to the station. All rails, sleepers, overhead wires and signals were removed by October 1988, with the platform track and overhead currently ending just under the Ann Street footbridge, at the down end of Williamstown station. The station was subsequently demolished, and replaced with a car park and a parkland.

Today little remains of Williamstown Pier remain mostly demolished aforementioned in the late 1980s until the early 1990s. A short section of disused tracks beyond Williamstown station is the only remains of the old line.But was then removed by 2021 when the Ferguson st level crossing was removed.

<text>The territory of the United States and its overseas possessions has evolved over time, from the colonial era to the present day. It includes formally organized territories, proposed and failed states, unrecognized breakaway states, international and interstate purchases, cessions, and land grants, and historical military departments and administrative districts.

* Kansas Territory (1854–1861) had two different governments in different cities, pro-slavery and anti-slavery, each claiming to be the real, lawful government of the entire territory. Since Kansas entered the union as a free state in 1861, there has only been one capital, Topeka, Kansas.

<text>Scafell ( or ; also spelled Sca Fell, previously Scawfell) is a mountain in the Lake District region of Cumbria, England. It has a height of , making it the second-highest mountain in England after its neighbour, Scafell Pike, from which it is separated by Mickledore col.

==Topography==
Scafell stands between Wasdale in the west and upper Eskdale to the east. The highest part of the fell is a ridge running south from Mickledore as far as Slight Side, which is counted as a separate fell by most guidebooks. Despite regarding Slight Side as a separate entity, Wainwright included the wide upland area beyond it to the south west as a part of Scafell. More modern guides have partitioned the plateau off as a further independent top, Great How.

The opposing flanks of Scafell are entirely different in character. To the south, monotonous smooth slopes, stony and lacking vegetation at higher levels, run down toward Burnmoor and the head of Wastwater. But on the east side several large crags loom impressively over upper Eskdale. On the north side, the sheer faces of Scafell Crag provide some the finest rock scenery in the Lake District.

From the narrow ridge of Mickledore the northern face of Scafell rises precipitously, an unusually complete barrier to progress along a Lakeland ridge, which frustrates many ridge walkers who find that this is a cliff for rock climbers only. At the top of the rise from Mickledore is Symonds Knott (), the northern top. The wall of crags – Scafell Crag to the west and the East Buttress above the Eskdale side of Mickledore – has two main weaknesses. Running laterally across Scafell Crag is Lord&#x27;s Rake, a scree-filled chute with several intermediate cols. It has two upper entrances onto the saddle separating Symonds Knott from the main summit. Formerly passable as a scramble, Lord&#x27;s Rake suffered from a serious rock fall in 2002 — with subsequent further falls — and recent guidebooks do not consider it a viable route, although it is gradually becoming more stable. The block that was bridged across the head of Lord&#x27;s Rake collapsed into the gully in July 2016, leaving several small unstable blocks behind, which can be avoided with care. The access to West Wall Traverse is clear of debris. The second breach in the crags is Broad Stand, a series of sloping steps which drop down from Symonds Knott almost to Mickledore; however, these steepen immediately above Mickledore and cannot be negotiated safely except by rock-climbers. The main summit stands a little to the south of the saddle, all around being a sea of stones. An easy ridge then steps down southward over Long Green to Slight Side. On the east are Cam Spout Crag and the fine high waterfall after which it is named.

Beyond Slight Side is a rough upland with many craggy tops and a number of tarns, before the southward descent finally ends in Lower Eskdale. South West of Scafell, below the scarp of Great How, is Burnmoor Tarn, one of the largest in Lakeland. Around deep, it holds trout, perch and pike. The tarn is prevented from following what would appear the natural line of drainage into Miterdale by moraines, and empties southward, reaching the Esk at Beckfoot. Near the southern shore stands Burnmoor Lodge, once a keeper&#x27;s cottage and a dwelling from the nearest road.

==Summit==
The main summit bears a large cairn on a short rocky ridge. Northward is a saddle, marked by a large cross of stones and then the bouldery climb to Symonds Knott, the north top. This gives views straight down to Mickledore. Scafell gives a very different view to that from its higher neighbour with Wastwater and the coastal plain given great prominence. There is a fine vista of the Western Fells, together with Bowfell and the Coniston Fells.

== Ascents ==

===Wasdale===
The classic ascent via Lord&#x27;s Rake path from Wastwater follows the main Scafell Pike footpath to Hollow Stones, then up to Lord&#x27;s Rake. Lord&#x27;s Rake may be followed in its entirety, or near the top of the first col, a diversion may be made onto the West Wall Traverse, the exit of which lies closer to the summit. However one section of Lord&#x27;s Rake is now threatened by unstable rocks following a rock fall in 2001. An alternative is to ascend from the Burnmoor track via Green How, but this misses the rock scenery of Scafell Crag.

===Eskdale===
A pleasant but lengthy alternative begins from Boot in Eskdale, following the River Esk upstream, and scrambling up to the summit by way of Foxes Tarn. A gentler return can be made across moorland, by way of the Burnmoor Tarn. Also starting in Eskdale, the Terrace route can be followed from Wha House, first ascending Slight Side.

===From Scafell Pike===
The route from Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) is one of the most frustrating in the Lake District. What seems like a direct route is in fact very hazardous as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and belay protection. Wainwright warns against its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before the danger is seen.
Instead there are two walking routes, but they entail some loss of altitude. The first is via Foxes Tarn to the East of Scafell summit, and the second is via Lord&#x27;s Rake and the West Wall traverse.
All routes go via Mickledore.

===Rock Climbing===
Scafell Crag, the massive north buttress of Scafell, and the overhanging East Buttress to the East of Mickledore Col, are the site of many famous historic and contemporary rock climbs. The history of climbing on these crags is documented by a book by The Fell and Rock Climbing Club called Nowt but a fleein&#x27; thing. , Latitude Press.

==Name history ==

Until about 1920, the phonetic spelling &quot;Scawfell&quot; was the most common version. This was used by, among others William Wordsworth who, in addition to poetry, wrote a popular guide book to the Lake District, Harriet Martineau (whose work replaced Wordsworth&#x27;s as the definitive guidebook), Jonathan Otley (who was one of the first to measure the height of most of the Lakeland fells), John Dalton (who also estimated the elevation of many of the fells), the surveyor of the Wasdale Head Enclosure map of 30 January 1808 and the hotel keepers and tour operators who lived or operated in the area, as typified by the many adverts in M. J. B. Baddeley&#x27;s guide of 1895 (versus the guide text which was consistent with the maps therein). This split between local usage and maps printed by national publishers is further illustrated by the Wasdale Hall Estate Plan and Sales Particulars, dated 30th Sept 1920. This uses the spelling &quot;Scawfell&quot; throughout except in the map attached which was reproduced with permission of the Ordnance Survey. The first edition of the Rock and Fell Club Guide was titled &quot;Climbs on the Scawfell Group&quot;. The phonetic &quot;Scawfell&quot; was still noticeably in use in the 1950s.

The change to the shorter spelling appears to have originated in the Donald Map of 1774, a document with a noticeable number of placename errors. This was then perpetuated by the Ordnance Survey from 1867. The Donald map is the first to name many mountains in the Lake District - earlier maps concentrated on showing passes through the mountains. Until 1867 the two spellings are roughly equally split on maps, the shorter form being more common with London publishers. General usage at the time was predominantly &quot;Scawfell&quot;. The only notable guide book that used &quot;Scafell&quot; prior to 1867 is Ford. The Ordnance Survey produced detailed procedures on capturing correct placenames in 1825, largely as a result of their survey work transferring to Ireland between 1824 and 1838. However, when they restarted their work in England, given the status of Sca Fell as an essential surveying station (taking bearings of Slieve Donard and Snowdon, thereby helping to fix the relative positions of Ireland and England), the familiarity with this mountain probably meant that the &quot;Name Book&quot; procedures were overlooked. Hence the correct enquiries were not made and the mistake of Donald was perpetuated.

Wainwright stated that, originally, the name Scawfell/Scafell referred to the whole of the massif from Great End south to Slight Side; only more recently had the general term become applied solely to the part of the fell south of Mickledore. Wainwright&#x27;s comments on this in book 4: &quot;When men first named the mountains, the whole of the high mass south of Sty Head was known as Scaw Fell...&quot;. However, Jonathan Otley, writing in the first concise guide to the Lake District, maintained that local shepherds applied the name &quot;Scawfell&quot; only as far as Mickledore, with the summits beyond called simply &quot;the Pikes&quot;. Otley also comments that the Donald map of 1774 and the Ordnance Survey were incorrect in their naming.
Scafell Pike and Scafell were referred to by the Ordnance Survey in their 1811 report as &quot;Sca-Fell Higher Top&quot; and &quot;Sca-Fell Lower Top&quot;. This can be confirmed from the 1811 account, a modern map and some elementary trigonometry. .

Once Scafell Pike (which has its own convoluted name history) had been identified as England&#x27;s highest mountain, that fact and the greater interest in climbing and fell-walking necessitated the Scafell Range being broken down into a number of individually named elements. This process was completed before the death of Jonathan Otley in 1856, as Otley commented on this change.

It was once believed that Scafell was the highest mountain in this part of the Lake District – it is much more prominent in views from many directions than its higher neighbour – with the three apparently inferior peaks to the north (those now known as Scafell Pike, Ill Crag and Broad Crag) being known collectively as the &quot;Pikes of Scawfell&quot;. The heights of many of the fells were first measured by John Dalton (Scafell: ) as a result of his study of meteorology and Jonathan Otley, who published a height of for &quot;Scawfell&quot; on his map of 1818. The Ordnance Survey first gave a height of , but this remained essentially unpublished until the maps of Cumberland were printed. Dorothy Wordsworth did discover shortly after her ascent of &quot;The Pikes&quot; (Scafell Pike) in 1818 that this peak was higher than Sca Fell - presumably from Otley&#x27;s map and guide book.

<doc id="509256" wikidata="Q412856" url="?curid=509256" title="Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex">
<text>Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a complex of three enzymes that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by a process called pyruvate decarboxylation. Acetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration, and this complex links the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate decarboxylation is also known as the &quot;pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction&quot; because it also involves the oxidation of pyruvate.

This multi-enzyme complex is related structurally and functionally to the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched-chain oxo-acid dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complexes.

==Reaction==
The reaction catalysed by Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is:
==Structure==

=== Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) ===
The E1 subunit, called the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit, is either a homodimer (comprising two “α” chains, e.g. in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) or a heterotetramer of two different chains (two “α” and two “β” chains). A magnesium ion forms a 4-coordinate complex with three, polar amino acid residues (Asp, Asn, and Tyr) located on the alpha chain, and the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor directly involved in decarboxylation of the pyruvate.

=== Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) ===
The E2 subunit, or dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase, for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is generally composed of three domains. The N-terminal domain (the lipoyl domain), consists of 1–3 lipoyl groups of approximately 80 amino acids each. The peripheral subunit binding domain (PSBD), serves as a selective binding site for other domains of the E1 and E3 subunits. Finally, the C-terminal (catalytic) domain catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups and acetyl-CoA synthesis. In Gammaproteobacteria, 24 copies of E2 form the cubic core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in which 8 E2 homotrimers are located at the vertices of the cubic core particle. 

=== Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) ===
The E3 subunit, called the Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase enzyme, is characterized as a homodimer protein wherein two cysteine residues, engaged in disulfide bonding, and the FAD cofactor in the active site facilitate its main purpose as an oxidizing catalyst. One example of E3 structure, found in &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot;, is formed such that each individual homodimer subunit contains two binding domains responsible for FAD binding and NAD binding, as well as a central domain and an interface domain.

=== Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase Binding protein (E3BP) ===
An auxiliary protein unique to most eukaryotes is the E3 binding protein (E3BP), which serves to bind the E3 subunit to the PDC complex. In the case of human E3BP, hydrophobic proline and leucine residues in the BP interact with the surface recognition site formed by the binding of two identical E3 monomers.

==Mechanism==


=== Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) ===

Initially, pyruvate and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP or vitamin B1) are bound by pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits. The thiazolium ring of TPP is in a zwitterionic form, and the anionic C2 carbon performs a nucleophilic attack on the C2 (ketone) carbonyl of pyruvate. The resulting intermediate undergoes decarboxylation to produce an acyl anion equivalent (see cyanohydrin or aldehyde-dithiane umpolung chemistry, as well as benzoin condensation). This anion attacks S1 of an oxidized lipoate species that is attached to a lysine residue. In a ring-opening SN2-like mechanism, S2 is displaced as a sulfide or sulfhydryl moiety. Subsequent collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate ejects thiazole, releasing the TPP cofactor and generating a thioacetate on S1 of lipoate. The E1-catalyzed process is the rate-limiting step of the whole pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

=== Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) ===
At this point, the lipoate-thioester functionality is translocated into the Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) active site, where a transacylation reaction transfers the acetyl from the &quot;swinging arm&quot; of lipoyl to the thiol of coenzyme A. This produces acetyl-CoA, which is released from the enzyme complex and subsequently enters the citric acid cycle. E2 can also be known as lipoamide reductase-transacetylase.

=== Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) ===
The dihydrolipoate, covalently bound to a lysine residue of the complex, is then transferred to the Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) active site, where it undergoes a flavin-mediated oxidation, similar in chemistry to e.g. thioredoxin reductase. First, FAD oxidizes dihydrolipoate back to its lipoate (disulfide) resting state, producing FADH2. Then, the substrate NAD+ oxidizes FADH2 back to its FAD resting state, producing NADH and H+.

==Differences in structure and subunit composition between species==
In all organisms, PDC is a large complex composed of multiple copies of the three catalytic subunits E1, E2 and E3. Another common feature of all PDCs is the fact that the subunit E2 forms the core of the complex to which the peripheral subunits E1 and E3 bind. Eukaryotic PDCs contain an additional, non-catalytic subunit in the core termed E3 binding protein (E3BP) (sometimes also &quot;protein X&quot;). In PDCs with a hetero-oligomeric core with multiple copies of E2 and E3BP, E1 exclusively associates with E2, and E3 only binds to E3BP. In contrast, E1 and E3 compete for binding to E2 in bacterial PDCs with a homo-oligomeric E2 core. While the peripheral enzyme E3 is a homodimer in all organisms, the peripheral enzyme E1 is an alpha2beta2 heterotetramerin eukaryotes.

===Gram-negative bacteria===
In Gram-negative bacteria, e.g. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, PDC consists of a central cubic core made up from 24 molecules of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2).
Up to 16 homodimers of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) and 8 homodimers of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) bind to the 24 peripheral subunit binding domains (PSBDs) of the E2 24-mer.
In Gammaproteobacteria, the specificity of PSBD for binding either E1 or E3 is determined by the oligomeric state of PSBD. In each E2 homotrimer, two of the three PSBDs dimerize. While two E1 homodimers cooperatively bind dimeric PSBD, the remaining, unpaired PSBD specifically interacts with one E3 homodimer. PSBD dimerization thus determines the subunit composition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex when fully saturated with the peripheral subunits E1 and E3, which has a stoichiometry of E1:E2:E3 (monomers) = 32:24:16 

===Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotes===
In contrast, in Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. &quot;Bacillus stearothermophilus&quot;) and eukaryotes the central PDC core contains 60 E2 molecules arranged into an icosahedron. This E2 subunit “core” coordinates to 30 subunits of E1 and 12 copies of E3.

Eukaryotes also contain 12 copies of an additional core protein, E3 binding protein (E3BP) which bind the E3 subunits to the E2 core. The exact location of E3BP is not completely clear. Cryo-electron microscopy has established that E3BP binds to each of the icosahedral faces in yeast. However, it has been suggested that it replaces an equivalent number of E2 molecules in the bovine PDC core.

Up to 60 E1 or E3 molecules can associate with the E2 core from Gram-positive bacteria - binding is mutually exclusive. In eukaryotes E1 is specifically bound by E2, while E3 associates with E3BP. It is thought that up to 30 E1 and 6 E3 enzymes are present, although the exact number of molecules can vary &quot;in vivo&quot; and often reflects the metabolic requirements of the tissue in question.

==Regulation==
Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inhibited when one or more of the three following ratios are increased: ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD+ and acetyl-CoA/CoA.

In eukaryotes PDC is tightly regulated by its own specific Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP), deactivating and activating it respectively. 
* PDK phosphorylates three specific serine residues on E1 with different affinities. Phosphorylation of any one of them (using ATP) renders E1 (and in consequence the entire complex) inactive.
* Dephosphorylation of E1 by PDP reinstates complex activity.

Products of the reaction act as allosteric inhibitors of the PDC, because they activate PDK. Substrates in turn inhibit PDK, reactivating PDC.

During starvation, PDK increases in amount in most tissues, including skeletal muscle, via increased gene transcription. Under the same conditions, the amount of PDP decreases. The resulting inhibition of PDC prevents muscle and other tissues from catabolizing glucose and gluconeogenesis precursors. Metabolism shifts toward fat utilization, while muscle protein breakdown to supply gluconeogenesis precursors is minimized, and available glucose is spared for use by the brain.

Calcium ions have a role in regulation of PDC in muscle tissue, because it activates PDP, stimulating glycolysis on its release into the cytosol - during muscle contraction. Some products of these transcriptions release H2 into the muscles. This can cause calcium ions to decay over time.

==Localization of pyruvate decarboxylation==
In eukaryotic cells the pyruvate decarboxylation occurs inside the mitochondrial matrix, after transport of the substrate, pyruvate, from the cytosol. The transport of pyruvate into the mitochondria is via the transport protein pyruvate translocase. Pyruvate translocase transports pyruvate in a symport fashion with a proton (across the inner mitochondrial membrane), which may be considered to be a form of secondary active transport, but further confirmation/support may be needed for the usage of &quot;secondary active transport&quot; desciptor here (Note: the pyruvate transportation method via the pyruvate translocase appears to be coupled to a proton gradient according to S. Papa et al., 1971, seemingly matching secondary active transport in definition).

Alternative sources say &quot;transport of pyruvate across the outer mitochondrial membrane appears to be easily accomplished via large non-selective channels such as voltage-dependent anion channels, which enable passive diffusion&quot; and transport across inner mitochondrial membrane is mediated by mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (MPC2).

Upon entry into the mitochondrial matrix, the pyruvate is decarboxylated, producing acetyl-CoA (and carbon dioxide and NADH). This irreversible reaction traps the acetyl-CoA within the mitochondria (the acetyl-CoA can only be transported out of the mitochondrial matrix under conditions of high oxaloacetate via the citrate shuttle, a TCA intermediate that is normally sparse). The carbon dioxide produced by this reaction is nonpolar and small, and can diffuse out of the mitochondria and out of the cell.

In prokaryotes, which have no mitochondria, this reaction is either carried out in the cytosol, or not at all.

==Evolutionary history==
It was found that pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme found in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells closely resembles an enzyme from &quot;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&quot;, which is a species of gram-positive bacteria. Despite similarities of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex with gram-positive bacteria, there is little resemblance with those of gram-negative bacteria.  Similarities of the quaternary structures between pyruvate dehydrogenase and enzymes in gram-positive bacteria point to a shared evolutionary history which is distinctive from the evolutionary history of corresponding enzymes found in gram-negative bacteria. Through an endosymbiotic event, pyruvate dehydrogenase found in the eukaryotic mitochondria points to ancestral linkages dating back to gram-positive bacteria. 

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes share many similarities with branched chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase (BCOADH), particularly in their substrate specificity for alpha-keto acids. Specifically, BCOADH catalyzes the degradation of amino acids and these enzymes would have been prevalent during the periods on prehistoric Earth dominated by rich amino acid environments. The E2 subunit from pyruvate dehydrogenase evolved from the E2 gene found in BCOADH while both enzymes contain identical E3 subunits due to the presence of only one E3 gene. Since the E1 subunits have a distinctive specificity for particular substrates, the E1 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase and BCOADH vary but share genetic similarities. The gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria that would later give rise to mitochondria and chloroplast found in eukaryotic cells retained the E1 subunits that are genetically related to those found in the BCOADH enzymes.

==Clinical relevance==
Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDCD) can result from mutations in any of the enzymes or cofactors used to build the complex. Its primary clinical finding is lactic acidosis. Such PDCD mutations, leading to subsequent deficiencies in NAD and FAD production, hinder oxidative phosphorylation processes that are key in aerobic respiration. Thus, acetyl-CoA is instead reduced via anaerobic mechanisms into other molecules like lactate, leading to an excess of bodily lactate and associated neurological pathologies.

While pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is rare, there are a variety of different genes when mutated or nonfunctional that can induce this deficiency. First, the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase contains four different subunits: two alpha subunits designated as E1-alpha and two beta subunits designated as E1-beta. The PDHA1 gene found in the E1-alpha subunits, when mutated, causes 80% of the cases of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency because this mutation abridges the E1-alpha protein. Decreased functional E1 alpha prevents pyruvate dehydrogenase from sufficiently binding to pyruvate, thus reducing the activity of the overall complex. When the PDHB gene found in the E1 beta subunit of the complex is mutated, this also leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Likewise, mutations found on other subunits of the complex, like the DLAT gene found on the E2 subunit, the PDHX gene found on the E3 subunit, as well as a mutation on a pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase gene, known as PDP1, have all been traced back to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, while their specific contribution to the disease state is unknown.

<text>The United States one-dollar bill (US$1), sometimes referred to as a single, has been the lowest value denomination of United States paper currency since the discontinuation of U.S. fractional currency notes in 1876. An image of the first U.S. president (1789–1797), George Washington, based on the &quot;Athenaeum Portrait&quot;, a 1796 painting by Gilbert Stuart, is currently featured on the obverse, and the Great Seal of the United States is featured on the reverse. The one-dollar bill has the oldest overall design of all U.S. currency currently in use. The reverse design of the present dollar debuted in 1935, and the obverse in 1963 when it was first issued as a Federal Reserve Note (previously, one-dollar bills were Silver Certificates). The current US two-dollar bill has the oldest obverse design, dating from 1928.

A dollar bill is composed of 25% linen and 75% cotton. That blend makes the notes more difficult to counterfeit compared to paper (as well as increasing its durability). , the average life of a dollar bill in circulation is 6.6 years before it is replaced due to wear. Approximately 42% of all U.S. currency produced in 2009 were one-dollar bills. , there were 12.7 billion one-dollar bills in circulation worldwide. An engraver at the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing, George Frederick Cumming Smillie, made an etching of a painting of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart which was used on multiple banknotes. A vignette of the portrait appears on the one dollar bill of 1899, and the one dollar note of (1918 to 2023). United States one-dollar bills featured the image for decades (1918 to 2023).

==History==
===Large-size notes===


&quot;(approximately )&quot;
* 1862: The first one-dollar bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note (United States Note) with a portrait of Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury who served under President Abraham Lincoln.
* 1869: The $1 United States Note was redesigned with a portrait of George Washington in the center and a vignette of Christopher Columbus sighting land to the left. The obverse of the note also featured overprinting of the word ONE numerous times in very small green type and blue tinting of the paper. Although this note is technically a United States Note, appeared on it instead of .
* 1874: The Series of 1869 United States Note was revised. Changes on the obverse included removing the green and blue tinting, adding a red floral design around the word , and changing the term to . The reverse was completely redesigned. This note was also issued as Series of 1875 and 1878.
* 1880: The red floral design around the words and on the United States Note was removed and replaced with a large red seal. Later versions also had blue serial numbers and a small seal moved to the left side of the note.
* 1886: The first woman to appear on U.S. currency, Martha Washington, was featured on the $1 silver certificate. The reverse of the note featured an ornate design that occupied the entire note, excluding the borders.
* 1890: One-dollar Treasury or &quot;Coin Notes&quot; were issued for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The reverse featured the large word in the center surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.
* 1891: The reverse of the Series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too &quot;busy,&quot; which would make it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design. The obverse was largely unchanged.
* 1896: The famous &quot;Educational Series&quot; Silver Certificate was issued. The entire obverse was covered with artwork of allegorical figures representing &quot;history instructing youth&quot; in front of Washington D.C. The reverse featured portraits of George and Martha Washington surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.
* 1899: The $1 was again redesigned: the redesigned note was called the Black Eagle Silver Certificate. The obverse featured a vignette of the United States Capitol behind a bald eagle perched on an American flag. Below that were small portraits of Abraham Lincoln to the left and Ulysses S. Grant to the right.
* 1917: The obverse of the $1 United States Note was changed slightly with the removal of ornamental frames that surrounded the serial numbers.
* 1918: The only large-sized, Federal Reserve Note-like $1 bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Bank Note (not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes). Each note was an obligation of the issuing Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed at that corresponding bank. The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of George Washington to the left and wording in the entire center. The reverse featured a bald eagle in flight clutching an American flag.
* 1923: Both the one-dollar United States Note and Silver Certificate were redesigned. Both notes featured the same reverse and an almost identical obverse with the same border design and portrait of George Washington. The only difference between the two notes was the color of ink used for the numeral 1 crossed by the word , Treasury seal, and serial numbers along with the wording of the obligations. These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.

===Small size notes===

&quot;(6.14 length × 2.61 width × thickness = 156 × 66.3 × )&quot;

In 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as silver certificates under Series of 1928. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray replaced the blue &quot;.&quot; The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 bill, but the center featured a large ornate superimposed by . These are commonly known as &quot;Funnybacks&quot; due to the rather odd-looking &quot;ONE&quot; on the reverse. These silver certificates were issued until 1934.

In 1933, Series of 1928 United States Notes were issued to supplement the supply of Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in Puerto Rico.

In 1934, the design of the silver certificate was changed. This occurred with that year&#x27;s passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal. Under Washington&#x27;s portrait, was changed to . The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over , and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.

A year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by , and a stylized was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of .

World War II brought about special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.
Special Silver Certificates were issued for Hawaii in case of a Japanese invasion. was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe, being distinguishable from regular Silver Certificates by their yellow seals; unlike the Hawaii overprint series, the remainder of the design was left unchanged. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.

The next change came in 1957 when the bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto . The inclusion of the motto, &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, on all currency was required by law in 1955, It was added over the word on the reverse. Thus all series 1957 and later notes include the motto. Initially the BEP began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto too. Later the 1935H series was printed only with the motto. The reason these 1935 series notes were produced into the 1960s was that older printing plates were used as long as possible. There is no particular difference in value if a bill does or does not have the motto.

The final production of Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.

Production of one-dollar Federal Reserve Notes was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word &quot;one&quot;, which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated. The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.

The first change since then came in 1969, when the was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new Treasury seal, with English wording instead of Latin.

The bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million star notes from the Dallas FRB was produced.

Though bill denominations of and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the or bills. 

====Experimental issues====

Since 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.

In 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B–B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.

A better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red &quot;S&quot; to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red &quot;R&quot;. Because they have some collector value, fake red S&#x27;s and R&#x27;s have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note&#x27;s serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.

Sometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production. The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the Philadelphia FRB as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.

In August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the Richmond FRB, with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the .

One-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a web-fed Intaglio printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th &amp; C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.

===Series dates===

====Small size====

==Obverse of current $1 bill==


The portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the obverse of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.

To the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A–L), identifying it among the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal Federal Reserve System seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.

To the right of George Washington is the Treasury Department seal.
The scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in English instead of Latin.

Below the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the Treasurer of the United States, and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the Secretary of the Treasury&#x27;s signature. To the left of the Secretary&#x27;s signature is the series date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note&#x27;s appearance such as a new currency design.

On the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s. A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If &quot;FW&quot; appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite Bureau of Engraving and Printing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. The absence of &quot;FW&quot; indicates the bill was printed at the main facility in Washington, D.C.

==Reverse of current $1 bill==
The reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the Great Seal of the United States to the left and right of the word &quot;ONE&quot;. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and seriffed typeface. A smaller image of the word &quot;ONE&quot; is superimposed over the numeral &quot;1&quot; in each of the four corners of the bill.

&quot;THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot; spans the top of the bill, &quot;ONE DOLLAR&quot; is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central &quot;ONE&quot; are the words &quot;IN GOD WE TRUST&quot;, which became the official motto of the United States in 1956 by an Act of Congress. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words &quot;THE GREAT SEAL&quot;, and below the obverse on the right side are the words &quot;OF THE UNITED STATES.&quot;

The Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill&#x27;s design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.

The reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the Eye of Providence within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the year of American independence from Britain. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, &quot;ANNUIT COEPTIS&quot;, meaning &quot;He favors our undertaking.&quot; At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming &quot;NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM&quot; meaning &quot;New Order of the Ages&quot; that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.

The obverse of the seal on the right features a bald eagle, the national bird and symbol of the United States. Above the eagle is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a six-pointed star. The eagle&#x27;s breast is covered by a heraldic shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the American flag. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading &quot;E PLURIBUS UNUM&quot;, a Latin phrase meaning &quot;Out of many [states], one [nation]&quot;, a &quot;de facto&quot; motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956). Both the phrases &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; and &quot;Annuit coeptis&quot; contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill. A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.

== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==
Except for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (web notes from other series are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value. However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.

In 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas. Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter &quot;K&quot;, for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number &quot;11&quot; and a &quot;K&quot; surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas in November 1963. The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.

In 1968–69 Joseph W. Barr was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill. Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed. Thus, they are very common.

Dollar bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or “palindrome“ notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists. Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number. The star designates that there was a printing error on one or more of the bills, and it has been replaced by one from a run specifically printed and numbered to be replacements. Star notes may have some additional value depending on their condition, their year series or if they have an unusual serial number sequence. To determine the rarity of modern star notes, production tables are maintained. There are rumors that series 2021 notes will be the last year which contains star notes, due to an update in the technology of the printing process.

== Redesign or replacement of the $1 bill ==

In modern times, the one-dollar bill is used much more than the dollar coin, despite the U.S. Government&#x27;s repeated efforts to promote the latter. There are organizations specifically aimed at either preventing (Save the Greenback) or advocating (Coin Coalition) the complete elimination of the one-dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin.

On November 29, 2012, a House subcommittee met to consider replacing the dollar bill. This action took place after the seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject. The latest report claimed that switching to dollar coins would save $4.4 billion over thirty years. However, according to polls, few Americans want to give up dollar bills.

In response to various requests to redesign the $1 bill to include (among others) the Preamble, Bill of Rights, and list of Articles of the United States Constitution, recent budgets passed by Congress have included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the $1 bill, since the potential cost impact of this change on the vending machine industry would greatly exceed its benefits.

<text>Apidya (titled in Japanese characters below the title) is a horizontally scrolling shoot &#x27;em up video game developed by German studio Kaiko and released by Play Byte in 1992 for the Amiga. It was Kaiko&#x27;s second game developed. Despite being labelled II in the title it is not a sequel to any game, but has the digits placed there simply for a gag. 

==Gameplay==
The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter, with some elements similar to early, classic shoot &#x27;em ups. The story revolves around Ikuro, whose wife Yuri has been poisoned by Hexaae, an evil lord of black magic. Ikuro uses magic to transform into a deadly bee and vows to find an antidote for Yuri and wreak revenge on Hexaae.

The player controls a bee capable of launching a number of projectiles which can damage or destroy enemy targets. The game uses the power-up bar system pioneered by &quot;Gradius&quot;. Destroyed enemies sometimes leave a power-up in the form of a red-and-yellow flower. The player may collect these flowers and activate new weapons and enhancements. A &#x27;build-up&#x27; weapon, similar to the &#x27;beam&#x27; weapon in &quot;R-Type&quot;, also features. If the fire button is held down for a second or two, the bee produces a hissing noise and releasing the fire button will then cause the bee to fire a large, organic projectile (a giant bee stinger) which can wipe out waves of small enemies, or damage larger ones.

If the player&#x27;s bee is hit by enemy fire or crashes into the terrain, a life will be lost and the current stage is restarted except for the end bosses of the first 3 stages, that will continue till all lives are lost. Once all lives are lost the game ends. A co-operative two-player mode is possible, in which the second player controls a smaller companion drone, which can launch small projectiles and shield the first player. The drone can sustain 5 small projectiles per life but won&#x27;t survive large projectiles or collisions and the stage doesn&#x27;t reset if it dies, the large bee is the alpha which must survive to advance. The alpha bee dying resets the stage as with normal play minus end stage bosses for the first 3 stages. An alternating two player mode is also possible.

The game consists of five themed levels: a meadow, a pond, a sewer filled with mutated enemies, a bio-technological machine and a final level where the player must battle five final bosses. The final level offers plenty of points for slain enemies, offering a semi status quo for players as they will recover some lost lives from restarting the level.
Each level is divided up into a number of stages (usually three where the last is the end boss, that doesn&#x27;t reset upon losing a life only on credit). There is also a number of hidden bonus levels. In the first two levels, nearly all the enemies are real creatures which may be found in a meadow or pond. The later levels feature mutant and inorganic creations. During &quot;Techno Party&quot;, the bee morphs into a more mechanized form for the duration of that level. The first boss is unique, it cannot be harmed so the player must survive till it vacates the game.
There are four difficulty settings. When the difficulty is set to &quot;easy&quot;, it is not possible to play the last level, the ending sequence is skipped and the player is directed straight to the end credits.

==Music==
The musical soundtrack to the game was composed by game musician Chris Huelsbeck. A high-quality arrangement of the soundtrack was released as a CD album in 1992. The soundtrack of level 4 features several samples from L.A. Style&#x27;s &quot;James Brown Is Dead&quot;.

There have also been live performances of the game&#x27;s music:

* An Apidya suite was performed live by a full symphonic orchestra in 2003 at the Symphonic Game Music Concert series in Leipzig, Germany.
* Music from Apidya was part of the 2006 PLAY!, a Video Game Symphony concert in Stockholm, Sweden.
* Music from Apidya (as well as many of Hülsbeck&#x27;s other works) was played by a symphonic orchestra at the Symphonic Shades concert in 2008.
* Music from Apidya was featured on the Amiga Power; Album with Attitude.
* Music from Apidya as a tribute do the Amiga, featured on album Project Paula - Amiga performed and mixed by Volkor X in 2017.

==Reception==
The game was largely praised as a fine example of the shoot &#x27;em up genre. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; described the game as offering &quot;more playability than any other shoot &#x27;em up&quot; and awarded the game 89% in 1992. &quot;Amiga Format&quot; awarded the game 90%.

==Legacy==
An unofficial GBA Apidya technical demo followed years later, and an unofficial Windows remake of the first level was released in 2002 but neither was ever completed.

<doc id="509280" wikidata="Q4862847" url="?curid=509280" title="Baron Sudeley">
<text>Baron Sudeley is a hereditary title that has been created three times in the history of Britain, twice in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1299 when John de Sudeley was summoned to Parliament as Lord Sudeley. On the death of the third Baron in 1367 the title fell into abeyance. The abeyance was terminated in 1380 when Thomas Boteler, the fourth Baron, became the sole heir. The sixth Baron was created Baron Sudeley by letters patent in 1441. He served as Lord High Treasurer from 1444 to 1447. On his death in 1473, the 1441 creation became extinct while the 1299 creation once again fell into abeyance.

The third creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1838 when Charles Hanbury-Tracy was created Baron Sudeley, of Toddington in the County of Gloucester. He had previously represented Tewkesbury in the House of Commons as a Whig and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. He was also Chairman of the Royal Commission appointed to judge designs for the new Houses of Parliament. He married his cousin Henrietta Susanna, daughter and heiress of Henry Leigh Tracy, 8th and last Viscount Tracy, through which marriage the estate of Toddington Manor in Gloucestershire came into the Hanbury family. Five days before the marriage Charles Hanbury assumed the additional surname of Tracy.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Wallingford and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. In 1806 Lord Sudeley assumed by Royal licence the surname of Leigh in lieu of his patronymic. However, in 1839 he discontinued the use of this surname and resumed by Royal licence his original surname of Hanbury-Tracy. On his death, the title passed to his son, the third Baron. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament for Montgomery from 1863 to 1877 and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Captain of the Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms in 1886. However, he later came into financial difficulties which caused the sale of the family seat of Toddington Manor. 

The title is currently held by the eighth Baron (a member of the collateral branch of the family), who succeeded the seventh Baron on 5 September 2022.

<doc id="509282" wikidata="Q5321399" url="?curid=509282" title="E-FIT">
<text>Electronic Facial Identification Technique (E-FIT, e-fit, efit) is a computer-based method of producing facial composites of wanted criminal(s), based on eyewitness descriptions.

== Uses ==
The system first appeared in the late 1980s, programmed by John Platten and has since been progressively refined by Platten and latterly by Dr Matthew Maylin. E-FIT has developed a reputation as a highly reliable and flexible system for feature-based composite construction.

Customers for this system exist in over 30 countries around the world. These include the Metropolitan Police Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the New York Police Department, the Stockholm Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Jamaica Constabulary Force.

E-FIT is used both for minor and serious crimes. In the United Kingdom, it is an ever-present feature on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Crimewatch&quot; television programme. The system is available in Spanish, German, English (both US and UK), French, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish.

The widespread use of the original E-FIT approach is gradually being superseded by a new version of the program called EFIT-V. EFIT-V is a full-colour, hybrid system that offers increased flexibility and speed, allowing the face to be constructed using both evolutionary and systematic construction techniques.

== Efficacy ==
The E-FIT, Pro-fit, and similar systems used in the UK have been subjected to a number of formal academic examinations. In these studies, volunteers were able to identify the person in the composite about 20% of the time if the composite was prepared immediately after viewing the subject. However, one study found that if witnesses were required to wait two days before constructing a composite, which matches real-life applications more closely, success rates fell to between 3 and 8 per cent.

<text>Baron Stamp, of Shortlands in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1938 for the civil servant, industrialist, economist, statistician and banker, Sir Josiah Stamp. The second Baron, Wilfred Carlyle Stamp, holds the record for having held a peerage for the shortest length of time. On 16 April 1941, the first Baron Stamp was killed by a German bomb, as was his son Wilfred. Legally, the son was presumed to have died a fraction of a second after his father, and therefore is supposed to have succeeded to the title for that short amount of time. The second Baron was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Baron.

==Barons Stamp (1938)==
*Josiah Charles Stamp, 1st Baron Stamp (1880–1941)
*Wilfred Carlyle Stamp, 2nd Baron Stamp (1904–1941)
*Trevor Charles Stamp, 3rd Baron Stamp (1907–1987)
*Trevor Charles Bosworth Stamp, 4th Baron Stamp (1935–2022)
*Nicholas Charles Trevor Stamp, 5th Baron Stamp (b. 1978)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son the Hon. Leo Charles Xie Stamp (b. 2021).

<text>The Dan Ryan Expressway, often called &quot;the Dan Ryan&quot; by locals, is an expressway in Chicago that runs from the Jane Byrne Interchange with Interstate 290 (I-290) near downtown Chicago through the South Side of the city. It is designated as both I-90 and I-94 south to 66th Street, a distance of . South of 66th Street, the expressway meets the Chicago Skyway, which travels southeast; the I-90 designation transfers over to the Skyway, while the Dan Ryan Expressway retains the I-94 designation and continues south for , ending at an interchange with I-57. This is a total distance of . The highway was named for Dan Ryan Jr., a former president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

== Route description ==
On an average day, up to 307,100 vehicles use a portion of the Dan Ryan (2005 data). The Dan Ryan, and its North Side counterpart the Kennedy Expressway, are the busiest roads in the entire state of Illinois. Utilizing an express-local system, the Dan Ryan has 14 lanes of traffic; seven in each direction, with four of those as express lanes and the other three providing access for exit and on-ramps. Because of its width, the Dan Ryan is very popular with commuters who live south of the Loop, making the road prone to traffic jams during weekday rush hour.

The posted directions on the Dan Ryan are different from the actual compass direction of the expressway, which may cause confusion to many travelers. The Dan Ryan for its entire length runs north–south. However, the Dan Ryan is a part of the larger Interstates 90 and 94, which both run east–west through the United States. Therefore, one who is traveling &quot;west&quot; on I-90/94 is actually driving north on the Dan Ryan as it passes through Chicago; I-90 continues northwest from the Kennedy split, while I-94 runs north–south until the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee. Similarly, &quot;east&quot; on 90 and 94 on the entire system is really south through Chicago; the interstates will continue on an easterly path outside of the city. Chicagoans also typically refer to the direction of travel as either &quot;inbound&quot; or &quot;outbound&quot; from the downtown area.

Four miles of continuous high-rise housing projects (Stateway Gardens and the Robert Taylor Homes) formerly ran parallel to the expressway on its eastern side from Cermak Road south to Garfield Boulevard. However, nearly all of these buildings have been demolished as part of the CHA&#x27;s transformation plan.

The Red Line runs in the median of the Dan Ryan. This section of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; opened on September 28, 1969. Chicago pioneered the location of rapid transit line in expressway medians, a practice that has since been followed in several other cities, such as Toronto, and Pasadena.

The control cities for the Dan Ryan Expressway are Indiana south, and the Chicago Loop northbound.

== History ==
The first segment of the Dan Ryan, opened on December 12, 1961, and ran between US 12/US 20, 95th Street north to 71st Street in Chicago&#x27;s Grand Crossing neighborhood. It was named after the recently deceased Dan Ryan, Jr., who was President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners who had worked to accelerate construction of Chicago-area expressways. A year later on December 15, 1962, the stretch of the Dan Ryan between 71st Street and I-90/Eisenhower Expressway (now signed as I-290) opened to the public as well as a stretch that connected it to the Bishop Ford Freeway (then known as the Calumet Expressway). During the planning stages it was also known as the South Route Expressway.
 
In 1988–1989, the northern of the Dan Ryan, known as the Elevated Bridge, were completely reconstructed.

In 2006 and 2007, the Illinois Department of Transportation reconstructed the entire length of the Dan Ryan Expressway, including the addition of a travel lane from 47th Street to 95th Street. The project was the largest expressway reconstruction plan in Chicago history. The total cost of the project was $975 million, nearly twice the $550 million original estimate for the project.

<doc id="509295" wikidata="Q938767" url="?curid=509295" title="Mickledore">
<text>Mickledore is a narrow ridge at an elevation of , connecting the mountains of Scafell and Scafell Pike in the English Lake District. It is also a pass between the valleys of Wasdale and Eskdale. The name means &quot;great door&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;.

The ridge is easily reached and traversed from Scafell Pike to the north, or from the valleys to the east and west. However, access to the summit of Scafell is barred by the rockface of Broad Stand, which looks much easier to climb than it is.

==Broad Stand==
Broad Stand is a steep buttress wall requiring sequential bouldering moves, which have been described as anything from scrambling to rock climbing. It is described as &#x27;extremely dangerous&#x27; by Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team, and the climb is &quot;Difficult&quot; in the British grading system. In descent, the cliff is even more dangerous.

The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge probably made a descent of Broad Stand on 5 August 1802; he wrote:

:. . .&quot;I began to suspect that I ought not to go on, but then unfortunately tho&#x27; I could with ease drop down a smooth Rock high, I could not climb it, so go on I must and on I went. The next 3 drops were not half a Foot, at least not a foot more than my own height, but every Drop increased the Palsy of my Limbs — I shook all over, Heaven knows without the least influence of Fear, and now I had only two more to drop down, to return was impossible — but of these two the first was tremendous, it was twice my own height, and the Ledge at the bottom was so exceedingly narrow, that if I dropt down upon it I must of necessity have fallen backwards and of course killed myself. My Limbs were all in a tremble — I lay upon my Back to rest myself, and was beginning according to my Custom to laugh at myself for a Madman, when the sight of the Crags above me on each side, and the impetuous Clouds just over them, posting so luridly and so rapidly northward, overawed me. I lay in a state of almost prophetic Trance and Delight — and blessed God aloud, for the powers of Reason and the Will, which remaining no Danger can overpower us! 

The historian and outdoor enthusiast W. G. Collingwood wrote in his classic guide book &quot;The Lake Counties&quot;:
. . .&quot;Indeed, it stands up with pinnacles and buttresses so high, and flanking precipice&#x27;s so deep, and even in places overhanging, that here, if anywhere in these mountains, one can get the impression of size and awesomeness. . .Right in front of Mickledore ridge the blocky volcanic-ash formation cleaves into a set of gigantic steps, as it were tilted from behind, so that the top of each step slopes outwards, and what should be vertical overhangs. . .That is the Broad Stand. . .

==Route to Scafell==

The walker seeking a safe route between England&#x27;s highest mountains must go via Foxes Tarn, which involves a descent to or so below the height of the ridge. The more challenging routes of Lord&#x27;s Rake, and the West Wall Traverse, offer alternative ways to reach Scafell.

===Route to Scafell via Foxes Tarn===
From the Mickledore ridge it is necessary to descend on the south side to pick up the path to Foxes Tarn. Older OS maps show the path junction near the confluence of two streams at about 680 m, however later maps show the path junction lower down at about 650 m. It is possible that the old path has been replaced with a newer one. 

==History==
The Mickledore mountain rescue stretcher box was airlifted to the site by the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service in 1974.

<doc id="509296" wikidata="Q4862712" url="?curid=509296" title="Baron Poltimore">
<text>Baron Poltimore, of Poltimore in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1831 for Sir George Bampfylde, 6th Baronet. His son, the second Baron, held office as Treasurer of the Household from 1872 to 1874 in the first Liberal administration of William Ewart Gladstone.

 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his grandfather in 1978. He has notably been a director of Sotheby&#x27;s and appears on the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; as Mark Poltimore, one of the experts on paintings. In 2013 he appeared in the film Trance playing the role of Francis Lemaitre, an auctioneer.

The Bampfylde Baronetcy, of Poltimore in the County of Devon, was created in the Baronetage of England on 14 July 1641 for John Bampfylde, the ancestor of the first Baron. He represented Penryn in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Tiverton and Devonshire. His grandson, the third Baronet, and great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, both represented Exeter and Devonshire in the House of Commons. The latter&#x27;s son, the fifth Baronet, also sat as Member of Parliament for Exeter. He was shot by an ex-servant on 7 April 1823 and died twelve days later. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned sixth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1831.

Another member of the Bampfylde family was Thomas Bampfylde, brother of the first Baronet. He served briefly as Speaker of the House of Commons in 1659. Also, John Codrington Bampfylde, younger son of the fourth Baronet, was a poet.

The ancestral seat of the Bampfylde family was Poltimore House, near Exeter, Devon, and from the 15th century at North Molton, North Devon. Their Exeter townhouse was Bampfylde House, built c. 1590, destroyed by bombing in 1942 during WW II. The seventh Baron and his family live near Hungerford, Berkshire.

<text>Transmissions from the Satellite Heart is the sixth studio album by American rock band the Flaming Lips, released in 1993 by Warner Bros. Records. The album marked the departure of Jonathan Donahue (to Mercury Rev) and Nathan Roberts, and the addition of guitarist Ronald Jones and drummer Steven Drozd.

The track &quot;She Don&#x27;t Use Jelly&quot; is notable for being the band&#x27;s first charting radio hit, after its video was featured on the MTV series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; nearly a year after the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Turn It On&quot; was also a moderately successful single, and also had two different music videos, one of which was shot at a laundromat. By 2002, &quot;Transmissions from the Satellite Heart&quot; had sold 300,000 copies worldwide.

The EP &quot;Due to High Expectations... The Flaming Lips Are Providing Needles for Your Balloons&quot; was released the following year to promote the album and featured live versions of &quot;Chewin the Apple of Yer Eye&quot; and &quot;Slow•Nerve•Action.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;as post-punk novelty singles go, &#x27;She Don’t Use Jelly&#x27; ... is grade-A whimsy, with Coyne’s wobbly singing the perfect complement to the band’s loose-limbed rumble.&quot;

<doc id="509300" wikidata="Q211783" url="?curid=509300" title="Pappus of Alexandria">
<text>Pappus of Alexandria (; ; AD) was a Greek mathematician of late antiquity known for his &quot;Synagoge&quot; (Συναγωγή) or &quot;Collection&quot; (), and for Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem in projective geometry. Almost nothing is known about his life except for what can be found in his own writings, many of which are lost. Pappus apparently lived in Alexandria, where he worked as a mathematics teacher to higher level students, one of whom was named Hermodorus.

The &quot;Collection&quot;, his best-known work, is a compendium of mathematics in eight volumes, the bulk of which survives. It covers a wide range of topics that were part of the ancient mathematics curriculum, including geometry, astronomy, and mechanics.

Pappus was active in a period generally considered one of stagnation in mathematical studies, where he stands out as a remarkable exception. In many respects, his fate strikingly resembles that of Diophantus&#x27;, originally of limited importance but becoming very influential in the late Renaissance and Early Modern periods.

==Dating==
In his surviving writings, Pappus gives no indication of the date of the authors whose works he makes use of, or of the time (but see below) when he himself wrote. If no other date information were available, all that could be known would be that he was later than Ptolemy (died c. 168 AD), whom he quotes, and earlier than Proclus (born ), who quotes him.

The 10th century &quot;Suda&quot; states that Pappus was of the same age as Theon of Alexandria, who was active in the reign of Emperor Theodosius I (372–395). A different date is given by a marginal note to a late 10th-century manuscript (a copy of a chronological table by the same Theon), which states, next to an entry on Emperor Diocletian (reigned 284–305), that &quot;at that time wrote Pappus&quot;.

However, a verifiable date comes from the dating of a solar eclipse mentioned by Pappus himself. In his commentary on the &quot;Almagest&quot; he calculates &quot;the place and time of conjunction which gave rise to the eclipse in Tybi in 1068 after Nabonassar&quot;. This works out as 18 October 320, and so Pappus must have been active around 320.

==Works==
The great work of Pappus, in eight books and titled &quot;Synagoge&quot; or &quot;Collection&quot;, has not survived in complete form: the first book is lost, and the rest have suffered considerably. The &quot;Suda&quot; enumerates other works of Pappus: &quot;Χωρογραφία οἰκουμενική&quot; (&quot;Chorographia oikoumenike&quot; or &quot;Description of the Inhabited World&quot;), commentary on the four books of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, &quot;Ποταμοὺς τοὺς ἐν Λιβύῃ&quot; (&quot;The Rivers in Libya&quot;), and &quot;Ὀνειροκριτικά&quot; (&quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;). Pappus himself mentions another commentary of his own on the &quot;Ἀνάλημμα&quot; (&quot;Analemma&quot;) of Diodorus of Alexandria. Pappus also wrote commentaries on Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (of which fragments are preserved in Proclus and the Scholia, while that on the tenth Book has been found in an Arabic manuscript), and on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Ἁρμονικά&quot; (&quot;Harmonika&quot;).

Federico Commandino translated the &quot;Collection&quot; of Pappus into Latin in 1588. The German classicist and mathematical historian Friedrich Hultsch (1833–1908) published a definitive three-volume presentation of Commandino&#x27;s translation with both the Greek and Latin versions (Berlin, 1875–1878). Using Hultsch&#x27;s work, the Belgian mathematical historian Paul ver Eecke was the first to publish a translation of the &quot;Collection&quot; into a modern European language; his two-volume, French translation has the title &quot;Pappus d&#x27;Alexandrie. La Collection Mathématique.&quot; (Paris and Bruges, 1933).

==&quot;Collection&quot;==
Pappus&#x27;s &quot;Collection&quot; contains an account, systematically arranged, of the most important results obtained by his predecessors and notes explanatory of, or extending, previous discoveries. These discoveries form, in fact, a text upon which Pappus enlarges discursively. Heath considered the systematic introductions to the various books valuable, for they set forth clearly an outline of the contents and the general scope of the subjects to be treated. In these introductions, the style of Pappus&#x27;s writing is excellent and even elegant the moment he is free from the shackles of mathematical formulae and expressions. Heath also found his characteristic exactness made his &quot;Collection&quot; &quot;a most admirable substitute for the texts of the many valuable treatises of earlier mathematicians of which time has deprived us&quot;.

The surviving portions of &quot;Collection&quot; can be summarized as follows.

===Book I===
Book I has been lost. Book I, like Book II, may have been concerned with arithmetic, as Book III is clearly introduced as beginning a new subject.

===Book II===
The whole of Book II (the former part of which is lost, the existing fragment beginning in the middle of the 14th proposition) discusses a method of multiplication from an unnamed book by Apollonius of Perga. The final propositions deal with multiplying together the numerical values of Greek letters in two lines of poetry, producing two very large numbers approximately equal to and .

===Book III===
Book III contains geometrical problems, plane and solid. It may be divided into five sections:

# On the famous problem of finding two mean proportionals between two given lines, which arose from that of duplicating the cube, reduced by Hippocrates of Chios to the former. Pappus gives several solutions of this problem, including a method of making successive approximations to the solution, the significance of which he apparently failed to appreciate; he adds his own solution of the more general problem of finding geometrically the side of a cube whose content is in any given ratio to that of a given one.
# On the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means between two straight lines, and the problem of representing all three in one and the same geometrical figure. This serves as an introduction to a general theory of means, of which Pappus distinguishes ten kinds, and gives a table representing examples of each in whole numbers.
# On a curious problem suggested by Euclid I. 21.
# On the inscribing of each of the five regular polyhedra in a sphere. Here Pappus observed that a regular dodecahedron and a regular icosahedron could be inscribed in the same sphere such that their vertices all lay on the same 4 circles of latitude, with 3 of the icosahedron&#x27;s 12 vertices on each circle, and 5 of the dodecahedron&#x27;s 20 vertices on each circle. This observation has been generalised to higher dimensional dual polytopes.
# An addition by a later writer on another solution of the first problem of the book.

===Book IV===
Of Book IV the title and preface have been lost, so that the program has to be gathered from the book itself. At the beginning is the well-known generalization of Euclid I.47 (Pappus&#x27;s area theorem), then follow various theorems on the circle, leading up to the problem of the construction of a circle which shall circumscribe three given circles, touching each other two and two. This and several other propositions on contact, e.g. cases of circles touching one another and inscribed in the figure made of three semicircles and known as arbelos (&quot;shoemakers knife&quot;) form the first division of the book; Pappus turns then to a consideration of certain properties of Archimedes&#x27;s spiral, the conchoid of Nicomedes (already mentioned in Book I as supplying a method of doubling the cube), and the curve discovered most probably by Hippias of Elis about 420 BC, and known by the name, τετραγωνισμός, or quadratrix. Proposition 30 describes the construction of a curve of double curvature called by Pappus the helix on a sphere; it is described by a point moving uniformly along the arc of a great circle, which itself turns about its diameter uniformly, the point describing a quadrant and the great circle a complete revolution in the same time. The area of the surface included between this curve and its base is found – the first known instance of a quadrature of a curved surface. The rest of the book treats of the trisection of an angle, and the solution of more general problems of the same kind by means of the quadratrix and spiral. In one solution of the former problem is the first recorded use of the property of a conic (a hyperbola) with reference to the focus and directrix.

===Book V===
In Book V, after an interesting preface concerning regular polygons, and containing remarks upon the hexagonal form of the cells of honeycombs, Pappus addresses himself to the comparison of the areas of different plane figures which have all the same perimeter (following Zenodorus&#x27;s treatise on this subject), and of the volumes of different solid figures which have all the same superficial area, and, lastly, a comparison of the five regular solids of Plato. Incidentally Pappus describes the thirteen other polyhedra bounded by equilateral and equiangular but not similar polygons, discovered by Archimedes, and finds, by a method recalling that of Archimedes, the surface and volume of a sphere.

===Book VI===
According to the preface, Book VI is intended to resolve difficulties occurring in the so-called &quot;Lesser Astronomical Works&quot; (Μικρὸς Ἀστρονομούμενος), i.e. works other than the &quot;Almagest&quot;. It accordingly comments on the &quot;Sphaerica&quot; of Theodosius, the &quot;Moving Sphere&quot; of Autolycus, Theodosius&#x27;s book on &quot;Day and Night&quot;, the treatise of Aristarchus &quot;On the Size and Distances of the Sun and Moon&quot;, and Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Optics and Phaenomena&quot;.

===Book VII===
Since Michel Chasles cited this book of Pappus in his history of geometric methods, it has become the object of considerable attention.

The preface of Book VII explains the terms analysis and synthesis, and the distinction between theorem and problem. Pappus then enumerates works of Euclid, Apollonius, Aristaeus and Eratosthenes, thirty-three books in all, the substance of which he intends to give, with the lemmas necessary for their elucidation. With the mention of the &quot;Porisms&quot; of Euclid we have an account of the relation of porism to theorem and problem. In the same preface is included (a) the famous problem known by Pappus&#x27;s name, often enunciated thus: Having given a number of straight lines, to find the geometric locus of a point such that the lengths of the perpendiculars upon, or (more generally) the lines drawn from it obliquely at given inclinations to, the given lines satisfy the condition that the product of certain of them may bear a constant ratio to the product of the remaining ones; (Pappus does not express it in this form but by means of composition of ratios, saying that if the ratio is given which is compounded of the ratios of pairs one of one set and one of another of the lines so drawn, and of the ratio of the odd one, if any, to a given straight line, the point will lie on a curve given in position); (b) the theorems which were rediscovered by and named after Paul Guldin, but appear to have been discovered by Pappus himself.

Book VII also contains

# under the head of the &quot;De Sectione Determinata&quot; of Apollonius, lemmas which, closely examined, are seen to be cases of the involution of six points;
# important lemmas on the &quot;Porisms&quot; of Euclid, including what is called Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem;
# a lemma upon the &quot;Surface Loci&quot; of Euclid which states that the locus of a point such that its distance from a given point bears a constant ratio to its distance from a given straight line is a conic, and is followed by proofs that the conic is a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola according as the constant ratio is equal to, less than or greater than 1 (the first recorded proofs of the properties, which do not appear in Apollonius).

Chasles&#x27;s citation of Pappus was repeated by Wilhelm Blaschke and Dirk Struik. In Cambridge, England, John J. Milne gave readers the benefit of his reading of Pappus. In 1985 Alexander Jones wrote his thesis at Brown University on the subject. A revised form of his translation and commentary was published by Springer-Verlag the following year. Jones succeeds in showing how Pappus manipulated the complete quadrangle, used the relation of projective harmonic conjugates, and displayed an awareness of cross-ratios of points and lines. Furthermore, the concept of pole and polar is revealed as a lemma in Book VII.

===Book VIII===
Book VIII principally treats mechanics, the properties of the center of gravity, and some mechanical powers. Interspersed are some propositions on pure geometry. Proposition 14 shows how to draw an ellipse through five given points, and Prop. 15 gives a simple construction for the axes of an ellipse when a pair of conjugate diameters are given.

==Legacy==
Pappus&#x27;s &quot;Collection&quot; was virtually unknown to the Arabs and medieval Europeans, but exerted great influence on 17th-century mathematics after being translated to Latin by Federico Commandino. Diophantus&#x27;s &quot;Arithmetica&quot; and Pappus&#x27;s &quot;Collection&quot; were the two major sources of Viète&#x27;s &quot;Isagoge in artem analyticam&quot; (1591). The Pappus&#x27;s problem and its generalization led Descartes to the development of analytic geometry. Fermat also developed his version of analytic geometry and his method of Maxima and Minima from Pappus&#x27;s summaries of Apollonius&#x27;s lost works &quot;Plane Loci&quot; and &quot;On Determinate Section&quot;. Other mathematicians influenced by Pappus were Pacioli, da Vinci, Kepler, van Roomen, Pascal, Newton, Bernoulli, Euler, Gauss, Gergonne, Steiner and Poncelet.

<text>In Asteraceae, the pappus is the modified calyx, the part of an individual floret, that surrounds the base of the corolla tube in flower. It functions as a dispersal mechanism for the achenes that contain the seeds.

In Asteraceae, the pappus may be composed of bristles (sometimes feathery), awns, scales, or may be absent, and in some species, is too small to see without magnification. In genera such as &quot;Taraxacum&quot; or &quot;Eupatorium&quot;, feathery bristles of the pappus function as a &quot;parachute&quot; which enables the seed to be carried by the wind. In genera such as &quot;Bidens&quot; the pappus has hooks that function in mechanical dispersal.

The name derives from the Ancient Greek word &quot;pappos&quot;, Latin &quot;pappus&quot;, meaning &quot;old man&quot;, so used for a plant (assumed to be an &quot;Erigeron&quot; species) having bristles and also for the woolly, hairy seed of certain plants.

The pappus of the dandelion plays a vital role in the wind-aided dispersal of its seeds. By creating a separated vortex ring in its wake, the flight of the pappus is stabilized and more lift and drag are produced. The pappus also has the property of being able to change its morphology in the presence of moisture in various ways that aid germination. The change of shape can adjust the rate of abscission, allowing increased or decreased germination depending on the favorability of conditions.

==Biomimicry==
The pappus of the dandelion has been studied and reproduced for a variety of applications. It has the ability to retain about 100 times its weight in water and pappus-inspired mechanisms have been proposed and fabricated which would allow highly efficient and specialized liquid transport. Another application of the pappus is in the use of minute airflow detection around walls which is important for measuring small fluctuations in airflow in neonatal incubators or to measure low velocity airflow in heating and ventilation systems.

<text>Toys &quot;R&quot; Us is an American toy, clothing, and baby product retailer owned by Tru Kids (doing business as Tru Kids Brands) and various others. The company was founded in 1948; its first store was built in April 1948, with its headquarters located in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area.

While originally considered a category killer, the rise of mass merchants and online retailers cost Toys &quot;R&quot; Us its share of the toy market. The company was further hampered by a significant debt load, the result of a leveraged buyout organized by private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and real estate firm Vornado. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and 2018, closing all of its stores in the US, UK, and Australia, with the last US stores closing in 2021. Operations in other international markets such as Asia and Africa were less affected, but chains in Canada, parts of Europe and Asia were eventually sold to third parties.

In August 2021, WHP Global announced that Toys &quot;R&quot; Us would be opening over 400 stores within Macy&#x27;s starting in 2022. The flagship store is located in New Jersey at the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex. A second flagship store was opened inside the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, in November 2023.

==History==
===Origins===
In April 1948, Charles P. Lazarus founded a baby-furniture retailer, Children&#x27;s Bargain Town, in Washington, D.C. during the postwar baby boom; the store&#x27;s site at 2461 18th St NW later became Madam&#x27;s Organ Blues Bar. The store was acquired in 1966 by Interstate Department Stores, Inc. 

The focus of the store changed in June 1957, and the first Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, dedicated exclusively to toys rather than furniture, was opened by Lazarus in Rockville, Maryland. Lazarus also designed and stylized the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us logo, which featured a backwards &quot;R&quot; to give the impression that a child wrote it. The store chain grew successfully and built a brand which was recognizable to many children born from the 1960s to the 1990s, and it shared in the success of the birth of popular culture successes of action figures (&quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;), dolls (Cabbage Patch Kids, &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot;), video games (Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario&quot; series and other co-developed names, original Sega Genesis stations and titles), and ultimately the co-branded FAO series, as the higher-end FAO Schwarz stores folded.

===21st century===
The board of directors installed John Eyler as CEO (formerly of FAO Schwarz) in May 2000. Eyler launched a plan to remodel and re-launch the chain. Blaming market pressures (primarily competition from Walmart and Target), Toys &quot;R&quot; Us considered splitting its toy and baby businesses. On March 17, 2005, a consortium of Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Vornado Realty Trust announced a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout of the company. Public stock closed for the last time on July 21, 2005, at $26.75—a 63% increase since when it first announced that the company was put up for sale. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us became a privately owned entity after the buyout. The company still files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by its debt agreements.

In December 2013, eight days before Christmas, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us announced their stores in the United States would stay open for 87 hours straight. The flagship store of the retailer in Times Square was open for 24 hours a day from December 1 to 24, to cater to tourists. The announcement came after snow and rain caused a nearly 9 percent year-over-year decline in U.S. store foot traffic. This move also pushed the retailer to hire an additional 45,000 seasonal workers to cater to the demand of the extended store hours. Since the toy business is highly seasonal, more than 40% of the company&#x27;s sales come in during the last quarter of the year.

In 2014, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us announced its &quot;TRU Transformation&quot; strategy, which concentrated on efforts to fix foundational issues affecting future growth, including making stores less cluttered, improving the customer experience, clearer pricing strategies and promotions, and tighter integration of its retail and online businesses. In 2015, the company launched the first of a new concept store called the &quot;Toy Lab&quot; in Freehold, New Jersey. The new layout provided more space for interactive exhibits and areas to play with new toys before purchase. This concept has since been expanded to stores in California, Delaware, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania.

===Bankruptcy===


On September 18, 2017, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stating the move would give it flexibility to deal with $5 billion in long-term debt by borrowing $2 billion so it could pay suppliers for the upcoming holiday season and invest in improving current operations. The company has not had an annual profit since 2013. It reported a net loss of US$164 million in the quarter ending April 29, 2017. It lost US$126 million in the same period in the prior year. It had been paying US$400 million per year to service its debt, which prevented it from investing in improvements to in-store experiences to compete with Amazon and Walmart. Although the &quot;retail apocalypse&quot; was a factor, some analysts cited that the rapid increase in debt occurred under its private equity ownership. The company was reported to have a total workforce of 64,000 in September 2017.

It was initially stated that only the U.S. and Canadian operations would be affected, and that its brick-and-mortar stores and online sales sites would continue to operate. In January 2018, the company announced it would liquidate and close up to 182 of its stores in the U.S. as part of its restructuring, as well as convert up to 12 stores into co-branded Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Babies &quot;R&quot; Us stores.

On February 28, 2018, it was reported that the company was exploring retaining its stronger Canadian operations, and the divestiture of some of its corporate-owned stores to franchises (leaving approximately 200 in a downsized chain). Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. later announced that all U.S. locations would be closed.

On March 15, 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us received approval from the bankruptcy court to liquidate its stores. There were buyers interested in acquiring groups of stores to use as showrooms, as well as others interested in acquiring the chain&#x27;s brand and associated intellectual property. The company indicated in filings that the Canadian operations were profitable, and desired to preserve the operations of the 82-store chain through a sale. MGA Entertainment had made an offer to acquire the Canadian operations. MGA Entertainment CEO Isaac Larian attempted to raise $200 million through investments and public crowdfunding to purchase at least 400 of the U.S. locations.

Liquidation sales began on March 23, 2018. The chain&#x27;s online store shut down on March 29, redirecting visitors to information on the liquidation and closures. On April 24, 2018, it was announced that the Canadian division would be sold to Fairfax Financial for approximately $234 million, and would continue to operate the locations under the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us name. Fairfax stated that it was potentially interested in purchasing U.S. locations as an extension of these Canadian operations.

On April 13, a bid was made by Isaac Larian to buy 356 Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores for $890 million, but was rejected on April 17 and was fully scrapped on April 23.

On June 29, 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us permanently closed all of its remaining U.S. locations, after 70 years of operations. In early July 2018, it was reported that unknown benefactors had bought all of the remaining stock of two locations in North Carolina so they could be donated to charity.

In November 2018, &quot;Fortune&quot; noted that the absence of the retailer during the 2018 holiday season represented a chunk of toy sales from which other retailers could benefit. Party supply retailer Party City capitalized on the closures by establishing temporary pop-up stores under the branding Toy City, some of which filled vacancies left by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us locations.

===Restructuring, Tru Kids, Inc., WHP Global, second restructuring, and third restructuring===
On October 1, 2018, the company issued a bankruptcy court filing which stated that it would no longer auction off its intellectual property, since its controlling lender planned to &quot;[revive] the business behind the Toys &#x27;R&#x27; Us and Babies &#x27;R&#x27; Us brand names&quot; with a focus on maintaining existing licensing agreements and establishing new retail opportunities. The company evaluated that selling its brand at auction &quot;[was] not reasonably likely to yield a superior alternative.&quot;

At the Toy Industry Association&#x27;s Fall Toy Preview, the company unveiled plans for a preliminary venture to be known as Geoffrey&#x27;s Toy Box, a wholesale store-within-a-store concept that the company planned to deploy in time for the holiday shopping season. The company planned to revive the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Babies &quot;R&quot; Us brands in the future. In November 2018, it was announced that grocery market chain Kroger would add toy displays under the Geoffrey&#x27;s Toy Box brand to some of its locations, to sell selections of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us private-label products. The brand operates under Geoffrey LLC, an intellectual property holding company within Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

On January 20, 2019, the company emerged from bankruptcy as Tru Kids.

As of June 21, 2019, the company planned to open new stores in the US slated to be 10,000 square feet, roughly a third of the size of the big box brand that closed in 2018. On November 27, 2019, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us opened a retail store at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey. On December 7, 2019, a second location was opened at The Galleria in Houston, Texas.

On October 8, 2019, the company relaunched the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us website, which would feature a focus on resources and videos highlighting popular toys. The site was established in partnership with Target, with users being redirected to Target.com to place their orders. In 2020, the agreement lapsed, and Amazon replaced Target as the site&#x27;s fulfillment partner.

In 2021, as a result of financial losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the only two U.S. stores once again closed down. The Houston location closed on January 15, 2021, and the Paramus location closed on January 26, 2021. The company stated that they made a strategic decision to pivot their store strategy, so they can look for new stores and platforms that will offer better traffic and that they continue to invest in channels where customers will want to experience their brand.

On March 15, 2021, it was announced that brand management company WHP Global acquired a controlling interest in Tru Kids, which is the parent company of the Toys R Us, Babies R Us and Geoffrey the Giraffe brands. Going forward WHP will be managing Tru Kids business, and help guiding its expansion. In North America WHP plans to open Toys R Us stores, again — ideally ahead of the holiday season and could come on various formats to include flagships, pop-ups, airport locations or mini stores inside other retailers&#x27; shops. WHP has not yet set a number of locations it plans to open in the United States. WHP is backed by a $350 million equity commitment from funds that are managed by Oaktree Capital Management. Financial terms of the deal have yet to be disclosed.

On August 19, 2021, WHP announced a new shift in branding by partnering with Macy&#x27;s to sell toys on the retailer&#x27;s website and open store-within-a-store locations at 400 department store locations.

On December 16, 2021, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us opened a two-story flagship store at a size of 20,000 square feet in the American Dream Meadowlands mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

On August 7, 2022, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us opened new locations in nine states: California, Georgia, New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, Louisiana, New York, Maryland, and Missouri. These stores are located inside Macy&#x27;s stores and range from 1,000 to 10,000 square feet. The company plans to open a store in every Macy&#x27;s location in the United States by October 15, 2022, just in time for the holiday season.

A second flagship store was opened inside the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, in November 2023. 

On September 29, 2023, WHP announced their intention to open 24 new physical stores in the United States. These stores would be stand-alone locations and would begin to open in 2024. WHP also announced smaller stores that would be located in airports and cruise ships. The first of these smaller stores opened in November 2023, and is located in Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

In 2024, a new store opened at Harlem Irving Plaza in Norridge, Illinois.

==Flagship store in Times Square==

On November 17, 2001, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us opened an international flagship store in New York&#x27;s Times Square at a cost of $35 million. The 110,000 square-foot store included various themed zones such as Barbie (with a life-size dreamhouse), Jurassic Park (with an animatronic T-Rex), Lego, and the signature indoor Ferris wheel. The flagship store also served as a gaming destination, partnering with Microsoft to be the world&#x27;s first location to launch the original Xbox console on November 15, 2001. In 2006, the store added a &quot;Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova&quot; arcade machine in its electronics department. The store later added a full amusement arcade, known as &quot;R&quot;Cade. In 2010, a Wonka shop opened on the second floor of the flagship store. The store drew thousands of tourists for over a decade before the company decided to cancel its lease on the space in December 2015.

In August 2017, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us announced a 35,000 square-foot temporary store near the original one that would be open around the Christmas shopping season.

==Charitable giving==
From 2004 until the company&#x27;s end in 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc., the former owner of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, had partnered with the Toys for Tots foundation to serve as a donation site for anyone donating unwrapped toys or monetary gifts. However, there is no evidence that the current parent, Tru Kids Inc., has continued Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27;s relationship with Toys for Tots and the Toys for Tots Foundation has not included any recent information on their website concerning Toys &quot;R&quot; Us since the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. bankruptcy filing in 2018.

==Product safety==
Toys &quot;R&quot; Us had reportedly implemented high safety standards in 2007 and had vowed to take an aggressive approach towards holding vendors accountable for meeting those standards. Former chairman and CEO Gerald L. Storch, testifying before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government on toy safety in September 2007, said he supported new legislation strengthening toy-safety standards and outlined new initiatives the retailer had set forth to ensure that its customers receive timely information on recalls (including a new website).

In 2008, the company introduced stricter product safety standards exceeding federal requirements. Among the new standards was a requirement for materials inside toys to meet a standard of 250 parts per million of lead for all products manufactured exclusively for the retailer (compared with the federal standard of 600 ppm). Toys &quot;R&quot; Us also announced the requirement that baby products be produced without the addition of phthalates, which have raised concerns about infant safety. The company had adjusted its requirements to meet new federal standards enacted with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008.

==International operations==
During its most recent entry into a new market in November 2011, when it opened its first licensed store in Poland (Blue City), Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, International operated more than 600 international stores and over 140 licensed stores in 35 countries and jurisdictions outside the United States. At its peak, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, International had presence in 40 countries.

Many of these stores were corporate-owned, but stores in some countries were independently owned and operated with Toys &quot;R&quot; Us licensing its name to a local company.

===Canada===
In addition to its expansion in the United States, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us launched a worldwide presence in September 1984 when the company opened its first international wholly-owned store in Canada.

As of its sale to Fairfax Financial on June 1, 2018, the chain comprises 82 stores that continue to operate under the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us name following the sale. In 2021, Doug Putman, through his company Putman Investments, announced that he would buy Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Canada from Fairfax Financial.

===Australia===

The Australian wing of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us entered voluntary administration on May 22, 2018. On June 20, it was announced that all of their Australian stores would be closing as well. The closure of all 44 stores was concluded on August 5, 2018.

On June 5, 2019, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us returned in Australia when Tru Kids partnered with Hobby Warehouse to relaunch the website for the chain.

===Africa and the Middle East===
Since 1995 the Al-Futtaim Group has operated stores in Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Stores in Israel are operated by the Fishman retail group, while stores in Saudi Arabia are owned by Tasweeq Company. Stores in South Africa, Namibia, and Zambia are also independently owned and operated.

===Asia===
Toys &quot;R&quot; Us has extensive presence in East Asian territories and Southeast Asia under the umbrella of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Asia, a loose amalgamation of joint ventures with local companies. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores operate in Brunei, China (mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau), India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.

The Asian unit was originally established in 1985 as a partnership between Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Fung Retailing, the retail subsidiary of the Fung Group (a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that also owns Li &amp; Fung, a major retail distributor), with the parent company owning a majority 85% stake while Fung Retailing owns the remainder of the shares. Following Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27; sale of the Asian unit in November 2018, Fung Retailing becomes the lead shareholder of the unit, holding an increased share of 21% while Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27; remaining 79% is distributed among a consortium of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27; lenders.

The Singaporean operations of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us began as a joint venture with Metro Holdings of Singapore which began in 1984, while the Malaysian operations was with Metro Holdings&#x27; Malaysian counterpart Metrojaya. Its first store was at the Marina Parade and the second was at Forum Galleria at Orchard Road. It expanded to Malaysia in November 1988 with its first outlet at Subang Parade. The Singaporean venture was terminated in 1993 when Metro Holdings sold its shares back to the parent company of Toys ‘R’ Us Inc. In September 1994, Metro Holdings sold 60% of its stake in Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Malaysia to Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Singapore.

Toys &quot;R&quot; Us expanded to Japan in 1991 as a joint venture with . Its first store in Ami opened in November 1991 with 3,000 square meters of space, being the largest toy store in the country. Its second store in Kashihara opened in January 1992. The joint venture was supposed to last until 2018, but Toys &quot;R&quot; Us withdrew in 2006; after suing for breach of contract, McDonald&#x27;s Holdings was awarded an ¥1.38 billion ($13.35 million) settlement in 2008. After their joint venture ended, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us increased their ownership from approximately 48% to about 61%, and integrated it into their overall Asian operation in 2017.

Locations in South Korea and India are established through joint ventures formed in conjunction with Lotte Mart in 2007 and Lulu Hypermarket in 2017, respectively.

For RRHI to compete with SM Retail&#x27;s Toy Kingdom, in 2006, RRHI obtained the license to operate Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores in the Philippines, with the first one to open in Robinsons Galleria.

Buoyed by increasing demand for toys in the Asia Pacific region, the Asian and Japanese arms of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us are among the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us subsidiaries that have remained profitable into the 2000s and 2010s, registering &quot;double-digit&quot; revenue growth through the mid-to-late 2010s. In 2015, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Asia posted a total turnover of US$1.85 billion; for the year ended January 2017, net sales from China and Southeast Asia totaled at approximately US$375 million while the Japanese arm would net sales of US$1.3 billion from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, despite recently declining yearly profits, and US$20.3 million from Babies &quot;R&quot; Us.

While representatives of the Asian arm of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us have consistently cited that they operate as a separate legal entity from the parent company and are unaffected by events at the parent company, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us had engaged in talks since February 2018 to offload Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Asia&#x27;s majority stake to a bidder for a proposed US$1 billion while outlets in Asia continue to operate unaffected. The planned bid was revised downwards to US$760 million in August and scheduled for September while Toys &quot;R&quot; Us sought a United States court order to strip Fung Retailing, a Hong Kong-based partner managing the majority of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Asian operations, of its right-of-first-refusal purchase option and force Fung Retailing to release its share of the unit. This follows allegations by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us of Fung Retailing delaying the sale via court proceedings filed through the Hong Kong judiciary system to discourage rival bidders and acquire Toys &quot;R&quot; Us share at a lower price; the Eastern District of Virginia bankruptcy court would subsequently issue an order for Fung Retailing to drop its court order for the delay in a September 28, 2018, report.

On November 16, 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Asia announced that the parent company has formally sold the Asian unit to Fung Retailing and multiple Toys &quot;R&quot; Us lenders at a valuation of US$900 million (later revised to US$760 million), with Fung Retailing receiving an increase in shares of the unit to become the lead shareholder of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Asia and the unit securing the licensing rights to retain the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us namebrand.

====Turkey====
Toys &quot;R&quot; Us entered Turkey in 1996 by licensing its brand to Turkish firm Uluslararası Çocuk Çarşıları A.S. In 2008, the firm terminated Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27; licensing agreement and rebranded the 35 stores as Toyiki. However, under the new brand, the company struggled and had entered bankruptcy various times. In July 2010, Toyiki shut down their 32 remaining stores in exchange for debts.

===Europe===
====Poland====
Toys &quot;R&quot; Us entered the Polish market in October 2011, with their first store opening in Blue City, Warsaw. In October 2014, they began online operations.

The Polish operations remained unaffected during the bankruptcy, and by 2017, 16 stores were operating. Eventually, the Polish chain began to close stores to cover the cost of debts and losses affected from the COVID-19 pandemic, closing seven of them in 2021. In February 2022, the store&#x27;s website was shuttered and the remaining stores were closed throughout the year, and currently, only the Łódź store remains in operation.

====United Kingdom====

The first European Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores were located in the United Kingdom, with the first store opening in 1985. At its peak, the chain had over 105 stores in the country. They were operated by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Limited.

On December 4, 2017, the company reported that it would be liquidating and closing at least 26 stores in the United Kingdom as part of an insolvency restructuring known as a company voluntary arrangement. After amassing £15 million in unpaid taxes, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Limited entered administration on February 28, 2018, after failing to find a buyer. On March 2, 2018, it was announced that all UK stores would begin a liquidation sale, and on March 14, 2018, it was announced that all UK stores were expected to close within six weeks. On April 24, 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stopped trading in the United Kingdom after 33 years of service. All stores were closed by April 24, 2018.

On 28 October 2021, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us announced plans to reopen its UK arm, initially through online purchasing from its Australian arm, then with physical branches opening from 2022 onwards. The online store reopened the following year, and this was followed up with a deal with WH Smith to open up Toys &quot;R&quot; Us branded concessions inside nine WH Smith stores. Following the success of the pilot stores, WHP Global extended it&#x27;s contract in April 2024, with the retailer opening up 30 more concessions in the Summer.

====DACH countries====

Stores in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were operated by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us AG.

In April 2018, it was announced that Smyths would acquire Toys &quot;R&quot; Us AG, although they were still pending by July. The deal was completed in January 2019, and all stores were rebranded as Smyths shortly afterward.

====France====
In July 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us France went into receivership in order to look for a buyer. The franchise including 44 of the stores was purchased by French company Jellej Jouets in October 2018. In April 2019, they sold the stores over to Luderix International, the owners of rival chain PicWic. The merger was soon completed, and by July 2019 all Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and PicWic stores were rebranded as PicWicToys.

Due to profit losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the chain closed several of their stores in 2020, and soon went into receivership in May 2022. In July 2022, Smyths, who already owned the ex-Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores in German-speaking areas, purchased PicWicToys.

====Iberia====
In August 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Iberia, consisting of stores in Spain and Portugal, was sold to Green Swan. In April 2022, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Iberia filed for bankruptcy. In July 2022, Italian business Prenatal Retail Group purchased Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Iberia under a long-term agreement with the brand owners WHP Global, and continue operating the stores and website under the brand.

====Scandinavia====
In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores were independently operated by Top-Toy under license. Because of this, these respective stores were not affected by the bankruptcy of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27; parent company. However, Top Toy would file for bankruptcy itself on December 30, 2018, due to poor holiday sales, with all Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores closing by January 10, 2019.

==== Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, 17 stores were operated under the brand by third-party licensee Speelhoorn. In March 2009, the contract between the two companies was not renewed, with Speelhoorn re-branding all the stores as Toys XL, which would be later purchased by rival business Intertoys in 2017. They originally attempted to sell the stores in 1997 to Blokker but were denied permission due to competition costs.

==Stores==
Until their liquidation and closing in 2018, the company owned 739 stores in the United States, in addition to more than 750 international stores and more than 245 licensed stores in 37 countries and jurisdictions.

==Other brands==
===Imaginarium===
Imaginarium was a private label brand of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us for most of their toys that was acquired in 1999. Originally after the acquisition by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in 1999, it also operated stores until 2004.

===Kids &quot;R&quot; Us===

Kids &quot;R&quot; Us was a children&#x27;s discount clothing retailer. Their first stores opened in February 1983 in Paramus, New Jersey, and Brooklyn, New York. The chain folded in January 2004 after the retailer suffered deteriorating same-store sales and to focus more on the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us brand. While the standalone stores closed in 2003, the stores combined with Toys &quot;R&quot; Us would stay until at least 2007 when they all closed.

===Babies &quot;R&quot; Us===
The first Babies &quot;R&quot; Us store opened in April 1996 in Westbury, New York. In February 1997, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us acquired Duncan-based Baby Superstore, Inc., a 78-store chain, for $376 million. The locations were converted into Babies &quot;R&quot; Us. The store operates as a specialty baby products retailer and grew to about 260 stores in the United States. The stores offer an assortment of products for newborns, infants, and toddlers. The company also maintains a registry and offers pre- and post-natal classes and events.

In 2011, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us began to open co-branded locations with Babies &quot;R&quot; Us departments at 21 new locations and 23 remodeled locations.

Babies &quot;R&quot; Us reopened in July 2023 with a new flagship location inside the American Dream mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

On May 10, 2024, it was announced that Babies &quot;R&quot; Us would be opening 200 store-within-a-store locations inside of &quot;Kohl’s&quot;. These locations opened in the fall of 2024.

===FAO Schwarz===
In May 2006, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Inc., acquired toy retailer FAO Schwarz including the retailer&#x27;s flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, as well as its e-commerce site, FAO.com. The company closed the FAO Schwarz flagship store in New York on July 15, 2015, citing rising rental costs, but continued to carry FAO Schwarz-branded toys in its Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Babies &quot;R&quot; Us stores until 2017.

===Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Express===
For the 2009 holiday-shopping season, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us tried a smaller-store concept to attract customers and 90 &quot;Holiday Express&quot; stores across the United States and Canada were opened. The Holiday Express stores are smaller than regular Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores, often in malls, and offer a more limited selection of merchandise than would be available at a stand-alone Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store. Most (if not all) of these 90 stores were opened in shopping-center and mall spaces that had been vacated by store chains closing their doors during the recession (including KB Toys, several of which were taken over by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us). Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27;s plan was to keep the Holiday Express stores open until early January 2010 and close them shortly thereafter, but the success of so many prompted the company to reconsider and several were kept open. These stores are known as &quot;Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Express&quot;. Beginning in May 2010, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us opened a total of 600 Express stores. Four more were converted to Toys &quot;R&quot; Us outlet stores. As with the larger basic Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores, these locations also closed along with the outlet stores in the United States during summer 2018.

===Web operations===

Toys &quot;R&quot; Us began selling toys online with the launch of Toysrus.com in 1998. Following a disastrous Christmas 1999 trading period during which the company failed to deliver gifts on time, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us entered into a ten-year contract with online retailer Amazon in 2000 to be the exclusive supplier of toys on the website. Amazon eventually reneged on the terms of the contract by allowing third-party retailers to use its marketplace to sell toys, citing Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27;s failure to carry a sufficiently large range of goods, including the most popular lines. In 2006, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us successfully sued Amazon; the company was awarded $51 million in damages in 2009, just over half of the $93 million initially claimed.

It placed at No. 29 in the &quot;Internet Retailer Top 500 Guide&quot; for 2012. Toysrus.com was one of the most visited sites in the specialty toy and baby products retail category with an assortment of toys. In addition, Babiesrus.com offered a wide selection of baby products and supplies and access to the company&#x27;s baby registry.

Looking to expand its web portfolio, in February 2009, the company acquired online toy seller eToys.com from Parent Co., which filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2008. Financial terms were not disclosed. Around the same time, it was reported that Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Inc. bought Toys.com for an estimated $5.1 million. Today, the company operates Toys.com to list unadvertised and exclusive deals available on its portfolio of e-commerce sites.

In 2010, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Inc. reported that its Internet sales grew 29.9% year-over-year to $782 million from $602 million, and in April 2011, the company announced plans to open a dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center in McCarran, Nevada. The company later reported online sales of $1 billion for 2011 and $1.1 billion for 2012.

Under Tru Kids, the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us website was revived in 2019 in partnership with Target, with online orders being redirected to Target.com for fulfillment. In 2020, the site switched to Amazon as its fulfillment partner. This lasted until 2021, when fulfillment was handed over to Macys.com as part of their deal with Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

==Mascot==

Formerly known as &quot;Dr. G. Raffe&quot; in 1950s print advertisements for Children&#x27;s Bargaintown, Geoffrey the Giraffe evolved in name and appearance over the next decade to become the official mascot of the renamed Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. He also made his first TV commercial appearance on television in 1973. Serving as a &quot;spokesanimal&quot; for the brand, Geoffrey&#x27;s design went through several phases for more than 50 years before the star-spotted iteration was finalized in November 2007.

In 2017, the company sponsored the live camera broadcast for April the Giraffe, which helped support giraffe conservation and awareness. The sponsored camera of pregnant April the giraffe went viral with millions of views on YouTube and across social media platforms.

<text>John Basset Stevens IV (born July 28, 1987) is an American classic pop singer and was the sixth-place finalist on the third season of the television series &quot;American Idol&quot;.

==Biography==
Stevens was born in Buffalo, New York and his permanent residence is in nearby East Amherst. He attended Williamsville East High School and sang in a select jazz group. He auditioned for &quot;American Idol&quot; in New York City, singing
&quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; as an impression of Dean Martin. When the judges asked him to sing in his normal voice, he performed &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; and was sent through to the next round.

Stevens was a member of the fourth group of semifinalists. He finished first in the voting among his group of eight semifinalists, earning 28% of the vote. At 16, he was the youngest contestant ever to make the finals on &quot;American Idol&quot;.

Stevens&#x27; favorite singer is Frank Sinatra, to whom his vocal style has been compared. He has also earned the nickname &quot;Teen Martin&quot; because of his Dean Martin impersonation and ability to croon at such a young age. Stevens&#x27; style was not typical &quot;Idol&quot; fare, causing him to struggle with unfamiliar genres during the competition.

For &quot;Country Week,&quot; Stevens sang &quot;King of the Road.&quot; During &quot;Elton John Week,&quot; he performed &quot;Crocodile Rock.&quot;

The last week in April 2004 was &quot;Latin Week,&quot; a tribute to the music of Gloria Estefan. Stevens performed &quot;Music of My Heart,&quot; and Simon Cowell credited Stevens with &quot;taking every bullet thrown at you like a man.&quot; The next day, Stevens was voted off the show, coming in sixth place despite receiving over four million votes.

Stevens was signed to Maverick Records and released his debut album &quot;Red&quot; on June 28, 2005. It was produced by Steve Tyrell and executive produced by David Foster. It features covers of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; and Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;This Love,&quot; both arranged and performed in a relaxed jazz/lounge style. Its first week sales put it into the top 10 of the Billboard jazz charts. It sold 18,000 copies as of March 2006. He and Maverick Records have since parted ways.

Stevens graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts in May 2009 and released a Christmas album, &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; on November 1, 2009.

Stevens currently sings with the Boston-based Beantown Swing Orchestra, focusing on the classic big band arrangements that were originally performed by Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.

Stevens sang &quot;My Way&quot; at the funeral of former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino on November 3, 2014.

<text>Jasmine Trias (; born November 3, 1986) is an American singer-entertainer who was the third place finalist on the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. She has released one album to date, &quot;Jasmine Trias&quot;.

==Biography==
Trias was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and raised in Mililani Town, Hawaii. She is the eldest daughter of Filipino immigrants to Hawaii from Tanza, Cavite. Trias attended Maryknoll School, a Roman Catholic preparatory school of the Diocese of Honolulu. As a representative of Maryknoll School, she won the &quot;Brown Bags to Stardom 2001&quot; state singing competition and the &quot;Road to Fame 2003&quot; youth talent competition. Trias graduated from Maryknoll School in June 2004.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==
Trias gained recognition on the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. She auditioned in her home state of Hawaii. Trias made it to the top twelve performers. She received praises on her rendition of &quot;Inseparable&quot; on Top 12 night, with Simon Cowell replying, &quot;Jasmine, it was just superb&quot;. Paula Abdul even threw a rose to her on the stage and, together with Randy Jackson, praised her maturity in that performance.

She was able to survive eliminations, despite criticisms on her performances on some instances of the competition. She landed on the bottom 3 with Camile Velasco and Diana DeGarmo. On Top 4 performance night, when she received criticisms for her performance of &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; by The Weather Girls, Cowell suggested that night that she would be eliminated the next day, but she made it into the top 3. On the Top 3 results show, when Ryan Seacrest announced that Trias was eliminated, she had her last message on &quot;American Idol&quot;: &quot;I wanna thank all my fans for believing in me and for embracing my talents and for making my dreams come true. I mean, this top 3, I cannot ask for more&quot;. Trias was the highest-placed Asian-American contestant on &quot;American Idol&quot; until Jessica Sanchez made it in the eleventh season finale.

===Performances/results===

==Post Idol career==
After Trias&#x27; appearance on &quot;American Idol&quot;, her fanbase grew in the United States and in foreign countries where the show was aired: Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan, among others. The Manila Times newspaper captured the mood of her ancestral country in an April headline: &quot;Everybody Wants Jasmine.&quot; During the &quot;American Idol&quot; season, hundreds of internet fan sites from over a dozen countries were established in several Asian and European languages. She also appeared in the fourth season finale and the fifteen season finale of &quot;American Idol.&quot;

==Trias in the Philippines==
In the Philippines, Trias has done television commercials and billboard ads for McDonald&#x27;s, Smart Telecommunications, Hapee Toothpaste, and Bench Clothing. On October 6, 2004, Trias released a promotional single for McDonald&#x27;s, &quot;Love Ko &#x27;To&quot;, (the local translation of McDonald&#x27;s &quot;i&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it&quot; slogan). McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in the Philippines offered a promotional meal called the &quot;Jasmine Trio&quot;, which consisted of a Strawberry Float, fries, and the McDonald&#x27;s exclusive &quot;Love Ko &#x27;To&quot; CD-Single.

Trias also appeared on the reality show &quot;Extra Challenge&quot; with Ruffa Gutierrez and Donita Rose. She also visited the housemates of &quot;Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition&quot; on March 6 and stayed in the house overnight, leaving on March 7.

In 2006, Trias&#x27; life story was dramatized in the anthology series &quot;Magpakailanman,&quot; where she was played by Jolina Magdangal. In 2006 and 2007, Trias starred in two episodes of the music anthology series &quot;Your Song&quot; which featured two of her songs as the title songs.

==Career==
Managing Director of Honolulu Ben Lee summarized the mood in Trias&#x27; home state of Hawaii by saying, &quot;Jasmine has enough votes in Hawaii to become governor or mayor easily.&quot; Lieutenant Governor Duke Aiona, in his capacity as acting governor, declared &quot;Jasmine Trias Day&quot; by executive order. Trias has also done various commercials in Hawaii discouraging smoking, drinking, and drug use. On February 27, 2005, Trias released a CD single entitled &quot;Flying Home,&quot; which was sold exclusively in Pizza Hut and Taco Bell stores in Hawaii. The single was intended to capture her feelings of returning to Hawaii after months of working on tour and on her album.

Trias was a part of the JCPenney and &quot;Seventeen&quot; &quot;Rock Your Prom&quot; Fashion Show. She performed in Springfield, Missouri and Glendale, California in March 2005.

Musically, some have compared Trias to Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton. Trias signed a record deal with Clockwork Entertainment, a company which has worked with Dream and Bad Boy Records (headed by P. Diddy), to record and produce her debut album. She also signed a record deal with Universal Records for the album&#x27;s release in the Philippines. Her self-titled debut album with Clockwork Entertainment was released on July 12, 2005, in the U.S. It has since sold 14,000 copies in the US alone according to Nielsen SoundScan and a reported 50,000 worldwide. She has since been certified platinum in the Philippines. Trias headlined tours in Manila, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Guam in 2004. To end her whirlwind visit to the Philippines, dubbed &quot;Jasmania,&quot; she met President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Trias left Clockwork Entertainment due to poor management and promotion; and is now with Universal Records Philippines. &quot;Excuses,&quot; &quot;Sana Lagi,&quot; &quot;Too Many Walls&quot; and &quot;DJ Don&#x27;t Quit&quot; peaked in the Top 10 on a popular Live365 Internet station called Idol Waves. &quot;I&#x27;d Rather&quot; managed to reach number one.

Trias was featured in the music video to The Black Eyed Peas single &quot;Bebot,&quot; playing apl.de.ap&#x27;s sister. She was featured as a commentator on MTV/TRL for the sixth season of &quot;American Idol.&quot; She also filmed a movie in the Philippines titled &quot;Suddenly It&#x27;s Magic&quot;; it is shelved indefinitely. In addition, she was featured as a guest judge for a children&#x27;s competition on &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; and made appearances on three &quot;American Idol&quot; national follow-up shows: &quot;American Idol Extra&quot;, &quot;American Idol Tonight&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Your Call&quot; with Lynn Doyle.

Trias has stated in many different interviews that she will start working on new albums for the U.S. and the Philippines for release this year [i.e. 2008]. Trias is the host of a television program called &quot;Pacific Groove&quot; in Hawaii. Trias performed with Society of Seven at the Riviera Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, debuting on August 16, 2012.

<doc id="509322" wikidata="Q3399591" url="?curid=509322" title="Baron Penrhyn">
<text>Baron Penrhyn is a title that has been created twice. The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1783 in favour of Richard Pennant, who had previously served as a Member of Parliament for Petersfield and Liverpool. This creation became extinct on his death in 1808. The next creation came in 1866 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom when the Conservative politician Edward Douglas-Pennant was created Baron Penrhyn, of Llandegai in the County of Carnarvon. He had previously represented Carnarvon in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire. He was granted the estate of his father-in-law (a cousin and heir of the first Baron of the 1783 creation) on the condition that he accepted his wife&#x27;s maiden name, Pennant. Lord Penrhyn was the younger brother of The 17th Earl of Morton. In 1833 he had married Juliana Isabella Mary Pennant (died 1842), eldest daughter and co-heiress of George Hay Dawkins-Pennant of Penrhyn Castle and in 1841 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Pennant.

Lord Penrhyn was succeeded by his eldest son George Sholto, the second Baron. He also represented Carnarvon in Parliament as a Conservative. On his death the title passed to his son Edward Sholto, the third Baron. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Northampton South. He was succeeded by his son Hugh Napier, the fourth Baron. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire from 1933 to 1941. On his death in 1949 the line of the eldest son of the first Baron failed. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the fifth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Archibald Charles Henry Douglas-Pennant, second son of the first Baron. Lord Penrhyn was 101 years and 74 days when he died on 3 February 1967 and was then the oldest ever peer. This record was not surpassed until the death of the seventh Viscount St Vincent in September 2006. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s nephew, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2003.

Muriel FitzRoy, 1st Viscountess Daventry, wife of the Hon. Edward FitzRoy, Speaker of the House of Commons, was the sister of the fifth Baron Penrhyn. The Douglas family of the second creation are the same of the same lineage as the Marquesses of Queensberry (note the appearance of the middle name &quot;Sholto&quot; in both families) and are also related to the later Earls of Home.

<doc id="509323" wikidata="Q387619" url="?curid=509323" title="Francisco de Montejo">
<text>Francisco de Montejo (; 1479 – 1553) was a Spanish conquistador in Mexico and Central America.

==Early years==
Francisco de Montejo was born about 1473 to a family of lesser Spanish nobility in Salamanca, Spain. He never documented his parentage during his lifetime but his father was probably Juan de Montejo. His mother is unknown but her surname may have been Téllez. He had a brother, Juan, who served with him in the New World and a sister, Maria, whose son Francisco de Montejo would become an important conquistador in Yucatán.

In 1513, Montejo joined an expedition being organized in Seville under the leadership of Pedrarias Davila who had received a royal appointment to govern Castilla de Oro, a new Spanish colony in Central America. Montejo was sent on ahead to Santo Domingo to recruit additional men for the colony. Later, Pedrarius sent him on an unsuccessful expedition to the region that would later become Nueva Granada.

Montejo became disillusioned with opportunities under Pedrarius and left for Cuba where he participated under Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar in the conquest of Cuba. The conquest was almost complete when Montejo arrived but he gained the favor of Velázquez and was rewarded with encomiendas and extensive grants of land.

In 1518, when Francisco Hernández de Córdoba reported his discovery of new lands in the west, Montejo joined Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s expedition to explore the coast of Yucatán. He invested his own money to help outfit the small fleet and was designated captain of one of the four ships. When they reached the Mexican coastline, Montejo became the first Spaniard to step ashore in the Aztec Empire and establish friendly relations with the Indians he encountered. 

On his return to Cuba, Montejo joined the Hernán Cortés expedition in an attempt to seize control of the newly-discovered lands. He became one of Cortés&#x27;s most important lieutenants, serving as captain of one ship and its company of soldiers. He fought in the bloody campaign in Tabasco and was then sent north with two small ships to find a suitable site for a permanent town. The site he identified became Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz and Montejo was appointed one of its first &quot;alcaldes&quot; (chief town administrators). Throughout this early phase of the conquest, Cortés showed high regard for Montejo.

In July 1519, Montejo was sent to the Spanish Court to provide news of the conquest and defend Cortés&#x27;s authority against claims by Velázquez. He also presented the emperor with a rich treasure of gold, silver and jewels that had already been seized in New Spain Montejo successfully represented Cortés in Castile until 1522 when he returned to the new City of Mexico, established on the ruins of the old Aztec capital. Cortés rewarded him handsomely with the assignment of encomiendas, notably the rich and populous town of Azcapotzalco.

By this time, Montejo was a wealthy and prestigious conquistador. In addition to his holdings in New Spain, he held encomiendas in Cuba and properties in Salamanca, Spain. For a couple years Montejo appeared ready to settle in New Spain. He built a luxurious home in Mexico City and developed his haciendas and mines. However, in 1524 he was again sent to Spain to defend Cortés against charges that he had become too powerful and independent of the Crown&#x27;s best interests. Montejo was successful in his advocacy and also won special favor at Court for tact and obvious talents. In 1525 in Seville Montejo married Beatriz de Herrera, the wealthy widow of conquistador Alonso Esquivel. In 1526 he was awarded his own coat of arms.

==Yucatán==
After settling affairs for Cortés, Montejo began to search for his next opportunity. The conquest by Cortés had set the standard for success and other ambitious conquistadors wanted to emulate him. Montejo thought that Yucatán provided such an opportunity. The coastline was dotted with towns and the interior was rumored to contain wealthy civilizations and spectacular cities.

In 1526 Montejo traveled to Grenada to petition the Spanish king, Charles V, for permission to conquer and colonize Yucatán. His request was supported by Pánfilo de Narváez, another veteran conquistador. Montejo argued persuasively that Yucatán would serve as a center of trade for the region and enrich the Crown. His formal petition was submitted on November 19, 1526 and quickly approved by Charles and the Council of the Indies on December 8.

Montejo was appointed &quot;Adelantado&quot; of Yucatán, governor and captain general of the new province, and authorized to conquer, settle, and govern at his own expense. His titles and offices were to be held for life. The Crown would not bear any expenses except to pay him a salary of 250,000 &quot;maravedis&quot; for the offices of governor and captain general. However, other valuable rights, privileges, and exemptions were granted. His contract also stipulated that the principal objective of the Crown was to bring the indigenous peoples of the New World into the Catholic Church. The appropriate treatment of the Indians was carefully spelled out and Montejo was warned to adhere to the spirit and letter of these instructions.

Montejo returned to Seville to organize his expedition. His contract stipulated that the conquest must begin within one year (by December 8, 1527) so he had to move quickly. He raised 28,000 &quot;castellanos&quot;, a significant amount of money at the time, acquired and outfitted four ships and recruited 250 men in addition the crews for the ships. Alonso Dávila was named his principal lieutenant. Careful to heed royal instructions, three clergymen were included to address the religious needs of the conquerors and the conquered. Montejo and his fleet set sail from Seville towards the end of June, 1526.

The crossing was uneventful and the fleet stopped first at Hispaniola where supplies were purchased, additional men were recruited and enough horses were procured to bring their small cavalry up to fifty strong. They soon set off again and reached Cozumel in late September. From there Montejo crossed the channel to the mainland and established their first town, Salamanca, named after Montejo&#x27;s hometown. The site was poorly chosen; the climate was hot and humid and freshwater was scarce. At first the local natives were willing to provide food but Spanish demands quickly turned their attitude from cooperation to resentment and outright hostility. Oviedo later reported that &quot;all [the Spaniards] fell ill and many died.&quot;

He returned to Yucatán in 1528, and attempted to conquer it from its east coast at Tulum and Chetumal, but was driven back by fierce resistance from the Maya living along this coast. In 1530, he decided to try conquering Yucatán from the west, and began by pacifying what is today the modern Mexican state of Tabasco. He continued this attempted conquest of western Yucatán from 1531 until 1535, when his forces were driven from Yucatán despite some prior successes.

==Governor of Honduras, Return to Yucatán, and death==
In 1533, Montejo received a royal decree giving him permission to conquer Puerto Caballos and Naco in Honduras. This put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, who had received a similar decree in 1532 and later declared in 1536 that he had conquered and pacified the province of Honduras. Alvarado continued to serve as the Governor of Honduras until 1540, although he was recalled to Spain in 1537. In 1540, the Spanish King awarded the Governorship of Honduras to Montejo, and he traveled to Gracias a Dios to install an administration loyal to him.

It would fall to Montejo&#x27;s eponymous son, nicknamed &quot;El Mozo&quot; (born 1508, died 1565), to conquer Yucatán. He founded the city of San Francisco de Campeche in 1540, and Mérida in 1542. In 1546, the elder Montejo assumed the title of Governor and Captain General of Yucatán. However, by 1550, complaints about Montejo caused him to be recalled to Spain, where he died in 1553.

Montejo was survived by his son, &quot;El Mozo,&quot; and a daughter, Catalina Montejo y Herrera.

<text>Baron Parmoor, of Frieth in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 16 January 1914 for the lawyer and politician Sir Charles Cripps. He and his second wife, Marian Ellis, were anti-war activists. Two of his sons, the second and third Barons, both succeeded to the title. The third Baron was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. As of 2010, the title is held by the latter&#x27;s first cousin, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 2008. He is the grandson of Major the Hon. Leonard Harrison Cripps, the third son of the first Baron.

The Labour politician, The Rt Hon. Sir Stafford Cripps, was the youngest son of the first Baron. Violet, the wife of the third Baron and mother of the fourth Baron, was previously the second wife of the 2nd Duke of Westminster.

The first Baron’s daughter, Ruth Julia Cripps, married Sir Alfred Egerton in 1912, becoming the Hon. Lady Egerton. They had no children but adopted a nephew. She set up and was the chairman of the Women&#x27;s Advisory Council on Solid Fuels in 1943.

Parmoor House, in Parmoor hamlet near Frieth, Buckinghamshire, was the home of the first Baron Parmoor.

==Barons Parmoor (1914)==
*Charles Alfred Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor (1852–1941)
*(Alfred Henry) Seddon Cripps, 2nd Baron Parmoor (1882–1977)

<text>Baron Phillimore, of Shiplake in the County of Oxford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1918 for the former Judge of the High Court of Justice and Lord Justice of Appeal, Sir Walter Phillimore, 2nd Baronet. The Phillimore Baronetcy, of The Coppice, had been created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 December 1881 for his father Sir Robert Phillimore, who was also a noted lawyer and judge. The first Baron was succeeded by his son, the second Baron.

On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the third Baron, his eldest son Captain the Hon. Anthony Francis Phillimore (d. 1940) having been killed in action during the Second World War. The third Baron was childless and was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Baron. He was an architect.

 the titles are held by his son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 1994. The fifth baron is a barrister who lives at Coppid Hall, Shiplake, Oxfordshire.

<doc id="509331" wikidata="Q845088" url="?curid=509331" title="Pappus's centroid theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Pappus&#x27;s centroid theorem (also known as the Guldinus theorem, Pappus–Guldinus theorem or Pappus&#x27;s theorem) is either of two related theorems dealing with the surface areas and volumes of surfaces and solids of revolution.

The theorems are attributed to Pappus of Alexandria and Paul Guldin. Pappus&#x27;s statement of this theorem appears in print for the first time in 1659, but it was known before, by Kepler in 1615 and by Guldin in 1640.

==The first theorem==
The first theorem states that the surface area &quot;A&quot; of a surface of revolution generated by rotating a plane curve &quot;C&quot; about an axis external to &quot;C&quot; and on the same plane is equal to the product of the arc length &quot;s&quot; of &quot;C&quot; and the distance &quot;d&quot; traveled by the geometric centroid of &quot;C&quot;:
formula_1

For example, the surface area of the torus with minor radius &quot;r&quot; and major radius &quot;R&quot; is
formula_2

===Proof===

A curve given by the positive function formula_3 is bounded by two points given by:

formula_4 and formula_5

If formula_6 is an infinitesimal line element tangent to the curve, the length of the curve is given by:

formula_7

The formula_8 component of the centroid of this curve is:

formula_9

The area of the surface generated by rotating the curve around the x-axis is given by:

formula_10

Using the last two equations to eliminate the integral we have:

formula_11

==The second theorem==
The second theorem states that the volume &quot;V&quot; of a solid of revolution generated by rotating a plane figure &quot;F&quot; about an external axis is equal to the product of the area &quot;A&quot; of &quot;F&quot; and the distance &quot;d&quot; traveled by the geometric centroid of &quot;F&quot;. (The centroid of &quot;F&quot; is usually different from the centroid of its boundary curve &quot;C&quot;.) That is:
formula_12

For example, the volume of the torus with minor radius &quot;r&quot; and major radius &quot;R&quot; is
formula_13

This special case was derived by Johannes Kepler using infinitesimals.

===Proof 1===

The area bounded by the two functions:

formula_14

formula_15

and bounded by the two lines:

formula_16 and formula_17

is given by:

formula_18

The formula_19 component of the centroid of this area is given by:

formula_20

If this area is rotated about the y-axis, the volume generated can be calculated using the shell method. It is given by:

formula_21

Using the last two equations to eliminate the integral we have:

formula_22

===Proof 2===
Let formula_23 be the area of formula_24, formula_25 the solid of revolution of formula_24, and formula_27 the volume of formula_25. Suppose formula_24 starts in the formula_30-plane and rotates around the formula_31-axis. The distance of the centroid of formula_24 from the formula_31-axis is its formula_34-coordinate
formula_35
and the theorem states that
formula_36

To show this, let formula_24 be in the &quot;xz&quot;-plane, parametrized by formula_38 for formula_39, a parameter region. Since formula_40 is essentially a mapping from formula_41 to formula_41, the area of formula_24 is given by the change of variables formula:
formula_44
where formula_45 is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the change of variables. 

The solid formula_25 has the toroidal parametrization formula_47 for formula_48 in the parameter region formula_49; and its volume is
formula_50

Expanding,
formula_51

The last equality holds because the axis of rotation must be external to formula_24, meaning formula_53. Now,
formula_54
by change of variables.

==Generalizations==

The theorems can be generalized for arbitrary curves and shapes, under appropriate conditions. 

Goodman &amp; Goodman generalize the second theorem as follows. If the figure moves through space so that it remains perpendicular to the curve traced by the centroid of , then it sweeps out a solid of volume , where is the area of and is the length of . (This assumes the solid does not intersect itself.) In particular, may rotate about its centroid during the motion. 

However, the corresponding generalization of the first theorem is only true if the curve traced by the centroid lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of .

== In &quot;n&quot;-dimensions ==
In general, one can generate an formula_55 dimensional solid by rotating an formula_56 dimensional solid formula_24 around a formula_58 dimensional sphere. This is called an formula_55-solid of revolution of species formula_58. Let the formula_58-th centroid of formula_24 be defined by 

formula_63

Then Pappus&#x27; theorems generalize to:

Volume of formula_55-solid of revolution of species formula_58 
&lt;br&gt; = (Volume of generating formula_66-solid) formula_67 (Surface area of formula_58-sphere traced by the formula_58-th centroid of the generating solid) 

and

Surface area of formula_55-solid of revolution of species formula_58
&lt;br&gt; = (Surface area of generating formula_66-solid) formula_67 (Surface area of formula_58-sphere traced by the formula_58-th centroid of the generating solid) 

The original theorems are the case with formula_76.

<text>is a Japanese method of dyeing fabrics using a resist paste applied through a stencil, typically a rice flour mixture applied with a brush or a tool such as a palette knife. Unlike , stencils are used repeatedly to make a repeating pattern. Pigment is added by hand-painting, immersion dyeing, or both. The area of the fabric covered and permeated by the paste mixture resists the later application of dye, thus creating undyed areas within the fabric.

 was first invented as an inexpensive and faster alternative to highly-patterned woven brocade fabrics. Over time, evolved into a respected fibre art form of its own.

Thin fabrics dyed in the style show the fabric&#x27;s design on the back of the fabric, whereas thicker or more tightly-woven fabrics generally have a solid colour underside, typically indigo blue for cotton fabrics. Futon covers made from multiple panels of fabric, if the stencils are properly placed and the panels joined correctly, can display a seamless stencilled pattern. Besides cotton, has been used to decorate linen, silk and fabrics that are entirely or partially-synthetic.
